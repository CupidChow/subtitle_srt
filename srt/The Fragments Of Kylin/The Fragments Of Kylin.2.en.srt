[One day ago]

5
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,710
Shi Si, have you made up your mind

6
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,430
to marry Mo Yan in my place?

7
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,500
I have.

8
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,880
If doing this can make you and Sikong be together,

9
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,479
I'm willing to do it.

10
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,380
Do you know

11
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,440
what marriage means?

12
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,480
Being a wife

13
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,760
means living with someone every day,

14
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,550
even spending the rest of your life together.

15
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,700
If you don't love this person,

16
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,210
your life

17
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,250
could be very painful.

18
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,220
It's okay.

19
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,120
Back then,

20
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,329
you saved me and brought me back to the Xuanyuan family.

21
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,680
I lost my memory.

22
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,190
As someone without a past,

23
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,120
I have no right to love,

24
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,730
and I don't expect anyone to love me.

25
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,820

26
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,210
you find someone you love,

27
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,740
and this marriage becomes a restriction to you,

28
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,540
you can leave,

29
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,840

Do you feel like this place

32
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,510
smells very good?

33
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,910
This must be Mr. Mo, right?

34
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,130
Seeing is believing.

35
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,930
You really are a handsome and talented man.

36
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,180
Sorry for bothering you.

37
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,410
I was really scared yesterday.

38
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,100
Two groups of people started fighting here

39
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,110
for no reason.

40
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,370
I'm just a small business owner

41
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,590
trying to live a peaceful life.

42
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,230
I didn't expect my tavern to be smashed,

43
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,010
and two of my staff were killed.

44
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,370
Be careful!

45
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,990
Yes.

47
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,750
I want to...

48
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,540
Just call me Bailing.

49
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,420
Misters, don't just stand there.

50
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,510
Please, have a seat.

00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,089

00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,230
any suspicious people

54
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,430
in the tavern these past few days?

55
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,950
I really can't say.

56
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,560
There are people coming and going here every day.

57
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,310
Xuanwu Street is right outside.

58
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,480
We get all sorts of people, drinking, staying the night,

59
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,720
from all classes and walks of life.

60
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,730
I really don't know what you meant by suspicious.

61
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,680
Mr. Mo,

62
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,940
although I'm just a wine seller,

63
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,810
I am aware of the reputation of the Mo family.

64
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,900
Since you're here,

65
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:55,300
could it be that the demon clan came to attack?

66
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,740
Don't worry.

67
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,040
During times of peace,

68
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,630
the Mo family not only hunts demons

69
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,340
but also handles ordinary matters.

70
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,150
Thank you for your assistance today.

71
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,540

72
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,180

As the Madam of the house,

75
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,800
I will be the one to accept the tea from the new bride.

76
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,910
I heard that Yan

77
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,360
spent the last night in the study.

78
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,090
This was your fault as the wife.

79
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,550
The wedding night is a joyous occasion in one's life.

80
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,760
How could you sleep separately from your husband?

81
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,500
This is a sign of discord between husband and wife.

82
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,070
Xuanyuan Yu!

83
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,380
Second Madam,

84
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,780
have you heard anything else? Feel free to say them all.

85
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,490
Funny you should ask.

86
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,360
There is indeed an interesting story.

87
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,700
The daughter of the Xuanyuan family

88
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,020
is truly spontaneous.

89
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,160
The young master of the Sikong family

90
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,440
must be a remarkable young man.

91
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,910
Otherwise, why would you be so enamored with him?

92
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,090
You are entangled with another man.

93
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,000
With such improper conduct,

94
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,150
I'm afraid it will be difficult for you

95
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,140
to become the future Madam of the Mo family.

96
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,280
Second Madam,

97
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,090
I'm not very interested

98
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,230
in the position of the Madam.

99
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,470
But I found you've been longing for this vacant position for many years.

100
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,070
Why don't you go up and try it yourself?

101
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,390
You...

102
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,200
Second Madam,

103
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,780
I'm different from you.

104
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,180
I always speak my mind.

105
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,730
I will always call you Second Madam,

106
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,280
without missing a single word.

107
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,790
I heard that my husband's birth mother, Madam Ye,

108
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,590
has long since left the mansion.

109
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,350
So I won't embarrass myself

110
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,090
by serving you as my mother-in law.

111
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,490
Furthermore,

112
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,400
while I

113
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,050
may not know much,

114
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,510
I do understand

115
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,550
the simple principle

116
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,690
of not meddling in affairs

117
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,640
beyond one's station.

118
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,400
As the Master's concubine and second wife for many years,

119
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,360
you may not be well-versed in marital relationships.

120
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,330
Therefore, I won't trouble you for advice.

121
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,950
Don't worry.

122
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,190
There are many ways to deal with her.

123
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,450
Where is Dongling?

124
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,679
Call him over.

125
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:37,909
Yes.

126
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,940
My Lady, you're quite daring.

127
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,030
Your words just now were indeed impressive,

128
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,540
but you've just married into the Mo family and already offended the Madam.

129
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,570
Will our days ahead

130
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,020
be difficult?

131
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,360
People like her

132
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,930
don't need to be pleased,

133
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,710
and I don't know how to please her anyway.

134
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,980
But how did you know about the situation in the Mo family?

135
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,170
Before I got married,

136
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,470
Yu told me

137
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,140
that Second Madam is not Mo Yan's birth mother

138
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,330
but always exerts her authority as his mother.

139
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,420
I guess

140
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,140
Mo Yan is not having a good time either.

141
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,060
So you're not stupid, My Lady.

142
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,360
I just don't keep things in mind.

143
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,560
Yes, you will remember.

144
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,010
My Lady, animals really like you.

145
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,110
Of course.

146
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,180
Mo Dongling?

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,950
Are you eavesdropping on us?

148
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,510
Who do you think you are?

149
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,450
How dare you call me by my name?

150
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,860
So what's your nickname?

151
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,090
My nickname is Dongdong.

152
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,280
Dongdong.

153
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,500
Listen.

154
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,650
My brother will never like you.

155
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,090
Even though you're...

156
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,340
not bad-looking,

157
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,650
you're just a country bumpkin,

158
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,290
not suitable for the upper class.

159
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,110
How do you know for sure that I would like him?

160
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,030
You...

161
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,920
You don't like my brother,

162
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,150
but you like that Sikong Shaoyun?

163
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,870
I think you are really blind.

164
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,490
Brother!

165
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,540
You finally came, Brother.

166
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,370
Let me tell you, just now...

167
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:39,870
Shut up.

168
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,800
Brother!

169
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,420
Are you mad at me, Brother?

170
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,310
Honey...

171
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,390
Brother!

172
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,550
Oh no, My Lady.

173
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,750
Young Master must have heard the rumor.

174
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,840
And just now,

175
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,550
you offended him again.

176
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,240
She actually said she doesn't like me?

177
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,640
Does that really matter?

178
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,720
She actually said she doesn't like you?

179
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,860
Ridiculous, absolutely absurd!

180
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,170
I haven't pursued the matter between her and Sikong Shaoyun yet.

181
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,240
Now that she's still in the Mo family, how dare she?

182
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,340
Yan,

183
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,970
the rumor is indeed unpleasant.

184
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,940
In my opinion,

185
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,280
you shouldn't

186
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,820
have married her.

187
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,460
I've thought it over.

188
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,300
The situation with the demon clan is unclear at the moment.

189
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,230
We may need the Xuanyuan family's strength.

190
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,420
I made a pact with my father, within two years,

191
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,420
to retrieve Gan Jiang

192
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,710
and kill Shuo Tian.

193
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,710
By then,

194
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,980
she can do whatever she wants.

195
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,070
What do you think about

196
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,040
the innkeeper?

197
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,580
I didn't notice anything unusual about her.

198
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,390
She smells

199
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,530
very fragrant.

200
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,670
Unusually fragrant.

201
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,400
Now that you mentioned it,

202
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,530
there is something strange about it.

203
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,810
If the innkeeper is really possible to be from the demon clan,

204
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,990
then they

205
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,810
must have used some method to conceal the demon clan's aura.

206
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,430
They

207
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,950
might have come prepared.

208
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,510
I'll go back there immediately.

209
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,470
This time,

210
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,100
we must not let them go.

211
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,650
You'll only alarm them if you go now.

212
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,060
We need to plan carefully.

213
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,120
It's been three years.

214
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,500
If the demon clan really comes back,

215
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,050
relying solely on our strength

216
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,030
won't be enough.

217
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,340
But...

218
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:30,930
Brother.

219
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,980
What's up?

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,670
Brother,

221
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,450
I'm here to tell you something

222
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,950
about your newlywed wife.

223
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,000
What happened to her?

224
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,590
She and that Sikong Shaoyun...

225
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,720
I already know about it.

226
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,360
Anyway,

227
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,200
she's ignorant

228
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,480
and ungrateful.

229
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,600
Brother,

230
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,470
my mom has already disciplined her for you.

231
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,690
You don't need to worry.

232
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,570
It's just that this woman is very uncouth.

233
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,690
It took my mom a lot of effort.

234
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,280
How did she discipline her?

235
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,380
I don't know.

236
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,520
Brother, don't worry.

237
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,740
I will definitely keep a close eye on Xuanyuan Yu for you.

238
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,590
I absolutely won't allow her

239
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,230
to have any dealings with that Sikong,

240
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,630
lest she brings disgrace upon you.

241
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,440
There's no need to do that.

242
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,450
Brother,

243
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,270
you can't be soft on this kind of woman.

244
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,300
Don't let her beauty

245
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,080
cloud your judgment.

246
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,890
If you like this type of woman, I...

247
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,560
Dongling.

248
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,920
I have something to do.

249
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,300
Go out now.

250
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,430
I'm leaving then.

251
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,220
[Wedding]

252
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,330
Annoying follower.

253
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,030
Useless and raging fool.

254
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,890
What did you say?

255
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,080
You shameless rabble!

256
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,660
[Wedding]

257
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,350
What?

258
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,560
You want to fight?

259
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,070
I'll spare you

260
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,950
for the sake of my brother.

261
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:54,890
Is that so?

262
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,830
[Wedding]

263
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,990
[Wedding]

264
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,430
Just you wait!

265
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,670
Lan.

266
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,380
I’m fine.

267
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,470
I've been used to it since I was young.

268
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,610
There were even harsher words.

269
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,120
Lan,

270
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,820
you are a descendant of the human race and the dragon race,

271
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,370
but you are not of the demon clan.

272
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,250
You are my family.

273
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,780
You care for the people more than many humans.

274
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,540
Every banner on Xuanwu Street

275
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,720
owes something to you.

276
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,820
Originally, it was nothing.

277
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,980
Your comforting made me feel weak.

278
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,220
When we were young, every time you cried,

279
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,890
it was me who comforted you.

280
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,050
You don't have to worry too much about me.

281
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,370
I'm fine.

282
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,000
How do you know for sure that I would like him?

283
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,070
Lan,

284
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,410
have you met Sikong Shaoyun before?

285
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,710
I've met him once.

286
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,850
Between him and me, who do you think

287
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,160
is more...

288
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,540
Forget it.

289
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,320
What does it matter to me

290
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,900
who she's involved with?

291
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,060
With just your mediocre skills,

292
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,070
you dared to stand up for others in the tavern?

293
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,910
You overestimated yourself.

294
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,060
The tavern?

295
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,760
Are you the Grandmaster from yesterday in the tavern?

296
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,810
What are you doing?

297
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,730
It's you!

298
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,180
Did you just recognize me?

299
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,990
Why were you wearing a mask

300
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,750
in the tavern yesterday?

301
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,810
It was for...

302
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,510
for keeping a low profile.

303
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,589
So this is what you Grandmasters like to do.

304
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,950
What are you doing here?

305
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,660
Training.

306
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,340
What clan does this technique belong to?

307
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,500
This is the technique

308
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,860
you used at the tavern yesterday.

309
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,270
Can you teach me?

310
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,010
Why should I?

311
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,110
Because you are my husband.

312
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,880
Do you really consider me your husband?

313
00:17:59,230 --> 00:17:59,980
Of course.

314
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,100
We're married.

315
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,990
Aren't you my husband?

316
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,930
Watch carefully.

317
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,870
What's going on?

318
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,400
Why can't I move?

319
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,960
This move is called Cloud Arrest.

320
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,740
It can trap the enemy in a battle.

321
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,030
The duration of the trap

322
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,660
depends on your magical strength.

323
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,310
It's usually used for escape.

324
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,280
Do you know how to perform this spell?

325
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,670
I don't.

326
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,340
Come, learn from me.

327
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,430
Look,

328
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,360
they're over there!

329
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,470
Where do you think

330
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,610
Young Master will sleep tonight?

331
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,720
The bed in the study is hard.

332
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,400
Young Master isn't accustomed to it.

333
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,380
Do you want to bet?

334
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,180
Okay.

335
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,900
What are you doing?

336
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,420
I'm drawing all your moves from just now.

337
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,510
I'll be frank.

338
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,460
Your talent is lacking,

339
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,670
and your aptitude is mediocre,

340
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,950
without any foundation in magic.

341
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,820
It will be difficult for you to achieve anything in magic in this lifetime.

342
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,590
Mo Yan!

343
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,170
You're so poor in magic.

344
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,030
I even doubt

345
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,430
if you're truly from the Xuanyuan family.

346
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,160
Young Master.

347
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,160
Mo Yan!

348
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,590
Mo Yan!

349
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,600
Are you really so relentless?

350
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:27,830
[Wedding]

351
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,590
If you want to learn,

352
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,540
go out with me tomorrow.

353
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,600
[Wedding]

354
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,160
He said "go out"?

355
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,790
It must be related to demon-hunting.

356
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,060
Great!

357
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,950
Young Master.

358
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,590
Have some tea.

359
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,380
Young master,

360
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,800
are you going to sleep in here tonight?

361
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,810
Brother,

362
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,270
my mom has already disciplined her for you.

363
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,280
You don't need to worry.

364
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,440
Xiaohe, I'm going to pay my respects.

365
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,680
Is this outfit okay?

366
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,960
My Lady.

367
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,890
What took you so long?

368
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,840
I didn't know you were coming.

369
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,930
I need to go out today to search for clues.

370
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't have much time.

371
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,800
Let's go and pay respects to Second Madam now.

372
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,320
Why are you going too?

373
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,530
I can go if I want.

374
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,220
Yan, why did you come along today?

375
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,060
Yu is my wife.

376
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,870
I should come with her to pay respects to you.

377
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,060
Yan, I've watched you grow up.

378
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,700
Although you're unwilling to call me mother,

379
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,780
I still consider you my own child.

380
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,350
I'm just offering my opinion.

381
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,750
You're the eldest son of the Mo family.

382
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,980
Many people are watching you.

383
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,210
You two just got married and are already sleeping separately.

384
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,650
Not only may it raise rumors,

385
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,690
but you're also not fulfiling Master's wish to have grandchildren.

386
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,140
You should consider the family more.

387
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,550
Aunt,

388
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,450
I didn't expect you

389
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,150
to be so concerned about the private matters

390
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,030
of your own child.

391
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,630
I appreciate your kindness.

392
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,230
But compared to me,

393
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,780
Dongling is your real own child.

394
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,330
Why don't you arrange his marriage as soon as possible?

395
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,070
I believe

396
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,330
with your constant reminders and care,

397
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,060
my father will soon have grandchildren.

398
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,530
Yan, it's inappropriate to say that.

399
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,140
Aunt,

400
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,340
Yu and I have something to attend to.

401
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,920
We're leaving now.

402
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,620
Did you come specifically to help me out of this predicament?

403
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,580
In the two years

404
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,950
before we divorce,

405
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,340
I will protect you thoroughly.

406
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,270
Let's go.

407
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,590
Okay!

408
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,790
Let's go. Hurry up!

409
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,630
How can we eat with all this noise?

410
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,550
Sir, don't go!

411
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,950
Sir!

412
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,180
Sir!

413
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,780
Ling,

414
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,950
where are you?

415
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,560
Madam, well...

416
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,400
Yes.

417
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,280
I just want to find my child.

418
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,400
Miss Bailing.

419
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,680
Mr. Mo, you came at the right time.

420
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,070
Miss Bailing?

421
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,540
Who is this lady?

422
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,360
This is my wife.

423
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,530
You are the Young Lady of the Xuanyuan family, right?

424
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,420
You are indeed beautiful.

425
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,120
Mr. Mo,

426
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,480
you're so lucky.

427
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,400
What happened?

428
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,070
I really don't know what to do.

429
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,020
This lady insists

430
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,970
that her daughter was lost in my tavern.

431
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:20,760
Fine.

432
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,870
So, I let her search.

433
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,760
But she searched upstairs and downstairs,

434
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,680
and her daughter is really not here.

435
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,680
She's been crying here for a long time.

436
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,510
How can I run my business like this?

437
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,660
Mr. Mo,

438
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,810
you must have some ideas.

439
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,770
Please help me think of a solution.

440
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,540
Ma'am,

441
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,560
please calm down.

442
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,550
Has your daughter

443
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,970
been acting strangely recently?

444
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,000
Acting strangely?

445
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,580
Oh, yes.

446
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,200
These days, before Ling

447
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,310
goes to sleep,

448
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,480
she always said that she can hear beautiful singing

449
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,900
and insisted on going out to find the person who is singing.

450
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,700
She said the person is near the Bailing Tavern.

451
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:03,980
However,

452
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,990
neither her father nor I have heard any singing.

453
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,130
My Ling!

454
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,580
Could she have already gone home?

455
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,060
Impossible.

456
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
We've searched the house.

457
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:21,840
No.

458
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,000
I have to go upstairs and search again.

459
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,550
-Ling!
-Didn't you already search once?

460
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,870
Ling!

461
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,230
I have business to run.

462
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,990
Yan.

463
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:33,710
Slow down!

464
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,510
This is the fifth lost child.

465
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,910
Little Ling!

466
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,780
Little Ling!

467
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,450
Little Ling, where are you?

468
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,060
My wine!

469
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,620
Ling.

470
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,570
Little Ling!

471
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,200
Ma'am!

472
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,000
Really!

473
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,300
She's really not here!

474
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,320
Ling!

475
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,430
Ling!

476
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,910
Ma'am!

477
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,730
How many times have you searched up and down?

478
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,470
If you keep searching like this,

479
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,710
the tavern will be ruined by you.

480
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,610
I've just renovated it.

481
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,550
Let me go up and search!

482
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,230
Ma'am, Ma'am, please come down first.

483
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,190
Listen to me.

484
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,690
Being anxious like this won't help.

485
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,750
With so many of us,

486
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,150
we'll definitely be able to come up with a solution.

487
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,070
Yes, let's think of a solution together.

488
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,150
My daughter.

489
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,080
Here, have a seat.

490
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,650
My daughter.

491
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,130
This is Mo Yan from the Mo family.

492
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,660
You can talk to him.

493
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,220
Mr. Mo, please help me.

494
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,610
Calm down.

495
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,640
Tell me,

496
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,280
what does your child look like?

497
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,150
Does she have any distinctive features?

498
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,360
My daughter, Little Ling,

499
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,450
has two little braids,

500
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,450
big eyes,

501
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,100
and is wearing pink clothes.

502
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,670
Is she wearing a longevity lock?

503
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,490
Yes.

504
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,990
Miss, have you seen her?

505
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,610
I...

506
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,180
I've seen her.

507
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,180
Oh,

508
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,900
she gave me this.

509
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,000
Sister new bride, this is for you.

510
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,020
Is this paper crane hers?

511
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,190
Exactly.

512
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,610
My daughter

513
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,830
loves to fold these little things the most.

514
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,410
Little Ling!

515
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,690
Please don't cry.

516
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,480
We'll definitely help you find her.

517
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,330
Yan.

518
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,930
I just searched again

519
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,740
and there are indeed no children here.

520
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,020
Impossible!

521
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,310
My daughter was here

522
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,450
before she went missing.

523
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,670
Tell me,

524
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,340
did you hide her?

525
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,840
Ma'am, have mercy on me.

526
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,240
Haven't you searched already?

527
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,680
Ma'am.

528
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,730
Does this paper crane...

529
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,700
really belong to your child?

530
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,510
Yes.

531
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,150
May I borrow it?

532
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,380
Thank you.

533
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:09,570
Watch carefully.

534
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,910
This technique is called Moon Chasing,

535
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,540
which can be used to trace.

536
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,190
This is my magical tool

537
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,670
named Wanwusu,

538
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,360
which can awaken dead objects

539
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,050
and trace the whereabouts of their owners.

540
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,270
Why does it

541
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,730
feel so familiar?
