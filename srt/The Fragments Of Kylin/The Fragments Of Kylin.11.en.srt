[The Fragments Of Kylin]

3
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,870
[Episode 11]

4
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,070
I didn't expect

5
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,070
his past to be like this.

6
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,700
Now I understand Mo Lan.

7
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,360
Mo Yan.

8
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,660
You're the only person

9
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,090
Mo Lan trusts in the world.

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,300
He doesn't want you to get hurt

11
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,600
and he doesn't want you to leave him.

12
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,120
So,

13
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,550
when I was hurt by Lan Jia that day,

14
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,740
he even turned into a dragon to save me.

15
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,130
But he's just a half-dragon.

16
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,340
He can't turn into a dragon at will

17
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,350
like a real dragon.

18
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,910
Every time he turns into a dragon,

19
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,110
his lifespan will be reduced by 5 years.

20
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,770
Since we were children,

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,600
I've always prohibited him from using that talent.

22
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,860
However,

23
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,240
he still did that to save me.

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm not a good elder brother to him.

25
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,230
Because

26
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,640
you are so important to him,

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,440
he would like to sacrifice everything for you.

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,760
What you give him

29
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,880
is your company which is the most precious

30
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,829
and is what he needs the most.

31
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,900
All these years,

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,040
he has been holding a great grudge against the demon clan.

33
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,220
I just hope

34
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,770
he can get rid of some of his prejudices

35
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,530
so that he'll live more freely.

36
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,440
There're good humans and bad humans.

37
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,050
There're also good demons and bad demons.

38
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,320
He shouldn't assume all demons are bad.

39
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,790
I talked to him about this many times.

40
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,940
But...

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,810
Speaking of the attitude towards the demons,

42
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,450
why are you so lenient

43
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,600
with the demon clan?

44
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,940
I think

45
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,600
it's probably because of my mother's influence on me.

46
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,980
Is she Fairy Fangfei?

47
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,890
You heard of her too?

48
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,190
Of course.

49
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,710
She

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,470
is an upright woman who helps uphold justice.

51
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,829
There have been

52
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,590
many stories about her.

53
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,810
Yu told me all this.

54
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,660
She is the real Young Lady of the Xuanyuan family.

55
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,990
She

56
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,300
always said to me

57
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,440
that Fairy Fangfei

58
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,850
was a great role model for women.

59
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,940
She does what she wants to do

60
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,790
and walks the path she wants.

61
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,500
Inspired by your mother,

62
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,720
she ran away from home to pursue her dream.

63
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,459
What about you?

64
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,960
Why would you replace her to marry into the Mo family?

65
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:26,960
I...

66
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,070
Three years ago,

67
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,860
Yu

68
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,530
took me in and let me stay in the Xuanyuan family.

69
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,680
When I woke up,

70
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,020
I only remembered

71
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,450
that my name is

72
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,990
Shi Si.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,510
And

74
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,790
Yu treated me

75
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,690
as her sister.

76
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,600
Just like how you treat Mo Lan.

77
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,940
Yu

78
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,820
fell in love with Sikong Shaoyun.

79
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,470
She didn't want to leave the man she really loved

80
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,510
for an arranged marriage.

81
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,740
I

82
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,240
wasn't in love with anyone.

83
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,210
So,

84
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,800
I replaced her to marry you.

85
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,540
You

86
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,160
weren't in love with anyone?

87
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,680
I am now.

88
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,500
So you agreed to marry me and get a divorce three years later

89
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,230
to repay the Xuanyuan family

90
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,890
for letting you stay in their family for three years.

91
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,190
Yes.

92
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,780
Wait.

93
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,020
You said to me first that we would get a divorce.

94
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,670
It's all because of you.

95
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,460
I thought you loved Sikong Shaoyun.

96
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,710
Then,

97
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,740
why did you said you would divorce me in two years?

98
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,920
It has something to do with another thing.

99
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,710
You think you can kill me

100
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
with Mo Ye Sword alone?

101
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,790
How naive!

102
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,030
I am the demon lord.

103
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,190
As long as you can't get Gan Jiang Sword back,

104
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,470
you won't be able to kill me.

105
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,320
Where is Gan Jiang Sword?

106
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,070
Give it to me!

107
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,830
You are such an ignorant young man.

108
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,830
Why should I tell you?

109
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,130
Go find it yourself.

110
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,900
But when you find it,

111
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,800
the human world will be destroyed by me.

112
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,820
You'll regret what you said

113
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,390
because today you've told me

114
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,560
how to kill you.

115
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,240
You're right.

116
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,690
I'm being arrogant.

117
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,690
You can also take my arrogance as disdain.

118
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,630
This is because I don't

119
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,530
see you as someone important at all.

120
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,470
Do you think

121
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,720
an ant can kill an elephant?

122
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,790
So you plan to

123
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,670
find Gan Jiang Sword within two years

124
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,130
to kill Shuo Tian

125
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,540
and settle the dispute between humans and demons?

126
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,120
Yes.

127
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,140
I will make him

128
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,530
pay for his arrogance.

129
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,380
So have you found Gan Jiang Sword?

130
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,520
I haven't had time to look for Gan Jiang Sword since we got married.

131
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,080
Dealing with you

132
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,880
already makes me so busy.

133
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,330
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,370
It's all my fault.

135
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,520
My bad.

136
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,880
Don't apologize to me so often.

137
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,280
I blame myself.

138
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,120
Well,

139
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,110
have you found any clues?

140
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,640
Gan Jiang Sword and Mo Ye Sword

141
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,330
are the two magical demon-killing weapons

142
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,190
passed down from the ancestors of the Mo family.

143
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,240
The two swords on the emblem of the Mo family are Gan Jiang and Mo Ye.

144
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,940
But Gan Jiang Sword has been missing for a long time.

145
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,240
People searched the mortal world but failed to find it.

146
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,420
I suspect

147
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,790
that Shuo Tian, the demon lord

148
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,990
stole it and took it to Demon Realm

149
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,630
to stop us from killing him.

150
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,280
He must be hiding it somewhere close to him.

151
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,450
So,

152
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,820
the demon lord may look a little bit lunatic,

153
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,090
but he's indeed very powerful.

154
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,090
We'll need to make a detailed long-term plan

155
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,030
if we hope to

156
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,600
get Gan Jiang Sword back from him.

157
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,630
I don't know

158
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,470
what Gan Jiang Sword looks like.

159
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,120
Shi Si.

160
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,950
What's wrong?

161
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,910
Mo...

162
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,260
Mo Yan?

163
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:02,940
I...

164
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,880
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,030
I didn't mean it.

166
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,250
It's fine.

167
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,150
You were having a nightmare.

168
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,590
And I couldn't wake you up.

169
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,000
I...

170
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,100
I...

171
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,200
I had a dream.

172
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,160
In the dream,

173
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,390
there was a man who was

174
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,290
a complete stranger to me.

175
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,710
He was holding a sword

176
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,480
and was going to kill me.

177
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,360
I was scared.

178
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,260
I...

179
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:47,990
It's fine.

180
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,230
Don't be afraid.

181
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,670
Can you show me Mo Ye Sword?

182
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,170
Is the pattern on Gan Jiang Sword's hilt

183
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,320
the same as that on Mo Ye Sword's hilt?

184
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,370
Yes.

185
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,940
In my dream,

186
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,220
the same pattern

187
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,160
was on the hilt of the sword

188
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,400
held by the man who wanted to kill me.

189
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,010
Can't fall asleep?

190
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,930
Are you thinking about that nightmare?

191
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,390
Yes.

192
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,670
Don't worry.

193
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,970
You haven't regained all your memory.

194
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,830
Don't think too much.

195
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,200
How I wish my memories could come back more quickly.

196
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:56,870
If so,

197
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,190
we'll have more clues.

198
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,890
You once told me

199
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,490
that the fragments attracted you

200
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,060
and they could make you feel at ease.

201
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,660
After you absorb a fragment,

202
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,990
your magic improves.

203
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,260
You don't look good.

204
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,960
I'll go get Wanwusu to help you feel better.

205
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,750
No need.

206
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,920
As long as you're by my side,

207
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,390
I'll feel good.

208
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,660
As long as we're close enough.

209
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,700
How close?

210
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,350
♫The person in the dream♫

211
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,630
♫Falling like a flower♫

212
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:05,680
♫The heart withers into a desert♫

213
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,830
To be this lose

214
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,830
is good enough.

215
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:12,030
♫The wind and the rain have seen through the vagaries of fate♫

216
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:19,810
♫Where do you wander off to?♫

217
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,830
♫Can't see through♫

218
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,440
♫The karma of destiny♫

219
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,920
♫Who will accompany the song in my heart?♫

220
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,590
♫Time goes by and desolates love and hate♫

221
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,490
♫The past is like a dream♫

222
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,290
♫Sounds echoing♫

223
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:54,050
♫Your smile is like the spring breeze♫

224
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:00,820
♫My heart is like jade and I used to be crazy about you and I don't regret it♫

225
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,980
♫Flowers bloom♫

226
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,480
♫Flowers fall♫

227
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,030
♫They're so fragile♫

228
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,580
♫Pretty faces will get wrinkled♫

229
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,550
♫Love will change♫

230
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,280
♫All will fade♫

231
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,650
Let's sleep.

232
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,120
My Lady.

233
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,380
You just came back a few days ago.

234
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,470
Why not stay home for a few more days?

235
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,490
It's fine.

236
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,530
Mo Yan said he and I would go for a spring outing today.

237
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,120
It'll be easy and relaxing.

238
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,390
But you just...

239
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,170
I'm afraid you'll encounter demons again.

240
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,620
Don't say it.

241
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,110
Can't you just wish Young Master and Young Madam

242
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,950
a happy spring outing?

243
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,610
I'm with her. There's nothing to worry about.

244
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,880
Alright.

245
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,200
You don't need to be worried.

246
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,550
Take good care of the business in the family.

247
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,900
Lan

248
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,100
hasn’t come back yet?

249
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,630
No.

250
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,920
I don't know where he is.

251
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,640
He hasn't come back since he left that day.

252
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,880
He seriously asked me to tell you that he would leave.

253
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,510
It's fine.

254
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,310
Let's go.

255
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,120
Bye, Xiaohe.

256
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,600
Okay.

257
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,920
Lan Jia.

258
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,250
What brings you here?

259
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,870
Where's Brother Mo Lan?

260
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,400
Why do you want to see him?

261
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,040
You guys asked me about the fragment yesterday.

262
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,330
Brother Mo Lan said

263
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,190
you might need other fragments.

264
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,510
You have clues about where they are?

265
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,550
To be honest,

266
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,200
Mount Niuyang

267
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,580
is full of spiritual energy.

268
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,369
For us demons,

269
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,460
this is a good place to practice magic.

270
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,560
Some of my neighbors

271
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,859
have their magic improved so fast.

272
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,260
I was wondering

273
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,109
if the way I practiced was not right.

274
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,930
But I'm one of the Five Mythical Beasts.

275
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,710
So it's impossible that my way of practicing was wrong.

276
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,680
Get to the point.

277
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,220
After Wutan Baluo gave me the fragment,

278
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,180
I got to know why their magic could be improved so fast.

279
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,680
So you mean

280
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,070
there are demons in the mountain

281
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,680
practicing magic with fragments?

282
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,640
That's right.

283
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,970
If you need it,

284
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,410
I can take you to them.

285
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,630
Let's go.

286
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,820
Are you plotting something?

287
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,310
I...

288
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,820
I'm not plotting anything.

289
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,260
I'm just

290
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,930
a weak and helpless snake.

291
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,510
All right.

292
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,250
There are powerful demons and weak demons in the mountain.

293
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,700
My fragment

294
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,080
has been taken by you.

295
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,960
If my neighbors become stronger,

296
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,330
how can I survive here?

297
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,130
I don't want to lose face.

298
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,950
Helping you get the fragment

299
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,920
will also do me a favor.

300
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,840
Besides,

301
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,050
Brother Mo Lan said

302
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,410
that if I know where a fragment is and don't report it,

303
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,660
he will kill me.

304
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,370
I dare not keep it all to myself.

305
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,370
Lan Jia.

306
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,810
Then you must guide us carefully

307
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,760
because my husband is good at

308
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,050
killing demons.

309
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,080
Right, Honey?

310
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,710
Yes.

311
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,170
Let's go, Honey.

312
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,240
We've arrived.

313
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,150
It's here.

314
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,030
The first neighbor to have a fragment

315
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,190
is here?

316
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:06,820
Yes.

317
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,540
He

318
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,180
is not easy to deal with.

319
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,080
What kind of demon is he?

320
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,230
Yu Zhou.

321
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,370
Are you there?

322
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,120
Lan Jia.

323
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,030
What are you doing?

324
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,000
You'll get yourself killed.

325
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,500
It's you.

326
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,660
You short-sighted demon.

327
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,690
Why did you wake me up?

328
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,760
Yu Zhou.

329
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,440
My two friends and I

330
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,560
need to talk to you about something.

331
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,330
What is it?

332
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,480
They want your fragment.

333
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,120
Fragment?

334
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,420
You

335
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,790
want this?

336
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,040
Yes.

337
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,540
Here you are.

338
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,820
We can have it?

339
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,310
Wait.

340
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,490
I have a question.

341
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,440
Well...

342
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,730
Yu Zhou.

343
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,490
The fragment is so important.

344
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,180
Shouldn't my husband have a fight with you before he can have it?

345
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,280
No.

346
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,480
I'm too lazy to have a fight.

347
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,350
And I don't want the fragment.

348
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,430
The demons out there

349
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,660
are all fighting hard for the fragment.

350
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,420
You're so generous.

351
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,750
That they're fighting for the fragment

352
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,050
is none of my business.

353
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,200
I just want to have a good sleep.

354
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,410
Don't disturb me.

355
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,670
Is this fragment real?

356
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,480
Get lost!

357
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,390
Get lost!

358
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,410
Yu Zhou.

359
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,670
Go back to sleep.

360
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,860
Sorry that we disturbed you.

361
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,560
See you next time.

362
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,930
I didn't expect us to get the fragment so easily.

363
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,670
If I had known Yu Zhou is so generous,

364
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,890
I would've come and asked him for it alone.

365
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,840
What are you murmuring?

366
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,670
Let's go.

367
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,310
Let's find another fragment.

368
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,000
Okay.

369
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,080
I'll guide you.

370
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:52,920
Please.

371
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,350
Okay.

372
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,030
Let's go.

373
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,450
Snake.

374
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,150
Where is the next fragment?

375
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,940
The next fragment is...

376
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,530
Got you.

377
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,740
You'll be

378
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,620
my supper tonight.

379
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,920
Wait.

380
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,670
You can't eat it.

381
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,290
Next time...

382
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,230
I'll buy you something delicious next time.

383
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,530
Mo Yan, the hare seems to be injured.

384
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,020
Hui.

385
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,630
Where are you?

386
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,240
You're injured. You shouldn't run around.

387
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,990
Come back!

388
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,770
Hui.

389
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,620
-Hui.
-Yu.

390
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,840
Yu.

391
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,960
Shi Si.

392
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,130
-Yu.
-We've finally met again.

393
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
Xuanyuan Yu?

394
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,770
I've finally met you again.

395
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,910
I missed you so much.

396
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,680
Women are really annoying,

397
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,560
right?

398
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,920
You are also a woman.

399
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,540
I'm one of the Five Mythical Beasts.

400
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,830
Shi Si.

401
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,190
You are thinner now.

402
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,130
No, I'm not.

403
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,190
Yu, where have you been?

404
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,970
I went to Mo's Mansion to find you.

405
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,470
I waited outside for days.

406
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,390
And I didn't see you go out.

407
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,640
Later, I asked a few people

408
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,290
and got to know that Mo Yan brought you here to practice magic.

409
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,670
You have no idea

410
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,680
how hard it is to climb this mountain and how rough the roads are.

411
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,620
Why did Mo Yan have to bring you here

412
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,430
to practice magic?

413
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,660
It's okay.

414
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,830
Honey.

415
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:11,950
Yes.

416
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,490
You're Mo Yan?

417
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,170
Not bad.

418
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,070
You look good.

419
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,820
It's said

420
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,200
he is one of the three most handsome young noblemen

421
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,860
in Fengdu.

422
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,250
But Shaoyun

423
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,450
is even a little more handsome than him.

424
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,440
Honey.

425
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,450
Don't you want to introduce her to me?

426
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,980
She is the eldest daughter of the Xuanyuan family...

427
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,860
I'm her

428
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,780
best friend.

429
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,240
I'm here to visit her.

430
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:52,910
right?

431
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,950
May I have your name?

432
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,750
Just now in the mountain,

433
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,530
I heard my wife

434
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,460
called you Yu.

435
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,240
I can be called Yu.

436
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,480
But my actual name is Xiaoyu.

437
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,540
What a coincidence.

438
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,480
You both have "Yu" in your names.

439
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,310
May I know

440
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,680
which family you're from?

441
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,120
Mo Yan, we...

442
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,630
Actually, I’m a maid

443
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,170
in the Xuanyuan family.

444
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,310
I'm a girl of humble origins.

445
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,470
Her Ladyship was so nice.

446
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,160
She didn't treat me badly.

447
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,100
Instead, she sees me as her sister.

448
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,480
-I’m really thankful to her.
-Yu. Yu.

449
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,350
Actually...

450
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,750
I'm so touched.

451
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,680
Yes.

452
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,030
Since you got married,

453
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,960
I've been missing you so much.

454
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,840
Really?

455
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,670
Then why

456
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,790
did you call her

457
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,320
Shi Si just now?

458
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,750
Shi Si...

459
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,830
Shi Si...

460
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,440
Well.

461
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,330
Maids in Xuyuan's Mansion often count off.

462
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,600
I happened to be No. 14.

463
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,340
I was so excited

464
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,800
when I saw Her Ladyship just now

465
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,510
that I just shouted my number which is fourteen.

466
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,580
You two...

467
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,500
Yu.

468
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,230
Yu.

469
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,840
I've told him everything.

470
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,360
Everything?

471
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,340
Yes.

472
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,420
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

473
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,790
I was going to but you...

474
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,960
I just wanted to give up pretending just now.

475
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,110
Come on.

476
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,870
It was a nice try.

477
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,340
I almost believed you.

478
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,820
So thanks to me,

479
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,300
you met each other and fell in love.

480
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,890
Ex-fiancée.

481
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,040
What do you think of

482
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,310
my idea to let her replace me

483
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,360
to marry you?

484
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,960
You're just a coward

485
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,370
who was too weak to find other ways to resist

486
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,850
so you just ran away with some luggage.

487
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,220
No.

488
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,070
You...

489
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,410
I did so because I believe in the freedom of marriage.

490
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,080
So you let Shi Yi, who lost her memory, replace you to marry me?

491
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,300
You have a double standard regarding the freedom of marriage.

492
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,100
Shi Si.

493
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,670
Stop laughing.

494
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:26,930
Help me!

495
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,940
Mo Yan.

496
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,070
You should be nicer to Yu.

497
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,720
She's my best friend.

498
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,090
I can't.

499
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,110
If the Mo family were a dangerous place,

500
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,010
she would have been the one

501
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,220
who had got you in danger.

502
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,350
Your family is not a dangerous place.

503
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,590
You

504
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,210
are my Mr. Right.

505
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,710
My goodness.

506
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,010
When your best friend gets married, you're no longer the most important person to her.

507
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,240
Yu.

508
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,550
Tell me

509
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,580
if you need anything.

510
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,490
My business is Mo Yan's business.

511
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,070
Got it?

512
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,590
Okay.

513
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,490
By the way,

514
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,280
Shi Si,

515
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,760
actually, I'm here

516
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,130
to deal with something important.

517
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,080
What is it?

518
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,310
Once,

519
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,280
I sneaked into Sikong's Mansion.

520
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,990
Young...
