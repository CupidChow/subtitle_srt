How dare you hide yourself in my team?

You're right.

Yes,

66
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,700
and no.

67
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,370
I planned to

68
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,060
figure out everything on my own first

69

who was holding the sword.

75
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,390
However,

76
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,650
maybe it was against your will.

77
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:26,930
What do you mean?

78
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,790
I mean,

79
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,780
you were the one

80
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,100
who cut off my kylin horns.

81
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,640
But maybe someone made you do that.

82
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:37,920
You mean

83
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,080
I was probably being manipulated at that time?

84
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,100
That's right.

85
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,050
When you were in Demon Realm,

86
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,370
you told me

87
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,520
that you were under the influence of Blood Moon Illusion.

88
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,420

Blood Moon Illusion

91
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,850
is very powerful magic.

92
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,290
The Blood Moon Illusion

93
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,200
is different from Mo Jialuo's Illusion-realm Flower Sea.

94

Those who are under the influence of this illusion technique

95
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,250
will temporarily lose consciousness

96
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,230
and even become a puppet that is manipulated by some other person.

97
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,140
The person won't remember anything of it after he regains his consciousness.

98
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,460
I think

99
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,820
you're right.

100
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,650

00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,050

apart from Shuo Tian?

105

As far as I know,

106
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,039
he didn't teach anyone how to use that magic.

107

But

108
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,970
why did he manipulate you

109
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,429
into doing that instead of anyone else?

110
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,419
Lingque said

111
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,409
the spiritual energy of kylins was too strong.

112

They can only be broken by the Magical Demon-killing Weapons.

113
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,710
Maybe

114
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,000
he wanted to use the Mo Ye Sword to do that evil thing.

115
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,120
I always feel

116
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,530
this is not as simple as it may seem.

117
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,710

you saw me cut off your horns,

127
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,750
but you still followed me here without hesitation,

128
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,920
and told me everything.

129
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,740
I just think

130
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,580
when you were cutting off my horns,

131
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,290
your expression was very strange.

132
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,360
It was not like your usual expression.

133
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,260
Thank you for not pushing me away this time.

all creatures in the world are equal.

that the dragon race has been loyal to us since many years ago.

165
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,480
We also gladly accepted their loyalty.

166
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,940
This was supposed to be a good thing

167

as it showed that the two races could live in harmony.

168

But the humans

169

are always afraid that the dragons will betray them.

170
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,400
This shows their fear of power,

171
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,120

And their beautiful love story was known to many.

178

in the Mo family's action to kill Monster Taowu.

180

They said it was because of a strategic mistake.

But actually, they just wanted to let her die.

Not only was he despised and mocked in the Mo family,

193
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,210
but was seen as a jinx and almost got kicked out

194
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,370
of the Mo family.

195
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,260
His name

196
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,880
is Mo Lan.

197
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,730
Uncle Sheng!

198
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,820
Let bygones be bygones.

199
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,140
Yan is very nice to me.

200
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,980
I grew up safely.

201
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,830
My mother's misfortune

202
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,990
shouldn't be your excuse for what you did.

203
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,530
If she were still alive...

204
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,080
She wouldn't blame me.

205
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,520
Suyun told me many times that she hoped that there would be

206
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,850
no more conflicts between humans and demons when she was alive.

207
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,580
Look.

208
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,030
Those from the demon-hunting households always said they were so upright.

209
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,930
But actually, they were not as broad-minded

210
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,560
as a demon.

211
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,120
Well.

212
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,030
Since she's dead,

213
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,690
I will fulfill

214
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,720
her wish.

215
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,380
So you joined hands with Second Young Demon Lord?

216
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,650
He promised me

217
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,840
that if I could help him ascend the throne of Demon Realm,

218
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,810
he will never cause trouble in the human world anymore.

219
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,240
How could you believe that lunatic?

220
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,630
Lunatic?

221
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,270
I'm not like you humans

222
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,020
who just abandon your partners.

223
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,050
Lan.

224
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,180
You have to think carefully

225
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,360
whether to be a human or a demon!

226
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,430
Second Uncle.

227
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,730
What do you want to say?

228
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,790
Listen.

229
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,390
I don't need your pity.

230
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,320
I didn't...

231
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,600
Don't say anything.

232
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,940
Mo Lan!

233
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,280
Mo Lan!

234
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,690
Useless!

235
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,570
I sent you to catch Mo Yan.

236
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,050
But you lost the fragment.

237
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,140
Look how weak you are now.

238
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,490
You can’t do anything well.

239
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,600
And you, Xuanyuan Sheng.

240
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,240
How dare you betray me at that critical moment?

241
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,890
You didn't deserve to be my ally.

242
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,910
You're a joke!

243
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,240
I

244
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,520
am willing to sacrifice everything for you.

245
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,550
But if someone dares to hurt Yu'er,

246
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,440
I will stop them.

247
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,230
Xuanyuan Sheng.

248
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,710
If that happens again,

249
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,520
I'll get you punished.

250
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,430
Yes.

251
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,800
You're awake.

252
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,920
Brother.

253
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,520
I...

254
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,260
I'm sorry.

255
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,680
What are you sorry for?

256
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,100
It’s all Xuanyuan Sheng's fault.

257
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:44,590
No.

258
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,360
I shouldn't have told them about your whereabouts.

259
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,310
Do you know we almost got killed because of you?

260
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,960
Brother.

261
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,070
I just wanted that demoness to be caught by them.

262
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,250
Are you talking about me?

263
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,240
Why are you here?

264
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,660
I should be the one asking you that.

265
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,350
You...

266
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,600
Go back to Fengdu tomorrow.

267
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,120
I've prepared for you

268
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,150
the food you'll need on the way.

269
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,970
Brother.

270
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,800
You want me to leave?

271
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,110
I've apologized.

272
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,500
Dongling.

273
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,590
You're not a child anymore.

274
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,300
But I don't want to go back to the Mo family.

275
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,860
It's not up to you.

276
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,500
Dongling.

277
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,800
I'm not going back.

278
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,320
Dongling.

279
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,350
Get down first.

280
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,140
I'm not going back.

281
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,550
I don't want to go back and suffer.

282
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,690
I won't go back.

283
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,080
Get down!

284
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,810
Dongling.

285
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,240
Dongling.

286
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,740
Look at me.

287
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,010
No matter what kind of life you want,

288
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,020
it's okay.

289
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,980
But freedom comes at a price.

290
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,400
If you are not willing to take the responsibility at the critical moment,

291
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,510
then you don't deserve good things in the future.

292
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,230
What critical moment?

293
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,230
I have something important to do.

294
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,870
You are my brother.

295
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,730
Can't you stand out and shoulder the responsibility?

296
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,100
Before I go back,

297
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,430
can you protect the Mo family for me?

298
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,510
Dongling.

299
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,550
Come.

300
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,830
Let me tell you the truth.

301
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,360
Do you know

302
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,270
in the eyes of me and our father,

303
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,580
who should be real master of the Mo family?

304
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,400
You!

305
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,820
Feeling surprised?

306
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,750
Do you know why Lan

307
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,380
is always on bad terms with you?

308
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,580
Let me tell you a secret.

309
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,410
It's all because he is jealous of you.

310
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,140
You're much more handsome than him.

311
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,710
You're such a handsome man.

312
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,030
If you were in ancient times,

313
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,860
your pretty face could have made the borders peaceful for 300 years.

314
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,650
You're good at everything.

315
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,450
You only don't know how to use magic.

316
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,290
If you do,

317
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,390
you'll definitely be

318
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,170
the best demon hunter in the world.

319
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,920
Then all the girls

320
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,760
will admire you.

321
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,910
You'll be their hero.

322
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,240
Everyone in our family

323
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,190
sees you as the hope of our family.

324
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:53,760
Yes.

325
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,340
I can do it.

326
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:57,970
Brother.

327
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,160
I promise that when you come back,

328
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,980
everything in the Mo family will be fine.

329
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,880
Yes.

330
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,180
I'll ask my mother

331
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,500
to give me the right

332
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,620
to handle everything in the family.

333
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,310
Thank you.

334
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,590
Don't worry.

335
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,430
Bye.

336
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,340
Dongling.

337
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,380
Anything else?

338
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:32,630
Your bag.

339
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,150
Be nice to my brother.

340
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,620
If you dare to play any tricks of the demons, I will...

341
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,530
I will...

342
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,650
Kill me?

343
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,770
I'm glad you know this.

344
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,910
Brother.

345
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,660
Bye.

346
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,360
No need to worry about me.

347
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,590
I'll let you know as soon as I arrive.

348
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,920
He won't come back, right?

349
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,590
I will definitely come back.

350
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,070
My Lady.

351
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,810
It hurts.

352
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,330
I don't like to be surrounded

353
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,950
by so many people when I'm treating the patient.

354
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,000
Leave us alone.

355
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,770
[Excellent Doctor]

356
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,550
My Lady.

357
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,860
My Lady, it hurts.

358
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,960
[Excellent Doctor]

359
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,450
My Lady.

360
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,390
My Lady.

361
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,400
Don't go, My Lady.

362
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,690
My Lady!

363
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,420
[Excellent Doctor]

364
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,990
Shut up!

365
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:12,570
[Excellent Doctor]

366
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,720
Shi Si, don't worry.

367
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,710
He will be cured.

368
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,820
Mo Yan found the doctor for him.

369
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,130
So I trust the doctor.

370
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,110
The doctor your husband found must be the best one.

371
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,270
Of course.

372
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,160
Mo Yan, good for you.

373
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,970
I didn't expect you to know a famous demon doctor.

374
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,570
I'm not surprised at that.

375
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,070
Why not?

376
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,530
Don't you always believe in the equality of all creatures?

377
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,500
Besides,

378
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,540
there are many demons around you.

379
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,690
Doctor Toad is an excellent doctor

380
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,610
who is famous in both the human world and Demon Realm.

381
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,180
She's a friend of my mother's.

382
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,480
My mother has many friends.

383
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,000
She has friends all over the world, both demons and humans.

384
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:55,890
Wherever she goes,

385
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,390
there will be someone she knows.

386
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,870
Your mother?

387
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,950
Yu.

388
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,210
His mother is Fairy Fangfei whom you admire the most.

389
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,800
Fairy Fangfei?

390
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,350
You are her son?

391
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,820
She likes travelling around.

392
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,490
That's why people call her Fairy Fangfei.

393
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,240
It's not surprising that you don't know that she's my mother.

394
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,420
I can't believe

395
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,070
-you are her son.
-Stop!

396
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,110
Come with me.

397
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,790
What's wrong?

398
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,440
I want to know more stories about her.

399
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,090
I'm leaving, Yan.

400
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,760
Shi Si!

401
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,010
Do you think

402
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,870
if Yu had known that

403
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,710
your mother is Fairy Fangfei,

404
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,950
she wouldn't have refused to marry you?

405
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,150
Luckily, she didn't know that.

406
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,510
Otherwise,

407
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,840
I wouldn't have met you.

408
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,760
Mo Yan, I...

409
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,490
Don't say you're dying or anything like that.

410
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,670
You know

411
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,550
I hate to see you apologize.

412
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,190
Actually,

413
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,280
I want to say

414
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,210
you're unlucky

415
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,120
to have met me.

416
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,570
Then I'm glad that I'm that unlucky.

417
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,730
By the way,

418
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,990
is it okay

419
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,110
if you don't go back to the Mo Family?

420
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,760
The most important thing is to find the fragments.

421
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,470
Besides,

422
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,860
we still don't know what on earth the demon lord wants to do.

423
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,440
If the problem remains unsolved,

424
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,540
the human world and Demon Realm

425
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,210
will never be peaceful.

426
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,160
Are you sure

427
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,320
your brother can take good care

428
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,580
of the Mo family?

429
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,270
My brother

430
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,680
is good at saying sweet words.

431
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,830
And he knows how to please different people.

432
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,730
Though he cannot be a good demon hunter,

433
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,820
he will be able to take good care of the Mo family

434
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,990
if we encourage him.

435
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,210
So,

436
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,990
you're actually testing him.

437
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,790
Were you testing me

438
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,900
when you asked if I would go back?

439
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,110
Do you want me to go back?

440
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,950
I want your real answer.

441
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,420
Done?

442
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,010
Go and see him.

443
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,920
Thank you.

444
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,510
It's been a long time

445
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,330
since I saw such a harmonious occasion last time.

446
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,640
Thank you, sir.

447
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,480
I've really recovered.

[Excellent Doctor] [Practice Medicine to Help All]

461
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,470
I only heard about it in the past.

462
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,010
I never expected

463
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,800
that

464
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,870
he could really set my broken bones and repair my muscles.

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,920
You've recovered?

466
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,830
Yes.

467
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,060
I've recovered.

468
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,690
Look at you.

473
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,990
Thanks to Mo Yan,

474
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,560
I've recovered.

475
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,640
I was rude to him

476
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,050
in Demon Realm.

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,630

478
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,250
It's okay.

479
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,000
He's not a petty person.

480
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,790
Right.

for the future?

I planned to...

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,240
Mo Jialuo.

486
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:08,420

I'll protect you.

493
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,870
Now you've recovered.

494
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,120

495
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,070

Don't worry.

Your friend in the room is fine.

498
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,390
Sir.

499
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,090
Do you know any solution

500
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,770
to Shi Si's problem?

501
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,200
As you said,

502
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,420
if First Young Demon Lord can gather all the fragments,

503
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,260
she won't die.

504
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,540
But before it happens,

505
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,200
she often feels dizzy and tired

506
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,250
because of a lack of the fragments.

507
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,740
Sometimes, she even fainted because of it.

508
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,880
Then I'll prescribe her some medicine

509
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,910
which may alleviate those symptoms.

510
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,750
Thank you.

511
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,240
You're welcome.

512
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,380
Fairy Fangfei and I have been friends for years.

513
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,680
She asked me to save you at the critical moment.

514
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,480
Now you're married.

515
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,080
And you married First Young Demon Lord of the demon clan.

516
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,300
I feel it's my duty to help you.

517
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,240
Sir.

518
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,470
Please.

519
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,210
Please

520
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,920
Mo Lan.

521
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,940
Mo Yan told me

522
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,190
that it was Shaoyun's own will to be possessed.

523
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,140
Everyone has their own ambition.

524
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,000
I really don't understand.

525
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,370
Then stop thinking about it.

526
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,860
I fell in love with him at first sight.

527
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,120
But now I recall

528
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,240
and I feel maybe since that time,

529
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,690
my feelings for him have been illusions.

530
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,410
Shaoyun and Wutan Baluo

531
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,360
can't be distinguished anymore.

532
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,380
Are those moments I cherished

533
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,510
all fake?

534
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,190
Why aren't you saying anything?

535
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,550
It's embarrassing for me to talk to myself alone.

536
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,840
What do you want me to say?

537
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,550
That I'm happy for you because you've seen it through?

538
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,800
Of course.

539
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,310
After such a long time,

540
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,180
I finally realized that the man I fell in love with was not a human.

541
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,900
But I'm not a human either.

542
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,480
Are you angry?

543
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,320
No.

544
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,310
Go catch a puffy fish in the river.

545
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
Your angry face looks exactly like a puffy fish now.

546
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,060
Let me tell you.

547
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,420
Don't mention him in front of me.

548
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,300
I'm not interested in him.

549
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,700
What's wrong?

550
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,890
Are you jealous?

551
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,070
What if I say yes?

[Bilifu Inn]

553
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,180
Put me down.

554
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,880
Anything else?

555
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,909
I want to tell you

556
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:12,110
that it doesn't matter if you're a human or not.

557
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,219
Don't think too much.

558
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,909
My Lady.

559
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:38,429
You have no idea

560
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,150
how painful I was when Doctor Toad was treating me.

561
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:40,960
He pulled my leg

562
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,340
all of a sudden.

563
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,719
He was very cruel to me.

564
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,400
And

565
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,219
then he suddenly

566
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,070
pulled my leg back.

567
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,400
It really hurt.

568
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,420
I wanted to scream.

569
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,949
But then he began to be very grim.

570
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,120
So I didn't dare to scream.

571
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,389
My Lady.

572
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,320
My leg hurts so much.

573
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,360
My leg hurts so much.

574
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,420
I can't walk anymore.

575
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,630
I can't walk anymore, My Lady.

576
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,430
I can't walk anymore.

577
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,020
I can't walk anymore, My Lady.

578
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,180
It really hurts.

579
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,630
It hurts so much that you can't get up?

580
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,720
My Lady.

581
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,800
I want...

582
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,750
I want you to carry me on the back.

583
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,260
Let me carry you.

584
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,700
You...

585
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,410
Come on.

586
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,240
Hurry up.

587
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,050
Go.

588
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:50,740
Go.

589
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,110
Be quick.

590
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,880
Faster.

591
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,320
Greetings, First Young Demon Lord.

592
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,390
Old turtle.

593
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,010
How come you didn't show up earlier?

594
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,820
You have know idea

595
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,990
how much I suffered?

596
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,470
Elder.

597
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,190
Why are you here?

598
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,040
First Young Demon Lord.

599
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,260
Mo Jialuo and I

600
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,250
made and implemented a temporary plan.

601
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,780
We let him be caught

602
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,540
because we had no other choice.

603
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,040
It was our way to distract Second Young Demon Lord

604
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,760
to buy us more time

605
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,120
so Second Young Demon Lord wouldn't be able to capture us all.

606
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,860
After that,

607
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,640
I secretly gathered your old supporters

608
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,810
so part of your forces have been kept.

609
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,970
Now that it’s done,

610
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,460
I’m here to report this to you.

611
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,690
But

612
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,060
I got

613
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,330
seriously injured

614
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,330
That's why he didn't find us until now.

615
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,520
It doesn't seem you're injured.

616
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,030
You look all fine.

617
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:51,810
Well...

618
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,960
Well...

619
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,430
Thanks to First Young Demon Lord's husband,

620
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,360
I got to be treated by Doctor Toad.

621
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,470
Old turtle.

622
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,100
Let me tell you how cruel Doctor Toad was.

623
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,970
He pulled my leg hard

624
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,630
and then pulled it back.

625
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,410
It really hurt.

626
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,680
Look at my leg.

627
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,680
Look at my leg.

628
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,840
He just pulled my leg like this

629
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,540
and pulled them back like this.

630
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,350
My leg still hurts so much now.

631
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,720
Look.

632
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,500
Old turtle, are you listening to me?

633
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,820
-Can you pay some attention to me?
-Shi Si.

634
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,460
My Lady!

635
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,220
Shi Si!

636
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,820
-My Lady.
-First Young Demon Lord.

637
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,240
Go and get Doctor Toad here.

638
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,020
Go.

639
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:31,820
Okay.

640
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,540
Shi Si!

641
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,550
Shi Si!
