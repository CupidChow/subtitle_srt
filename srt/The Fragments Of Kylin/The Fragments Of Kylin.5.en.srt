Nice to meet you, Young Madam Yu.

192
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,240
Nice to meet you, too.

193
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,320
Look at me.

194
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,470
I've been talking here for a long time

195
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,200
Young Master, Young Madam, please come in.

196
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,560
Let's go.

197
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,110
Okay.

198
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,580
Young Master Mo Yan.

199
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,780
It's said that you'll be here for days to investigate a case.

200
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,970
But I don't have good accommodations to offer.

201
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,970
There're only two rooms in my house.

202
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,610
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,830
It's okay.

204
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,540
Thank you for letting us stay.

205
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:06,920
You're welcome.

206
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,790
Please.

207
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,410
Young Master, Young Madam.

208
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,850
This room is shabby.

209
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,440
There's a bed here.

210
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,930
There's also a bed here.

211
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,040
There are only two small beds in the outer room.

212
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,760
Please come into the inner room.

213
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,470
Young Master, Young Madam, though the bed is

214
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,590
a little bit small,

215
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,030
it's big enough

216
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,550
for you two.

217
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,030
You sleep in the inner room.

218
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,540
Lan and I will sleep in the outer room.

219
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,570
You want to sleep in the outer room?

220
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,890
Young Master.

221
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,790
I'll get you one more quilt.

222
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,330
Yan.

223
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,220
I'm going out for a walk

224
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,340
to find some information.

225
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,730
Let's put our luggage down

226
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,650
and go to the sheepfold.

227
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,290
You want to share a room with me?

228
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:00,980
Yes.

229
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,820
The outer room is in poor condition.

230
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,350
I'm afraid you won't sleep well.

231
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,240
I'll sleep well if we sleep in the same room.

232
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,790
Recently, the sheep in the village have been getting stolen.

233
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,250
The villagers are quite troubled by it.

234
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,140
Young Master Mo Yan, look.

235
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,620
There used to be lots of sheep

236
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,380
in the sheepfold.

237
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,320
But these are all we have now.

238
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,570
Let's go inside and take a look.

239
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,150
Okay.

240
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,460
What's wrong?

241
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,450
Young Master, look.

242
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,890
This lamb

243
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,140
wasn't here when I was herding the sheep in the morning.

244
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,690
I thought it had been stolen.

245
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,100
I was very sad about it in the morning.

246
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,960
Now the lamb is back.

247
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,150
Looks like my lamb

248
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,450
knows the way back to the sheepfold.

249
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,440
It must have been taken away by some bad guy

250
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,230
then it found its way back.

251
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,970
Yan.

252
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,300
I went to the woods to investigate just now.

253
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,160
There're traces of wolves in the woods.

254
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,060
There is more than one wolf.

255
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,050
They stole so many sheep.

256
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:28,900
Where did they hide the sheep?

257
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:30,930
The wolves ate all of the sheep.

258
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,020
The wolves ate all of the sheep?

259
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,950
In a hidden cave,

260
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,390
there're many skeletons of the sheep.

261
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,510
What are you thinking?

262
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,090
Mo Yan.

263
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,050
Is there any magic that can

264
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,450
make all villagers unable to hear anything for a while?

265
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,900
As far as I know,

266
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,280
there isn't such magic.

267
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,980
There isn't?

268
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,140
Do you think

269
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,950
the demons

270
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,890
can change

271
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,410
their own appearances into anything?

272
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,200
You mean...

273
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,840
Yes.

274
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,770
Do you think that it was possible

275
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,120
that the sheep thieves didn't break into the sheepfold all of a sudden

276
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,520
and that they were waiting in the sheepfold

277
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,990
from the beginning instead?

278
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,550
There is one more sheep in the sheepfold now

279
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,580
than

280
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,560
in the morning.

281
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,560
Young Master, look.

282
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,870
This lamb

283
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,300
wasn't here when I was herding the sheep in the morning.

284
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,730
I thought it had been stolen.

285
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,140
I was very sad about it in the morning.

286
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,710
Besides, when no one was paying attention to me,

287
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,890
I hung a bell

288
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,860
on five random sheep.

289
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,500
If they take action tonight,

290
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,720
the sheep will panic.

291
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,310
By then,

292
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,550
the bells will ring.

293
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,930
The bell is hung on the fence previously.

294
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,360
But this bell only rings when it's touched.

295
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,460
If the wolf doesn't touch the fence,

296
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,870
the bell won't ring.

297
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,480
Sheep are no match for wolves.

298
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,210
Even if they wake up and panic at night,

299
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,590
they'll be killed

300
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,010
after seconds of struggle.

301
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,840
So,

302
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,530
neither the sheep nor the people

303
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,320
would notice it when the sheep were being killed.

304
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,750
But if there is a bell hung on the sheep's neck,

305
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,760
when the sheep moves,

306
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,540
the bell will definitely ring.

307
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,190
How can you be sure

308
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,880
that the five sheep you picked

309
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,500
will be targeted by the wolves?

310
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,770
I

311
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,950
carefully selected those five sheep.

312
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,750
How did you select them?

313
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,030
I was thinking

314
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,130
if I were a wolf,

315
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,730
what kind of sheep would I want to eat?

316
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,220
It must be fat one.

317
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,300
Am I wrong?

318
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,490
Then guess

319
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,130
what kind of sheep

320
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,370
would I want to eat if I were a wolf?

321
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,250
It must be fat one too.

322
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,750
Brother Yan, bad news.

323
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,940
What happened?

324
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,410
I heard the bell and came.

325
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,700
The sheep was like this.

326
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,880
Mr. Li.

327
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,090
Count the sheep and see if any sheep are missing.

328
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,990
1, 2.

329
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,750
19, 20.

330
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,830
The number of sheep didn't decrease.

331
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,480
There're as many sheep as before.

332
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,690
Didn't decrease?

333
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,700
The wolf must still be in the sheepfold.

334
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,120
Yes.

335
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,870
Honey.

336
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,090
Let’s find the wolf.

337
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,190
Lan.

338
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:02,910
Yes.

339
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,650
Use that magic.

340
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,680
Do I really have to do that?

341
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,010
Didn't you always use that magic

342
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,500
when your ability to sense demons was weak when you were young?

343
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,680
I was young and ignorant back then.

344
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,740
I'm different now.

345
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,080
Let me try again.

346
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,500
What's that magic?

347
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,560
Don't waste time.

348
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,820
Lan.

349
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,000
You haven’t done it for a long time and your posture is not right now.

350
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,550
Lift your butt.

351
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,030
Chest out.

352
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,750
Belly in.

353
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,840
Begin.

354
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,730
What is he doing?

355
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,330
This is the Dragon Scale Formation.

356
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,450
As long as the sheep pass through his body one by one,

357
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,490
he'll know which sheep is the demon.

358
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,060
So magical?

359
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,340
Hurry up and make the sheep pass me.

360
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,640
-Okay.
-Let’s go.

361
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,600
This is exhausting.

362
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,510
It's almost done.

363
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,660
The real sheep have passed.

364
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,250
What about the suspicious one?

365
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,610
The last one.

366
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,520
Go.

367
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,310
Catch it.

368
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,370
Go.

369
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,400
Let go of me!

370
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,530
Let go of me!

371
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,840
We've finally caught you.

372
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,760
Let me go!

373
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,760
Let go of me!

374
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,830
Tell me.

375
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,030
Which mountain do you guys plan to meet?

376
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,410
The tallest one.

377
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,730
Wolves live in packs.

378
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,010
Normally, seven wolves make one pack.

379
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,520
Yes.

380
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,210
We must catch them all.

381
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:14,380
Don't move.

382
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,170
All right.

383
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,180
Your clothes are dirty too.

384
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,680
What are you doing?

385
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,910
The two humans are in love. You demon stay out of it.

386
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,720
Why did they leave?

387
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,920
Little wolf.

388
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,510
Don't you wolves only howl on full-moon nights?

389
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,210
That is just your assumption.

390
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,180
We just like howling.

391
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,460
It has nothing to do with the moon.

392
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,220
Then why do you wolves like howling?

393
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,210
Take a guess.

394
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,500
Father.

395
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,340
Don't be afraid.

396
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,150
I don't want to hurt you.

397
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,350
As long as you promise me

398
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,660
that you won't disturb the villagers again,

399
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,060
I'll let you go.

400
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,560
Cut the crap.

401
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,950
Father.

402
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,820
Why do you keep disturbing the villagers?

403
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,830
We have no other choice.

404
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,140
Since

405
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,200
I accidentally got a fragment,

406
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,440
our clan

407
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,010
has been encountering disasters.

408
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,210
What fragment?

409
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,050
It's a fragment that all demons want.

410
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,280
It can increase one's magic power dramatically

411
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,770
and one's magic power can be improved a lot faster.

412
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,710
Besides,

413
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,410
any demon who has touched the fragment

414
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,790
can hide their traces

415
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,920
and live in the mortal world without being detected.

416
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,740
No wonder I couldn't sense the demon.

417
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,630
At first,

418
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,240
I wanted to use this fragment to protect our clan.

419
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,970
Unexpectedly,

420
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,960
more and more demons came to fight for it.

421
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,160
Even my wife

422
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,330
died because of it.

423
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,900
So you stole the villagers' sheep?

424
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,830
What other choice do we have?

425
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,040
This place is barren.

426
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,070
We have no other ways to get food.

427
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,200
There's nothing here.

428
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,120
Apart from us who have the fragment,

429
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,960
other living beings are all dead.

430
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,910
If we don't do that,

431
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,280
we'll die.

432
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,390
Give me the fragment.

433
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,490
Don't ever come here again.

434
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,220
Brother Yan...

435
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,710
Son.

436
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,670
Come here.

437
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,430
Father!

438
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,900
Little wolf.

439
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:49,970
Let's go.

440
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,120
Yu'er, do you know what this is?

441
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,210
Last time when I was hunting the demon,

442
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,210
I happened to...

443
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,320
What's going on?

444
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,180
The veins and meridians in my body

445
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,150
seem to have been unclogged.

446
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,610
What's wrong?

447
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,230
What did I do?

448
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,300
You absorbed the fragment.

449
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,100
I...

450
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,190
I didn't mean to absorb that fragment.

451
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,060
I don't know why that happened.

452
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,920
Mo Yan.

453
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,780
Let's go down the mountain first.

454
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,110
I...

455
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,890
Goodbye, Mr. Li.

456
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,640
Goodbye, Mr. Li.

457
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,510
Young Master.

458
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,260
Why don't you stay for a few more days?

459
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,120
You really have to leave now?

460
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,140
Don't worry, Mr. Li.

461
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,540
The wolves have left.

462
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,780
Thank you.

463
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,760
Thank you for your help.

464
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,920
Take care.

465
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,210
Goodbye.

466
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,780
Mo Yan.

467
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,210
Have a safe journey, Young Master.

468
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,630
Young Master.

469
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,900
Young Master, you are back.

470
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,650
Young Master.

471
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,080
My Lady.

472
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,560
Give it to me.

473
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,980
My Lady, I missed you so much.

474
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,580
How is it?

475
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,910
Did everything go well?

476
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,430
Yes.

477
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,330
Did you

478
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,760
have a fight?

479
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,170
I don't know why

480
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,790
he suddenly started to ignore me.

481
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,170
On the way back,

482
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,590
he didn't say anything to me.

483
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,540
Don’t worry, My Lady.

484
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,470
Maybe Young Master is worried about

485
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,600
some trouble caused by the demon?

486
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,110
You're back.

487
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,760
Mo Yu said you didn't have dinner.

488
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,320
I prepared some food for you.

489
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,150
Here.

490
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,430
Sit down and eat.

491
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,760
I'm not hungry.

492
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,600
I'm here to get the bedding.

493
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,340
The study has been cleaned.

494
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,330
I can sleep there now.

495
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,230
I don't want you to leave.

496
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,290
I don't know what to say.

497
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,190
When I'm with you,

498
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,150
I feel safe.

499
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,270
Don't go.
