My Lady.

12
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,010
Why are you still practicing at this time?

13
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,750
Since they have locked us up,

14
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,740
they won't let us go so easily.

15
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,410
Someone will be here in the morning.

16
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,810
Tomorrow morning?

17
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,420
Do we have to

18

sleep here tonight?

19
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,960
Come sit next to me if you're scared.

20
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,050
My Lady,

21
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,130
Second Madam is so wicked.

22
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,250
Xiaohe,

23
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,390
just one night.

My Lady,

27
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,190
why did you come right after you heard that

28
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:12,990
Madam Ye had left something here?

29
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,820

31
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,920
She has been hunting demons and upholding justice for more than ten years,

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,010
yet she didn't covet fame and fortune at all.

Are you hungry, Xiaohe?

39
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,470
Yes, I am.

40
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,430
My Lady.

41
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,950
How come you bring food along with you?

42
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,370
Is it sweet?

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,950

44
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,670

00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,460
Put it down quickly.

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,710
I was just asking.

Because compared to

looking for the fragments,

130
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,590
what I want more

Go get a physician for you.

Isn't it strange?

143
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,500
Even without the gift of demon hunting,

144
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,740
I have such an amazing ability to heal myself.

145
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,610
Maybe God thought I was too weak

146
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,680
so He gave me the ability to recover faster from my injuries.

147
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,440

153
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,970
He said he wanted to kill me.

what he said to me.

159
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,770
But

160
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,170
he called me Young Lady.

161
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,700
He also mentioned

162
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,090
the fragments.

163
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,350
The crow also mentioned the fragments last time.

164
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,970
Is this situation

165
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,500
more complicated than I thought?

166
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,070
Why are you telling me this?

167
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,760
Why can't I tell you this?

168
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,210

169
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,140

170

171
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,080
will be unfavorable to you.

172
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,990
Maybe

173
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,580
there's a big conspiracy hidden in there

174
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,360
and we are all pawns.

175
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,840
Maybe

176
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,930
we'll become enemies.

177
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,930

178
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,810
I think you're trustworthy.

179
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,850
Since you are fine,

180
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,410
I'll take my leave first.

181
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,270

182
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,770

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,830
She even lost her memory.

197
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,130
♫Time goes by and desolates love and hate♫

198
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,710
You...

199
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,750
are indeed full of riddles.

200
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,030
♫The past is like a dream♫

201
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,550
But just like you trust me,

202
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,830
♫Sounds echoing♫

203
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,950
I think

204
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,790
I should trust you too.

205
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,850
I will treat you well.

206
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,380
Mo Yan.

207
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,510
Teach me

208
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,400
magic.

209
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:06,720
Morning.

210
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,470
Young Master.

211
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,400
Have some tea.

212
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,480
Yan.

213
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,610
I heard there was a demon invasion last night.

214
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,250
I...

215
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,820
Why are you talking shop so early in the morning?

216
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,030
Young Master.

217
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,710
Why do you look

218
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,350
a bit pale?

219
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,560
Let's talk in the study.

220
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,310
You really don't know how to behave yourself.

221
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,290
Young Madam is still injured.

222
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,540
Yan.

223
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,680
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,060
If I hadn't been away from the Mo's Mansion last night,

225
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,790
-It's fine.
-it'd…

226
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,540
It's none of your business.

227
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,420
By the way,

228
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,520
did you see the demon's face?

229
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,790
He has bird-like feathers and claws.

230
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,130
It's a poison-eagle.

231
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,970
My mother taught me that

232
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,800
poison-eagles have both bird and leopard forms.

233
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,420
They are good at diving.

234
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,150
They are born fierce, bloodthirsty,

235
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,140
and moody.

236
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,680
They make sounds

237
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,830
like a baby crying.

238
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
They are also man-eaters.

239
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,730
Yu said

240
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,320
the poison-eagle wanted to kill her.

241
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,130
Poison-eagles are rare in Demon Realm.

242
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,430
Due to their characteristics of flying in the sky and fleeing underground,

243
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,490
they are often

244
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,470
trained as killers.

245
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,270
They're high-level demons.

246
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,880
As far as I know,

247
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,320
they don't act rashly.

248
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,790
I think he showed up here

249
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,640
under orders from his superiors in Demon Realm.

250
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,450
That's weird.

251
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,730
Although Young Madam comes from the Xuanyuan family,

252
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,420
her magic power

253
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,220
is very weak.

254
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,570
In the martial world,

255
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,920
no one had ever heard of her hunting demons.

256
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,360
The demon clan has no grudge against her.

257
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,780
Why do they want to kill her?

258
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,520
He called me Young Lady.

259
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,090
Maybe he has some grudges against the Mo family.

260
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,200
Coincidentally,

261
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,710
Yu was alone last night.

262
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,020
Could it be something to do with herself?

263
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,030
Alright, Lan.

264
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,160
Let's go prepare for the farm in the suburbs.

265
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,770
My Lady.

266
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,690
Come in.

267
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,510
My Lady, did you sleep well last night?

268
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,470
Yes.

269
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,400
It was the best sleep I've had

270
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,020
since I came to Mo's Mansion.

271
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,220
Is it because of Young Master?

272
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,660
The area

273
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,980
where he slept last night

274
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,450
was especially warm.

275
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,110
My Lady, that's what I admire about you.

276
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,950
What?

277
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,270
You speak your mind.

278
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,460
You're never coy.

279
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,760
Is Young Master going to move back?

280
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,020
Has he moved out before?

281
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,490
If not, why do you think

282
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,430
he has been sleeping in the study?

283
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,070
Mo Yan never told me about it.

284
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,470
He must have something important to deal with.

285
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,200
Besides, I think he's...

286
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,770
He did all that to avoid me?

287
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,480
I envy you so much.

288
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,900
You rarely worry and live a carefree life.

289
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,200
There are too many things I can't remember.

290
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,930
My Lady, please don't...

291
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,990
My Lady.

292
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,780
Why are you still injured?

293
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Does it hurt?

294
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,140
It should be fine.

295
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,950
But I remember that

296
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,000
you don't get hurt.

297
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
You're right.

298
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,710
Also, my injury last night

299
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,050
has recovered.

300
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,080
Could it be...

301
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,660
the Mo Ye Sword?

302
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,170
Who is it?

303
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,530
It's me.

304
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,270
Jia Chun is receiving punishment in the backyard.

305
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,790
Today, I'll show you guys

306
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,930
what will happen when you fail to do your job properly.

307
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,320
Madam, please spare my life.

308
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,540
Madam! Madam!

309
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,580
Madam, please spare my life!

310
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,750
Please spare my life! Madam!

311
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,260
Madam.

312
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,330
Last night,

313
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,410
Young Madam Yu was attacked in the ancestral hall

314
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,610
and almost died.

315
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,680
Why was Young Madam Yu in the ancestral hall?

316
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,960
I wanted to take revenge on Young Madam Yu.

317
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,780
So...

318
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,180
That's why I tricked her to the ancestral hall.

319
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,450
How dare you!

320
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,690
Why did you take revenge on Young Madam Yu?

321
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,410
Keep flogging.

322
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,740
Madam.

323
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:33,980
I'll tell you.

324
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,070
I'll tell you.

325
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,960
One day, Young Madam Yu wanted to eat almond pastries,

326
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,950
so the chef sent me to deliver them.

327
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,790
At night,

328
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,020
the chef told me

329
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,830
Young Madam Yu got diarrhea

330
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,020
after having the almond pastries

331
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,030
and wanted to punish me.

332
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,910
I wanted to plead with Young Madam Yu.

333
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,280
Before I had time to go,

334
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,860
she had told the chef

335
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,350
to punish me severely.

336
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,740
As a result,

337
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,320
I was fined six months' wages.

338
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,460
I am the only son

339
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,620
of my mother.

340
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,650
Moreover, she was seriously ill.

341
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,250
I couldn't afford her medicine bill.

342
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,450
So my mother...

343
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,510
My mother died because of illness

344
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,880
a few days ago.

345
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,760
I hate her.

346
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,000
What's that?

347
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,390
That's not true.

348
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,170
Why is he making up stories?

349
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,120
Calm down.

350
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,650
Really?

351
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,020
Please uphold the justice, Madam.

352
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,000
I know you are holding a grudge.

353
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,930
Everyone would be upset about this.

354
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,350
But we have to follow the family rules.

355
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,280
After all, you have hurt Young Madam Yu.

356
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,010
Today, I have decided

357
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,590
to pay you half a year's salary

358
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,910
and expel you.

359
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,620
Give your mother a proper burial.

360
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,970
Thank you, Madam.

361
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,360
Wait.

362
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,530
You hurt my wife.

363
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,060
You can't close the case so easily.

364
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,200
Yan.

365
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,940
You just arrived.

366
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,420
You don't know about the whole story.

367
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,460
Aunt also said that we have to follow the family rules.

368
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,930
If such vicious retaliation

369
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,330
can be spared so easily,

370
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,500
then the Mo family's rules

371
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,180
will mean nothing at all.

372
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:35,740
Lan.

373
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,760
Young Master, Madam.

374
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,270
Yan.

375
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,370
What are you doing?

376
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,180
This was found in Uncle Xu's cabinet.

377
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,450
He deducted your salary for half a year.

378
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,890
However, the monthly salaries paid out to the kitchen staff

379
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,200
have never been reduced.

380
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,320
Xu Houfu! Give my mother back!

381
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,250
Xu Houfu!

382
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,740
Madam! Help me!

383
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,760
Madam, you promised to help me.

384
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,340
Madam!

385
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,650
Help! Madam!

386
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,340
Kneel!

387
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,010
Yan.

388
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,080
Uncle Xu took someone else's wages for himself.

389
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,420
He must be punished.

390
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,270
But his crime is not that serious.

391
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,360
After all, he's been staying at the Mo's Mansion for so long.

392
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,410
It depends on

393
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,420
who asked Jia Chun to pass the message.

394
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,240
Since you admit it,

395
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,940
you should suffer all the pains

396
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,020
my wife has suffered.

397
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,480
As for the rest,

398
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,870
we'll discuss it later.

399
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,240
Wait.

400
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,720
Honey.

401
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,460
Honey.

402
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,540
Why are you here?

403
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,960
I thought something serious was going on.

404
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,410
It's such a big show.

405
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,880
Second Madam,

406
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,460
are you seeking justice for me?

407
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,000
After such a big incident,

408
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,320
of course we need to...

409
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,460
Jia Chun did send the message last night.

410
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,610
I thought you just used an excuse

411
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,450
to make me repent at the ancestral hall.

412
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,050
After all,

413
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,220
I didn't eat the apricot pastries

414
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,780
or got diarrhea.

415
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,910
Jia Chun, let me ask you.

416
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,770
We have no grudges.

417
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,330
Why did you take revenge on me?

418
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,580
I think

419
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,280
someone must have deliberately used him.

420
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,870
Yu, you must be joking.

421
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,490
Yesterday, I offended you

422
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,390
because of the feminine arts.

423
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,290
With your forbearance,

424
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,920
I was sure you'd teach me a lesson

425
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,510
after that.

426
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,700
But

427
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,540
you even implicated this innocent man

428
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,690
in our disgraceful show.

429
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,620
How could anyone do

430
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,450
such an immoral and boring thing?

431
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,870
Xuanyuan Yu, don't be too arrogant.

432
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,340
Second Madam,

433
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,620
spare us that trickery

434
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,070
in the future.

435
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,820
If you have time,

436
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,150
you can go to the theater with Young Master Dongling.

437
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,220
Honey,

438
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,320
I'm tired.

439
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,280
Really tired?

440
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,150
Yes.

441
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,930
♫With Mo Ye in hand♫

442
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,180
♫The confusion of right and wrong cannot be cleared away♫

443
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,230
Are you...

444
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:33,130
♫Not to say a word about parting, just keep isolated♫

445
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,230
really tired?

446
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:29,820
Yes.

447
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,020
Why are you so sharp-tongued to Aunt

448
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,650
but word-saving to me?

449
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,160
♫Gan Jiang is still the same♫

450
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,390

♫Dusty sword shines as cold as twilight♫

452
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,350
you need to stretch your tongue and say more.

♫Where does the soul go when the grudge is not settled?♫

454
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,840
When talking to bad guys,

455
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,740
you have to be tough and mean.

456
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,230
She's not only stupid but also bad.

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,210
♫If confrontation is an act of fate♫

458
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,730

I look at you because you look handsome.

♫A single sword will conquer the nine states♫

470

♫The world is vast, and the life is beautiful♫

472

I must stand up for you.

I mean,

474
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,550
you don't have to deal with such a small matter.

475
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,690
What's the occasion for me, then?

476
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,540
I have no idea yet.

477
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,310
I'll let you know when I figure it out.

478
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,520
I saved you last night,

479
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,160
but today you said you don't need me.

480
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,140
As you can see,

481
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,650
I have strong self-healing ability.

482
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,200
No one can hurt me.

483
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,620
But you will die too.

484
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,400
That's true.

485
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,660
If you hadn't come,

486
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,610
I'd have been dead.

487
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,080
Don't say that.

488
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,950
Are you angry?

489
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,670
The two-year agreement hasn't reached the end yet.

490
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,130
You can't die.

491
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,140
Didn't we agree that it would be three years?

492
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,690
Who told you that?

493
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,500
You...

494
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,740
Why are you looking at me?

495
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,940
I look at you because you look pretty.

496
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,680
Mo Yan.

497
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,930
How rebellious they are!

498
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,640
Yes, Mother.

499
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,000
We must teach Xuanyuan Yu a lesson.

500
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,520
Teach her a lesson?

501
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,700
How?

502
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,220
All you know is having fun outside.

503
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,520
What can I expect from you?

504
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,520
Mother.

505
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,720
Have some tea.

506
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,800
Don't be angry.

507
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,160
Come on.

508
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,400
Have a seat.

509
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,240
Mother.

510
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,410
I just came back.

511
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,490
I don't know what happened.

512
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,200
Yet I was insulted by Xuanyuan Yu indirectly.

513
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,750
I...

514
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,800
Was that indirect?

515
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,120
She even pointed out your name.

516
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,370
You silly boy.

517
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,350
Mother, don't be angry.

518
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,960
Xuanyuan Yu...

519
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,270
seems to have a scandal.

520
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,640
Mother,

521
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,160
I have an idea.

522
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,800
What's your idea?
