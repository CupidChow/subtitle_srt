[Episode 8]

4
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,270
Where is he?

5
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,470
I don't know.

6
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,710
-My Lady.
-He's gone.

7
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,150
-My Lady.
-Where did he go?

8
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:52,920
You...

9
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,020
I finally found you,

10
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,710
My Lady.

11
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,759
-Where did he go?
-How come we lost him?

12
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,030
You know me?

13
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,850
How could I not know you, My Lady?

14
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't!

15
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,010
So annoying.

16
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,789
Are you going to listen to him?

17
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,830
He said he knows me.

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,770
Let me ask him first.

19
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,660
You said your name is...

20
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,550
Mo...

21
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,630
My name is Mo Jialuo, My Lady!

22
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,730
How could you forget me?

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,040
-My name is Mo Jialuo!
-Mo Jialuo.

24
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,860
Well...

25
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,290
Why are you here?

26
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,020
I'm here to find you, My Lady.

27
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,750
My Lady,

28
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,430
you are my beloved, My Lady.

29
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,010
Why are you touching my wife?

30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,829
Let go of me!

31
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,450
Let go of my husband!

32
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,420
Let go!

33
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,320
Why are you touching him?

34
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,070
-He's holding you.
-Let go! Let go!

35
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,950
Let go! Let go of her!

36
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:48,870
Why are you so bothersome?

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,840
-Let go!
-Let go of him!

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,670
Let go!

39
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,470
-Let go of him!
-Let go of me!

40
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,290
-Let go of him!
-Let go!

41
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,680
-Let go! Uncle Nian!
-Lan!

42
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,650
Don't hurt my lord!

43
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,860
Stinky catfish!

44
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,680
Let go of me!

45
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,750
You old chap!

46
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,210
Aren't you formidable,

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,150
you half-drangon?

48
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:05,910
Let go!

49
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,430
I'll kill you!

50
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,150
Let go of me!

51
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,140
-You let go first!
-Let go of me!

52
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,250
You let go first!

53
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,210
I'll do it if you do it!

54
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,150
I won't do it if you don't!

55
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,470
Why would I if you don't?

56
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,090
If you don't let go of me,

57
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,860
I won't let go of her!

58
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,250
-You let go first!
-Let go of me!

59
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,370
-Let go, now!
-Let go of me!

60
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,380
Stop it!

61
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,260
When I count to one, you both let go.

62
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:26,390
Three,

63
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,829
two...

64
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,160
one.

65
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,560
I knew you wouldn't let go!

66
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,740
Let go! Let go!

67
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,910
-Let go! Let go!
-You let go first!

68
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,190
-I'll do it if you do it!
-Let go!

69
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,390
-I'll do it if you do it!
-Let go!

70
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,550
-No, no!
-You let go first!

71
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,270
You let go first!

72
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,310
Let go!

73
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,430
My Lady, you hit me.

74
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,210
I'm sorry, Mo Jialuo.

75
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,100
Honey, does it hurt?

76
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,620
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,150
My Lady, it hurts me too.

78
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,170
Alright, Honey.

79
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,370
Let me finish my business first.

80
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,310
We can talk later.

81
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,820
Please.

82
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,740
Why are you here?

83
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,329
Why am I here?

84
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,600
Why am I here?

85
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,810
Uncle Nian.

86
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,580
Can't you see I'm busy?

87
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,010
Let go of me!

88
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,030
I see.

89
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,960
Why am I here?

90
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,390
This stupid fish is silly.

91
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,280
Ignore him.

92
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,460
Don't say I'm silly.

93
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,930
I just have a bad memory.

94
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,690
It's okay.

95
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,370
I'm silly too.

96
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,270
Really?

97
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:43,630
Yes.

98
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,810
Do you know about the fragment?

99
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,270
The fragment?

100
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,850
The fragment!

101
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,800
The fragment.

102
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,770
The fragment.

103
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,600
The fragment...

104
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,860
What's your problem?

105
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,430
Why do you want to snatch it from me?

106
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,730
Can you give it to me then?

107
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,720
If you want it,

108
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,930
then of course I can give it to you.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,600
No.

110
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,850
I feel like I can give it to you,

111
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,890
but I also feel like I can't.

112
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,240
Why is that?

113
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,650
I got it!

114
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,620
I have to...

115
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,000
I have to collect them all

116
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,020
before I can give them to you.

117
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,760
Collect?

118
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,500
Collect?

119
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,580
Are there many fragments like this one?

120
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,180
There are ten of them.

121
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,140
However,

122
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,130
I don't know where they are now.

123
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:53,630
It took me

124
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,180
a lot of effort

125
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,909
just to find this one.

126
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,120
My Lady,

127
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,350
I did it for you.

128
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,550
My Lady!

129
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,740
Just talk.

130
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,990
Don't be handsy.

131
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,630
You said you did it for me.

132
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,200
But why?

133
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,630
Because...

134
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,190
Because...

135
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,950
I got it.

136
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,580
It was because...

137
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,200
Because of what?

138
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,800
My Lord,

139
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,000
I really can't take it anymore.

140
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,870
That guy is quite formidable.

141
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,190
I didn't expect him

142
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,120
to really be something.

143
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,490
That fish,

144
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,159
come here!

145
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,420
Today, I'll either stir-fry you

146
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,230
or braise you.

147
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,240
There's no third method!

148
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,790
Uncle Nian.

149
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,570
Let go of me!

150
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,750
Must we

151
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,350
fight this out?

152
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,060
My Lord,

153
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:48,650
according to records,

154
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,450
this battle is unnecessary.

155
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,320
We can retreat first.

156
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,000
Sounds good.

157
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,020
My Lady.

158
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,840
There are too many unwanted people today.

159
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,920
I'll come back to you another day.

160
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,170
By then,

161
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,870
we can have a deep conversation.

162
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,220
I...

163
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,880
My Lady, see you.

164
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,740
You haven't answered my question.

165
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,710
Where is he?

166
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,610
Where is the fish?

167
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,300
Did he run away?

168
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,060
That fish has a fragment.

169
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,070
Why didn't you snatch it?

170
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,230
You scared him away

171
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,620
before we had a chance.

172
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,760
What should we do now?

173
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,750
At least we got some information.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,640
For example...

175
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,500
But compared to that,

176
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,490
I'm more curious about

177
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,560
why he said you were his beloved.

178
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,230
Did...

179
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,740
Did he say that?

180
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,290
He did.

181
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,540
Guys,

182
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,040
is that the point?

183
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,590
Yes.

184
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,570
But...

185
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,820
I really don't know him.

186
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,460
Before, it was Sikong Shaoyun.

187
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,070
And now, here comes a...

188
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,220
a Mo Jialuo.

189
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,430
What...

190
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,850
What do you mean?

191
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,890
I mean

192
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,160
you are so charming

193
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,630
that you have so many admirers.

194
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:02,990
Well...

195
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:03,990
Well...

196
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,670
You are not too different from me.

197
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,070
Do you know how many girls were secretly watching you

198
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,160
at the archery tournament?

199
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,650
But they didn't boldly express their love

200
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,510
like Mo Jialuo did.

201
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,760
You don't know

202
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,020
that they praised your muscles

203
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,000
right in front of me.

204
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,910
Right in front of me!

205
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,930
Stop!

206
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,840
-Get lost!
-Get lost!

207
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,770
I'm going to hunt some wild game.

208
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
Mo Jialuo.

209
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,430
What does that mean?

210
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,950
Sikong Shaoyun.

211
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,100
He still hasn't apologized to me.

212
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,120
What?

213
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,110
I just want to see if what they said is true.

214
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,090
Why don't you give it a try?

215
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,890
Fine.

216
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,460
♫The person in the dream♫

217
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,750
♫Falling like a flower♫

218
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,210
You ambushed me last night.

219
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:25,790
♫The heart withers into a desert♫

220
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,100
And now you're feeling embarrassed?

221
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,510
You...

222
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,070
You fought back last night, didn't you?

223
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,220
♫The wind and the rain have seen through the vagaries of fate♫

224
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,230
Why don't I remember?

225
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:39,920
♫Where do you wander off to?♫

226
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,870
You really don't know that Mo Jialuo?

227
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,430
Do you know he's from the demon clan?

228
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,470
Yes.

229
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,680
I could tell.

230
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,570
He seems to be very familiar with you.

231
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,820
But I don't remember him at all.

232
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,770
-I trust you.
-I...

233
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,340
However...

234
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,630
before, that bird said it knew me,

235
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,640
and now this fish says it knew me too.

236
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,440
Do I...

237
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,060
Do I really have some connection

238
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,920
with the demon clan?

239
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,940
You just realized it?

240
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,370
What should I do then?

241
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,670
Are you asking me?

242
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,370
Yes.

243
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,210
Because...

244
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,870
Because...

245
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,450
I think you're reliable.

246
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,120
Whatever.

247
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,490
Honey,

248
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,240
don't be angry anymore.

249
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,190
They're back.

250
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,190
My Lady, Young Master Yan,

251
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,010
you are back.

252
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,120
Did you make any progress today?

253
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,300
I've been fishing all day

254
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,670
and didn't have time to practice.

255
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,380
Honey, I'll make up for it next time.

256
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,010
Well, where's the fish you caught?

257
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,470
He escaped.

258
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,160
Next time, if I catch him,

259
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,780
he's either going to be stir-fried or braised.

260
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,210
I wonder who's being angry with a fish.

261
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:25,960
Grow up a little.

262
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,940
Well,

263
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,520
who got jealous over a fish?

264
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,090
You...

265
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,950
Alright, Honey.

266
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,510
Let's go.

267
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,290
Getting jealous over a fish?

268
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,770
Do I smell good?

269
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,760
Do you have something to tell me?

270
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,070
Are you taking me somewhere?

271
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,870
Wait for me!

272
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,030
Slow down.

273
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,850
Where are you taking me?

274
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,150
Don't...

275
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,210
Don't come over!

276
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,550
Break!

277
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,830
Did you get hurt?

278
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,820
I didn't get to.

279
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,270
You really believed that I would come to save you?

280
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,360
Watch out!

281
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,820
Don't be afraid.

282
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,940
It's a dragon howl,

283
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,140
which specializes in restraining demons that use sound.

284
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,200
Okay.

285
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,260
Young Madam really has a physique that attracts demons.

286
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,970
It hasn't been long,

287
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,060
and another wave has come.

288
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,070
Thank you.

289
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,400
You should thank Yan.

290
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,040
Thank you, Honey.

291
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:41,810
So,

292
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,840
the clue I left was not bad, wasn't it?

293
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,060
Moon Chasing

294
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,850
is used for tracing tracks.

295
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,350
You used it incorrectly.

296
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,780
Moon Chasing

297
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,990
is originally used for tracing tracks.

298
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,420
But you left the thread on the pillar

299
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:58,900
and tied the knot

300
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,090
on yourself,

301
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,060
which was the wrong approach

302
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,600
but led to a positive outcome.

303
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,870
I see.

304
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,240
Was it that you didn't teach well, or she didn't learn well?

305
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,550
With just this lousy skill,

306
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,930
you actually came out to lure the enemy?

307
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,190
So, did it work or not?

308
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,010
It worked.

309
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,190
Then that's all that matters.

310
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,320
I'll leave it to you.

311
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,230
Got it.

312
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,150
Let's go.

313
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,980
Why did Mo Lan stay there?

314
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,330
To interrogate that bat

315
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,760
and find out the demon who's controlling him.

316
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,780
I shouldn't

317
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,350
have come here, should I?

318
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:50,720
You should,

319
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,790
but also shouldn't.

320
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,030
We came here

321
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,910
to investigate the matter of the demon clan.

322
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,050
The clue you lured out

323
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,950
might catch a big fish.

324
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,290
However, you have just learned the magic,

325
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,530
and it's not enough for self-protection.

326
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,260
You shouldn't have taken risks alone.

327
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,069
I didn't feel like I would encounter any danger.

328
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,730
Just because of your self-healing power?

329
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,960
No.

330
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,510
It was because...

331
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,510
I've never felt that I would be in danger.

332
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,480
It's like...

333
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,690
It's like I know those demons can't hurt me.

334
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,710
What do you mean?

335
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,850
Look.

336
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,580
I can't explain why.

337
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,040
Let's go back first.

338
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:44,990
Okay.

339
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,960
What did you find out?

340
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,410
Before I even said anything,

341
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,280
the bat was already scared out of his wits.

342
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,400
He's not a high-level demon.

343
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,470
Why did he attack her?

344
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,040
He said he was only ordered to kill Xuanyuan Yu.

345
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,080
As for everything else,

346
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,170
he doesn't know.

347
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,080
By whom was he ordered?

348
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,670
He only knows that the name of the person

349
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,880
is Wutan Baluo,

350
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,220
who is said to hold a high position

351
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,640
in the Demon Realm.

352
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,790
As for what it is

353
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,830
and why it did this,

354
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,410
at his level,

355
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,360
he doesn't have access to that information.

356
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,530
This Wutan Baluo

357
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,230
gave this order

358
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,840
to many demons.

359
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,150
What's wrong?

360
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,140
Why are you bleeding?

361
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,460
Were you too focused on practicing

362
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,530
and got backfired?

363
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,150
Demonic aura?

364
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,320
It must be the demonic aura that entered your body,

365
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,050
causing you to be confused.

366
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,720
Let me help you disperse the demonic aura

367
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,020
in your body right now.

368
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,660
If we wait any longer,

369
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,260
your hand will be crippled.

370
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:03,770
Come,

371
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,000
give me your hand.

372
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,320
Wait a minute.

373
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,700
Are you trying to suck out the poison for me?

374
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,350
No, you can't.

375
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,720
You'll get poisoned too.

376
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,220
Have you been reading too many cheap stories from street stalls?

377
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,270
The other one.

378
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,610
What move is this?

379
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,340
This is called Lightning Chasing,

380
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,160
a move that can enhance magical power.

381
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,140
You can understand it as an approach

382
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,300
to materializing magical power

383
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,940
and transforming it into various weapons.

384
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,380
So I can use it

385
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,520
on Moye Sword,

386
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,400
strengthening its attack and defense,

387
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,840
or turn it into a needle

388
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,620
to extract the demonic aura.

389
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,370
Mo Yan,

390
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,350
can I

391
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,270
learn this spell?

392
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:11,980
No, you can't.

393
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,680
Lightning Chasing

394
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,210
is extremely draining on magical power.

395
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,320
It would be too much for you

396
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,750
in your current state.

397
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,620
Using it once

398
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,530
might make you sleep for several days.

399
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,220
It's too dangerous.

400
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,450
Well,

401
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,540
what about you?

402
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,240
Are you going to be alright?

403
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:40,830
Did you

404
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,930
have a nightmare just now?

405
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,350
Yes.

406
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,160
I had

407
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,110
a weird dream.

408
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,620
In the dream,

409
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,030
I was in a place.

410
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,410
What place?

411
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,510
That place had...

412
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,710
a blood-red sky.

413
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,480
And...

414
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,540
What's wrong?

415
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,320
I can't remember.

416
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,670
My head hurts when I try to keep thinking about it.

417
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:33,980
Just stop thinking about it.

418
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,710
It's okay.

419
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,780
There's no rush.

420
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,660
Have I...

421
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,710
caused you a lot of trouble?

422
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,380
Yes.

423
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,090
So...

424
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,800
So, be a good girl.

425
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,530
That way,

426
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,100
I won't worry about you.

427
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,870
Okay.

428
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,630
Are you sleepy?

429
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,050
Sleep now.

430
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,860
In a few days,

431
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,310
I'll take you on a spring outing

432
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,930
to relax.

433
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,080
Yan.

434
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,190
Lan.

435
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,950
Where have you seen a blood-red sky before?

436
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,510
During the Great Human-Demon War 3 years ago.

437
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,750
It was demon lord Shuo Tian's illusion,

438
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,190
which can stop time.

439
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,770
Why did you ask this all of a sudden?

440
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,660
It was because of her,

441
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:45,910
right?

442
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,110
Yes.

443
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,600
She said she had seen it too.

444
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,990
Yan,

445
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,790
are you still unwilling to admit it?

446
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,820
Admit what?

447
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,750
This only proves

448
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,010
that 3 years ago, she was also

449
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,710
on that battlefield.

450
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,990
Besides the demon clan, there was also the human race on the battlefield.

451
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,680
You've already confirmed that she is not Xuanyuan Yu.

452
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,800
She is a woman of unknown origin

453
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,800
who took Xuanyuan Yu's place and married into the Mo family.

454
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,280
She was first attacked by a high-level demon in the ancestral hall,

455
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,540
then absorbed the fragment

456
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,840
related to the demon clan at the pasture.

457
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,420
Today, that fish clearly knows her.

458
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,800
Tonight, a bat that was ordered

459
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,200
to kill her came here too.

460
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,600
Now, she said that she had seen the Blood Moon Illusion too.

461
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,600
Aren't all these signs enough to show

462
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,850
that she has a deep connection with the demon clan?

463
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,410
Lan,

464
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,570
I know what you're talking about.

465
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,990
We're here precisely

466
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,940
to investigate...

467
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,720
Yan.

468
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,520
In fact, you had already deduced it,

469
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,370
hadn't you?

470
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,710
Perhaps she doesn't just have a deep connection with the demon clan;

471
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,050
she is from the demon clan!

472
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,630
You can hide it from me,

473
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,090
but you can't deceive yourself.

474
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,750
Even though she is not Xuanyuan Yu,

475
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,990
it doesn't necessarily mean she's a demon.

476
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,520
Stop lying to yourself!

477
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,460
If you can't bring yourself to do it,

478
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,640
then let me handle it.

479
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,150
What do you want to do?

480
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,150
Lan,

481
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,980
I'm not trying to avoid anything.

482
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,770
But are the demon clan really that hateful?

483
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,150
Of course they are!

484
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,930
Aunt Suyun is also from the demon clan.

485
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,510
What did she do wrong in her life?

486
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,380
Just like you, she...

487
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,540
Don't mention my mom!

488
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,840
Yes,

489
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,780
she did nothing wrong in her life.

490
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:45,970
The tragedy was destined the moment

491
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,610
the noble dragon race

492
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,650
bowed to the human race.

493
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,490
Lan, calm down!

494
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,420
How do you expect me to stay calm?

495
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,300
My mom dedicated herself to the Mo family.

496
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,130
In the end,

497
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,060
she became a victim of the conflict between the human and demon races.

498
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,810
I detest the greedy demon clan who instigated the war,

499
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,250
and I equally detest the hypocritical human race.

500
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,760
Yan.

501
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,340
I've told you before

502
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,410
that I would never compromise with any side.

503
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,850
You saved me, so I swore

504
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,990
to live for you for the rest of my life,

505
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,420
and to eliminate anyone

506
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,320
who might pose a threat to you.

507
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,790
Lan,

508
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,070
I treat you as my own brother.

509
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,720
You don't need to live for me.

510
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,320
You also can't

511
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,230
make any decisions for me.

512
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,860
I can listen to you on other matters,

513
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,910
but,

514
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,540
not this one.

515
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,070
She has no intention to harm me.

516
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,590
Fine.

517
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,080
Let me ask you.

518
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,870
If she has nothing to hide,

519
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,990
why doesn't she tell you her true identity?

520
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,650
I don't care about her identity.

521
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,050
Even if she's just an ordinary girl from a common family,

522
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,080
she's still important to me.

523
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,130
I care about her for who she is.

524
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,320
You finally admitted it, Yan.

525
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:36,980
You know she's not just

526
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,320
an ordinary girl from a common family.

527
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,360
She's from the demon clan.

528
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,430
There's no need for me to prove it to you.

529
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,030
A demon has been lurking by your side for so long.

530
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,090
She must have ulterior motives!

531
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,710
She said she lost her memory, and you just believed it?

532
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,710
She trusts me. Why can't I trust her?

533
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,530
She is my wife.

534
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,080
You've lost your judgment because of her.

535
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,760
It's okay.

536
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,340
I'll take care of all the trouble for you.

537
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,230
I'll keep my promise.

538
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:13,860
Lan!

539
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,470
Young Master,

540
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,440
last night Mo Lan left in a hurry.

541
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,700
I have no idea what happened.

542
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,170
I also heard that

543
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,750
there is a wild beast in the mountains.

544
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,000
Young Madam is here.

545
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,480
Honey, I'm ready.

546
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,170
Let's go.

547
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,880
You were poisoned last night.

548
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,800
You must rest at home today.

549
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,630
I'm fine now.

550
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,780
There is a wild beast in the mountains.

551
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,620
I'm going to investigate with Mo Yu.

552
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,330
I want to go with you.

553
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,120
Be a good girl.

554
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,680
Alright then.

555
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,880
Be careful.

556
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,080
And you must come back early.

557
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,350
Don't worry.

558
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:09,530
I'm leaving.

559
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:17,930
Be a good girl.

560
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,450
I'll be back soon.

561
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,040
I'm leaving.

562
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,610
Let's go.

563
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,200
You must come back early.

564
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,200
My Lady, you were poisoned?

565
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,060
When did that happen?

566
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,340
Are you okay?

567
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,310
I'm fine.

568
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,050
Let me take a look.

569
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,790
Did Lan say anything to you when he left?

570
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,890
He just said that he wouldn't be staying

571
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:49,960
at the village for the next few days,

572
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,440
and would be out investigating something.

573
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,080
Then how did you find out about the wild beast?

574
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,480
Yesterday, while you were out,

575
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,960
I went down the mountain to do some shopping

576
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,470
and ran into a scout of the Mo family

577
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,390
who was reporting this news to a secret post.

578
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:01,710
And I heard

579
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,760
it was in Mount Niuyang.

580
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,980
What a coincidence.

581
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,290
I reckon Mo Lan also came to hunt this beast.

582
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,430
Where is it?

583
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,160
The scout said...

584
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,320
it was in that direction.

585
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,530
Did he mention what kind of beast it was?

586
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,450
He said it was a giant serpent,

587
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,710
five-men tall,

588
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,650
rising with the mist and flying without legs.

589
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,770
Young Master.

590
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,260
It's already here?

591
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,660
I must have guided the way too accurately.

592
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,430
Young Master,

593
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,880
this serpent looks terrifying!
