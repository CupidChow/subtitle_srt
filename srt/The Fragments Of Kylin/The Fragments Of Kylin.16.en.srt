[Episode 16]

4
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,070
Mo Lan.

5
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,140
The fish are all ready to be cooked.

6
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,550
We've come ashore. Why will we still eat fish for supper today?

7
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,170
Mo Lan got a lot of fish when he was fishing on the boat.

8
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,920
I'll prepare them and make them dried fish

9
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,210
so they can be taken with us as food next time we go out.

10
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,970
They stink.

11
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,260
No one will force you to eat them.

12
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,020
Then

13
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,320
do your laundry yourself.

14
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,600
Okay.

15
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,480
Then you

16
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,650
go find food yourself.

17
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,180
You... I...

18
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,710
You...

19
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,760
You're a man.

20
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,320
How come you're so narrow-minded?

21
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,430
I really dislike spoiled girls

22
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,050
from rich families like you.

23
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,310
I offered to do laundry for everyone.

24
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:29,860
How can you say I'm spoiled?

25
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,850
You expect me

26
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,370
to say you're diligent and considerate?

27
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:35,990
You...

28
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,430
My Lady.

29
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,030
Why do you always make her angry?

30
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,060
And you.

31
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,930
You did the same.

32
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,540
I...

33
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,850
Enough, Mo Lan.

34
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,900
She's a girl.

35
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,250
Don't embarrass her too much.

36
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,700
I was telling the truth.

37
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,950
Isn't what I said true?

38
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,910
Besides,

39
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,340
it's none of your business.

40
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,650
I don't want to argue with you.

41
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,830
Waiter.

42
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,440
Serve us some good dishes tonight.

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,390
Okay.

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,750
What's up?

45
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,420
Why did you just order some nice dishes for tonight's dinner?

46
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,130
We eat fish every day.

47
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,320
I guess we're all tired of it.

48
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,420
What happened just now?

49
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,940
I heard you talk loudly from afar.

50
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,240
All right, forget about it.

51
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,430
By the way, Yan.

52
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,310
I made an investigation last night

53
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,950
and found that the Mo family had sent people to Yandu

54
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,130
to meet the Xuanyuan family.

55
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,870
Both families are looking for you.

56
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,230
Remember to tell Xuanyuan Yu

57
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,480
not to let anyone know her whereabouts

58
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,240
when she goes to see her second uncle.

59
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,620
Okay.

60
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,860
By the way,

61
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,240
I also heard some other news.

62
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,829
What news?

63
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,450
The elders of the Mo family said

64
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
they would remove you from the family tree.

65
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,550
The would even...

66
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,360
Go ahead.

67
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,890
They said

68
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,890
they would even kill you

69
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,590
if you continue to protect that demon.

70
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,500
Yan.

71
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,850
Are you really going to give up everything for her?

72
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,730
You don't even care about your family and your life?

73
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,740
You'll understand in the future.

74
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,670
What are you doing?

75
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,590
The weather is so nice today.

76
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,660
It's sunny today.

77
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,170
Look over there.

78
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,840
Give it back!

79
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,820
Mo Yan, give it back to me.

80
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,630
Is this for me?

81
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,610
Yes.

82
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,530
It doesn't look good.

83
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,860
But you can't dislike it.

84
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,500
Who said it doesn't look good?

85
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,360
No matter how ugly this embroidery is, I...

86
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,770
I mean,

87
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,280
as long as it's made by you,

88
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,890
I'll like it.

89
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,840
When I was in Mo's Mansion,

90
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,700
Second Madam disliked me because of my poor needlework skills.

91
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,380
I thought

92
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,050
she was just picking on me.

93
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,170
I didn't expect

94
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,030
the embroidery made by me would be so ugly.

95
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,690
No, it isn't.

96
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,050
Look at this small figure.

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,410
Look at the bamboo.

98
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,620
Look at the flower.

99
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,870
This flower is so lifelike.

100
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,460
It's very colorful.

101
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,180
It should be the word "Yan".

102
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,300
Look.

103
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,560
This is a Yan.

104
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,630
A colorful Yan.

105
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,760
Yan as in your name.

106
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,720
My wife is so good.

107
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,420
It's so creative.

108
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,380
But it's not all bad.

109
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,260
You'll never lose the sachet.

110
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,290
How come?

111
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,000
The sachet is so ugly.

112
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,640
No one will steal it.

113
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,940
That's great.

114
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,840
Then

115
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,890
no one will take this precious little thing away from me.

116
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,750
The dishes are ready. Please enjoy.

117
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,350
What a feast!

118
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,170
Who prepared those for us?

119
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,090
My Lady.

120
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,600
Young Master Mo Lan asked the kitchen staff to prepare them.

121
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,580
No matter who prepared them,

122
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,860
I'm so thankful to them.

123
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,430
Here.

124
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,850
Let's eat together.

125
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:52,260
Come on.

126
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,480
-Eat more.
-That’s enough.

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,330
My Lady, try this.

128
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:01,970
Yes.

129
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,650
Young Madam, please eat more.

130
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,840
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,970
Actually, it was not that I was afraid of you back then.

132
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,070
I was just

133
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,860
not used to your identity.

134
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,170
We've lived together for three years.

135
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,730
I should have realized

136
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,330
that no matter you're a demon or a human, you've never changed.

137
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,230
Yes.

138
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,130
I should say sorry too.

139
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,800
These days

140
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,930
Young Madam

141
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,610
has been the same as before.

142
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,110
And I believe in Young Master Mo Yan's judgment.

143
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,010
He has always been a good judge of character.

144
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,440
Besides,

145
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,659
Young Madam doesn't look like the demon that is as scary

146
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,049
as what the rumor says.

147
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,740
What are you talking about?

148
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,909
I didn't mean that.

149
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,020
Shi Si.

150
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,240
I don't know what you're thinking.

151
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,830
But none of us

152
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,080
will leave you.

153
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,270
Whether you're a demon or a human

154
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,630
has nothing to do with me.

155
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,830
You are you.

156
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,310
It has nothing to do with anything else.

157
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,150
Thank you, everyone.

158
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,580
Mo Lan.

159
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,480
This is such a happy occasion.

160
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,260
Don't be a bummer.

161
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,170
Say something.

162
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,410
Say what?

163
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,600
Say it!

164
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,040
Say it, Mo Lan.

165
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,870
To this moment.

166
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,060
Cheers.

167
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,330
To this moment.

168
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:26,910
To this moment.

169
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,630
To this moment.

170
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,710
To this moment.

171
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,070
By the way,

172
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,180
the annual Flower Lantern Festival

173
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,440
is going to be held in Yandu soon.

174
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,540
The streets will be very lively by then.

175
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,740
We can have fun there all day.

176
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,090
Let's go there.

177
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,140
I want to go, too!

178
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,200
-Then let's...
-Let me go with you.

179
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,910
Go there together.

180
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,470
Do you remember...

181
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,310
Then it's decided.

182
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,710
Don't go back on your word.

183
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,330
Which is the most delicious?

184
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,290
You'll know after you try all of them.

185
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,770
Then I'll try all of them.

186
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,400
Mo Lan, don't be shy.

187
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,470
You'll go with us.

188
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,840
And the sugar figurines are also very good.

189
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,550
By the way,

190
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,880
we can also watch fireworks together.

191
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,780
Let's go together then.

192
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,810
Deal.

193
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,840
Deal.

194
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,260
The weather is so nice today.

195
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,670
It's so beautiful here.

196
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,150
By the way,

197
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,630
are you sure your second uncle has come to Mount Panlong?

198
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,040
Of course.

199
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,710
After he has a fight with my father every time,

200
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,660
he'll come to Mount Panlong to practice his magic.

201
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,410
He must have done the same this time.

202
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,930
You don't believe me?

203
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,500
No.

204
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,090
I just hope

205
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,240
we won't waste our time here.

206
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,300
What's wrong?

207
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,360
Are you tired?

208
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,430
We don't know where to go anyway.

209
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,950
Maybe this is a waste of time, but so what?

210
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,610
What's that look about?

211
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,310
Tell me.

212
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,210
What do you mean?

213
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,140
Nothing.

214
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,920
Shi Si.

215
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,500
Let Mo Yan discipline his brother.

216
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,760
Look at him.

217
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,860
He's unfriendly to me.

218
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,440
I want to ask Brother Yan's wife

219
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,690
why she sees you, who is so noisy, as her best friend.

220
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,430
Am I noisy?

221
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:11,850
Shi Si.

222
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,760
Enough.

223
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,070
You go on fighting.

224
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,920
-Wait.
-Let’s go.

225
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,340
What on earth do you mean?

226
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,440
I don't want to talk to you.

227
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,410
Stop being unreasonable.

228
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,120
Are they fighting again?

229
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,110
-You have to make it clear today.
-Mo Yan.

230
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,660
-Stop fighting.
-Calm down.

231
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,100
Do you like your present life?

232
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,010
Of course.

233
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,190
Her Ladyship...

234
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,710
He made me angry deliberately.

235
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,450
Unfortunately,

236
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,150
everything is going to end.

237
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,980
Greetings, First Young Demon Lord.

238
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,800
My Lady.

239
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,680
The appointed day has come.

240
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,990
I kept my promise.

241
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,710
I know.

242
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,340
Although it hasn't been two year since we got married,

243
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,820
let's

244
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,830
divorce today.

245
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,220
Divorce?

246
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,960
Are you serious?

247
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,940
Forget me.

248
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,750
Yan!

249
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,990
♫With Mo Ye in hand♫

250
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,240
♫The confusion of right and wrong cannot be cleared away♫

251
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:29,110
♫Not to say a word about parting, just keep isolated♫

♫If confrontation is an act of fate♫

256
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,770
Shi Si.

257
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,110
♫It's a curse that can't be stopped♫

258
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,520
♫Love will revive like everything else♫

♫I'll never let go of my love for you♫

265

♫The world is vast, and the life is beautiful♫

the future ruler of Demon Realm.

♫Love is hard to tell, hate is hard to realize♫

273

Shi Si.

277
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,220
♫Any joy in life, any sorrow in death?♫

[Demon Realm]

283
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,460
My Lady.

284
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,380
My Lady.

285
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,300
My Lady.

286
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,600
You're finally awake.

287
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,620
You've been in a coma for three days.

288
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,130
This is your residence in Demon Realm,

289
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,150
Lichan Palace.

290
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,120
First Young Demon Lord.

291
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,690
How are you feeling?

292
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,320
Much better.

293
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,550
My Lady.

294
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,620
What spell were you put under in the human world?

295
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,610
Three days ago,

296
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,350
we brought you back to Demon Realm.

297
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,590
When we were talking...

298
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,070
-You remained silent.
-What were you talking about?

299
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,070
My Lady, that's not important.

300
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,320
I haven't been back for a long time.

301
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,560
I need to get enough knowledge

302
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,020
of the affairs in Demon Realm as soon as possible.

303
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,570
Yes.

304
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,020
First Young Demon Lord.

305
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,430
Let me tell you what happened in Demon Realm.

306
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,060
Three years ago, after the Great War between Humans and Demons ended,

307
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,570
Demon Realm was almost destroyed completely.

308
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,780
The demon lord was critically injured.

309
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,390
So he started to practice magic in seclusion.

310
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,130
First Young Demon Lord, you went missing in the human world.

311
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,980
and we couldn't find you.

312
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,070
So Second Young Demon Lord

313
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,050
started to be the regent of Demon Realm.

314
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,260
Second Young Demon Lord is young and ambitious.

315
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,980
Although he was powerful,

316
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,240
he didn't have enough prestige.

317
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,930
He wanted to make your forces become his so much

318
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,090
that he acted recklessly.

319
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,810
To fully control Demon Realm,

320
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,990
he started to massacre others.

321
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,869
I'm one of the elders in Demon Realm

322
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,300
who are very stubborn.

323
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,819
So we're targeted by him.

324
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,760
After the Great War,

325
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,859
Demon Realm was in a mess.

326
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,930
If demons continue to kill each other,

327
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,920
I’m afraid Demon Realm will fall apart.

328
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,550
First Young Demon Lord, I hope after you come back,

329
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,510
you'll improve the situation.

330
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,490
Thank you.

331
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,970
Get up.

332
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,090
Thank you, First Young Demon Lord.

333
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:52,900
No wonder

334
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,470
Wutan Baluo tried to kill me several times.

335
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,880
So it was my younger brother who made him do that.

336
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,100
My Lady.

337
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,770
Thanks to Second Young Demon Lord's involvement,

338
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,030
we got many clues

339
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,100
to your whereabouts

340
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,120
from Wutan Baluo who flied everywhere every day.

341
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,940
Last time, you made

342
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,660
such a big scene in Mount Niuyang.

343
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,280
Not only did you fail to bring First Young Demon Lord back

344
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,040
but also got yourself seen by Wutan Baluo.

345
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,550
If you hadn't let him know your whereabouts,

346
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,560
he wouldn't have made demons in the mountain

347
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,680
assassinate First Young Demon Lord.

348
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,230
You...

349
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,370
In this regard,

350
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,140
you're just as stupid as your enemy.

351
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,740
My Lady.

352
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,270
I...

353
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,680
I'm a fish.

354
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,260
My memory is poor.

355
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,810
When I'm in the human world,

356
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,100
my memory event gets poorer.

357
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,150
Besides,

358
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,910
your husband in the human world...

359
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,300
He...

360
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,450
He just interrupted me

361
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,670
and I forgot what I was going to say.

362
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,950
Well,

363
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,370
I'm more interested

364
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,510
in the fragments.

365
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,840
My Lady.

366
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:02,980
Your Lordship.

367
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,480
My Lady.

368
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:04,790
You...

369
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,580
Have a seat first.

370
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,120
My Lady.

371
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,060
Are you okay?

372
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,860
Those fragments

373
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,640
are the broken pieces of your kylin horns.

374
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,800
I found that

375
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,030
there were ten fragments in total.

376
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,390
After the Great War,

377
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,990
they scattered in the human world.

378
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,930
Later, some demons picked them up

379
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,570
and used them to improve their magic.

380
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,720
First Young Demon Lord.

381
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,310
The kylin horns are the source of your demonic aura.

382
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,360
I don't know how you lost them.

383
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,850
But without them,

384
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,980
you would lose much of your energy.

385
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,470
The fact that you often go into a coma

386
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,700
may have something to do with it.

387
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,360
Back then,

388
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,160
when I was practicing my magic in the human world,

389
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,980
I always failed to find the right way.

390
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,560
Now I think

391
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,590
it was because my way of practicing is wrong.

392
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,600
As a demon, I shouldn't have used the human's way of practicing in the human world.

393
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,450
But I did, and inevitably, it didn't work.

394
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Fortunately, Mo...

395
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,510
They found four fragments for me

396
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,910
so I gradually recovered.

397
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,050
Then

398
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,330
why do you often faint?

399
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,070
It's probably a side effect of the fragments.

400
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,820
No matter what,

401
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,520
the fragments of kylin horns

402
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,720
must be returned to their owner.

403
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,140
While looking for you,

404
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,750
I also found one fragment.

405
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,950
I hope it can help you

406
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,590
recover soon.

407
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,440
My Lady.

408
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,670
I have one too.

409
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,870
First Young Demon Lord, take a good rest.

410
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,940
We’ll leave now.

411
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,020
Okay.

412
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,970
I'm not leaving.

413
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,980
I want to stay there and chat with Her Ladyship.

414
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,170
I'm not leaving.

415
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,970
You're a fish.

416
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,660
Why do you have so much nonsense to talk?

417
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,180
You old turtle.

418
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,190
Yan.

419
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,710
Young Master, have some water.

420
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,210
How long did I sleep?

421
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,380
Not long.

422
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,590
You've been suffering from insomnia these days.

423
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,240
You finally fell asleep.

424
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,830
When you were dreaming, you were calling...

425
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,280
Young Master, you must be hungry.

426
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,840
I'll get you some food.

427
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,280
Are you not busy at all?

428
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,690
Why did you stay here and hear me talk when I was asleep?

429
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,730
You got badly hurt by her sword.

430
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,630
If you have a nightmare,

431
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,360
you'll probably never wake up.

432
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,050
What did I say when dreaming?

433
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,610
You were calling the name of that callous girl who you still love.

434
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,200
Yan.

435
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,370
I don't understand.

436
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,630
What?

437
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,730
You always tell me

438
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,860
that not all demons are bad

439
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,830
and that not all humans are good.

440
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,510
I tried to believe that.

441
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,380
But in the end, she still chose to hurt you

442
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,240
and part from us.

443
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,820
From what I know about her,

444
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,310
I believe she has her reasons.

445
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,510
Even if she does,

446
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,300
it seems that she has never

447
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,210
thought about what will happen to you

448
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,180
after she leaves.

449
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,260
She left me and that's it.

450
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,390
I'm used to it.

451
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,550
I will get you back.

452
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,500
My Lady.

453
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,620
Are you

454
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,190
missing the man in the human world?

455
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,950
He

456
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,770
is indeed good-looking.

457
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,300
But I'm still

458
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,830
a little more handsome than him.

459
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,870
My Lady, what do you like about him?

460
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,320
He and I

461
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,740
have divorced.

462
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,700
Yes.

463
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,820
My Lady.

464
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,070
The days you spent in the human world

465
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,050
are nothing but illusions.

466
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,830
Really?

467
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,820
My Lady, you should learn from me.

468
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,580
You should be good at forgetting.

469
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,860
Then you'll feel at ease.

470
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Besides,

471
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,760
the real important memory

472
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
should be about something will be deeper and deeper.

473
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,820
For example,

474
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,690
my love for you

475
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:18,450
will never change despite great changes in the world.

476
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,430
Okay.

477
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,520
I see.

478
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:30,930
I’ll get lost myself.

479
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,400
Second Young Demon Lord.

480
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,270
First Young Demon Lord has been brought back to Demon Realm.

481
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,590
Useless!

482
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,690
How come she came back alive?

483
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,030
It's my fault.

484
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,240
It's good that she's back.

485
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,910
