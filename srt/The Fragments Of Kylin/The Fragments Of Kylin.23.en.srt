[Xiao Xuan Village]

5
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,590
Girl.

6
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,390
Try relaxing the lower part of your body.

7
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,350
Are you my son's wife?

8
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,380
You're really beautiful.

9
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,840
Greetings, Fairy Fangfei.

10
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,450
My son asked me to come back

11
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,980
to help save you.

12
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,710
Looks like he really loves you.

13
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,400
You have known my thing?

14
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,590
I've been travelling in the human world and Demon Realm for many years.

15
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,920
Your thing

16
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,690
is such a big one

17
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,550
that it's impossible that I don't know it.

18
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,340
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,560
But I didn't expect

20
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,910
the Young Lady of the demon clan

21
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,960
to be such a beautiful and graceful girl.

22
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,120
My son

23
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,840
is really lucky.

24
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,830
Fairy Fangfei, thank you for not looking down on me because of my identity.

25
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,600
I won't look down on you.

26
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,410
Demons can fly and travel underground.

27
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,630
Humans

28
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,070
can only live on the ground.

29
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,010
And there are many rules for humans.

30
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,270
I think

31
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,920
it's good thing

32
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,180
that you don't look down on Mo Yan.

33
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,990
Why are you laughing?

34
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,100
Did Yan bad-mouth me a lot in front of you?

35
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,190
No, Fairy Fangfei.

36
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,670
Actually, Mo Yan...

37
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,670
Who bad-mouthed you?

38
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,300
She is my mother.

39
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,950
-Mother.
-Mother.

40
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,000
First Aunt.

41
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,280
Don't call me that!

42
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,410
How many times have I told you?

43
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,360
Call me Miss Fang.

44
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,280
I'll call you that next time.

45
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,660
Mo Lan.

46
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,850
She is Fairy Fangfei?

47
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:51,680
Yes.

48
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,390
What's wrong?

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,740
Fairy Fangfei.

50
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,400
Can I have your autograph?

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,700
Let's go.

52
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,560
Fairy Fangfei!

53
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:58,950
Let's go.

54
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,540
I really admire you.

55
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,130
Why did you make me leave?

56
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,340
What are you doing?

57
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,670
Fairy Fangfei just got reunited with her son and her son's wife.

58
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,350
Give them some private time.

59
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,110
But she is my idol.

60
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:12,650
Let's go.

61
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,750
Mother.

62
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,010
Do you know any solution

63
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,060
to Shi Si's problem?

64
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,659
Her problem can be solved.

65
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,460
First, we need to let her absorb all the fragments.

66
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,700
How many fragments are in her body now?

67
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,440
Eight.

68
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,760
There is also one on my Wanwusu.

69
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,080
Not long ago,

70
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,720
I happened to get one too.

71
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,640
All here.

72
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,500
Go save your wife.

73
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,010
Okay.

74
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,070
Shi Si.

75
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,350
Are you okay?

76
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,590
I can feel

77
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,600
the fragments in my body have all gathered.

78
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,420
But they still failed to form a pair of complete kylins.

79
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,520
I gave you the ninth fragment.

80
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,270
My mother gave you the tenth fragment.

81
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,890
Didn't Bei Zuo say there were only ten fragments in total?

82
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,220
I suspect

83
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,690
there is sill one fragment being hidden by Demon Lord.

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,990
He is very headstrong.

85
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,750
He must be keeping

86
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,480
the decisive fragment himself.

87
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,120
He spread the fake news

88
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,190
that there are only ten fragments in total.

89
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,240
Then

90
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,800
what should we do?

91
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,570
Did that toad

92
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,360
give you a pill?

93
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,590
Yes.

94
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,910
Many years ago, I made this poisonous pill.

95
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,630
The pill contains the refined poisons of many poisonous things.

96
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,310
It's much more poisonous than the fragments in First Young Demon Lord's body.

97
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,110
When First Young Demon Lord absorbs the last fragment,

98
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,270
let her take the pill at the same time.

99
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,950
If Demon Lord really takes her body as the source of power

100
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,470
and absorbs the power of all the fragments in her body,

101
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,690
his body explode and he'll die.

102
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,990
What will happen to Shi Si?

103
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,010
She will die too.

104
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,960
He said that pill was extremely poisonous.

105
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,000
Indeed.

106
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,340
But now,

107
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,900
I need to Shi Si to take the pill.

108
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,230
If the fragments are polluted by the poison of the demonic aura,

109
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,480
we just need to get the poison out of her body.

110
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,100
But now we haven't found all the fragments.

111
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,560
The poison in the fragments

112
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,530
is perhaps not poisonous enough to kill who will absorb the power of the fragments.

113
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,280
We need to use external force to help.

114
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,000
But Doctor Toad said

115
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,500
Shi Si would die after taking it.

116
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,550
I'm here.

117
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,480
I won't let that happen.

118
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,490
Shi Si is the head of the demon clan.

119
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,910
She is the kylin.

120
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,270
Although the kylin is a kind of demons,

121
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,710
her own demonic aura

122
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,410
doesn't blend with the poison of the fragments.

123
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,520
This gives us a chance to save Shi Si.

124
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,540
Mother.

125
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,690
You mean...

126
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,300
This method

127
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,440
takes a long time.

128
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,820
We need to guard the formation together.

129
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,890
At the same time, it will consume a lot of our power.

130
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,040
During this period,

131
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,530
Demon Lord may come.

132
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,900
If he does, both of us

133
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,340
may be killed by him.

134
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,850
No.

135
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,850
I won't let you do that.

136
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,990
You can't do that.

137
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,280
Mo Yan.

138
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,490
But this is the only way now.

139
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,420
There must be another way.

140
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,610
I can't let you and Mother consume much of your power.

141
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,080
I can't let you two die for me.

142
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
My daughter-in-law.

143
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,500
You just called me Mother.

144
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,240
So you don't treat me as an outsider.

145
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,030
But

146
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,510
I can't let you take risks.

147
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,870
It seems

148
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,260
you don't know

149
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,580
how powerful I am.

150
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,040
We can do it.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,300
People call me Fairy Fangfei.

152
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,810
So there must be something in me that distinguishes me from ordinary people.

153
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,030
I can always

154
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,130
achieve a lot effortlessly

155
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,840
and turn calamities into blessings.

156
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,309
But this is very dangerous.

157
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,710
I know.

158
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,890
I think

159
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,590
you must be one of those

160
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,350
who only make sacrifices for others

161
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,890
and won't let others make sacrifices for you.

162
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,880
So this time,

163
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,690
just let Yan and I try our best to save you.

164
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,020
Shi Si.

165
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,800
Do you know

166
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,970
what the most important thing is to us now?

167
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,950
It's time.

168
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,120
If time allows,

169
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,750
I hope

170
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,470
none of us will have to take risks.

171
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,070
I'm willing to go everywhere

172
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,900
to find a perfect way to solve the problem.

173
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,800
But

174
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,310
I don't want you

175
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,590
to sacrifice your lives to save mine.

176
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,950
Don't say that.

177
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,390
I want us to live and die together.

178
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,390
Last time you blamed me

179
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,720
because I took action on my own

180
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,280
and fell into Demon Lord's trap.

181
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,560
This time, we'll take action together. Why won't you allow me to do that?

182
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,690
Stop joking.

183
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,390
Okay.

184
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,720
Shi Si.

185
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,070
Look at me.

186
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,070
I don't care how much time Demon Lord will give us.

187
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,070
What I care about is

188
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,670
how much time you still have.

189
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,710
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

190
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,060
And we won't have enough time to spend with each other if we don't do that.

191
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,680
You're the eldest son of the Mo family.

192
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,630
But you consider our love as the most important thing to you.

193
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,130
If your father knows about this,

194
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,670
he'll be furious.

195
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,260
Don't cry.

196
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,180
Shi Si.

197
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,080
Give me a chance.

198
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,510
A chance to save you.

199
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,350
A chance to grow old with you.

200
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,450
I didn't expect my son to be so sweet.

201
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,700
How is it?

202
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,020
Have you thought it through?

203
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,940
Don't be so stressed out.

204
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,850
To do that

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,560
is as easy as my daily practice.

206
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,870
I just received a letter from Doctor Toad.

207
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,290
It says Demon Lord will start a war against humans soon.

208
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,380
What?

209
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,000
Yan.

210
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,220
Do you still remember the way to kill Demon Lord?

211
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,550
Yes.

212
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,830
Four years ago,

213
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,980
I injured Demon Lord badly with Mo Ye Sword.

214
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,190
But I failed to kill him.

215
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,780
Because the sword spirit of Lingque was split into two halves.

216
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,850
So the power of the sword was limited.

217
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,400
But this time,

218
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,810
I must get back Gan Jiang Sword.

219
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,310
I'll combine the two swords

220
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,430
and kill him.

221
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,000
So we must remove the poison

222
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,750
from these fragments as soon as possible

223
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,120
so that we can fight against Demon Lord.

224
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,400
Mother.

225
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:11,970
Shi Si.

226
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,750
Shi Si.

227
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,310
The only way

228
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,830
to remove the poison from the fragments in your body

229
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,200
is that Yan and I

230
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,360
get all the fragments out of your body first.

231
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,610
But don't worry.

232
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,710
We will make sure you won't get hurt.

233
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,380
After we remove all the poison from the fragments,

234
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,850
we'll get the fragments

235
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,710
back into your body.

236
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,160
Yan.

237
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,770
Let's begin.

238
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,680
Don't knock on the door.

239
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,120
Don't interrupt them.

240
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,740
How should we give them the food?

241
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,230
Here.

242
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,640
Hold it for me first.

243
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,390
Here.

244
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,230
All right.

245
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,550
Let's go.

246
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,240
If demons come and attack us,

247
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,180
will you be afraid?

248
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,540
No.

249
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,430
In the past,

250
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,460
I never thought

251
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,630
that one day

252
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,860
I would start to kill demons and defend justice.

253
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,040
In the past, I only tried to escape responsibility.

254
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,070
So I just left home.

255
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,190
However,

256
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,800
after all that,

257
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,530
I've realized

258
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,100
that there is something I can do in the world.

259
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,110
I didn't expect...

260
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,440
What?

261
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,510
I didn't expect that I would know

262
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,430
how it feels to love someone.

263
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,300
Should I be shy?

264
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,020
We know each other so well.

265
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,560
I don't need you to pretend to be shy.

266
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,480
You...

267
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,040
What kind of person am I in your eyes?

268
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,840
In my eyes, you're a bossy and unreasonable young lady from a rich family.

269
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,670
And you're moody and arrogant

270
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,970
and you know nothing about how to do domestic chores.

271
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,500
Let go of me.

272
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,670
But I love you.

273
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,670
Our enemies are coming soon.

274
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,630
How come you are different from who you used to be now?

275
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,010
Because our enemies are coming to us,

276
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,190
I could really know what my heart wants.

277
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,250
It's hard to predict

278
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,060
whether we'll win the war.

279
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,460
I don't want to have any regrets.

280
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,040
We will win.

281
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,270
Yes.

282
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,650
Lan Jia.

283
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,000
I'll guard them three in Xiao Xuan Village.

284
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,160
You go to the back of the mountain

285
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,780
and see if there's any trace of demons.

286
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,280
Okay, Brother Mo Lan.

287
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,460
I'll go.

288
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,120
What's wrong?

289
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,690
I've figured it how to expand the Mirror Barrier.

290
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,960
Stop jumping.

291
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,370
How much can it be expanded this time?

292
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,470
Last time,

293
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,470
the barrier could only shield you and me.

294
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,520
I promise,

295
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,300
this time,

296
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,860
the whole Xiao Xuan Village can be shielded by the barrier.

297
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,040
Let me show you if you don't believe me.

298
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,080
I believe you.

299
00:18:59,370 --> 00:18:59,880
But

300
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,070
if we make the barrier shield the whole Xiao Xuan Village,

301
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,470
it will consume too much of your power.

302
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,440
I'm afraid the barrier won't last long.

303
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,560
I haven't taken that

304
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,180
into account.

305
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,110
You fool.

306
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,800
Here.

307
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,680
Well.

308
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,170
The most important thing now

309
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,400
is to ensure that they three

310
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,700
won't be interrupted when they're using the magic.

311
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,080
If the barrier is used to shield only them three,

312
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,170
the barrier

313
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,440
will last longer.

314
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,060
Right.

315
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,590
Then

316
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,340
let me give it a try.

317
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:25,990
Okay.

318
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,830
Yan.

319
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,930
Can I come in?

320
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,540
Yes.

321
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,000
Yan.

322
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,230
Mo Yan.

323
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,500
I'll use the Mirror Barrier to shield you.

324
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,610
Then

325
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,970
no one is able to interrupt you.

326
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,460
Thank you.

327
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,500
You stay in the barrier too.

328
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,740
Don't go out.

329
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,920
Mo Lan.

330
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,530
I want to stay with you.

331
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,790
I've been learning attacking magic.

332
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,400
I can protect myself.

333
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,000
No.

334
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,080
It's the most critical moment for them three now.

335
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,900
If the barrier

336
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,670
can't protect them,

337
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,230
what we did

338
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,780
will be in vain.

339
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,770
Mo Lan.

340
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,190
You protect them

341
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,950
and I protect you.

342
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,180
We'll be fine,

343
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:02,870
right?

344
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,620
Don't worry.

345
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,600
We will all be fine.

346
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,800
What do you mean

347
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,240
by "missing"?

348
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,230
I sent Wutan Baluo to Xiao Xuan Village to investigate.

349
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,140
Others are all there.

350
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,940
But only Shi Si and Mo Yan are not.

351
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,150
Then what are you doing here?

352
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,500
Waiting for me to find them?

353
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,430
I dare not.

354
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,390
There are three days left for you.

355
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,180
If you can't find them...

356
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,030
I will definitely find them.

357
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,580
You may leave.

358
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,230
Yes.

359
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,200
Let's go.

360
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,070
He's an old jerk!

361
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,070
How could he boss me around as soon as he came back?

362
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,420
What does he think I am?

363
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,510
He asked me to take charge of Demon Realm when he was away.

364
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,560
As soon as he came back, he made me his slave.

365
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,840
He even asked me to live in this stupid Lichan Palace.

366
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,120
Ridiculous.

367
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,570
Ridiculous!

368
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,880
How come you

369
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,010
are regarded as the best assassin in Demon Realm?

370
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,720
You couldn't even find them for me!

371
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,490
And you, Xuanyuan Sheng.

372
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,800
You're such a useless loser!

373
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,870
Calm down, Second Young Demon Lord.

374
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,080
Something just occurred to me.

375
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,630
Let me finish.

376
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,520
Second Young Demon Lord.

377
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,590
Think well before you speak.

378
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,470
Second Young Demon Lord.

379
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,130
I've figured it out

380
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,840
why Wutan Baluo failed to find them.

381
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,830
The Xuanyuan family

382
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,810
has a heirloom

383
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,040
that can be used

384
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,900
to create a barrier

385
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,100
to hide people's traces.

386
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,100
But Yu hasn't learned how to use magic since childhood.

387
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,950
Logically speaking, it's impossible

388
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,950
for her to learn to use that heirloom in a short time.

389
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,070
This explains

390
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,550
how First Young Demon Lord

391
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,510
and Mo Yan disappeared

392
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,730
all of a sudden last time.

393
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,120
Yu

394
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,760
is able to create a passage now.

395
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,400
Could it be

396
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,640
that she started practicing the secret technique long ago?

397
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,020
Cut the crap.

398
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,180
Just tell me

399
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,320
whether you can break that barrier.

400
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,260
This heirloom has been

401
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,400
passed down from generation to generation from the main family of the Xuanyuan family.

402
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,280
It’s a magical mirror.

403
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,450
It's hard to break the barrier made by the mirror from outside.

404
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,020
Unless...

405
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,620
Unless we can

406
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,150
find the exact position the mirror

407
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,780
which is the eye of formation.

408
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,450
I think

409
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,340
the eye of formation must be near Yu.

410
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,620
It's in Xiao Xuan Village.

411
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,740
Let's

412
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,710
attack Xiao Xuan Village first

413
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,180
and see what to do next.

414
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,160
I hope your method will work.

415
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,250
If we fail again,

416
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,840
we three will be doomed.

417
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:44,960
Got it?

418
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:47,690
Yes.

419
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,390
Yes.

420
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,730
Get lost!

421
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,040
Elder Bei Zuo.

422
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,420
How is the situation in the east?

423
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,590
Nothing unusual.

424
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,560
From now on,

425
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,160
the duration of a mountain patrol

426
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,810
will be shortened to two hours each time.

427
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,670
Okay.

428
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,030
Shi Si.

429
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,150
They didn't eat today.

430
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,200
When will they stop?

431
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,940
Will the demons suddenly...

432
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,280
No.

433
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,680
Don't say unlucky words.

434
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,290
What should we about the food?

435
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,160
Leave it here.

436
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,720
They may eat it later.

437
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,280
Go!

438
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,480
Yan.

439
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,890
Hang in there.

440
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,110
There's only one fragment left.
