[Episode 7]

4
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,350
Yan.

5
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,220
Are you okay?

6
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,550
Just some minor injuries.

7
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,360
Nothing serious.

8
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm asking about you.

9
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:00,550
Me?

10
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,060
I didn't get hit.

11
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,150
Regarding her identity,

12
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,800
what do you think?

13
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,900
Actually, I knew

14
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,470
she might not be the genuine Xuanyuan Yu.

15
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,120
I also find it strange.

16
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,200
You see.

17
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,300
Why had she stayed in the Mo's Mansion for so long,

18
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,520
but the Xuanyuan family never showed up?

19
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,579
At first, I thought

20
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,860
it was because the two families hadn't been in touch for a few years.

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,780
But quite a while ago,

22
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:29,460
I heard that First Uncle

23
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,380
went to the Xuanyuan's Mansion to visit their chief.

24
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,460
It is said that

25
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,579
he was injured in the war three years ago

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,990
and hasn't recovered yet,

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,090
even after a long time.

28
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,210
Well, he was attacked by Shuo Tian.

29
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,290
The poisonous demonic aura

30
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,700
has not been completely purified.

31
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,100
I guess

32
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,090
he would suffer it for the rest of his life.

33
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,260
But

34
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,740
we've been married for quite some time.

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,210
Especially,

36
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,250
everyone knows about the scandal

37
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,680
between Yu and Sikong.

38
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,150
Yet her parents showed no interest in it.

39
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,110
As you said,

40
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,080
it's unreasonable.

41
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,730
I guess

42
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,320
they are so indifferent

43
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,380
because she's not their biological daughter.

44
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,190
There's one more thing

45
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,090
that's a little fishy.

46
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,970
When I snooped at the Xuanyuan's Mansion,

47
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,070
I heard that

48
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,380
they had dismissed many servants in the past three years.

49
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,050
It should be due to financial constraints.

50
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,210
I found one of the nannies.

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,750
She left Xuanyuan's Mansion after the wedding.

52
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,050
But she said

53
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,150
all the ladies had left,

54
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,070
and she had no one to serve.

55
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,210
Ladies?

56
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,640
Yes.

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
Speaking of which,

58
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,590
when I saw them,

59
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,880
they didn't look like lovers who reunited after a long time.

60
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,480
It was more like

61
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,580
a confrontation.

62
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,590
A confrontation?

63
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,280
Yes.

64
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,240
It was a bit tense

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,090
between them.

66
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,190
Yu

67
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,700
seemed to be questioning Sikong.

68
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,550
Yan.

69
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,250
Are you out of your mind?

70
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,250
It sounds like your self-consolation.

71
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,800
What?

72
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,180
[Cheating]

73
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:41,950
[Cheating]

74
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:44,690
All right.

75
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,770
Cut it out.

76
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,730
If she's not Xuanyuan Yu,

77
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,850
what are you going to do?

78
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,240
How similar do you think

79
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,850
she's to the spunky girl

80
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,800
who confessed her love

81
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,909
in public?

82
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,940
I don't know about that.

83
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,030
However, according to my observation,

84
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,830
Young Madam is usually calm and quiet.

85
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,390
Although

86
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,320
sometimes she is something of an enigma,

87
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,370
she

88
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,050
isn't like such an outgoing person.

89
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,770
Exactly.

90
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,360
What I like

91
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,800
is what she usually looks like.

92
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,270
Whether she is Xuanyuan Yu or not,

93
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,370
to me,

94
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,390
it doesn't matter.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,170
But there are many mysteries about her.

96
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,910
Maybe

97
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,010
they are related to the demons.

98
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,860
I have a plan

99
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,500
to deal with that.

100
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:42,790
Father.

101
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,830
That's what happened.

102
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,970
Since someone in the family can't tolerate her,

103
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,620
please allow me

104
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,130
to take her to Xiao Xuan Village for a while to recuperate.

105
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,380
Yan.

106
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,790
If you leave,

107
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,710
who will take care of the Mo family?

108
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,120
As you know,

109
00:05:59,190 --> 00:05:59,890
recently,

110
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,410
the demon clan has been in turmoil lately.

111
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,390
You have to shoulder responsibility for the Mo family.

112
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,810
Besides,

113
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,810
your aunt

114
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,310
did that for your sake.

115
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,160
Father,

116
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,720
only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches.

117
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,830
I haven't felt disgraced yet.

118
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,160
Aunt was indeed nosy

119
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,450
when she simply meddled in my business.

120
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,280
If I think

121
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,410
what Aunt has done

122
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,030
has disgraced the Mo family and you

123
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,780
and taught her a lesson for your sake,

124
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,870
do you think

125
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,500
it makes sense as well?

126
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,480
Of course not.

127
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,430
I could have

128
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,600
put her in her place

129
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,280
to defend my wife.

130
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,380
But for your sake,

131
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,780
I didn't repeat her mistake.

132
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,330
Mo Yan.

133
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,320
What are you talking about?

134
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,980
Even though I don't think of her as a mother,

135
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,340
I still treat her as an elder.

136
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,570
I respect her,

137
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,060
but she doesn't respect me.

138
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,790
From now on,

139
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,500
I will take back my respect.

140
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,850
If she crosses the line again,

141
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,270
I will not tolerate her.

142
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,110
How dare you!

143
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,560
Get out!

144
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,830
Go to your mother's Xiao Xuan Village!

145
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,000
Yan.

146
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,050
You've really pissed First Uncle off.

147
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,230
I heard his voice cracked outside.

148
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,990
I was polite enough.

149
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,090
Lady Liu is getting more arrogant

150
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,380
just because he allows Lady Liu to do whatever she wants.

151
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,390
He's so fatuous

152
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,140
and pedantic.

153
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,650
No wonder my mother couldn't stay here.

154
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,630
At least First Uncle didn't raise Lady Liu to the status of wife.

155
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,560
My father is not good at playing games, even with good cards.

156
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,220
His act is arduous but fruitless.

157
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,070
He wants to save a place

158
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,180
for my mother.

159
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,790
But

160
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,800
he can't pocket his pride.

161
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,270
Everyone knows what Lady Liu

162
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,660
is trying to do

163
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,080
except my father.

164
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,730
The mansion is always in turmoil.

165
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,550
I think

166
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,350
my father and Lady Liu

167
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,420
deserve all the credit.

168
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,580
Now, Young Madam joined the battle

169
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,690
and fought with Lady Liu

170
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,780
neck and neck.

171
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,800
To be honest,

172
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,270
it's indeed more interesting.

173
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,010
Brother.

174
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,160
Yan.

175
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,350
You're so arrogant

176
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,590
that you throw your weight around.

177
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,200
You still have time to scold him?

178
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,020
Your father will teach you a lesson later.

179
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,299
Hurry up.

180
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,920
Let's depart tomorrow.

181
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,810
Tell Mo Yu to pack some things.

182
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,240
Yan.

183
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,180
Are you sure you can find out her identity

184
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,890
after you go to Xiao Xuan Village?

185
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,770
If she is related to that demon,

186
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,510
her connection with the fragments

187
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,730
will be more than that.

188
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,480
After hearing what Wolf King said,

189
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,910
I suspected

190
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,910
the fragments were

191
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,810
more than two pieces.

192
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,220
That's right.

193
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,300
I've also been investigating this matter lately.

194
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,130
It seems that many demons

195
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,890
are looking for the fragments.

196
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,340
Xiao Xuan Village is located at Mount Niuyang.

197
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,790
It's one of the origins of the demon clan.

198
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,030
Recently, the demons have been acting abnormally.

199
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,090
We should look into it, no matter what.

200
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,020
Maybe

201
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,820
we may discover something new.

202
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,520
What are you worried about?

203
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,110
Nothing.

204
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,280
Yan.

205
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,270
You can be softhearted,

206
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,050
but I

207
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,670
won't go easy on her.

208
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,650
Honey.

209
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,360
Honey, come and have a look.

210
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:19,940
Come here.

211
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
Sit down.

212
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,450
Look.

213
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,950
Is this magic?

214
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,540
Yes.

215
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,460
Somehow,

216
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,300
I woke up in the morning and suddenly got it.

217
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,330
Could it be your meridians were unblocked

218
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,530
after being beaten yesterday?

219
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,790
I think so too.

220
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,590
I should have...

221
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,330
What?

222
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,460
You should have begged for a beating earlier?

223
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,630
With your talent,

224
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,140
it's not appropriate to say you're obsessed with martial arts.

225
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,170
Why are you so stubborn?

226
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,370
I miss it so much.

227
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,440
Aren't you going to ask me what I miss?

228
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,830
No.

229
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,430
I don't want to know about it.

230
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,650
You don't have to tell me.

231
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,960
We haven't talked for half a month.

232
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,380
Didn't I say

233
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,290
there was no need to tell me?

234
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,540
You haven't yelled at me for a long time too.

235
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,430
When did I yell at you?

236
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,260
Now.

237
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,730
You are very fierce now.

238
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,010
Then why are you laughing?

239
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,510
I laugh when I want to.

240
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,530
This woman

241
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,250
is still the same as before.

242
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,290
Didn't you tell me

243
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,010
not to trust you anymore?

244
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,750
I've told you everything.

245
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,850
If you don't follow what I say,

246
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,920
I have no choice either.

247
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,500
What do you mean?

248
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,360
Every time I was in danger,

249
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,040
you would be the first to save me.

250
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,780
I was just passing by.

251
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,340
So I regret it.

252
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,820
I take back what I said.

253
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,390
Don't disbelieve me,

254
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,000
and don't ignore me, okay?

255
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,970
I'm really sorry

256
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,430
for what happened yesterday.

257
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,640
Only sorry?

258
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,290
What else do you want to hear?

259
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,140
I can explain what happened to Sikong Shaoyun...

260
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,060
That's not important.

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,080
More importantly,

262
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,600
I want to know

263
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,020
who you are

264
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,530
if you are not Xuanyuan Yu.

265
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,270
I...

266
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,360
Don't tell me you have forgotten it.

267
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,670
Yesterday, I heard

268
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,850
what you said clearly

269
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,490
when I sent you back to the room.

270
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,160
Then...

271
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,270
Tell me that

272
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,290
you married me,

273
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,410
not anyone else.

274
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,220
But I have to know

275
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,000
whom I married.

276
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,370
I... I can't tell you.

277
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,600
You can't tell me.

278
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,420
You don't want to lie to me either.

279
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,960
Is that what you mean?

280
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,480
Even if you don't tell me,

281
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,320
I have my way of finding out.

282
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,910
Pack up first.

283
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,030
Tomorrow,

284
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,600
I'll take you to a villa to recuperate for a while.

285
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,670
It's full of spiritual energy there.

286
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,440
It would be very helpful for your cultivation.

287
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:17,980
Really?

288
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:18,830
No.

289
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,330
Just kidding.

290
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,600
Thank you, Mo Yan.

291
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,780
Listen.

292
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,220
Before I know who you are,

293
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,410
we shall keep a distance.

294
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,880
Got it?

295
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,180
Yes.

296
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,840
Are you afraid that I'll hurt you?

297
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,940
I'm not capable of doing so.

298
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,360
Even if you squeeze me dry,

299
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,070
my power

300
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,180
can't fill a glass.

301
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,990
Go pack up.

302
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,840
Young Master Yan.

303
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,230
Yes.

304
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:27,990
My Lady.

305
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,040
My Lady.

306
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,810
My Lady.

307
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,600
What are you laughing at?

308
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,330
My Lady,

309
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,800
you're amazing!

310
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,440
Yan.

311
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:53,710
What's the matter?

312
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,540
Why are you so happy?

313
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,350
How can she pretend like

314
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,300
nothing happened?

315
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,570
Young Madam?

316
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,090
Have you reconciled?

317
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,380
I haven't agreed to reconcile yet.

318
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,720
How could she do that to me?

319
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,120
What?

320
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Speaking of which,

321
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,920
the last time I saw you so happy

322
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,750
was when First Aunt praised you for your improvement in magic skills.

323
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,360
It's different.

324
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,040
My mother only comes back once every three years.

325
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:30,890
You're right.

326
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,060
You haven't spoken to Young Madam for only half a month,

327
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,020
but you are so happy

328
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,280
to get reconciled today.

329
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,190
Yan.

330
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,870
Don't blame me for throwing cold water on you.

331
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,510
It's just that we still don't know

332
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,110
her relationship with the demon clan.

333
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,530
You should

334
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,590
be less sincere to her.

335
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,160
Don't get yourself hurt in the end.

336
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,230
Don't worry.

337
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,190
I know what to do.

338
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,790
By the way,

339
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,720
where is the person I asked you to find?

340
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,160
She will arrive tomorrow.

341
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,170
Young Madam Yu.

342
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,560
Yes.

343
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:15,829
Honey.

344
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,300
Why did you call me here?

345
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,190
Aren't we leaving soon?

346
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,160
My Lady.

347
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,430
Do you

348
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,360
know her?

349
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,080
Of course I do.

350
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,730
What brings Aunt Zhang here today?

351
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,020
Master and Madam asked me to visit you.

352
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,780
How have you been, My Lady?

353
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,480
Of course I'm fine.

354
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,540
My husband is taking me to recuperate outside the city.

355
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,810
I also heard about it,

356
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,140
so I brought you

357
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,400
your favorite desserts from the mansion.

358
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,580
They are almond pastries,

359
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,340
osmanthus cakes,

360
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,590
and your favorite

361
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,190
glutinous balls in sweet rice wine.

362
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,340
Thank you, Aunt Zhang.

363
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,210
I didn't expect the two ladies from the Xuanyuan family

364
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,470
would like the same food.

365
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,600
You are indeed sisters.

366
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,950
Even the taste is the same.

367
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,410
It seems that you know clearly

368
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,640
about my sister.

369
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,080
I guess you are

370
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,420
interested in her very much.

371
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:53,820
After you.

372
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,750
Okay.

373
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,150
Goodbye.

374
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,480
What?

375
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,850
Are you going to admit that Xuanyuan Yu is someone else?

376
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,900
Haven't you already made your own judgment?

377
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,600
How long do you plan to

378
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,460
talk in riddles?

379
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,230
I can only promise that

380
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,960
I won't lie to you anymore.

381
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,810
Okay.

382
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,550
Remember what you said.

383
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,870
Young Master.

384
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,780
Young Master.

385
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,680
Everything is ready.

386
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,430
We can go now.

387
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:36,880
Okay.

388
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,390
Got it.

389
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,330
Aunt Zhang

390
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,820
left Xuanyuan's Mansion

391
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,350
after you got married.

392
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,670
This...

393
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,070
I bought it.

394
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,530
Take it so that we can have some in the journey.

395
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,440
[Xiao Xuan Village]

396
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,990
We're finally here.

397
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,200
I'm exhausted.

398
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,910
The view here is nice.

399
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,510
Young Master,

400
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,180
Xiaohe and I will clean up the room first.

401
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:47,650
Go ahead.

402
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,420
Yes.

403
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,240
Is the view beautiful?

404
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,110
Yes.

405
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,780
It's beautiful.

406
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,230
This villa belonged to the Ye family back then,

407
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,970
and it was one of my mother's dowries.

408
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,460
Then she left it to me.

409
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:02,950
When I was young,

410
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,620
my mother often brought me here for cultivation.

411
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,350
Really?

412
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:05,760
Yes.

413
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,660
This place is so beautiful.

414
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,140
But

415
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,880
the weather is not good today.

416
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,330
It's a little foggy.

417
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,750
I can't see faraway places clearly.

418
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,910
Don't look at me but enjoy the scenery.

419
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,290
Don't ever say you're looking at me because you want to.

420
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,800
I want to learn

421
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,070
the magic just now.

422
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,700
I want to learn it.

423
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,080
Teach me.

424
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,000
It's really springtime now.

425
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,590
Even the peacock spreads its bright plumage.

426
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,750
Okay or not?

427
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,540
Teach me.

428
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,510
Okay, I'll teach you.

429
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,070
Hurry up.

430
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,560
Come on.

431
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,060
Honey.

432
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,430
You're still up?

433
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:31,810
Mo Yan.

434
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,170
Yes?

435
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,370
Come and take a look.

436
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,390
Why can't I master

437
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,690
the Cloud Arrest?

438
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,300
Even if I were a teacher,

439
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,130
it's time for a break.

440
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:40,960
Freeze.

441
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,110
You're really frozen.

442
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,240
It seems that I'm quite talented

443
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,830
at learning magic.

444
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,610
Let me tell...

445
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:19,990
Freeze.

446
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,690
You lied to me.

447
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,960
Now we're even.

448
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,100
Can you move?

449
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,930
No.

450
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,060
Do you want to be unfrozen?

451
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,700
Yes.

452
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,860
Stop practicing tonight,

453
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,460
then I'll set you free.

454
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,170
Deal?

455
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,460
Deal.

456
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,120
What's wrong?

457
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,660
You don't teach me magic.

458
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,820
Please.

459
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,980
Please teach me again.

460
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,720
I promise

461
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,030
I'll be able to master it soon.

462
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,860
Are you getting up or not?

463
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,130
No.

464
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,660
I'm going to leave if you don't get up.

465
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,490
Go.

466
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,430
I'm really leaving.

467
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:23,860
Okay.

468
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,050
Let's go to bed.

469
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,200
Fine,

470
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,860
go to bed then.

471
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,700
I...

472
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,930
I...

473
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,190
I still have things to do.

474
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,450
You...

475
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,200
Where are you going?

476
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,670
Patrol the mountain.

477
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,300
Didn't you say

478
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,140
even teachers deserve a break?

479
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,760
Never mind.

480
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,180
Bravo, Yan.

481
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,740
With your swordsmanship,

482
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,140
I guess

483
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,020
no one from the demon clan would be injured.

484
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,780
Yan.

485
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,030
Are you really in love with her?

486
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,160
Can't I?

487
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,100
Really?

488
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,050
What do you mean?

489
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,340
You don't even know who she is.

490
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,240
I have my own plan.

491
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,650
You're laughing at me now.

492
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,240
You will pay for it sooner or later.

493
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,590
Ridiculous.

494
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,470
I won't lose my mind for a woman.

495
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,350
Who is losing his mind?

496
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,720
What do you think?

497
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,450
Go to sleep.

498
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,080
Yan.

499
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
What's your plan?

500
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,160
I have no plan.

501
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,330
Then why are we here?

502
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,300
We are here

503
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,600
to verify her identity.

504
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,090
How?

505
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,830
By finding the demon and the fragments.

506
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,090
It would take a very long time.

507
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,630
Here he is.

508
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,660
What happened?

509
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,190
I feel dizzy,

510
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,080
just like I'm going to float.

511
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,430
Be careful.

512
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,550
This might be some kind of illusion.

513
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,160
It'd make people lose their fighting awareness.

514
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,080
It's no use.

515
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,330
My illusion is not created by demonic aura.

516
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,040
It can't be dispersed.

517
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,000
Wind Breaking.

518
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,990
Break!

519
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,600
What kind of illusion is this?

520
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,020
We just broke it effortlessly.

521
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,630
How boring.

522
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,660
Who is he?

523
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,560
Do you know him?

524
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,610
How would I know him?

525
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,560
Who is this?

526
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,880
Is it a man or a woman?

527
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,800
Go ask.

528
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,240
You go.

529
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,140
Ask him.

530
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:47,850
Go.

531
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,550
Who are you?

532
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,330
My name is Mo Jialuo.

533
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:59,990
My true form is a Kunpeng from Beiming.

534
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,730
I specialize in...

535
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,940
Creating illusions.

536
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,290
I specialize in creating illusions.

537
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,910
I'm an illusion master in the Demon Realm.

538
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:22,570
You can also call me a magician.

539
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,540
I came here

540
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,110
to...

541
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,370
to...

542
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,490
to...

543
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,690
Find the one you love.

544
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,600
Find the one I love.

545
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,570
Are you performing opera here?

546
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,410
Can you just spit it out?

547
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,330
You...

548
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,030
So rude.

549
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,550
Honey.

550
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,490
This man

551
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,650
looks strange.

552
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,070
My Lady.
