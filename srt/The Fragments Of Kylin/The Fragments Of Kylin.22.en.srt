[Episode 22]

4
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,160
Thank you very much

5
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,520
for just now.

6
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,380
If there's nothing else, you may go back.

7
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,950
You almost fainted.

8
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,250
I'm worried about you.

9
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,700
I'm fine.

10
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,870
I just

11
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,820
lost my balance.

12
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,070
Why are you so stubborn?

13
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,440
Is it so hard to be honest with me?

14
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,940
Yes, it is.

15
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,950
After all, we are husband and wife.

16
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,090
You don't have to treat me as an outsider, do you?

17
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,920
Should I see you sacrifice your life for me

18
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,690
instead of treating

19
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,079
you as an outsider?

20
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,630
Are you saying you're doing this for my own good?

21
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,760
I dare not.

22
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,290
I just can't bear the weight of a human life.

23
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,870
Shi Si,

24
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,480
we've been married for a year.

25
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,710
We have had intimate moments together

26
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,260
and also faced death side by side.

27
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,920
I just wanted to save your life

28
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,070
and fight for a chance to grow old with you.

29
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,480
Is that

30
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,310
so unforgivable to you?

31
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,720
You want me to stay alive.

32
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,310
I also want you to stay alive.

33
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,870
Wasn't the atmosphere just now quite good?

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,440
A slight difference

35
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,340
can lead to a huge loss.

36
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,630
I really can't listen to this anymore.

37
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,300
Now it's time for memories.

38
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,380

118
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,270
Mo Yan,

119
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,230
actually, when we parted last time,

120
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,050
I originally wanted to keep it from you

121
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,330
and handle everything alone.

122
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,510
I didn't want to drag you into the conflict.

123
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,330
I thought,

124
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,980
if there was

125
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,350
still time left by then,

126
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,940
I would definitely find you.

127
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,510
Wouldn't I feel sad

128
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,670
if you left?

129
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,310
Actually, these days,

130
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,980
I did a lot of thinking.

131
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,530
I've been thinking,

132
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,240
if I keep staying with you,

133
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,970
would I end up harming you?

134
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,500
I never expected

135
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,970
you would come to the Demon Realm to find me.

136
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,070
I never imagined

137
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,220
we would reunite.

138
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,220
But by walking through this time again with you,

139
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,400
I realized

140
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,840
I can't control my feelings at all.

141
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,789
Actually...

142
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,370
Actually, after I left you and returned to the Demon Realm,

143
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,960
I missed you deeply

144
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,340
every day and night.

145
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,540
Mo Yan,

146
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,040
now, for me,

147
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,920
things like pretending to part with you

148
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,600
and counting down to death

149
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,470
are no longer important.

150
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,660
The most important thing is,

151
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,400
at this moment,

152
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,680
I am still alive,

153
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,380
and I still want to be with you.

154
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,900
Mo Yan, you must promise me

155
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,680
not to venture alone again,

156
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,160
and to make decisions together with me in everything, okay?

157
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,630
Okay.

158
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,260
I promise you.

159
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,730
But right now, the most important thing

160
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,210
is to remove the restriction in your body.

161
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,890
I think

162
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,680
perhaps we can seek help from a Grandmaster.

163
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,830
For example...

164
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,920
-Your mother!
-My mother.

165
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,680
That's what I think.

166
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,290
So, I plan to take you back to Xiao Xuan Village.

167
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,060
Four years ago,

168
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,640
I trusted the Demon Lord blindly

169
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,640
and followed him onto the battlefield.

170
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,300
I ended up

171
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,970
becoming an invalid with no memories.

172
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,050
But later,

173
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,740
I met you.

174
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,630
You, Mo Yan,

175
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,910
made me experience the warmth of the human world.

176
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,660
It was also you

177
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,460
who made me abandon the idea that

178
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,630
humans and demons are inherently opposed and cannot coexist.

179
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,760
So,

180
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,890
I will no longer fight meaningless battles.

181
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,130
I want to personally bring an end to all of this.

182
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,200
Honey,

183
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,580
I will face

184
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,350
all of this with you.

185
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,390
Okay.

186
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,970
Not bad!

187
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,210
Of course.

188
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,510
I'm going back to my room.

189
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,620
You two...

190
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,810
continue.

191
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,650
The show is over.

192
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,840
It's time to sleep.

193
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,050
Mo Yan has taken over my room.

194
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,510
Where should I sleep then?

195
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,630
Sorry.

196
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,050
The guest rooms are fully booked.

197
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,230
Fully booked?

198
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,990
How come?

199
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,610
The guest rooms are fully booked.

200
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,660
There's nothing I can do.

201
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,890
Well...

202
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,230
How about this?

203
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,630
I'll stay with Mo Jialuo.

204
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,460
I'll leave this room

205
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,170
to you.

206
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,480
Mo Lan,

207
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,270
I...

208
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,820
don't dare stay alone.

209
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,800
Last time, Mo Dongling...

210
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,570
Guys,

211
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,960
when you're away from home,

212
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,380
you can't be too picky.

213
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,910
You two

214
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,000
look quite compatible.

215
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,800
How about

216
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,910
you make do for one night?

217
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,710
What are you talking about?

218
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,190
Shut up.

219
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,910
Then I'll sleep on the floor.

220
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,300
Why were these two

221
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,100
performing in front of me?

222
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,700
They are living together now, aren't they?

223
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,540
Are you asleep?

224
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,860
Yes.

225
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,250
You're lying.

226
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,040
What's up?

227
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,300
I can't fall asleep.

228
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,100
Come up with a solution yourself.

229
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,260
How can you be like this?

230
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,260
Do you expect me

231
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,120
to tell you a story?

232
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,320
Sure.

233
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,850
I'd like it.

234
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,790
Young Lady,

235
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,060
do you know what the situation is right now?

236
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,720
What is it?

237
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,020
Where are we?

238
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,210
In the guest room.

239
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,370
I'm asking where you're lying.

240
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,340
You're lying on the bed.

241
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,360
This joke is funny.

242
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,340
What are you doing?

243
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,180
Now you are nervous.

244
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,280
A man and a woman,

245
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,090
alone in a room,

246
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,390
in the dark night,

247
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,180
sharing a bed.

248
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,140
Do you get it now?

249
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,800
Are you trying to scare me?

250
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:53,470
You...

251
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:53,950
You...

252
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,610
You wouldn't do that.

253
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,530
What's wrong?

254
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,890
What do you mean?

255
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,940
Why did you stop?

256
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,150
You...

257
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,540
During the day,

258
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,820
on the boat,

259
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,270
it felt quite good.

260
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,220
Yu,

261
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,410
are you in there?

262
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,930
Yu,

263
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,140
what happened?

264
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,640
Yu, open the door!

265
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,010
Coming!

266
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:10,990
Shi Si,

267
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,470
good morning.

268
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,060
Good morning.

269
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,190
You just...

270
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,190
woke up?

271
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,520
Why do you look so pale?

272
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,350
I'm sorry,

273
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:24,890
Yu.

274
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,590
I changed rooms yesterday

275
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,670
without telling you.

276
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,380
Was it because of changing rooms

277
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,260
that you

278
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,190
didn't sleep well,

279
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:31,430
so...

280
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,990
No, no!

281
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,310
It's fine.

282
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,180
As long as you two made up.

283
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,840
How did you know

284
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,190
we made up?

285
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:47,940
By the way,

286
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,280
what was the noise in your room just now?

287
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,360
There was no noise.

288
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,830
There clearly was noise just now.

289
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,990
You must have misheard.

290
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:56,890
How could I mishear?

291
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,640
Good morning.

292
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,819
Lan,

293
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,490
where's your hand guard?

294
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,170
I forgot to wear it.

295
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,630
Where is your broadsword?

296
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,030
I forgot it too.

297
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,839
Mo Jialuo, what's wrong with you?

298
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,829
Nothing.

299
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,380
Why is everyone acting weird?

300
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,520
It's nothing.

301
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,350
It's just that this morning,

302
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,100
a harasser

303
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,580
climbed through my window...

304
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,030
Alright.

305
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,380
Let's go eat first.

306
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,680
Let's go.

307
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,920
What a loser!

308
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,110
I trusted the Demon Realm to you,

309
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,230
and this is what you've made of it.

310
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,080
As fellow kylins,

311
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,490
your sister's abilities far surpass yours.

312
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,910
Even in the development of kylin's horns,

313
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,590
you are inferior to her.

314
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,230
Tell me,

315
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,330
what use are you to me?

316
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,840
It has been four years since the Great War.

317
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,690
Through cultivation,

318
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,070
I have surpassed my former peak state!

319
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,810
Congratulations, Demon Lord!

320
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,500
Congratulations, Demon Lord!

321
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,490
There will eventually be a war between the human race and the demon clan.

322
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,680
We will never be the dogs of the human race,

323
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,830
picking up their scraps!

324
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,360
The day when the resources of the Demon Realm are exhausted is approaching.

325
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,640
For survival,

326
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,400
the demon clan must strike.

327
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,620
The demon clan

328
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,550
must triumph!

329
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,030
For survival!

330
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,470
For triumph!

331
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,030
For survival!

332
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,350
For triumph!

333
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,870
For survival!

334
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,310
For triumph!

335
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,880
For survival!

336
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,260
For triumph!

337
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,930
For survival!

338
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,310
For triumph!

339
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,080
For survival!

340
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,770
For triumph!

341
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,360
[Xiao Xuan Village]

342
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,270
Don't worry.

343
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,710
My Lady!

344
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,670
Xiaohe?

345
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,870
Xiaohe,

346
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,780
you're a grown-up. Don't cry.

347
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,060
Xiaohe,

348
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,050
why are you here?

349
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,360
Didn't we tell you

350
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,240
to go back with Mo Yu

351
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,500
when we were going to the Demon Realm to find Shi Si?

352
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,180
My Ladies,

353
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,350
it was Young Master Yan who wrote us a letter asking us to come.

354
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:24,890
Besides,

355
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,550
I haven't seen you for a long time.

356
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,190
Can't I cry a little?

357
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,500
Yes, you can.

358
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,050
How have you been, My Ladies?

359
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,280
Young Master!

360
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:33,910
Not bad.

361
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,590
Young Master!

362
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,430
-Young...
-Stop.

363
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,250
Just talk.

364
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,400
Young Master,

365
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,910
you're finally back.

366
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:43,950
What's wrong?

367
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,280
Did something happen to the Mo family again?

368
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,910
No.

369
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,950
Since Young Master Dongling came back last time,

370
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,140
he's been like a different person.

371
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,460
He no longer goes out to drink with the company of prostitutes.

372
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,810
He's been at home entertaining guests.

373
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,780
I even suspect if he's someone else in disguise.

374
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,020
Also, Young Master,

375
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,500
after receiving your letter,

376
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,870
Young Master Dongling prepared

377
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,990
money and snacks for me and Xiaohe.

378
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,510
He even arranged a carriage.

379
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,360
Let's go inside.

380
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,550
Let's go inside.

381
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,350
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

382
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:08,750
Let's go.

383
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,460
What are you looking at?

384
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,660
Look.

385
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,450
That's the spell I cast.

386
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,990
My mom and I

387
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,600
meet at Xiao Xuan Village once every three years.

388
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,270
It's still some time away,

389
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,870
but when there's a major event,

390
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,230
I use magic to notify her.

391
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,720
She'll come in seven days.

392
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,370
You only see your mom

393
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,930
once every three years?

394
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,040
I worked hard to get it.

395
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,410
She has no interest in fighting

396
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,240
for family property

397
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,690
or status.

398
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,620
After giving birth to me,

399
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,080
she went traveling around the world.

400
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,700
My father was very dissatisfied about it,

401
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,060
but there was nothing he could do.

402
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,430
She, on the other hand,

403
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,910
has been upholding justice

404
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,010
and became

405
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,970
a famous demon slayer, admired by everyone.

406
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,880
She's too busy to come see me.

407
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,030
I envy Fairy Fangfei like that.

408
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,670
Really?

409
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,390
Yes.

410
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,040
I remember when I first learned magic as a child,

411
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,760
there was a time I missed her so much

412
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,700
that I used magic to summon her.

413
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,550
Seven days later, she came

414
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,390
and asked me what happened.

415
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,030
I said I missed her too much.

416
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,180
Guess what happened next?

417
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,720
What happened?

418
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,520
She gave me a good beating

419
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,900
and told me that she hadn't even finished

420
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,430
a demon-slaying job just to come see me.

421
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,240
Fairy Fangfei is really an amazing person.

422
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,760
Last time you said

423
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,490
that you abandoned the idea

424
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,410
that humans and demons cannot coexist because of me.

425
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,230
In fact, this is what my mother taught me.

426
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,510
She told me

427
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,710
that all beings have spirits.

428
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,760
No matter in the human race or the demon clan,

429
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,480
there are good ones and bad ones.

430
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,640
One cannot generalize.

431
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,950
This is also

432
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,680
the fundamental disagreement in concepts

433
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,830
between her and my father.

434
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,130
No wonder Fairy Fangfei

435
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,310
can have such a close relationship

436
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,870
with demons like Doctor Toad.

437
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,580
Her dream

438
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,950
is to eliminate the bad demons.

439
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,630
But she gets along well

440
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,550
with the good demons.

441
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,800
Lan's mother was one of them.

442
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,220
When she was in the Mo family,

443
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,630
she was very close

444
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,490
with Aunt Suyun.

445
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,280
She also told me to take good care of Lan.

446
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,530
After she left,

447
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,170
she secretly helped her in many aspects.

448
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,060
It's just a pity

449
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,320
that she couldn't prevent the tragedy from happening.

450
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,720
So,

451
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,540
do you also think

452
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,130
that we shouldn't exterminate the demon clan completely?

453
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,020
Shi Si,

454
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,660
when you left me last time,

455
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,960
I knew it was because you had your own things to do.

456
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,900
A girl having ambitions

457
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,180
is a good thing.

458
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,020
Moreover,

459
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,800
I have no reason to stop you.

460
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,890
But what I can do

461
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,340
is become stronger.

462
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,540
This way, no matter what difficulties arise,

463
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,730
I can be by your side

464
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,370
and face them with you.

465
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,580
I really want to meet this Fairy Fangfei.

466
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,640
If it weren't for her,

467
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,290
I wouldn't have such a good husband.

468
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,430
Then you must promise me one thing.

469
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,410
Promise me to live longer.

470
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,050
There are so many good things about me

471
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,060
that you haven't seen yet.

472
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,770
I see.

473
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,490
It smells so good.

474
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,560
So good.

475
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,580
Dinner is ready.

476
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,070
Xiaohe,

477
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,780
stop working.

478
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,870
Sit down and eat.

479
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:26,890
The dishes are ready.

480
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,820
Xiaohe, have a seat.

481
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,800
We all have wine, right?

482
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,620
It's been so long since we've all gathered like this.

483
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,410
Yes.

484
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,960
The last time we gathered together,

485
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,800
it was at an inn in Yandu.

486
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,930
Thank you all for taking care of me.

487
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,460
I hope in the future

488
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,740
we will be together through thick and thin.

489
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:45,870
Here.

490
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:46,960
Here.

491
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,220
Remember what you said.

492
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,040
Cheers.

493
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,290
Why didn't you wait for me?

494
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,370
Why didn't you wait for me?

495
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,920
Wait for you? If we waited for you, would there be anything left for us to eat?

496
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,530
You're annoying.

497
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,070
Snake, have a seat.

498
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,110
We've prepared everything for you.

499
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,710
You're so nice to me.

500
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,360
Cheers!

501
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,990
Let's eat.

502
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,060
Let's eat.

503
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,950
This dish was cooked by me.

504
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,350
Give it a try.

505
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,410
Have a taste of this dish.

506
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,590
This beautiful sister is here too.

507
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:22,950
This is also delicious.

508
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,470
Try this.

509
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,470
You two...

510
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,910
Get off the table if you don't want to eat.

511
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,560
I want to eat.

512
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,520
Snake.

513
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,910
Listen to me.

514
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,310
Do you know

515
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:39,060
what the biggest difference between humans and demons is?

516
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,200
It is that

517
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,990
humans

518
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,570
are the best at pretending,

519
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,550
whereas we demons

520
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,010
are accustomed to being straightforward.

521
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,870
Some people, well,

522
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,310
they are neither human nor demon.

523
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,400
So they are somewhat...

524
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,740
contradictory.

525
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,770
Contradictory?

526
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:01,530
And they've even picked up a bad habit of not liking to go through doors.

527
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:03,830
Well...

528
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,030
Let's not talk about that for now.

529
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,350
Yes.

530
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,230
Let's have a drink.

531
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,950
Come on.

532
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,670
Let's have a drink.

533
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,350
Here.

534
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:08,750
Cheers.

535
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,910
Cheers!

536
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,110
Here.

537
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,030
Here.

538
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:16,830
Let's eat.

539
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,100
Eat more.

540
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,830
Eat up.

541
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:18,780
Let me pour wine for you.

542
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,230
Is this delicious?

543
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:19,470
This is delicious.

544
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:19,870
Have some of this.

545
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:20,480
This one.

546
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,290
Eat more.

547
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,590
Okay.

548
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,430
It tastes good.

549
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,630
Don't steal it from me.

550
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,470
Sister, long time no see.

551
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,890
Yun, please rise,

552
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:43,990
there's no need for such formalities.

553
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,510
What brings you back

554
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,610
this time?

555
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,340
There are indeed some matters.

556
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,850
Let's wait for Yun Kai,

557
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,850
and I'll tell you both together.

558
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,150
Sister, despite your long absence from home,

559
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,850
you seem not to consider yourself an outsider at all.

560
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,060
Outside of home,

561
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,560
you act freely

562
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,700
and everyone respects you.

563
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,380
As for me,

564
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,950
managing the household

565
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,410
all these years

566
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,670
has earned me the reputation of being a demoness.

567
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,170
Yun,

568
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,950
why do you have to compare yourself to me?

569
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,810
Naturally, I can't compare to you.

570
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,850
I'm carefree by nature

571
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,660
and lack your meticulousness.

572
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,960
Naturally, I couldn't manage this household like you do.

573
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,280
It's all thanks to you

574
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,130
that the Mo family is so well-organized from top to bottom.

575
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,360
Do you...

576
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,410
Do you really think so?

577
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,030
Yes.

578
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,780
Master, did you rush back right after work?

579
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,690
Normally,

580
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,940
you don't even come back for meals.

581
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,320
Yun,

582
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,420
what are you saying?

583
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,220
What happened?

584
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,100
Yan wanted to see me.

585
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,510
I'm going to meet him at Xiao Xuan Village.

586
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,100
That brat.

587
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,460
He was enchanted

588
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,480
by that demon girl.

589
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:31,660
Not only did he

590
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,790
defy my orders,

591
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,970
but he also jumped off the cliff

592
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,940
with her.

593
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,140
He was lucky

594
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,280
that he didn't die.

595
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,970
Yun Kai,

596
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,200
I increasingly feel that

597
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,800
leaving you

598
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,120
and leaving the Mo family

599
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,900
was absolutely a right decision.

600
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,750
I should really feel relieved

601
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,340
that despite being raised by you for over ten years,

602
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,980
Yan still possesses such broad-mindedness and courage.

603
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,640
He is truly my son.

604
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,730
As the leader of a demon-hunting household,

605
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,890
you are quite unaware of worldly affairs.

606
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,410
You've been flattering and fawning in the court every day.

607
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,450
Have you forgotten your mission?

608
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:14,990
You...

609
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,800
You are just a woman.

610
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,140
What do you know?

611
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,630
You...

612
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,230
When you were young,

613
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,950
I thought you were a hero among young men,

614
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,310
and marrying you was not too much of a loss.

615
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,370
I didn't expect

616
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,750
that as you got older,

617
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,250
you became more and more muddle-headed,

618
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,040
incompetent, and narrow-minded.

619
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,310
I've been gone for so many years,

620
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,730
yet you still cling to the belief that humans and demons cannot coexist.

621
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,980
I really can't communicate with you at all.

622
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,300
We don't have

623
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,910
many years to live in one lifetime.

624
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,390
It was not easy for our son to meet someone he truly loves.

625
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,800
Compared to you, me,

626
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,700
and Yun, he's much luckier.

627
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,340
The world has already put too much pressure on him.

628
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,510
And you, his own father,

629
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,290
actually want to break them up.

630
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,020
You're still insisting on these outdated notions of

631
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,970
mismatched status and social hierarchy,

632
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,630
and clinging to the Mo family's own affairs!

633
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,510
Let me tell you,

634
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,500
the demon clan is conspiring

635
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,030
to make a comeback in a short time

636
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,240
to massacre humanity.

637
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,030
If you don't take action soon,

638
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,510
the ancestral graves of the Mo family will be in danger.

639
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,500
What are you talking about?

640
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,470
[Righteousness]

641
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,730
Madam,

642
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,150
how is my brother?

643
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,160
Is he in danger?

644
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,060
If there is,

645
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,050
are you willing to do something for him?

646
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:38,970
Of course.

647
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,370
Dongling,

648
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,090
there is something

649
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,740
that only you can do.

650
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,120
Please tell me,

651
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,600
as long as I can help my brother,

652
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,630
I will not hesitate.

653
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,660
Alright.

654
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,810
We will inevitably have a war

655
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,740
with the demon clan.

656
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,450
You must stay here

657
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,900
and protect the people of Fengdu,

658
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,330
so that your brother will have no worries.

659
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,190
I will not hesitate.

660
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,880
I'm going to prepare the troops to defend the city.

661
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,600
All these years,

662
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,210
no matter what I said,

663
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,830
it couldn't overcome his closeness to Yan.

664
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,490
I think it's because they are brothers

665
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,840
and have a deep connection.

666
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:28,900
Yun,

667
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,900
thank you.

668
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,500
You have suffered a lot

669
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,000
all these years.

670
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,120
Sister,

671
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,960
I never thought

672
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,280
you would say this to me.

673
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,300
I'll leave the family to you.

674
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,320
I'm going to join Yan now.

675
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:50,970
Don't worry.

676
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,670
I'll take care of the family.

677
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,050
Rest assured and go.

678
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,300
Remember to come back often.

679
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,920
I didn't expect

680
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,030
that Mo Yan's sword four years ago

681
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,820
would hurt me so badly.

682
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,810
If it weren't for the traitor Shi Si

683
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,610
pulling him out of the illusion realm,

684
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,890
I would have almost killed him.

685
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,560
Once I recover from my internal injuries,

686
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,130
none of you will escape.

687
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,810
Shi Qi.

688
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,030
What can I do for you, Demon Lord?

689
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,520
The battle begins

690
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,800
in seven days.

691
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,110
Yes.
