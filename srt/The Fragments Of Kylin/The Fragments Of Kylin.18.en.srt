[Episode 18]

4
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,310
Brother-in-law,

5
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:43,240
what do you think of the scenery of our demon clan?

6
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,640
Brother-in-law,

7
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,680
it's your first time here.

8
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,340
You're not feeling well, huh?

9
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,830
Look.

10
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,340
Both of you are humans.

11
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,930
But Xuanyuan Sheng is fine.

12
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,490
Do you know why?

13
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,690
Thanks to Second Young Demon Lord,

14
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,720
it's not the first time I've been to Demon Realm.

15
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,450
You've contributed a lot to me.

16
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,100
Once I ascend the throne,

17
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,260
you'll be rewarded.

18
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,730
Thank you, Second Young Demon Lord.

19
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,950
Uncle,

20
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,770
why did you...

21
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,440
What is this, Brother-in-law?

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,020
You can talk.

23
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,830
Throughout the journey,

24
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,460
I thought you were a mute.

25
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,760
Brother-in-law,

26
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,860
what do you want to know?

27
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,660
Come on, let me answer it for you.

28
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Brother-in-law,

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,130
are you curious about

30
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,190
why Xuanyuan Sheng has become my lackey?

31
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,950
That's what you want to know?

32
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,150
It's easy.

33
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,760
Of course it's a deal.

34
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,710
Isn't that what the human race is best at?

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,060
What kind of deal did you make?

36
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,329
It's no big deal.

37
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,250
Xuanyuan Sheng helped me lure you here

38
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,130
so that I could get the sword

39
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,180
and kill my dear sister.

40
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,550
As for me,

41
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,640
I promise him that after I become the demon lord,

42
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,040
I will not invade the mortal world anymore.

43
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:03,920
Yan.

44
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,840
Don't look at me like that.

45
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,000
Although I have sided with the Second Young Demon Lord,

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,150
I'm still a human.

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,720
Of course I will consider the interests of the human race.

48
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,040
I just hope there will be no more war in the future.

49
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,079
The Second Young Demon Lord has the same thought as mine.

50
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,810
So I had a cooperation with him.

51
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,920
As for you guys,

52
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,710
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,790
Xuanyuan Sheng.

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,329
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,670
Why do you feel sorry?

56
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,700
Am I not good to my brother-in-law?

57
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,170
Didn't you see how friendly I treated him

58
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,640
all the way here?

59
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:42,980
Look.

60
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,940
He's bleeding.

61
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,530
This means

62
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,380
I pulled no punches

63
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,790
but took good care of my brother-in-law.

64
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,590
Are you insane?

65
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,880
Brother-in-law, you even know I'm sick.

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,260
Brother-in-law,

67
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,890
you are really my soulmate.

68
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,510
I feel relieved.

69
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,520
I feel so relieved.

70
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,630
Yan.

71
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Brother-in-law.

72
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,300
You didn't believe me when I said

73
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,959
I wouldn't invade the mortal world anymore, did you?

74
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,570
Actually,

75
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,370
the first thing I want to do

76
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,790
after I become the demon lord

77
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,860
is to eliminate the human race.

78
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,860
Lunatic.

79
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,370
What's wrong, Brother-in-law?

80
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,770
Don't you recognize him?

81
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,680
He is Sikong Shaoyun.

82
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,390
He's also Wutan Baluo.

83
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,060
They are all my lackeys.

84
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,580
What's wrong, Brother-in-law?

85
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,240
You're curious about him too?

86
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,750
Wutan,

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,850
tell him.

88
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,380
About what?

89
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,330
Wutan.

90
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,909
Come over here.

91
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,670
Don't you have a brain, you idiot?

92
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,830
Can't you tell that my brother-in-law

93
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,630
is curious about your identity?

94
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,030
Second Young Demon Lord...

95
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,710
Reply to my brother-in-law.

96
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,290
Brother-in-law...

97
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,620
You still have one chance left.

98
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,320
Dear

99
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,630
Mo...

100
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,580
Lord Mo Yan,

101
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,880
over a year ago,

102
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,140
I possessed Sikong Shaoyun.

103
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,450
My true form is a poison-eagle,

104
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,000
one of the assassins

105
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,570
of the Second Young Demon Lord.

106
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,270
Brother-in-law,

107
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,640
are you curious about

108
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,280
how he hid his aura?

109
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,740
Brother-in-law,

110
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,409
you are too narrow-minded.

111
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,980
Look.

112
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,230
You humans

113
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,400
always think so badly of us demons.

114
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,720
In fact,

115
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,420
as long as the possessed one

116
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,380
willingly obeys the demon

117
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,630
and hands over their consciousness, they'll become one with the demon.

118
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,630
Naturally, you can't distinguish each other after a long time.

119
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,750
It's hard to tell whether the human has turned into a demon

120
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,080
or vice versa.

121
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,940
Not to mention the sensation.

122
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,780
Wutan, tell me,

123
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,700
who are you

124
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,040
at the moment?

125
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,430
I'm Wutan Baluo.

126
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,050
I'm also Sikong Shaoyun.

127
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,520
Great.

128
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,790
Alright, Brother-in-law.

129
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,380
After coaxing you all the way,

130
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,930
I've treated you well enough.

131
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,510
I told you everything I know.

132
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,030
It's been years

133
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,030
I haven't talked so much.

134
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,159
Now,

135
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,420
you are supposed to let me take over the Mo Ye Sword, aren't you?

136
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,900
Alright, Brother-in-law.

137
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,200
We're not in a hurry.

138
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,360
Go back and have a good rest.

139
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,570
Wutan.

140
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,630
Take my brother-in-law away

141
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,600
so that he can get some rest.

142
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,700
Yes.

143
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,050
Let's go.

144
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,960
Second Young Demon Lord.

145
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,410
Shut up.

146
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,670
Is it because I'm now in the Demon Realm?

147
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,250
My power has been weakened a lot.

148
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,210
So this is how you felt

149
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,600
back then.

150
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,380
It's all my fault.

151
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,900
If I hadn't proposed

152
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,980
to seek refuge from my uncle in Yandu,

153
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,210
Mo Yan wouldn't have gone missing,

154
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,130
and you wouldn't have gotten hurt.

155
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,080
Even if we didn't come to Yandu,

156
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,140
we couldn't have escaped from it too.

157
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,500
You even got hurt because of me today.

158
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,070
No one ever

159
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,690
protected me like you did.

160
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,920
Thank you.

161
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,240
Don't flatter yourself.

162
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,720
I would do the same if it were someone else.

163
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,190
Even at this point,

164
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,610
you're still being mean.

165
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,130
Can't you tell I'm very upset?

166
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,380
I didn't expect the Second Uncle to lie to me.

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,780
Maybe

168
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,440
he had his reasons.

169
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,460
Since young,

170
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,580
no one in my family

171
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,580
understood me

172
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,270
except the Second Uncle.

173
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,240
Only he told me

174
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,470
to free myself from the family

175
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,360
and do what I wanted to do.

176
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,240
So I left the Xuanyuan family.

177
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,310
But I never thought

178
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,000
things would turn out like this.

179
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:30,950
Mo Lan.

180
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,320
You're bleeding again.

181
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,330
I'm fine.

182
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,450
Actually it has nothing to do with you.

183
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,110
First, the possessed Sikong Shaoyun deliberately approached you.

184
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,440
Then, your second uncle

185
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,460
lured us into the trap set by the demon clan.

186
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,020
Everything came prepared.

187
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,840
We both became pawns

188
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,410
without knowing.

189
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,070
You...

190
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,160
gave it to me...

191
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,900
Aren't you cold?

192
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,600
You even got hurt.

193
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,650
I'm just injured.

194
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,730
I'm not cold.

195
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,220
Can we find them?

196
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,960
Shi Si and Mo Yan.

197
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,510
Definitely.

198
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,790
Okay.

199
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,560
My Lady.

200
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,260
My Lady.

201
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,370
My Lady.

202
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,710
What are you worried about?

203
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,640
Are you thinking about the one from the human world again?

204
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,860
I don't know why.

205
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,340
I've been restless lately.

206
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,310
Is there anything wrong with Shi Qi recently?

207
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,910
It seems...

208
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,890
Nothing special.

209
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,900
He just colluded with his men

210
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,670
to do all kinds of evil everywhere.

211
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,940
But I heard that he has been

212
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,740
closeting himself in the Zhegui Palace recently.

213
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,070
He must have been worn out a few days ago,

214
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,900
so he wants to rest for a few days.

215
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,510
But what doesn't change is that

216
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,810
many demon corpses

217
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,380
are still being carried out every day.

218
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,120
That's what you called nothing special?

219
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:42,970
My Lady,

220
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,710
you have no idea.

221
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,170
You were not in Demon Realm for three years.

222
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,070
After the Second Young Demon Lord took over the power,

223
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,870
he has been behaving in this way.

224
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,870
A fatuous, self-indulgent ruler of the human world

225
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,370
might be lustful and indulge in sumptuous feasts.

226
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,030
But for him,

227
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,500
he thinks killing people is fun.

228
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,240
He even killed our own people when he went crazy.

229
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,890
We're already used to it.

230
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,090
My Lady.

231
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,040
My Lady.

232
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,440
My Lady.

233
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,720
My Lady, have a seat.

234
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,440
My Lady.

235
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,720
Is the fragment in your body acting up again?

236
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,890
I don't know why.

237
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,120
It's been a month

238
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,650
since you and Bei Zuo

239
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,650
gave me the two fragments.

240
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,690
The fragments in my body keep urging me to polymerize them.

241
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,880
So annoying.

242
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,380
You really disappoint me.

243
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,340
I told you,

244
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,640
whoever can pull out this sword for me

245
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,970
will become my general-in-chief in the future.

246
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,850
Why

247
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,940
are you so unambitious?

248
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,380
How are you going to achieve great success

249
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,820
with me in the future?

250
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,230
You...

251
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,040
Pull it out.

252
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,300
Yes.

253
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,440
I beg your pardon for my incompetence.

254
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,470
Useless!

255
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,770
Go to hell!

256
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,650
Hold on, Second Young Demon Lord.

257
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,390
You'd better have a good idea.

258
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:05,869
Otherwise...

259
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,280
In my opinion,

260
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,670
it is better for the doer to undo what he has done.

261
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,089
Mo Yan is the owner of this sword.

262
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:16,130
Instead of waiting for him to hand over the power voluntarily,

263
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,619
we should control him

264
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,599
and force him to pull out the sword,

265
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,450
and then we'll cripple him.

266
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,420
You're right.

267
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,980
Why didn't I think of that?

268
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,710
I only thought about how to take over the power two days ago.

269
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,310
I forgot there is such a direct way.

270
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,390
Xuanyuan Sheng, get up.

271
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,200
Xuanyuan Sheng.

272
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,730
You indeed belong to the human race which is the most sinister.

273
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,320
You're not blushing

274
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,800
even when you intend to maim your fellow man.

275
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,880
You will achieve great success.

276
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,340
I admire you.

277
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,520
Thank you, Second Young Demon Lord.

278
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
I'm willing to help you as best I can.

279
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,190
My brother-in-law has been locked in the dungeon

280
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,310
for days.

281
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,520
I wonder if he'll be more obedient.

282
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,670
Second Young Demon Lord.

283
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,110
Second Young Demon Lord.

284
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,950
Mo Yan...

285
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,040
Mo Yan ran away.

286
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,190
That's my brother-in-law.

287
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,840
He always surprises me.

288
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,510
I will surely

289
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,970
cut him open with my own hands.

290
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,500
[Yan]

291
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,690
I've accumulated magic power for days,

292
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,820
hoping it could support me to find you.

293
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,320
[Yan]

294
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
It really works only in Demon Realm.

295
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,260
If the First Young Demon Lord wants to recover,

296
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,780
we have to find all her fragments.

297
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,760
Elder, I'm so anxious.

298
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,230
We need to gather all the fragments as soon as possible.

299
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,440
Exactly.

300
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,330
Who is eavesdropping?

301
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,630
Mo Yan?

302
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,470
Mo Jialuo.

303
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,830
You...

304
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,040
Why are you in Demon Realm?

305
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,350
I was caught by your Second Young Demon Lord.

306
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,980
You're not telling the truth.

307
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,580
I want to meet Shi Si.

308
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,590
What do you want

309
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,980
from Her Ladyship?

310
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,980
It's between us as husband and wife.

311
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,740
My Lord.

312
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,290
According to the records,

313
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,310
they divorced not long ago.

314
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,910
If I remember correctly,

315
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,830
you and Miss have divorced, right?

316
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,320
I don't remember I agreed.

317
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,130
You...

318
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,790
Young man,

319
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,360
your marriage with the First Young Demon Lord

320
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,710
was an accident.

321
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,250
Demons and humans

322
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,550
are on different paths.

323
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,440
You can't be together.

324
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,920
Why are you so obsessed with it?

325
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,260
I know

326
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,420
she didn't leave me because of this.

327
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,630
I'm willing to endure the hardship with her.

328
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,520
Unless she doesn't need me anymore.

329
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,620
But besides that,

330
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,180
I will never abandon her.

331
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,300
At this point,

332
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,560
what's the use of saying this?

333
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,190
The countdown has started.

334
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,930
The polymerization of the kylin in her body

335
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,020
will never stop no matter what.

336
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,690
If we can't gather them as soon as possible,

337
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,510
I'm afraid...

338
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,290
What will happen to her?

339
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,570
She will die.

340
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,880
She has been

341
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,000
in bad shape lately.

342
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,290
How could it be?

343
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,140
Aren't those fragments

344
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,570
helping her improve her cultivation?

345
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,090
Why...

346
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,990
Those belonged to her from the beginning.

347
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,190
It's the source of kylin's magic power.

348
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,350
If she loses it,

349
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,740
she will die sooner or later.

350
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,080
The most important thing now

351
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,430
is to find the remaining fragments as soon as possible

352
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,460
to save her life.

353
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,090
Mo Jialuo.

354
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,210
Take me to her.

355
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,980
Shi Si.

356
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,690
My little brother.

357
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,750
You can't hold on any longer, can you?

358
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,490
Don't worry about me, Sister.

359
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,020
Why don't you lend me some magic power?

360
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,080
Why don't you just die?

361
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,070
Fulfill my wishes, can you?

362
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,880
How can I die

363
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,400
if you don't die first?

364
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,160
Sister.

365
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,730
Why didn't you tell me you wanted to fight with me?

366
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,150
You're not moral.

367
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,360
Do I still need to make an appointment to smack you?

368
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
Brother-in-law.

369
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,210
Shi Si.

370
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,740
Shi Si, you...

371
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,670
What's wrong?

372
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,280
Why are you here in Demon Realm?

373
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,960
Why didn't you tell me about the fragments?

374
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,310
And why did you fight Shi Qi here?

375
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,680
I could feel that

376
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,660
you were looking for me with Wanwusu.

377
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,060
So I suspected that you were in Demon Realm.

378
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,900
I wanted to see

379
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,810
if my brother was up to something.

380
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,230
Coincidentally, I ran into him

381
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,110
and his men,

382
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,170
and they came here to catch you.

383
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,310
Looks like he already knew

384
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,730
I left the dungeon today.

385
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,800
The dungeon?

386
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
You were locked in the dungeon before?

387
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,720
Yes.

388
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,850
How many days?

389
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,350
Not long.

390
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,290
Only five days.

391
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,350
Are you concerned about me?

392
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,550
I'll take you back.

393
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,390
-Shi Si.
-My Lady.

394
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,270
This is inappropriate.

395
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,620
Young man,

396
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,450
now you have fully understood

397
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,450
the First Young Demon Lord's current situation.

398
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,740
Yes, I have.

399
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,960
She is carrying a lot of responsibility now.

400
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,360
As a human,

401
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,760
what's the point of you being here?

402
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,000
I can help her.

403
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,240
You'll distract her if you stay here.

404
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,510
However,

405
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,030
if you are willing to marry into the Demon Realm,

406
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,550
you'll be

407
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,100
an effective tool

408
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,520
in increasing the First Young Demon Lord's strength.

409
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,490
After all, the Mo family has the right to have a say

410
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,590
in decisions among humans.

411
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,280
I'm sorry.

412
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,260
I was expelled from the Mo family

413
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,360
because I colluded with demons.

414
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,440
What else do we need you for?

415
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,220
What a sin!

416
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,950
What a sin.

417
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,530
It must be very painful.

418
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,800
What?

419
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,200
Those fragments

420
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,910
have been yelling in your body to get together.

421
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,260
It has nothing to do with you.

422
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,570
That's why you left.

423
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:28,920
Right?

424
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,590
You thought I couldn't help you.

425
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,040
Just take it as a yes.

426
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,080
I didn't do well enough.

427
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,510
I couldn't make you trust me wholeheartedly.

428
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,620
It's all my fault.

429
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,670
Now that I've come to the Demon Realm,

430
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,200
I've lost all my power

431
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,340
and become a useless person.

432
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,070
You just didn't want me

433
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,000
to fall into your brother's hands.

434
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,840
You pitied me,

435
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,730
so you brought me here.

436
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,850
Why do you think so?

437
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,690
Am I wrong?

438
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,290
If not,

439
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,970
why did you divorce me?

440
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,250
You are a human while I'm a demon.

441
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,600
We are destined to be on different paths.

442
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,970
No one is right or wrong.

443
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,590
No.

444
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,840
I was wrong.

445
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,360
I shouldn't have married into the Mo family.

446
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,840
I shouldn't have married on behalf of Yu.

447
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,830
Do you mean it?

448
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,430
At this point,

449
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,430
does it matter?

450
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,310
I thought

451
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,350
at least you wouldn't regret it.

452
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,060
Our fate has ended.

453
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,640
Let it go.

454
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,780
Shi Si.

455
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,030
You did well enough.

456
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,480
It's not that I pitied you.

457
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,090
You're strong.

458
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,880
Never doubt yourself.

459
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,200
First Young Demon Lord.

460
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,600
Please allow us to

461
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,450
go to the human world again

462
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,180
and search for the remaining fragments.

463
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,710
Do you think

464
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,810
I should

465
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,640
send Young Master Yan back with this opportunity?

466
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,480
My Lady.

467
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,490
The Second Young Demon Lord has spread rumors

468
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,430
that

469
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,450
you colluded with the human race

470
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,040
and worked with Mo Yan

471
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,270
to overturn the rule of the Demon Realm.

472
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,750
In just a day or two,

473
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,400
many people have betrayed us

474
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,330
and defected to the Second Young Demon Lord.

475
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,440
It's no use to persuade

476
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,940
those fence-sitters to stay.

477
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,120
First Young Demon Lord is right.

478
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,300
But we can't keep Young Master Yan here

479
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,100
for a long period.

480
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,080
My Lady.

481
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,430
You...

482
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,440
Are you reluctant to let him go?

483
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:53,990
Well...

484
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,080
When he recovers,

485
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,370
send him back to the human world.

486
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,270
That's more like it.

487
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,530
My lady has always been carefree.

488
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,620
You don't need to care about a passer-by.

489
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,590
Shi Si.

490
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,130
You came at the right time.

491
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,670
What brings you here?

492
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,480
I'm looking for Shi Si.

493
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,610
You...

494
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,580
How shameless you are!

495
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,550
All right.

496
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,050
You may leave now.

497
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,160
Thank you in advance for the fragments.

498
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,190
-Yes.
-Yes.

499
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,160
What is it?

500
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,740
I heard you say

501
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,330
you'd send me away.

502
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,590
You can leave

503
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,290
after you recover.

504
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,950
Since I'm already a passer-by,

505
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,090
what's the difference whether I recover

506
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:04,970
or not?

507
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,940
Since I've caused you a lot of trouble here,

508
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,530
I'll leave today.

509
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,440
Fine.

510
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,310
But I have a request.

511
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,720
You have to give me a ride.

512
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,300
After all, your brother

513
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,190
is really sinister and cunning.

514
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,370
As you know,

515
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,180
in Demon Realm,

516
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,930
I have negligible magic power.

517
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,270
If I leave alone,

518
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,370
he will kill me halfway.

519
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,750
We were husband and wife once.

520
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,220
You don't want me to

521
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,800
die in his hands, right?

522
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,650
It seems that I have caused you a lot of criticism.

523
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,820
When we were fleeing,

524
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,970
I also caused you a lot of trouble.

525
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,560
How did you know?

526
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,760
Where did you hear that?

527
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,990
Is that why you...

528
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,960
I'm not as great as you think.

529
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,550
Aren't you Young Master Yan?

530
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,100
Why are you here in Demon Realm?

531
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,370
You used to be arrogant.

532
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,030
Now you're just like a loser.

533
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,570
Get up.

534
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,580
Do you still dare to be arrogant?

535
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,450
Stand up.

536
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,400
What are you waiting for?

537
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,670
Get up, Young Master Yan.

538
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,600
Get up quickly.

539
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,910
Stand up.

540
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,730
Hurry up.

541
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,690
Go on.

542
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,410
I'm talking to you.

543
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,540
Can you get up or not?

544
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,790
Shut up!

545
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,030
First…

546
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,680
First Young Demon Lord, please spare my life.

547
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,360
You were so arrogant just now.

548
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,850
You're like a loser now.

549
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,890
I was wrong.

550
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,170
Go back and tell Shi Qi

551
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,810
no one

552
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,470
can hurt my people.

553
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:23,910
Got...

554
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,610
Got it.

555
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,260
Apologize.

556
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,710
I'm sorry, First Young Demon Lord's...

557
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,510
-Lady.
-Is that what we call him?

558
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,630
What should we call him then?

559
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,870
First Young Madam?

560
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,240
It's inappropriate.

561
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,430
Well...

562
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,790
What should we call him?

563
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,940
I don't know.

564
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,020
Get lost!

565
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,080
-Yes.
-Yes.

566
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,850
Are you leaving or not?

567
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,260
Troublesome.

568
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,280
♫The person in the dream♫

569
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,610
♫Falling like a flower♫

570
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:53,630
♫The heart withers into a desert♫

571
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,950
♫The wind and the rain have seen through the vagaries of fate♫

572
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:07,740
♫Where do you wander off to?♫

573
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,300
♫Can't see through♫

574
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,820
♫The karma of destiny♫

575
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:21,469
♫Who will accompany the song in my heart?♫

576
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,489
Let go of me.

577
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:28,219
♫Time goes by and desolates love and hate♫

578
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,199
♫The past is like a dream♫

579
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:35,929
♫Sounds echoing♫

580
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,560
You were pretending?

581
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,540
I should have asked you to protect me earlier

582
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,590
If I'd known that pretending to be vulnerable would work.

583
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:42,860
♫Your smile is like the spring breeze♫

584
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,960
Didn't you divorce me?

585
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,810
Why did you say I'm yours?

586
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:49,870
♫My heart is like jade and I used to be crazy about you and I don't regret it♫

587
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,360
I'll send you back.

588
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,710
I'm not leaving.

589
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,150
♫Flowers bloom♫

590
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,679
♫Flowers fall♫

591
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:56,120
♫They're so fragile♫

592
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,469
You don't want me to be bullied.

593
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,750
♫Pretty faces will get wrinkled♫

594
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,680
♫Love will change♫

595
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,460
But why do you keep hurting my heart?

596
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:03,500
♫All will fade♫

597
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Shi Si.

598
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,150
I don't want to divorce you.

599
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,590
Do you agree?

600
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,610
♫Can't see through♫

601
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,170
♫The karma of destiny♫

602
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,890
Shi Si.

603
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,720
♫Who will accompany the song in my heart?♫

604
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,710
Do you still want me?

605
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,510
♫Time goes by and desolates love and hate♫

606
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,630
Do you know

607
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,420
♫The past is like a dream♫

608
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,290
you can't go back to the Mo family anymore

609
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:35,230
♫Sounds echoing♫

610
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,830
if you are together with me?

611
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,220
I don't care about it.

612
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:43,700
♫Your smile is like the spring breeze♫

613
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,750
You're my wife.

614
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,660
You can't abandon me.

615
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:50,550
♫My heart is like jade and I used to be crazy about you and I don't regret it♫

616
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,450
Don't leave me again, okay?

617
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,250
♫The destiny brought us so much misfortune but we remain stubborn♫

618
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,870
♫You made me a promise♫

619
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,450
♫Spring comes and flowers bloom again♫

620
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:04,560
♫I just smile♫

621
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,520
Okay.
