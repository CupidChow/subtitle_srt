deep down, you also have doubts.

194
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,900
Why are you so eager to deny them?

195
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,890
First Young Demon Lord,

196
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,850
if you regain your memory,

197
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,850
would you still insist on this?

198
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,630
I...

199
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,350
The future of the demon clan

200
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,130
lies in

201
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,430
conquering the human world.

202
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,860
Mo Yan,

203
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,090
I never want to be your enemy.

204
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,700
Shi Si.

205
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,240
I don't even know

206
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,070
how to face him anymore.

207
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,890
Are you talking about

208
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,240
Sikong Shaoyun?

209
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,080
Yes.

210
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,160
Did you hear that?

211
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,570
Yesterday,

212
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,360
he called me Yu.

213
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,240
Yes,

214
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,380
I heard it.

215
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,040
Back when Mo Yan thought I was you,

216
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,070
he also called me that.

217
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,230
That's different.

218
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,820
He just made a mistake.

219
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,220
However,

220
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,570
I never expected

221
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,690
that he also had feelings for me.

222
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,830
What good deeds did I do in my past life

223
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,610
to deserve mutual affection this time?

224
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,700
Yu.

225
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,150
Yes?

226
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,960
Have you ever thought about

227
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,200
how coincidental it is

228
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,940
that we arrived here

229
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,590
and he suddenly appeared?

230
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,630
I've asked him about it.

231
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,460
He said

232
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,700
he came here intentionally to find me.

233
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,260
Actually, last time,

234
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,890
before I saw him possessed by a demon,

235
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,340
I had left him a message.

236
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,680
But

237
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,480
I didn't get his reply.

238
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,920
So,

239
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,370
I took the risk and sneaked into Sikong's Mansion.

240
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,180
What message did you leave?

241
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,970
Could you please pass a message to Young Master Sikong for me,

242
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,840
saying that I'll be waiting for him in the place in the painting?

243
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,460
It's our little secret.

244
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,140
But don't worry.

245
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,220
I'm sure

246
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,650
that as long as he can come here,

247
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,590
it must be the real him.

248
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,660
But I...

249
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,690
Alright, Shi Si.

250
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,300
I've liked him for so long.

251
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,300
I know him

252
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,730
the best.

253
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,020
Those demons

254
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,260
can't deceive my eyes.

255
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,560
Besides,

256
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,470
Mo Yan is here, isn't he?

257
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,430
Don't you believe in him?

258
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,390
Fine.

259
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,780
By the way,

260
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,130
when he hugged me like that yesterday,

261
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,940
I was really startled.

262
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,980
Scenes like that

263
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,880
used to only appear in my dreams.

264
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,700
I never expected them

265
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,810
to come true.

266
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,030
I'm afraid it's too early to be happy.

267
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:44,550
What?

268
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,710
What's wrong?

269
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,460
Didn't you hear any strange noises just now?

270
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,440
No.

271
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,630
It's okay.

272
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,470
Eat.

273
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,030
Okay.

274
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,650
So rude.

275
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,680
Shi Si,

276
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,830
they're here.

277
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,470
Did you see that?

278
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,700
The person I like

279
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,510
is absolutely exceptional.

280
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,700
Mo Yan, please have a seat.

281
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,870
Yesterday,

282
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,920
thanks to you and your wife's help,

283
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,030
I wasn't left homeless

284
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,040
on the streets.

285
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:48,950
How about this?

286
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,220
Let me make a toast to you

287
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,370
with a cup of tea instead of wine.

288
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,150
Well,

289
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,010
what about me?

290
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,349
Yu,

291
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,099
if I

292
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,349
need to thank you,

293
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,819
wouldn't that mean we're not close enough?

294
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:11,960
Mr. Sikong, you're being too polite.

295
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,569
When away from home,

296
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,460
we're all friends.

297
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,790
Mr. Mo, you're a few months older than me,

298
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,380
please just call me Shaoyun.

299
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,820
I'm sure

300
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,170
you all already know about me

301
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,450
being possessed by a demon.

302
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,870
I don't even know

303
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,950
when I was possessed.

304
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,340
It's just that sometimes,

305
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,430
I felt confused and disoriented.

306
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,260
I don't know

307
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,490
what the demon wanted to do.

308
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,940
But one night,

309
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,840
I suddenly woke up

310
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,580
feeling as if

311
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,720
someone was tearing apart my meridians and bones.

312
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,670
I passed out from the pain.

313
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,510
When I woke up the next morning,

314
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,740
that feeling

315
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,060
had completely disappeared.

316
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,300
So, I knew

317
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,430
that he had left.

318
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,340
Shaoyun,

319
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,350
you've suffered.

320
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,160
I've heard before

321
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,850
that demons' purpose in possessing humans

322
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,530
is to absorb their magical powers.

323
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,750
And those with weak wills

324
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,410
are most likely to be possessed.

325
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,410
In that case, it was probably because

326
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,360
my magical powers are poor

327
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,670
that I was fortunate enough to escape.

328
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,500
Shaoyun,

329
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,500
don't say that about yourself.

330
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,510
Your family has always been primarily focusing on commerce.

331
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,860
Without the support

332
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,950
of the Sikong family in Fengdu,

333
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,820
where would the Mo family and the Xuanyuan family

334
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,430
get the funds to fight demons and uphold justice?

335
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:46,940
Am I right,

336
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,150
Young Master Yan?

337
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,760
That's true.

338
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,790
Now that everything has been resolved,

339
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,830
what are your plans for the next step?

340
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,620
Are you planning to get married right here?

341
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,790
Shi Si,

342
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,240
what are you talking about?

343
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,270
Today, Pucheng is quite lively.

344
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,840
There are many new and interesting things

345
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,230
in the market.

346
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,820
I know Yu enjoys lively places.

347
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,960
We haven't seen each other for a long time,

348
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,630
so,

349
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,820
I want to take Yu over there and show her around.

350
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,800
Let's eat.

351
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,150
I'm full.

352
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,570
I want to get changed.

353
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,380
Shi Si, come with me.

354
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,080
Let's go.

355
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,560
But you haven't eaten much.

356
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,560
Let's go.

357
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,660
Yu, be careful.

358
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,190
Yu,

359
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,260
didn't you just change your clothes this morning?

360
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
Why are you changing again?

361
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,920
Shi Si.

362
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,120
What's wrong?

363
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,590
Shi Si,

364
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,190
I feel

365
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,990
a little unreal.

366
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,950
I've never been so close to him before.

367
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,800
It was his blessing to meet you.

368
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,910
Shi Si.

369
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,550
Do you remember when you told me on the mountain

370
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,760
that I would also meet someone who truly likes me?

371
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,260
Now I have.

372
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,810
Can you help me

373
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,620
choose which clothes to wear later?

374
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,880
I think they all look the same.

375
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,080
Should I wear orange

376
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,660
or blue?

377
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,630
Take a look!

378
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,590
Handmade pendants!

379
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,960
-Take a look.
-Yu, slow down.

380
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,590
Miss, what kind do you want?

381
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,750
Shaoyun, which one looks better?

382
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,030
This one.

383
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,680
I'll take this one then.

384
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,890
Two coins.

385
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,120
Thank you, sir.

386
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:01,940
Take care.

387
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,840
Which one do you like?

388
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,750
Pick one.

389
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,350
Sugar figurines!

390
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,480
Is it sweet?

391
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,250
Yes.

392
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:24,850
Try it.

393
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,070
Is it good?

394
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,870
Yes.

395
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,380
I'm sorry, Sister.

396
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,340
It's okay.

397
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,860
What are you doing?

398
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,090
Sorry, My Lady.

399
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,800
Let me buy you a new one.

400
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,650
It's okay.

401
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,220
I'm sorry, sir.

402
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,270
You damn old woman.

403
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,010
Do you want to die?

404
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,940
Shaoyun!

405
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,970
Leave.

406
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,990
Hurry up. Let's go.

407
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,650
What are you doing?

408
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,390
Yu,

409
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,740
I'm sorry.

410
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,640
I lost my temper

411
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,240
in the heat of the moment.

412
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,310
Yu!

413
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,460
Yu!

414
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,950
Yu.

415
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:17,780
I...

416
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:21,590
I...

417
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,240
It was just a sugar figurine.

418
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
I don't care about it.

419
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,610
But I do.

420
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,820
You are my beloved.

421
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,170
How could I let you suffer

422
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,480
even the slightest grievance?

423
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,280
I want to give you

424
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,140
all the best things in the world.

425
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,980
Yu,

426
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,240
don't be angry anymore.

427
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,960
Let's go and watch a play together, okay?

428
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,150
Let's go.

429
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,200
Demon Exorcising Talisman?

430
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,850
Yu,

431
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,650
are you suspecting me?

432
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,350
Shaoyun?

433
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,140
Are you awake?

434
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,630
I advise you not to move.

435
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,980
You'll get scars.

436
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,690
Who are you?

437
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,980
Unfortunately, Yu,

438
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,150
your suspicion is correct.

439
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,390
My real name

440
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,160
is Wutan Baluo.

441
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,050
I thought...

442
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:29,970
What did you think?

443
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,100
The relationships between the human race are really troublesome.

444
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,560
I...

445
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,100
couldn't hold it any longer.

446
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,130
Shi Si!

447
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,650
You dare to come alone?

448
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,180
Yu!

449
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:56,820
Yu!

450
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,340
If you dare to take one more step forward,

451
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,250
I'll kill her.

452
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,700
What are you?

453
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,970
Tell me your name.

454
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,650
Young Lady,

455
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,190
I advise you not to provoke me.

456
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,480
You...

457
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,150
You were the one in the ancestral hall?

458
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,530
Were you the one who possessed Sikong Shaoyun?

459
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,640
Your name is...

460
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:24,900
is...

461
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,480
is...

462
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,610
Wu...

463
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,750
Wu...

464
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,000
Wutan Black?

465
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,920
Young Lady.

466
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,810
I've told you

467
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,620
not to provoke me, haven't I?

468
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,110
Yu!

469
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,850
Yu!

470
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,470
If you want to do anything, do it to me!

471
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,630
Let her go!

472
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,060
My target is you, that's true.

473
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,120
But using her as leverage against you

474
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,380
is quite effective.

475
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,590
If you want to do anything, do it to me.

476
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,670
Let go of her!

477
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,890
I... I...

478
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,400
What exactly do you want?

479
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,210
Give me Mo Ye Sword.

480
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,720
If I give you Mo Ye Sword,

481
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,240
will you let her go?

482
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,170
Young Lady,

483
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,720
please understand the situation.

484
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,890
Do you think

485
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,410
that in your current state,

486
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,180
you are qualified to negotiate with me?

487
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,650
Even if I were to

488
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,620
kill you now,

489
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,820
and then her,

490
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,820
what

491
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,080
could you do

492
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,000
to stop me?

493
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,130
Do you think that,

494
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,740
with Mo Ye Sword not beside me,

495
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,460
you can kill me?

496
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,080
Young Lady,

497
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,170
this is the human world.

498
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,300
Although you are the First Young Demon Lord,

499
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,750
you are now powerless

500
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,570
and came here alone.

501
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,120
What do you have to fight against me?

502
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,350
Judging by your expression,

503
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,480
are you

504
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,830
remembering something?

505
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,500
You've been wandering the human world for many years.

506
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,820
You must understand better than anyone

507
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,140
that even if our demon clan

508
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,980
could live peacefully with the human race,

509
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,850
the people of this world

510
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,170
will never change their prejudice against us.

511
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,040
You haven’t

512
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,400
told your husband

513
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,900
about this yet, have you?

514
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,650
It's okay.

515
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,450
It's okay.

516
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,360
Soon enough,

517
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,080
he will know.

518
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,380
Soon enough,

519
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,020
he will

520
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,380
abandon you.

521
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,390
Your strength is mediocre,

522
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,920
but your ability to sow discord is top-notch.

523
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,220
You are so foolish and weak.

524
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,000
That old turtle

525
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,210
actually went to great lengths to find you,

526
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,820
a loser, to be your supporter.

527
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,180
It's a great disgrace to the demon clan.

528
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,410
Young Lady,

529
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,750
since you love the human world so much,

530
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,420
why don't you stay here forever?

531
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,240
Farewell.
