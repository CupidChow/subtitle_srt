[The Fragments Of Kylin]

00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,920
[Episode 17]

4
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,670
What's wrong?

5
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,030
The circus animals have gone mad.

6
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,030
They are killing people up ahead.

7
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,759
Go see for yourself if you're not afraid of death!

8
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,590
So handsome!

9
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,550
Who are you?

10
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,770
I'm a phoenix,

11
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,420
named Lingque.

12
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,780
I am the sword spirit of Gan Jiang Sword and Mo Ye Sword.

13
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,540
Phoenix?

14
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,329
Sword spirit?

15
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,780
Many years ago,

16
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,720
my soul was torn in two

17
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,660
and sealed within Gan Jiang Sword and Mo Ye Sword separately.

18
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,980
Three years ago, Gan Jiang Sword was lost,

19
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,130
and my spiritual power was damaged.

20
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,350
So, I had to hibernate within the sword.

21
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,450
Until...

22
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,470
Where's the person who awakened me?

23
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,650
The person who awakened you?

24
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,140
Who is it?

25
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,940
Kylins have a powerful ability to summon

26
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,550
all creatures in the world.

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,460
Not long ago,

28
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,300
a kylin had a connection with Mo Ye Sword.

29
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,110
I sensed her through the sword aura

30
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,820
and was thus awakened from my long slumber.

31
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,040
Are you saying...

32
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,240
when I handed over the control to her?

33
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,480
Yes.

34
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,880
At that time...

35
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,579
Are you looking for me?

36
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,350
You...

37
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,460
Are you sent by the demon clan to kill me?

38
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,000
I am indeed a demon.

39
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,860
But our phoenix clan

40
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,810
has long been extinct.

41
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,000
I am the only one left and was sealed inside this sword.

42
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,060
Wasn't it you who awakened me a few days ago?

43
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,980
Why are you now acting like you don't know me?

44
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,550
Sword spirit?

45
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,510
You are Mo Yan's sword spirit?

46
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,640
Mo Yan?

47
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,810
You mean

48
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,550
the guy who's been carrying me?

49
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,269
Yes.

50
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,750
He's not from the demon clan.

51
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,690
He couldn't awaken me.

52
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,100
What do you mean?

53
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,140
It means

54
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,420
you are from the demon clan.

55
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,020
A few days ago,

56
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,710
that guy handed over the control to you, right?

57
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,110
That's why you could draw out Mo Ye Sword,

58
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,350
accidentally awaken me,

59
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,590
and talk to me.

60
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,210
I'm not.

61
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,030
You are.

62
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,690
Besides,

63
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,150
you are quite rare.

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,260
I'm telling you,

65
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,110
don't talk nonsense.

66
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,110
I'm not from the demon clan.

67
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,700
Shi Si.

68
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,010
Shi Si.

69
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,940
Don't talk nonsense.

70
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,770
So annoying.

71
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,420
I'm done talking.

72
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,550
Say something.

73
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,860
Who are you talking to?

74
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,900
No one.

75
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,760
I remember the last time I saw her...

76
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,610
Little girl.

77
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,650
Why are you embroidering this?

78
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,320
It's for Mo Yan.

79
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:34,980
Are you sure he'll like it?

80
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,540
Even if he doesn't like it, there's nothing I can do.

81
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,190
This is the best I can do.

82
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,350
Oh, by the way...

83
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:44,860
What?

84
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,950
Are you very skilled?

85
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,710
Of course.

86
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,610
Then can you promise me

87
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,720
to protect Mo Yan well in the future?

88
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,310
He is the master of Mo Ye Sword.

89
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,580
Of course I will.

90
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,700
You're not leaving, are you?

91
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,630
Yes.

92
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,450
Does Mo Yan know about it?

93
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,030
Why don't you tell him?

94
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,900
If he stays with me,

95
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,660
then he will have no place

96
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,400
in the demon-hunting households.

97
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,550
He has his own life.

98
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,060
So she really left,

99
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,770
right?

100
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,710
Yes.

101
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,830
What are they talking about?

102
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,760
I don't understand.

103
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,130
A fragment?

104
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,270
You know about the fragments too?

105
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,750
What exactly

106
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,170
are these fragments?

107
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,510
They are a kylin's horn.

108
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,150
Kylin's horn?

109
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,650
During the Great War three years ago,

110
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,220
someone used Gan Jiang Sword or Mo Ye Sword

111
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,530
to chop off a kylin's horn.

112
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,550
This thing

113
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,490
contains a lot of spiritual energy.

114
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,210
The sword almost cracked.

115
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,930
That's why I have such a vivid memory of it.

116
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,960
Who was this person?

117
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,350
Was it you?

118
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,000
Your figure bears some resemblance to that person.

119
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,150
Perhaps my memory is incomplete.

120
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,420
Yan?

121
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,409
She must have known something

122
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,890
to choose to leave.

123
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,390
I must find her.

124
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,920
Shi Si is definitely not the kind of person who would leave without saying anything.

125
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,630
She must have encountered something.

126
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:50,920
Yu!

127
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,960
Slowly.

128
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,790
Second Uncle?

129
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,190
Little wolf cub?

130
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,940
Second Uncle,

131
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,510
why are you here?

132
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,020
Weren't you supposed to be cultivating at Mount Panlong?

133
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,480
It was because of the disturbance caused by the demon clan.

134
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,450
I heard

135
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,600
that Fengdu is not peaceful.

136
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,919
Fortunately, the Mo family is there maintaining the order.

137
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,320
Yandu is under the jurisdiction of our Xuanyuan family.

138
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,980
In the past year,

139
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,580
there have been several strange incidents.

140
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,790
I received the report today

141
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,970
and hurried back to handle it.

142
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,610
I didn't expect

143
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,990
that you guys had already resolved it.

144
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,280
Just now, you mentioned that

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,340
there were demons appearing in Yandu.

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,730
I suppose you have also

147
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,840
known about the fragments.

148
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,460
Exactly.

149
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,920
According to my investigation,

150
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,500
the fragments

151
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,550
are objects that the demon clan is vigorously pursuing.

152
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,330
They can significantly enhance cultivation

153
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,480
in the short term

154
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,730
and are also involved in the disputes

155
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,280
between the two factions of the demon clan.

156
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,370
Please explain it to me, Uncle.

157
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,400
After Demon Lord Shuo Tian

158
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,230
suffered serious injuries during his seclusion,

159
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,360
the Demon Realm has been overseen by Second Young Demon Lord.

160
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,880
It is said that under Demon Lord's command,

161
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,470
there was originally a pair of very formidable kylin siblings.

162
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,710
This Second Young Demon Lord is the younger brother,

163
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,800
known as Shi Qi.

164
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,370
Based on the information I have received,

165
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,830
that First Young Demon Lord has been missing

166
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,830
since the Great War.

167
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,960
Her former subordinates have been searching for her all along,

168
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,690
and only recently found her.

169
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,240
I wonder...

170
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,920
Second Uncle,

171
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,400
the girl I brought back

172
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,180
is their First Young Demon Lord, Shi Si.

173
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,160
She is like a sister to me.

174
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,910
And she is Mo Yan's wife.

175
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,270
I see.

176
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,020
No wonder.

177
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,130
This Second Young Demon Lord has been ambitious

178
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,470
these past three years,

179
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,340
expanding his influence

180
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,470
while

181
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,540
ordering his subordinates to hunt down his own sister.

182
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,700
At the same time, he has been secretly gathering the fragments.

183
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,450
I failed to stop him,

184
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,290
and he managed to take one away from me.

185
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,140
I feel ashamed.

186
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,360
So,

187
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,670
Wutan Baluo is under the command of the Second Young Demon Lord.

188
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,450
He has long coveted the position of Demon Lord.

189
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,270
If what you said is true

190
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,790
and Miss Shi Si has returned to the Demon Realm,

191
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,110
I'm afraid the Second Young Demon Lord

192
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,690
will try to kill her.

193
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,530
Second Uncle,

194
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,470
you must help us save her.

195
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,890
Shi Si is my wife.

196
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,990
If she is in trouble,

197
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,500
it is my responsibility to rescue her.

198
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,210
Uncle,

199
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,900
I appreciate your kindness.

200
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,000
But I can't get you involved in this.

201
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,610
Yandu needs your protection.

202
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,360
Yan,

203
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,800
you're wrong.

204
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,150
Miss Shi Si and you

205
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,590
love each other very much,

206
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,930
and she's like Yu's sister.

207
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,180
I have

208
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,210
met her several times,

209
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,030
and she is indeed a good girl.

210
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,300
Now that I know about this,

211
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,650
I cannot let you guys go alone and take such risks.

212
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,170
Second Uncle,

213
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,580
you don't mind that she is from the demon clan?

214
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,520
Am I

215
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,450
just a stubborn old man in your eyes?

216
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,800
The demon clan,

217
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,030
like us,

218
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,000
has both good and evil,

219
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,360
righteousness and malice.

220
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,160
Emotions are mutual.

221
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,110
Your unwavering determination to rescue her

222
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:33,980
only proves

223
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,960
that she is a person of integrity and loyalty, doesn't it?

224
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,400
Uncle,

225
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,630
if everyone in the world were like you,

226
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,600
Shi Si probably

227
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,830
wouldn't have had to leave.

228
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,500
Yan.

229
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,880
The world is unpredictable,

230
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,290
but sometimes it is predictable.

231
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,630
Try your best,

232
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,920
and leave

233
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,870
no regret.

234
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,270
[Bilifu Inn]

235
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,090
Shi Si,

236
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,530
you must wait for us.

237
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,730
[Yan]

238
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,760
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

239
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,770
Along this journey,

240
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,920
many people immediately called for violence upon hearing about the demon clan.

241
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,370
I dared not reveal my identity at all.

242
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,080
I just want to live.

243
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,020
Why is it so difficult?

244
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,750
Perhaps staying alive

245
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,000
is the hardest thing of all.

246
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,900
You look tough. Why are you so negative?

247
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,810
I was hoping you'd say some comforting words to me.

248
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,540
Little wolf cub,

249
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,730
always expecting something from others

250
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,870
will make you lose faith in this world.

251
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,090
However,

252
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,150
being optimistic is a good thing.

253
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,150
Keep being a fool.

254
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,860
I'm not a fool!

255
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,740
Alright.

256
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:00,950
Here.

257
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,760
Don't get caught again.

258
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,800
If you want to live well,

259
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,260
then learn to use the talents of your demon clan.

260
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,210
This is not a crime;

261
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,050
it's for survival.

262
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,950
Here.

263
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,420
Let's go.

264
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,330
[Bilifu Inn]

265
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,360
Uncle Sheng?

266
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:17,990
Lan,

267
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,950
how have you been?

268
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,110
Luckily, you have Yan

269
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,780
to take care of each other.

270
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,900
Yan is my benefactor.

271
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,600
I don't have the courage to see you.

272
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,670
Every time I see you,

273
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,960
I am reminded of Suyun.

274
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,380
Back then,

275
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,500
if I could have joined forces with your parents

276
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,230
to besiege Monster Taowu,

277
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,700
perhaps

278
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,620
the tragedy wouldn't have happened.

279
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,270
And you wouldn't have...

280
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,020
Uncle Sheng.

281
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,230
It was not something

282
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,000
you and I could easily change.

283
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,690
Since my parents passed away,

284
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,800
you have been taking great care of me.

285
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,350
Over these years,

286
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,550
the books and clothes you've sent to the Mo family

287
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,420
are enough for a lifetime's use.

288
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,730
I just

289
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,060
want to do more for your parents.

290
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:11,960
However,

291
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,370
it's inappropriate for me

292
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,180
to intervene too much in the affairs of the Mo family.

293
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,860
I understand.

294
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,370
I've known Suyun since we were kids,

295
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:37,190
[Bilifu Inn]

296
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
and we were very close.

297
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,490
I still remember

298
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,310
the overwhelming joy

299
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,950
she expressed

300
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,170
when she told me

301
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,760
that she was going to marry Yun Qi back then.

302
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,630
I sincerely believed

303
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,910
that their union would symbolize

304
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,780
bridging the gap between humans and demons.

305
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,550
What a wonderful match.

306
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,990
What a perfect couple.

307
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Yes.

308
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,290
I haven't thought of them for a long time.

309
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,390
If the two clans

310
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,839
could have been honest with each other

311
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,680
and reconciled earlier,

312
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,750
perhaps your mother wouldn't have died.

313
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,150
Lan,

314
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,599
you are still young.

315
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,560
The future belongs to you.

316
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,800
I believe you will see that day.

317
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,829
Yes.

318
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,220
My Lady?

319
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,530
My Lady?

320
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,700
What is it?

321
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,480
Second Young Demon Lord is here.

322
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,700
Sister.

323
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,960
Why do I need an outsider to report to you

324
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,630
when I come to see you nowadays?

325
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,620
That's because I don't want to see you.

326
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,170
Sister,

327
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,960
we're siblings.

328
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,210
Why are you so distant with me?

329
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,000
You're not distant with me.

330
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,390
Are you trying to bond with me

331
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,570
through repeatedly trying to kill me?

332
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,590
Isn't that our usual way of sparring?

333
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,230
How could you take it seriously?

334
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,000
Sister, you know

335
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,500
I've always admired the strong.

336
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,050
When I encounter someone stronger than me,

337
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,820
I get an itch to challenge them.

338
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,090
Well, I suggest you chop your hands off.

339
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,950
There are plenty of people stronger than you in this world.

340
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,550
It seems our First Young Demon Lord has indeed regained her memory.

341
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,360
Your tongue is as sharp as ever.

342
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,920
Not at all as gentle and adorable as in the human world.

343
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,320
What a pity.

344
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,650
Likewise.

345
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,160
You only have a few

346
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,670
capable people under your command.

347
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,120
And you've sent them all to monitor me.

348
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,770
I'm truly flattered.

349
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,850
Sister,

350
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,600
I wonder, how would my human brother-in-law feel

351
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,910
if he saw you

352
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,720
being so contentious?

353
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,180
You...

354
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,810
Well, you have to be a person first.

355
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:33,790
My Lady.

356
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,890
Do you want to continue?

357
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,360
Your cultivation has actually recovered so quickly?

358
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,510
Are you pretending?

359
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,370
Pretending?

360
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,730
Why don't you give it a try?

361
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,770
Sister,

362
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,310
didn't I just say earlier

363
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,250
that this is just our usual way of sparring?

364
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:02,690
I...

365
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,620
I'm just here to test how well you've recovered

366
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,280
for Demon Lord.

367
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,160
How could you take it seriously?

368
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,930
Second Young Demon Lord,

369
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,670
Let me...

370
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,410
see you out.

371
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,910
First Young Demon Lord!

372
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,250
Second Young Demon Lord,

373
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:51,890
this way, please.

374
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,170
Mo Jialuo.

375
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,990
What can I do for you?

376
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,350
No need to be so polite. We are all on the same side.

377
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,400
Mo Jialuo,

378
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
what benefits can you get from my sister?

379
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,140
She is just a paper tiger pretending to be strong,

380
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,090
with no future.

381
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,340
The Demon Realm is mine now.

382
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,830
I value and cherish talent.

383
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,120
Why not come under my command

384
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,370
and create a great future with me?

385
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,110
Is that so?

386
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,210
Then may I ask, what benefits will I get

387
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,220
if I join you?

388
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,810
whatever you want.

389
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,380
Second Young Demon Lord,

390
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,980
I have a bad memory.

391
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,430
What did you need me for?

392
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,520
I just said

393
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,370
that I want you

394
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,020
to come under my command.

395
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,040
Oh, yes.

396
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,900
What was it?

397
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,490
I said...

398
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:48,910
Yes?

399
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,240
If you come under my command,

400
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,220
I can give you anything you want.

401
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,420
Really?

402
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,270
That's impressive.

403
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,400
Unfortunately,

404
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,550
what I desire most in my life

405
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,280
is First Young Demon Lord herself.

406
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,810
What do you mean?

407
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,930
We're not

408
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,950
meant for each other, so...

409
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,240
let's not force it.

410
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,040
Mo Jialuo!

411
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:39,910
[Steam]

412
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,600
Not every part of the Demon Realm

413
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,500
is directly connected with the human world.

414
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,880
They use barriers to create entrances,

415
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,370
and the locations of these barriers often change,

416
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,250
making them difficult to pinpoint.

417
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,780
This time I received intel

418
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,570
saying that another new entrance

419
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,430
has been discovered on Mount Luwu.

420
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,380
Let's go investigate.

421
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,980
Thank you, Uncle.

422
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,520
Yan,

423
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,120
eliminating demons and upholding justice

424
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,540
is my duty.

425
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,680
Don't thank me.

426
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,880
It'll create distance between us.

427
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,950
Yu.

428
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,270
Yu...

429
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,300
[Steam]

430
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,630
This child.

431
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,780
I've never been able to control her since she was little.

432
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,780
It has just been a while, and she disappeared.

433
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,590
Uncle Sheng,

434
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,450
Yan,

435
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,560
keep talking.

436
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,440
I'll go find her.

437
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,220
Okay.

438
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,780
Yan, let's go.

439
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,410
Okay.

440
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,290
Do you want to eat this?

441
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,020
No.

442
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,040
No, it's just that it reminded me

443
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,290
of the time I ate a sugar figurine...

444
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,980
Sir, a sugar figurine.

445
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:51,760
Feel free to pick.

446
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,370
Is this okay?

447
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,270
Okay.

448
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,960
You want it?

449
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:11,780
Yes.

450
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:15,640
Here.

451
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,870
You can't take it.

452
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,560
This was bought by this brother for this sister.

453
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,910
Look at you.

454
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:23,710
It's okay.

455
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,630
I'll buy her another one later.

456
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,470
Take it.

457
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,900
Sorry about that.

458
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,560
Say thanks to them.

459
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,660
Thank you, Brother and Sister.

460
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,670
Good girl.

461
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,920
Thank you.

462
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,030
Oh,

463
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,020
what did you want to say just now?

464
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,830
Nothing.

465
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,270
Didn't you say you were going to buy me a sugar figurine?

466
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,070
Pick one yourself.

467
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,490
Sir.

468
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,880
Here's the money.

469
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,510
Okay.

470
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,980
I didn't expect you to be so good at it.

471
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,540
What?

472
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,570
Flattering girls.

473
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,570
Have you ever liked anyone?

474
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,300
What a boring question.

475
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,510
Why do we have to like someone?

476
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,050
If you say that,

477
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,440
maybe you won't understand the taste of love.

478
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,700
I'm not interested.

479
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,740
I'm not interested.

480
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,100
Her Ladyship

481
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,020
eventually pushed herself too much.

482
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,720
Second Young Master's ambitions are clear now.

483
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,130
I'm afraid he won't give up easily.

484
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,700
With his mediocre skills,

485
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,190
he actually dared to provoke Her Ladyship.

486
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,720
If First Young Demon Lord were to fully recover,

487
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,180
then there would be nothing to worry about.

488
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:13,980
However...

489
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,960
now...

490
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,710
Or...

491
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,790
how about cutting off Second Young Demon Lord's horn

492
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,490
as well?

493
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,310
Not only do you have a bad memory,

494
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,060
but you also love to daydream.

495
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,760
Is cutting off a kylin's horn like chopping firewood?

496
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,800
As far as I know,

497
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,780
the kylin's horn of Shi Qi

498
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,300
is not fully developed.

499
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,620
Whether you cut it or not doesn't matter.

500
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,810
No wonder his brain doesn't work well.

501
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,210
First Young Demon Lord,

502
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,620
you must take care of yourself.

503
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,540
I'm fine.

504
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,120
I just exerted too much force.

505
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,100
Now that I think about it,

506
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,220
there's no need to use so much strength

507
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,040
to deal with my brother.

508
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,940
Thank you, Bei Zuo,

509
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,270
and Mo Jialuo, for giving me the two fragments.

510
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,960
Otherwise,

511
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,110
my power

512
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,500
wouldn't have recovered so quickly.

513
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,900
Since you said that,

514
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,760
I

515
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,420
feel relieved.

516
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,140
Once you gather all the fragments,

517
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,740
Second Young Demon Lord

518
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,430
will be kneeling and begging you for mercy.

519
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,430
So,

520
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,290
I earnestly request your permission

521
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,530
to return to the human world immediately

522
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,480
to search for the remaining fragments,

523
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,980
to help you regain your authority as soon as possible.

524
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,430
Well then, I'll...

525
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,550
we'll...

526
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,690
take our leave.

527
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,330
Old turtle,

528
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,380
you're so slow

529
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,730
that I'll catch up to you in no time.

530
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,170
Just go.

531
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,460
My Lady,

532
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,500
what are you worried about?

533
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,370
You can tell me.

534
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,780
I can help ease your worries.

535
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,690
How about...

536
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,440
How about...

537
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,870
I cast an illusion realm?

538
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,350
And there will be only you

539
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,540
and me...

540
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:27,920
Got it.

541
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,310
I'll leave on my own.

542
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,660
Uncle,

543
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,510
is the entrance to the Demon Realm

544
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,670
that intelligence mentioned really here?

545
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,340
It comes from our Xuanyuan family's veteran scout.

546
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,440
It should be accurate.

547
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,050
It's a bit weird.

548
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,470
Usually,

549
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,540
the entrances to the Demon Realm

550
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,320
are set up on open plains.

551
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,060
That way, they can transport more troops.

552
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,010
Why did the demon clan

553
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,600
set the entrance here?

554
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,620
Perhaps

555
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,680
Perhaps this is not a commonly used entrance.

556
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,090
This place is densely wooded.

557
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,090
There might be demons lying in ambush here.

558
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
Once we go inside,

559
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,400
we must be extremely careful

560
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,300
and look out for each other.

561
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,060
Everyone, be cautious.

562
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,150
Let's keep searching further in.

563
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,830
No, no.

564
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,950
I can't walk anymore.

565
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,730
Let's take a rest.

566
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,460
I'm so tired and thirsty.

567
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,220
Mo Lan.

568
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,540
Mo Lan!

569
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,840
Have some water.

570
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,210
Yan,

571
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,480
don't be too tense.

572
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,410
We'll find Miss Shi Si.

573
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,940
Here, have some water.

574
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,430
It's getting late.

575
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,240
We can’t go on like this.

576
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,190
Lan,

577
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:47,780
Uncle,

578
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,780
let's split up and search.

579
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,750
Okay.

580
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,000
Mo Lan, wait for me!

581
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,300
Yan!

582
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,360
What's wrong with her?

583
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,920
We encountered some low-level demons.

584
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,090
She twisted her ankle.

585
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,430
You encountered them too?

586
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,260
Yan,

587
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,890
there's something strange about this mountain.

588
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,260
Low-level demons usually don't act in groups.

589
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,360
But I didn't find their leader.

590
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,030
I also think something's fishy.

591
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,790
They are clearly

592
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,290
under someone's direction.

593
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,500
But in this mountain,

594
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,850
I haven't found any other group of people.

595
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,170
Where is my Second Uncle?

596
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,730
Long time no see,

597
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:23,930
Yu.

598
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,310
Did you miss me?

599
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:28,510
You...

600
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,540
Who dares to move?

601
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,720
Yu,

602
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,320
last time we parted too hastily.

603
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
I didn't get a chance

604
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,140
to be close to you.

605
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,770
You're not him.

606
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,510
Don't talk to me with his face.

607
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,790
Are you okay?

608
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,480
I’m fine.

609
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,450
Second Young Demon Lord.

610
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,210
Wutan,

611
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,070
which one is my brother-in-law?

612
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,230
That wooden dummy over there.

613
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,550
You deal with that one.

614
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,080
I'll have some fun with my brother-in-law.

615
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,420
Okay.

616
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,510
Why aren't you coming out? What are you waiting for?

617
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,630
Mo Lan!

618
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,750
Are you alright?

619
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,350
Yu,

620
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,880
come to me.

621
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,250
Second Uncle?

622
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,880
You actually betrayed us?

623
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,130
You joined the demon clan?

624
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,909
No.

625
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,760
The demon clan accepted me.

626
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:15,969
Mo Lan!

627
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,429
The water was poisoned.

628
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,489
Uncle, you...

629
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
You are indeed the future head of the Mo family.

630
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,310
You had suspected me from the start.

631
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,300
You didn't have the water and food I prepared.

632
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,000
I was just being cautious.

633
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,150
Here.

634
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:29,800
Have some water.

635
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,280
Lan, take Xuanyuan Yu away!

636
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:33,870
No!

637
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
I'll be with you!

638
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,290
Brother-in-law,

639
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,630
let's play a bit more.

640
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,110
You are quitting?

641
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,380
I'm quitting.

642
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:45,840
Wutan,

643
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,270
look at my brother-in-law's style.

644
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,030
Brother-in-law,

645
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,590
how about you let me play with your sword for a while?

646
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,719
I thought it would be harder.

647
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,600
But now I've got it in my hand, haven't I?

648
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,630
Brother-in-law,

649
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,400
It's a pity that I set up such a big plan

650
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,690
and had Xuanyuan Sheng arrange some low-level demons

651
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,140
to fight with you first to wear you down.

652
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,060
Xuanyuan Sheng,

653
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,960
thanks to you this time.

654
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,060
Congratulations, Second Young Demon Lord.

655
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,260
Brother-in-law,

656
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,880
do you know

657
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,410
why I took your sword?

658
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,110
My sister and I are both kylins.

659
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,300
Ordinary weapons can't harm us.

660
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,000
But we are vulnerable

661
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,810
to the swords Gan Jiang and Mo Ye.

662
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,510
After I thought about it,

663
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,540
I realized it wasn't entirely hopeless.

664
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,360
By the way, brother-in-law,

665
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,810
yesterday I went to have a friendly spar with my sister,

666
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,910
but she was very rude to me.

667
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,510
Although I failed yesterday,

668
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,820
today I've got Mo Ye Sword.

669
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,600
Brother-in-law,

670
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,880
can you guess

671
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,470
when I plan to kill her?

672
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,390
You can't use it.

673
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,610
Interesting.

674
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,680
So this thing can only be used by its owner, right?

675
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,460
Second Young Demon Lord,

676
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,480
I’ll kill him.

677
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,270
Wutan,

678
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,180
don't be so petty.

679
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,500
Don't always talk about killing.

680
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,250
Brother-in-law,

681
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,210
why don't you come back to the Demon Realm with me

682
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,940
and have a nice chat with my sister?

683
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,800
That's exactly what I want.
