[Episode 24]

4
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:42,470
Where are they?

5
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:44,800
Take a guess.

6
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,090
You are half-bred!

7
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,150
Who are you to fight against me?

8
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,210
You're purebred.

9
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,770
Come and try.

10
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,310
I'm going to show you today

11
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,900
what the chosen demon is.

12
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,230
I don't want to know at all.

13
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:04,980
Your Lordship,

14
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,060
let me help you.

15
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,370
Get out of my way.

16
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,120
Your Lordship.

17
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,670
Brother Mo Lan.

18
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,340
All of you are here.

19
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,220
You traitors!

20
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,650
They haven't finished casting the spell yet.

21
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,080
If the three of them are interrupted now,

22
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,790
their lives will be in danger.

23
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,840
If the demon clan comes here,

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,030
we must try our best

25
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,190
to guard the last line of defense.

26
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,800
Okay.

27
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,020
We weren't born on the same day,

28
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,030
but I hope we can die on the same day.

29
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,670
Demon Lord.

30
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,240
Where is the eye of the formation?

31
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,390
I haven't found it yet.

32
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,570
You loser!

33
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,180
Tell me where the eye of the formation is,

34
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,920
and I'll reward you with death.

35
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,850
You're the son of the dragon and the human?

36
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,920
Traitor.

37
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,180
I'm giving you one more chance.

38
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,230
Tell me.

39
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,000
Let go of Mo Lan!

40
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,430
Mo Lan,

41
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,390
are you all right?

42
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,720
Don't come here, Yu!

43
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,840
Demon Lord,

44
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,360
the eye of the formation is on her.

45
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,030
Wutan,

46
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,210
go.

47
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,810
Kill her.

48
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,670
I don't allow...

49
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,660
anyone to hurt Yu.

50
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,030
Second Uncle!

51
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,390
Second Uncle.

52
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,720
Second Uncle.

53
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,990
Second Uncle.

54
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,790
Second Uncle.

55
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,620
Yu,

56
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,210
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,950
I was wrong.

58
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,390
Second Uncle.

59
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,020
Second Uncle!

60
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,340
Yu...

61
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,860
Yu.

62
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,940
I'm so useless.

63
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,040
I can't even protect the person I love.

64
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,950
If I...

65
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,800
If I can be stronger,

66
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,520
maybe I can take her away.

67
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,410
I can make you stronger.

68
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,770
Do you want to try?

69
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,610
Who are you?

70
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,520
I'm a demon.

71
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,650
From today onwards,

72
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,670
if you give me your consciousness and body,

73
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,830
I will make you stronger.

74
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,430
One day,

75
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,950
you can protect the one you love.

76
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,710
Okay.

77
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,530
A bunch of losers!

78
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,450
Yu,

79
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,470
go!

80
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,260
Mo Lan.

81
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,320
Just go!

82
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,990
Mo Lan!

83
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,140
Where's the eye of the formation?

84
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,159
Forget it.

85
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,640
Show yourselves now.

86
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,659
Otherwise, these people are going to die with you.

87
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,110
Three.

88
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,760
Two.

89
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,550
One!

90
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,950
Fairy Fangfei,

91
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,310
why are you getting involved in this?

92
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,540
I don't want to talk

93
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,110
to a despicable person like you.

94
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,570
Fairy,

95
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,030
you've stayed away from conflicts for years.

96
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,510
I advise you to stay out of this.

97
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,650
This is my son and daughter-in-law's business.

98
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,970
Why should I stay out of this?

99
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,270
But Demon Lord, you're alone.

100
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,570
I'm sure you can't understand this kind of happiness!

101
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,540
Mother!

102
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,110
Sister,

103
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,550
today, either you die

104
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,970
or I die.

105
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,830
Shi Qi,

106
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,050
stop it

107
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,670
before it's too late.

108
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,360
Violence is not the only way to solve problems.

109
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,450
Cut the crap!

110
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,630
Mother.

111
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,380
Mother.

112
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,270
Do you think this will be over

113
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,710
because I can't do anything to you?

114
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,360
When I went up the mountain,

115
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,230
I already cast the Blood Moon Illusion Spell.

116
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,330
Soon,

117
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,150
the whole mountain

118
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,230
and even the five towns down the mountain

119
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,940
will be destroyed.

120
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,960
So what if you kill every human and every demon?

121
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,000
So what if you can rule the world?

122
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,160
There will be nothing but a ruin.

123
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,620
Stop it!

124
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,640
Cut the crap.

125
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,080
Shi Si,

126
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,360
why are you so selfish?

127
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,560
You spent four years in the mortal world.

128
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,770
Why haven't you learned to care about the world?

129
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,080
I only wanted your life,

130
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,790
but now, so many people are going to die with you.

131
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,380
Come on.

132
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,640
Absorb the last fragment

133
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,720
and give me the complete kylin horns.

134
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,040
Then I can spare those

135
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,830
innocent people.

136
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,270
Shi Si,

137
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,150
no.

138
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,270
We don't have time to remove

139
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,710
the poisonous aura on the fragment.

140
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,610
If you are invaded by the poison,

141
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,860
you will die!

142
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,650
I promise you.

143
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,500
Shi Si.

144
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,140
Shi Si.

145
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,150
Shi Si,

146
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,370
no.

147
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,680
There must be another way.

148
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,140
This is the only way

149
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,800
to save the world.

150
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,800
No!

151
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,860
Shi Si.

152
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,530
Shi Si.

153
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,110
You'll become the vessel for my cultivation ultimately.

154
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,720
Demon Lord,

155
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,330
I'm going to kill them all.

156
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,970
I'm going to have the complete kylin horns.

157
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,550
What's the use of keeping a loser like you?

158
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:31,670
Shi Si.

159
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,820
Shi Si.

160
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,570
What...

161
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,070
What did you do?

162
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,030
Honey,

163
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,040
make or break.

164
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,350
You think the Blood Moon Illusion Spell

165
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,900
can control people's minds

166
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,060
because there are weaknesses in human nature.

167
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,090
But what you don't know is

168
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,950
although there are

169
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,010
weaknesses in human nature,

170
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,970
once they have a goal,

171
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,280
their strength and persistence

172
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,450
will be beyond your imagination.

173
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,050
This world is a jungle.

174
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,380
Why can't the demon clan be the ruler?

175
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,990
Why can't the demon clan

176
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,660
be the ruler?

177
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:11,730
Shi Si.

178
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,910
Shi Si.

179
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,000
Shi Si.

180
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,960
Shi Si.

181
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,740
Shi Si.

182
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,900
Hang in there.

183
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,250
We did it,

184
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,900
Mo Yan.

185
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,600
It's all over.

186
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,520
Both the human race and the demon clan have been saved.

187
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,530
Hang in there.

188
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,110
I'm going to take you back to Xiao Xuan Village now.

189
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,870
Mo Yan,

190
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,210
a few days ago, you told me

191
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,160
you want to...

192
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,750
spend the rest of your life with me.

193
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,560
Now,

194
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,130
looks like I'll let you down.

195
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,390
Shi Si,

196
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,330
you'll be fine.

197
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,240
I will figure out a way to save you.

198
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,850
Shi Si.

199
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,340
Promise me

200
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,350
you'll stay alive.

201
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,420
Don't make me worried again.

202
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,310
Okay?

203
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,830
Shi Si,

204
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,720
you can't die.

205
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,930
You promised me

206
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,550
you won't leave me.

207
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,820
I still haven't taken you...

208
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,780
to enjoy the beauty of this world.

209
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,420
We still have a lot of things

210
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,920
to do together.

211
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,630
We promised to spend the rest of our lives together.

212
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,980
Don't leave me behind.

213
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,330
Okay?

214
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,200
Mo Yan.

215
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,090
I...

217
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,160
I love you so much.

218
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,420
In the next life...

219
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,630
In the next life,

220
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,730
marry me again.

221
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,680
Okay?

222
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,750
Okay.

223
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,620
I promise you.

224
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,450
I promise you.

225
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,550
This time,

226
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,950
we can't only spend two years together.

227
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,410
We should...

228
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,190
be with each other forever.

229
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,210
Shi Si.

230
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,180
Shi Si.

231
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,770
Shi Si!

232
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,090
Shi Si!

233
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,840
Shi Si!

234
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,350
Shi Si.

235
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,680
[Four years ago]

236
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,270
Get ready to set out.

237
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,290
-Yes.
-Yes.

238
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,100
Wait.

239
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,750
You?

240
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,840
Do you want to die?

241
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,010
Ridiculous.

242
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,580
I'm going to purge the human world to make contributions

243
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,650
so that I can rule the Demon Realm.

244
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,000
Sister,

245
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,320
don't stand in my way.

246
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,420
Or I'll kill you.

247
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,190
Brother,

248
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,190
you are...

249
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,730
not ruthless

250
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,270
but talkative.

251
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,640
I won't let you die.

252
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,480
Let's go!

253
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,280
-Yes.
-Yes.

254
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,720
Stop crying.

255
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,600
Help her up.

256
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,330
That old man

257
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,900
wants to kill us.

258
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,170
He's not even close to it.

259
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,530
Help her up now.

260
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,630
Hurry!

261
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,340
Shi Si and I

262
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,520
were adopted by Shuo Tian.

263
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,900
He was just an ordinary demon at first.

264
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,490
After he started to compete for resources with the human race,

265
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,810
he became very aggressive.

266
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,290
Gradually, he became the ruler of the demon clan.

267
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,200
He even killed our father.

268
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,290
I did what I did

269
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,340
to take back what belongs to me!

270
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,080
Sister.

271
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:28,220
[Mo's Mansion]

272
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,870
These are the human race's dumplings?

273
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,260
Yes.

274
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,960
Learn from me.

275
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,270
How is it going?

276
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,720
My Lady, look at this.

277
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,880
So cute.

278
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,860
There are many more here.

279
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,730
We can eat them later.

280
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,350
Okay.

281
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,360
Yu.

282
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,070
Mo Lan.

283
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,950
You're back.

284
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,430
Where did you go?

285
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,150
I went to deliver the goods for Chinese New Year to Doctor Toad.

286
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,240
Take a rest first.

287
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:49,780
Okay.

288
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,130
-Put the stuffing on it.
-Go.

289
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,550
Like this.

290
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,470
Elder Bei Zuo.

291
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,310
Happy Chinese New Year.

292
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,430
Happy Chinese New Year.

293
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,040
Brother Mo Lan.

294
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,420
Be ready to eat.

295
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,010
You're back.

296
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,270
What is this?

297
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,060
Lower.

298
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,400
Eat later.

299
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:08,930
Okay.

300
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,030
Have you put up the couplets?

301
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,290
Almost there, Elder.

302
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,950
Okay.

303
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,590
Here.

304
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,480
Step on it.

305
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,160
Young Master Dongling,

306
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,970
according to your order,

307
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,800
we've delivered the goods for Chinese New Year to the side families.

308
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,090
It's been a year.

309
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,070
Thank you.

310
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,720
Share this with everyone.

311
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,900
Thank you, Young Master Dongling.

312
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,780
The meal is ready.

313
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,680
-Time to eat.
-Coming.

314
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,710
Everyone, come quickly.

315
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,400
Dumplings are here.

316

Come quickly.

317
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,390
The dumplings are cooked.

318
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,260
Look.

319

The meal is ready.

320
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,970
Put it there.

321
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,820
Xiaohe,

322
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,670
you're amazing.

323
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,540
I made them myself.

324
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:45,960
You did?

325
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,710
I made this.

326
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,790
I'm impressed.

327
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,190
What's the stuffing of the dumplings?

328
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:49,770
Meat.

329
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,580
Meat is my favorite.

330
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:51,890
Come on.

331
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,150
Let's make a toast.

332
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:53,570
Come on.

333

Have a seat.

341

Try the dumplings I made.

342
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,770
I want to go there to eat.

343

You eat that.

344
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,340
Try this.

345
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,260
If you like them,

346
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,120
I'll make more for you in the future.

347
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,910
Try this. It's good.

348
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,510
Try this.

349
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,450
This smells so good.

350
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,500
This tastes good.

351
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,130
Delicious.

352
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,210
Eat more.

353
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,550
It's so beautiful.

354
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,470
Don't enjoy the scenery.

355
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,950
Look at me.

356
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,270
Thank you.

Mo Yan.

358
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,990
For what?

359
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,190
Thank you

360
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,880
for giving me a home.

361
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,030
I should thank you too.

362
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,470
For what?

363
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,110
Thank you for choosing to marry me back then.

364
00:27:54,150 --> 00:28:00,550
[The end]
