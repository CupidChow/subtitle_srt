4
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,139
The landlady is missing.

5
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,490
-Mo Yan.
-Be careful.

6
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,200
I sense demon aura.

7
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,840
Mo Yan, look over there.

8
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,920
That paper crane.

9
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,990
Follow me closely.

10
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,220
Don't be afraid.

11
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,090
It stinks.

12
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,829
Is there a partition inside?

13
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,160
I don't know if there is.

14
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,580
It seems

15
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,020
like a barrier.

16
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,060
Step back.

17
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,080
Step back.

Little Ling!

21
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,440
Come.

22
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,470
Come out. Be careful.

23
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,900
Little Ling, are you alright?

24
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,360
I’m fine, Mother.

25
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,990
Let me see.

26
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,110
Are you all right?

27
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:29,960
Yes.

28
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,890
Don't be afraid.

29
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,070
Mother.

30
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,360
Don't be afraid.

Mother.

32
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,740
The crow's crows are rough and omnivorous.

33
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,140
They enjoy rotten food,

34
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,820
and they stink.

35
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,530
What about the other kids?

36
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,680
Of course they were absorbed by me.

37
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,980
Children's spiritual energy is so useful.

38
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,690
In order to cover up the rotten smell,

39
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,650
you used a lot of spices.

40
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,540
Where is Bailing?

41
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,740
Bailing?

42
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,020
I killed that woman long ago.

43
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,080
I just transformed into her.

44
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,659
This woman was quite useful.

45
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,570
I deceived many children using her.

46
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,270
You will be in great trouble.

47
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,240
Just wait.

48
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,550
I'm just the beginning.

49
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,500
I'm not even a fragment.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,110

Don't worry.

What are you thinking?

57
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,310
I'm thinking about

58
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,710
what that crow said.

59
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,620
It's useless to tell you.

60
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,940
That crow

61
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,310
seems to know me.

62
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,360
He's from the demon clan.

63
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,580
Why would he know you?

64
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,630
Maybe I lost my memory

65
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,570
and I forgot.

66
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,320
That's because

67
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,550
I’m the Young Lady of the Xuanyuan family.

68
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,480

70
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,590

71
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,030
about you being unprofessional,

72
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,670

73
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,080
idle,

74
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,530

to pursue the man you love boldly.

78
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,150
If you like Sikong Shaoyun so much,

79
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,560
why are you willing to marry me?

80
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,010
It was just puppy love.

81
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,150
It's not worth mentioning.

82
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,760
Hypocritical.

83
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,790
Do you want the truth?

84
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,590
Of course it's...

85
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Because I haven't met you yet.

86
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,670
If you did,

87
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,480
what would you have done?

88
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,270
If I did...

89
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,730
you'd be the one

90
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,150
I would confess my feelings to.

91
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,590
I know you love someone else.

92
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,169
When it's just the two of us,

93
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,669
no need to act.

94
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,130
I'm not acting.

95
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,080
I just...

96
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,159
I just...

97
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,030
I just want to get close to you.

98
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,930
We'll only be married for two years.

99
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,710
You don't have to force yourself.

100

Three years.

101
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,670

Aren't you in a hurry to meet Sikong?

103
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,500
My Lady,

104
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,990
will you consummate tonight?

105
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,740
I'm afraid it's unlikely.

106
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,560
That's right.

107
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,720
I've calculated for you.

108
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,120
There's no rush.

109
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,080
You have to take your time.

110
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,660
How?

111
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,500
You need to do it step by step.

112
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,700
Like holding hands first.

113
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,990
Holding hands?

114
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,470
I held his hand before.

115
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,700
I don't know why

116
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,090
every time I see his hand,

117
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,950
I want to hold it.

118
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,990
And then?

119
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,300
Then...

120
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,320
he seemed reluctant.

121
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,300
It's okay, My Lady.

122
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,330
We won't pay mind to this.

123
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,960
-You’re married into Mo’s Mansion.
-Youngest Madam Yu.

124
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:36,930
By the way,

125
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,980
did you recall anything recently?

126
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,530
However,

127
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,110
when I approach Mo Yan,

128
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,870
I get a strange feeling.

129
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,320
And

130
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,760
the way the crow

131
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,230
looked at me

132
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,890
wasn't quite right.

133
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,170
Crow?

134
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,700
Did you run into a demon?

135
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,630
Yes.

136
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,570
He also said

137
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,440
we're in danger.

138
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,130
My Lady.

139
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,260
My Lady, what's wrong?

140
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,130
Are you okay?

141
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,370
It's strange.

142
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,230
There are some

143
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,490
strange images in my mind.

144
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,640
Don't be too anxious.

145
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,690
It's driving you into hysteria.

146
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,680
Xiaohe, go back first.

147
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,270
My Lady, where are you going?

148
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,070
Mo Yan, when you go to slay demons,

149
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,400
can you take me with you?

150
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,380
What for?

151
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,230
Maybe

152
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,890
my memory loss three years ago has something to do with this.

153
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,020
To hold me back?

154
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,510
Mo Yan.

155
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,660
Today,

156
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,170
I kinda helped you.

157
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,790
I'll be more useful in the future.

158
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,580
By the way,

159
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,020
for the two moves today

160
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,540
Moon Chasing and Wind Breaking.

161
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,680
Can you teach them to me?

162
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,360
Why do you want to learn magic?

163
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,720
I don't know.

164
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,420
I just think

165
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,590
I should learn it.

166
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,690
You're so stupid;

167
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,940
Where did you get the confidence?

168
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,420
You're the stupid one.

169
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,500
If I ever...

170
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,310
Ever what?

171
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,980
Nothing.

172
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,560
Please.

173
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,700
Please teach me.

174
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,560
Mo Yan.

175
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,030
Please teach me.

176
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,060
Fine.

177
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,100
I'll only teach you once.

178
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:52,640
Okay.

179
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,880
I'm ready.

180
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,610
I'll take notes.

181
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,310
Let's start.

182
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,610
It's said that the early bird gets the worm.

183
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,860
I'm a smart early bird.

184
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,190
Wind Breaking.

185
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,450
Moon Chasing.

186
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,490
I haven't learned them yet.

187
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,580
Didn't you take notes?

188
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,990
Go back and figure it out.

189
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,510
But...

190
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,380
Mo Yan.

191
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,770
I think you're different from what others say.

192
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,630
You're not that cold-hearted

193
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,060
or that hard to get along with.

194
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,990
I don't care.

195
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,090
In that case, I don't care

196
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,140
about my reputation too.

197
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,120
Mo Yan.

198
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,200
If you really believed the rumors,

199
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,700
you wouldn't have taught me.

200
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,190
One should come to their own conclusions about things.

201
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,480
Ask away if you want.

202
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,180
Young Master, how long do you plan to stay here?

203
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,390
She didn't ask me to go back.

204
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,210
That's your new room too.

205
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,820
Can't you go back as you wish?

206
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,430
Coming out and going back all by myself.

207
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,020
I can't do this.

208
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,630
It's embarrassing?

209
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,920
But

210
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,670
Young Madam comes to you so often.

211
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,800
She gave you an out,

212
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,030
so when will you take it?

213
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,070
She's here to learn magic from me.

214
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,940
As a girl,

215
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,570
she just had to make an excuse.

216
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,030
Mo Yan.

217
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,210
I think you're different from what others say.

218
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,830
You're not that cold-hearted

219
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,610
or that hard to get along with.

220
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,750
Could it be that

221
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,260
she was explaining to me?

222
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,760
If you really believed the rumors,

223
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,090
you wouldn't have taught me.

224
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,110
Young Master,

225
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,610
please don't break her heart.

226
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,500
She's so involved with that Sikong Shaoyun.

227
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,000
How could she be hurt by me?

228
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,110
Even a bystander knows

229
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,580
that Young Madam

230
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,120
only has you in her heart.

231
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,820
Hello, Young Master Yan.

232
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,170
Young Master Yan.

233
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:24,900
Father.

234
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,620
Yan.

235
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,880
Is there anything new?

236
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,000
Father,

237
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,840
on my wedding day,

238
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,790
a crow of the demon clan came to attack.

239
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,310
After Mo Lan and I destroyed them together,

240
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,400
there has been no abnormal activities from the demon clan.

241
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,640
But yesterday, the spy reported that

242
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,990
the farmers in the suburb farm said

243
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,380
the sheep were killed frequently.

244
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,010
I sent Mo Lan there,

245
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,930
but I didn't sense demon aura.

246
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,160
It's been three years since the war between the two clans.

247
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,450
Are the peaceful days

248
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,130
coming to an end?

249
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,540
If, as you've said,

250
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,580
they

251
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,640
have set up a barrier

252
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,830
to hide their aura,

253
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,480
I'm afraid things won't be that simple.

254
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,400
Could it be...

255
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,450
Demon Lord Shuo Tian

256
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,589
is about to make a new move?

257
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,160
I'm assuming that too.

258
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,910
That day at the tavern,

259
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,020
if that paper crane

260
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,339
didn't mess up the crow's mind,

261
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,040
causing him to expose his aura,

262
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,540
Mo Lan and I

263
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,640
wouldn't have even sense his aura.

264
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,970
The clue is still not clear.

265
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,970
You've to be

266
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,360
bold yet cautious and act with discretion.

267
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,560
Yes.

268
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,570
Yan, take a seat.

269
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,140
Yan.

270
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,650
Is there anything going on at home lately?

271
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,740
Father, you're referring to...

272
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,730
How are things going with the Xuanyuan family's daughter?

273
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,020
You're the future head of Mo family.

274
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,160
You should look at the world

275
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,590
and be ambitious.

276
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,730
One should live by principles.

277
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,690
Always act appropriately.

278
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,270
So it'll not reflect badly on you out there.

279
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,220
Don't argue with a woman.

280
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,540
Father, don't worry.

281
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,080
Since I've married her,

282
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,710
I won't run away anymore.

283
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,230
Speaking of which,

284
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,630
let me ask you,

285
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,320
why did you run away

286
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,350
and then come back?

287
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,530
Some things

288
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,210
are not solved yet.

289
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,940
Are you doing this for the demon clan?

290
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,840
You're indeed a man of Mo family.

291
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,730
You've my style.

292
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,110
Compared to killing demons and upholding justice,

293
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,570
love

294
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,900
is not worth mentioning.

295
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,780
Has your mother come back this year?

296
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,210
Not yet.

297
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,660
Still not back?

298
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,510
Didn't Father say

299
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,040
love

300
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,390
isn't worth mentioning?

301
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,130
It's better if she's not coming back.

302
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,980
We find each other annoying,

303
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,520
and can't have a decent conversation.

304
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,240
The things she says

305
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,660
give me a headache.

306
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,020
I can't be bothered to argue with her.

307
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,090
Young Master.

308
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,280
Young Master.

309
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,330
Did you make Master angry again?

310
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,190
Don't mind him.

311
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,780
He's fighting with my mom again.

312
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,320
Brother Yan,

313
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,580
the suburb...

314
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,590
Something is fishy.

315
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,770
I'll go there myself.

316
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,930
We'll stay there for a few days

317
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,590
and figure out what's going on.

318
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,630
Get prepared.

319
00:19:59,050 --> 00:19:59,610
Okay.

320
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,290
Mo Yan.

321
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,640
Can you bring me

322
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,030
on your demon-slaying missions in the future?

323
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:09,970
Young Master.

324
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,830
What's wrong?

325
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,520
Where's Xuanyuan Yu?

326
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,740
My Lady, are you okay?

327
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,130
Mother.

328
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,180
Let me tell you.

329
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,710
Something happened just now,

330
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,970
and it's very interesting.

331
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,090
Xuanyuan Yu?

332
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,610
What're you doing here?

333
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,360
Yes.

334
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,980
Oh, my goodness.

335
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,600
Even if I used my feet to embroider,

336
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,940
it'd probably be better than this.

337
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,420
Yu,

338
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,970
your stitching is indeed

339
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,880
a bit too wild.

340
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,370
One could say it's completely disorganised.

341
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,910
Didn't your mother teach you needlework?

342
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,870
This stitch doesn't look ladylike.

343
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,190
Exactly.

344
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,250
My brother is unlucky to marry a wife like you.

345
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,180
It's really a shame.

346
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,210
You're a woman.

347
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,260
You should know how to do these things.

348
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,240
You don't know needlework,

349
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,550
and you can't cook either.

350
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,720
Yan is so unfortunate.

351
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,140
In such a big Mo family,

352
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,580
there're so many people.

353
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,360
My husband has food to eat and clothes to wear.

354
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,470
Why should I do these things

355
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,890
that have nothing to do with killing demons?

356
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,260
What do you mean why?

357
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,550
This is what women are supposed to do.

358
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,850
My family didn't teach me that.

359
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,750
But

360
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,960
someone told me that

361
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,760
a girl

362
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,070
should pursue what she loves,

363
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,220
and shouldn't be trapped by the pedantic rules.

364
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,030
Your argument

365
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,970
sounds just like

366
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,070
Madam Ye who abandoned her family.

367
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,160
You must have heard about it.

368
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,010
Yan's birth mother, Mrs Ye,

369
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,690
is the kind of strange woman you just mentioned.

370
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,990
Not long after she gave birth to Yan,

371
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,380
she said she's going out to venture the world.

372
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,710
It was an unusual thing to happen back then.

373
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,830
I saw that no one was disciplining Yan.

374
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,290
I'm afraid he'll go astray,

375
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,600
so I made every effort to raise him.

376
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,870
Unfortunately,

377
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,510
he doesn't appreciate it.

378
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,970
He's just like those

379
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,720
ungrateful people out there.

380
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,990
What are you saying, Second Madam?

381
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,330
Now, I finally understand,

382
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,890
all your efforts

383
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,070
has been dedicated to my husband.

384
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,860
Instead, you've neglected

385
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:15,990
your son's discipline.

386
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,950
My son.

387
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,800
It's none of your business.

388
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,310
My husband doesn't need your criticism too.

389
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,450
He's my brother.

390
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,600
Useless!

391
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,660
Second Madam,

392
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,250
it seems that your perception on second young master

393
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,510
is very accurate.

394
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,130
You...

395
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,920
But

396
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,250
you've really

397
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,850
underestimated my husband.

398
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,630
After all, you're too busy with needlework.

399
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,600
I can understand that you've poor judgement.

400
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,300
Also,

401
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,510
Madam Ye is just traveling.

402
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,730
Mo Family's female head is still around,

403
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,730
so I suggest Second Madam to mind your own matters.

404
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,710
Xiaohe.

405
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,190
You...

406
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,560
Mother.

407
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,430
Look.

408
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,400
Isn't my embroidery better than her?

409
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,450
Useless!

410
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,350
Mother, don't go!

411
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,930
I'll show you my embroidery when I'm done.

412
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,560
Mother!

413
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,910
Young Madam.

414
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,720
You were amazing just now.

415
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,520
Young Madam.

416
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,860
You actually left Second Madam speechless.

417
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,740
Why are you here?

418
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,770
Where's Mo Yan?

419
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,330
Young Master.

420
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,790
Young Master!

421
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,400
Young Master, wait for me!

422
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,070
Mo...

423
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,780
Why is he here?

424
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,950
Is he here for you, My Lady?

425
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
Why did he come and then just leave?

426
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,130
Well, I don't know about that.

427
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,590
My Lady,

428
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,800
why did you talk back to Second Madam again?

429
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,500
She's the one who started it.

430
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,200
My Lady,

431
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,880
just turn a deaf ear to some words.

432
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,880
Why bother going against her?

433
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,290
I don't like it when people talk nonsense.

434
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,220
Especially...

435
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,700
What?

436
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,740
Nothing.

437
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,150
That's strange.

438
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,450
My Lady, you usually

439
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,310
speak one word at a time,

440
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,400
but why is it when you're with Second Madam,

441
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,630
you talk so fluently?

442
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,970
Now that I'm married,

443
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,030
I should fulfill my duty as a good wife.

444
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,250
I won't allow anyone to slander him.

445
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,090
I see.

446
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,040
Anger has got to your head.

447
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,950
I wonder if it has opened up your Ren and Du meridians,

448
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,390
and let you regain your magic.

449
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,380
Oh yes!

450
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,400
Let me try!

451
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,760
Xiaohe, you...

452
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,870
My Lady, calm down.

453
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,530
Perhaps Young Master heard

454
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,540
what you just said,

455
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,720
and he's probably thrilled beyond words now.

456
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,320
Of course,

457
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,900
it's because I've never seen you before.

458
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,260
If I did...

459
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,350
you'd be the one

460
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,610
I confessed my love to on the street.

461
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,570
Young Master.

462
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,110
Slow down.

463
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,050
Don't you know how long your legs are?

464
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,040
I know.

465
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,840
She's completely smitten with me.

466
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,180
Just pretend

467
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,050
that you don't know anything.

468
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,050
You must pretend.

469
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,670
Young Master, stop looking.

470
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,090
Young Madam won’t be coming.

471
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,930
Who said I'm waiting for her?

472
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,640
Xiaohe, I'm going out.

473
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,540
My Lady.

474
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,660
Where are you going at this late hour?

475
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,310
I'm going to find Mo Yan to practice my magic.

476
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,470
You guys are really inseparable.

477
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,790
Am I going to lose to Mo Yu?

478
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,970
What are you saying?

479
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,360
Nothing.

480
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,760
Why hasn't she invited me to the bedroom?

481
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,160
She probably knows she's in the wrong.

482
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,390
Eldest Young Madam.

483
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,680
Madam Ye asked me to tell you that

484
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,850
she left something

485
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,510
for her future daughter-in-law in the ancestral hall.

486
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,660
Let me know when you're free to get it.

487
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:33,810
Okay.

488
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,040
Madam Ye.

489
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,480
Eldest Young Madam, it's in there.
