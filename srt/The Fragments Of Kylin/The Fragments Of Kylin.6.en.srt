[The Fragments Of Kylin]

00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,690
[Episode 6]

4
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,190
You saw it too, right?

5
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,970
You also saw that she absorbed the fragment.

6
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,729
Yes.

7
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,000
Do you still remember this?

8
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,720
After the war back then,

9
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,610
we besieged the Yanzi Mountain to kill Shu Hu.

10
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,330
After three days and three nights,

11
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,660
we finally managed to kill him.

12
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,470
Golden fragments

13
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,260
burst out of his body.

14
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,730
Later,

15
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,440
I made the fragments into a spiritual weapon

16
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,900
to reinforce the armor.

17
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,210
Since then,

18
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,680
Wanwusu

19
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,060
has had the power to give life to inanimate objects

20
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,290
and has been used for tracking by me.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,200
We have been suspecting

22
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,060
the fragments have something to do with the demon clan.

23
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,650
This time,

24
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,210
Wolf King personally verified everything.

25
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,980
The fragments

26
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,880
can make the demon clan stronger

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,000
and help them hide their traces.

28
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,220
Yu doesn't have martial arts skills at all.

29
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
She doesn't even

30
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,680
have any internal power in her body.

31
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,530
But the fragment

32
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,270
actually can be integrated into her body.

33
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,430
Tell me.

34
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,520
Why?

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,060
You don't dare to say.

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,260
But I don't even dare to think about it.

37
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,180
You're awake.

38
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,310
You can't sleep?

39
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,110
Are you angry?

40
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,710
Yes.

41
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,870
That's why

42
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,070
you didn't talk to me today?

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,010
Yes.

44
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,990
Is it because of the fragment?

45
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:49,840
Yes.

46
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,120
I don't know what happened either.

47
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,230
I lost my memory three years ago.

48
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,820
I don't know any spell.

49
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,180
Why did the fragment enter my body?

50
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,540
I didn't do anything.

51
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,620
I really don't know.

52
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,290
I'm not mad at you.

53
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,860
You said you don't know.

54
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,020
I believe you.

55
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,840
I taught you martial arts every day.

56
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,200
Of course I know what you can do and what you can't do.

57
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,730
But there are too many mysteries about you.

58
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,360
You can absorb the fragments.

59
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,460
After getting hurt,

60
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,300
you can heal on your own very quickly.

61
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,460
The reason why you lost your memory three years ago is also unknown.

62
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,500
So,

63
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,250
I'm mad at myself.

64
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:01,290
I know you have a special identity,

65
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,020
but I still can't help it.

66
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,670
Have you ever thought

67
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,530
maybe I've been lying to you?

68
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,890
You're right.

69
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,120
I lost my memory.

70
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,670
Indeed, many strange things

71
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,220
have happened to me.

72
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,630
It's normal that you suspect me.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,750
As for your questions,

74
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,659
there are some

75
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,300
I don't know the answers to

76
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,230
and some

77
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,870
I can't give the answers to.

78
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
What are you trying to say?

79
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,780
So,

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,040
don't trust me anymore.

81
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,690
Maybe

82
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,010
even your dependence on me

83
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,250
is because of this fragment.

84
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,120
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,650
I guess

86
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,400
you are not the real Xuanyuan Yu.

[Righteousness]

88
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,700
Good morning, My Lady.

89
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,010
Has Young Master Yan got up?

90
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,870
He didn't sleep here last night.

91
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,290
Did something happen between you two?

92
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,470
Yan.

93
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,020
Yan?

94
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,900
Yes, Father.

95
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,960
What?

96
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,920
What's wrong with you?

97
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,610
You didn't sleep well last night?

98
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:03,890
That's not it.

99
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,770
Do you still remember

100
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,930
what I told you last time?

101
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,560
What?

102
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,420
I told you

103
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,970
not to waste too much energy

104
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,190
on love.

105
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,100
Although I'm rarely at home,

106
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,020
I still have some knowledge of this.

107
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,650
Look at you.

108
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,870
You are absent-minded.

109
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,520
The problem

110
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,890
still hasn't been solved?

111
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,980
Mr. Sikong and I are colleagues.

112
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:36,910
For this,

113
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,740
he specially came to me

114
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,950
and explained to me.

115
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,060
He said there is nothing between his son and my daughter-in-law.

116
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,010
Before you got married,

117
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,950
they met once,

118
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,910
-but...
-Father.

119
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,200
I don't care about this.

120
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,990
I promised you

121
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,150
I will find Gan Jiang Sword

122
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,130
and kill Shuo Tian within two years.

123
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,450
I will fulfill my promise.

124
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,380
I will continue to investigate

125
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,000
the affairs concerning demons.

126
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,020
While

127
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,610
you are handling

128
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,200
the affairs concerning demons,

129
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,770
you should also pay attention to your own family.

130
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,660
You are the eldest son of the Mo family.

131
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,860
She is the only daughter of the Xuanyuan family.

132
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,070
I don't want

133
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,810
to interfere in you young people's love.

134
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,800
But

135
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,590
the harmony between husband and wife is essential for a family's prosperity.

136
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,870
Taming your wife

137
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
is an art.

138
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,580
Father,

139
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,730
I don't want to tame her.

140
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,160
She is my wife,

141
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,460
not a dog I keep.

142
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,590
You are exactly like your mother.

143
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,500
My mother left because she didn't want

144
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,330
to be tamed by you, right?

145
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,760
She just didn't want to shoulder the responsibility

146
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,060
of being a wife and a mother.

147
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,750
Which married woman

148
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,750
ran away from home after giving birth like her?

149
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,880
She always talked about

150
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,640
her dreams and ambition.

151
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,500
Ridiculous!

152
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,200
Women should be virtuous.

153
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,850
They should serve their husbands and educate their children at home.

154
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,750
She

155
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,580
always talked about fighting and killing.

156
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,520
She wanted

157
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,550
to save the people

158
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,680
and quell riots.

159
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,630
Who is she

160
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,240
to save this world?

161
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,200
What a joke!

162
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,790
Don't think I don't know

163
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,790
what you were thinking on your wedding day.

164
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,060
You've learned nothing good

165
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,330
from your mother.

166
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,430
All you know is running away.

167
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,950
Mo's Mansion is big.

168
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,710
Can't it accommodate you and your mother?

169
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,170
Fortunately, you figured it out and came back yourself.

170
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,180
Otherwise, I would break your legs

171
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,950
if I catch you.

172
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,630
Don't talk back!

173
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:26,790
Get lost!

174
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,160
Get lost!

175
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,100
I didn't stay

176
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,660
because I figured it out.

177
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,990
The reason why my mother chose to leave

178
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,920
is the same

179
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,560
as the reason why I chose to stay.

180
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,470
Father,

181
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,930
you have never tried to understand us.

182
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,150
Brother.

183
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,200
Brother,

184
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,220
you went to kill demons in the suburbs.

185
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,300
Did everything go well?

186
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,940
You took that person with you this time.

187
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,130
She seems to be inexperienced.

188
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,690
She must have been a drag on you, right?

189
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,790
Brother, that woman is not a good person.

190
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,830
Don't be blinded by her.

191
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,880
No matter what kind of person she is,

192
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,250
it's none of your business.

193
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,710
I don't allow anyone to interfere

194
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,460
with your inheritance of the Mo family's business.

195
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,100
Let's wait and see.

196
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,890
♫The person in the dream♫

197
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,180
♫Falling like a flower♫

198
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,220
♫The heart withers into a desert♫

199
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,530
♫The wind and the rain have seen through the vagaries of fate♫

200
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:28,360
♫Where do you wander off to?♫

201
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,230
Young Master?

202
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,600
Why are you sleeping in the study again?

203
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,240
Can't I sleep here?

204
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,790
What about last night?

205
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,320
This morning, I heard from Young Madam Yu

206
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,430
that you weren't with her last night either.

207
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,450
I want to rest.

208
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,720
You may leave.

209
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,030
Yes.

210
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,000
My Lady,

211
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,600
what happened between you and Young Master Yan recently?

212
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,630
Nothing.

213
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,960
Well...

214
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,660
He went to sleep in the study again.

215
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,910
He didn't take you with him when he went out

216
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,080
to kill demons these days.

217
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,130
My Lady, what are you thinking about?

218
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,580
Nothing.

219
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,210
I've never seen you like this.

220
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,170
If you want to talk to Young Master Yan,

221
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,480
just go to him.

222
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,410
I don't.

223
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,390
Although your handwriting is really awful,

224
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,780
I can still recognize them.

225
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,240
[Yan]

226
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,970
You're writing the Chinese character of Yan.

227
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,660
I'm just practicing calligraphy.

228
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,260
Then what about

229
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,520
your swollen eyes?

230
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,410
In my opinion,

231
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,070
you can't sleep well without Young Master Yan.

232
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,440
Xiaohe,

233
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,850
why do you think

234
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,820
I care so much about Mo Yan's opinion of me?

235
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,330
Because you care about him.

236
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,950
But now,

237
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,110
I don't know my background.

238
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,280
I also lost my memory.

239
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,840
You're not a bad guy anyway.

240
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,950
How do you know that?

241
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,010
Bad guys

242
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,080
hide their thoughts in their hearts.

243
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,240
But your thoughts can be read through your face.

244
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,780
In my opinion,

245
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,160
if you are a bad guy,

246
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,880
you won't succeed in doing anything evil.

247
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,010
I'm so useless.

248
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,750
I can't even succeed in doing evil things.

249
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,130
Why did you skip the first part of what I said?

250
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,800
Anyway,

251
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,090
Xuanyuan Yu brought you back.

252
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,070
You two are as close as sisters.

253
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,250
Also, I've been with you for three years.

254
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,900
I know you very well.

255
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,210
Isn't this enough?

256
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,960
But Mo Yan...

257
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,550
How can he trust me?

258
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,040
So many strange things

259
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,790
have happened to me lately.

260
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,360
Even I can't understand myself.

261
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,830
It's okay.

262
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,670
You'll get your memory back.

263
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,720
I wonder how she has been recently.

264
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,290
Mrs. Wang is here.

265
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,900
Please go inside.

266
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,370
Please.

267
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,720
Mrs. Wang, you're here.

268
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,510
We haven't met for days.

269
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,770
You've become more beautiful.

270
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,050
Mrs. Mo, you're being too polite.

271
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,980
Pan'er, invite Mrs. Wang to sit inside.

272
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,270
Mrs. Wang, this way, please.

273
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,099
Mr. Zhou is here.

274
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:06,839
-Mrs. Mo.
-Mr. Zhou.

275
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,589
Please go inside.

276
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,670
Mrs. Mo.

277
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,990
Have you taken care of that matter?

278
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,920
Mother, don't worry.

279
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,440
I took care of it myself.

280
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,330
You'll know if I succeeded or not.

281
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,340
Did you succeed or not?

282
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,330
Of course I did.

283
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,320
Young Master Sikong is here.

284
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,660
Look.

285
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,990
He's here, right?

286
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:00,920
My Lady!

287
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,240
My Lady, bad news!

288
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,700
Bad news, My Lady!

289
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,030
-What's wrong, Xiaohe?
-My Lady, bad news!

290
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,850
Calm down.

291
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,710
Second Madam...

292
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,320
Second Madam invited Young Master Sikong here.

293
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
He's in the front yard.

294
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,190
She wants you to go there now.

295
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,380
Yu.

296
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,440
Yu, you're finally here.

297
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,930
It's a big day of our mansion today.

298
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,580
I guess you don't want to miss out on seeing someone.

299
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,560
So,

300
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,590
I specially asked Xiaohe to invite you here.

301
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,230
Come.

302
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,240
You've married into the Mo family.

303
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,860
Of course you should know more officials and noble people.

304
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,220
Young Master Mo, you're right.

305
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,340
Young Master Sikong.

306
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,170
Greetings, Mrs. Mo.

307
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,910
Do you two know each other?

308
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,480
Yu,

309
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,280
aren't you happy

310
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,350
to see your old friend?

311
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,070
Bravo.

312
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,030
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

313
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,710
Impressive!

314
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,800
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

315
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,020
His archery is really great.

316
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,700
Young Master Sikong is awesome.

317
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,400
My Lady,

318
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,080
Young Master Sikong is awesome.

319
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,470
I think he's ordinary.

320
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,660
You're so picky as if you were

321
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,300
choosing a son-in-law.

322
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,450
Of course.

323
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,330
I should help her see if he deserves her love.

324
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,440
Young Master Mo Yan is here.

325
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,120
Young Master Mo Yan is here.

326
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,830
Mr. Mo.

327
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,110
I've heard a lot about you.

328
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,350
Just now, I was outside and saw

329
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,630
that your archery is amazing.

330
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,230
I wonder if you can enlighten me.

331
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,180
I'm flattered.

332
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,700
Mr. Mo,

333
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,550
please show mercy.

334
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,690
Please.

335
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,240
Who do you think is going to win?

336
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,000
Of course Young Master Mo Yan is going to win.

337
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,250
I doubt it.

338
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,100
I think Young Master Sikong is awesome too.

339
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:47,890
Bravo!

340
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,440
Bravo!

341
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,480
Impressive.

342
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,820
His archery is great.

343
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,510
Sikong is the winner.

344
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,050
-Young Master Mo Yan is the winner.
-Young Master Mo Yan is the winner.

345
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,520
Young Master Mo Yan is awesome.

346
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,070
Young Master Mo Yan is better.

347
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,880
Thank you.

348
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,110
Maybe it's a bit hasty

349
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,450
to decide who's the winner with just one shot.

350
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,840
Mr. Mo,

351
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,360
I wonder if you can give me

352
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,000
one more chance to challenge you.

353
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,820
I'm not interested.

354
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,250
My Lady,

355
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,860
are you going to Young Master Yan?

356
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,480
Yes.

357
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,870
My Lady,

358
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,510
Young Master Yan is awesome.

359
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,530
In your opinion, why did he only compete

360
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,800
with Young Master Sikong,

361
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,260
who has an involvement with Xuanyuan Yu?

362
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,020
What do you mean?

363
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,470
Of course it's...

364
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,130
because of a man's desire to win.

365
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,660
Xuanyuan Yu.

366
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,870
Long time no see.

367
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,830
Why are you here?

368
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,430
My Lady, you guys talk first.

369
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,640
Okay.

370
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,320
Why did you come here?

371
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,980
Of course it's because...

372
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,310
the Mo family invited me here.

373
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,280
Is she...

374
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,830
Is she okay?

375
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,960
I haven't seen her again

376
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,850
since we said goodbye last time.

377
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,170
How could it be?

378
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,350
She told me

379
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,360
she would go to you after she left home.

380
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,130
I don't know.

381
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,160
Let's talk about you.

382
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,960
I heard

383
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,680
because of your...

384
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,220
involvement with me,

385
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,530
you've suffered a lot in Mo's Mansion.

386
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,380
Your husband's good brother

387
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,440
took great pains

388
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,590
to trick me into coming here.

389
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,220
You've done so much for her.

390
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,750
Is it really worth it?

391
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,330
She saved my life.

392
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,720
Do you have any news about her?

393
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,350
Of course.

394
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,410
Then tell me

395
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,860
where exactly she is.

396
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,080
Come closer.

397
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,500
How do you think

398
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,360
Young Master Yan will feel

399
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,230
if he sees this?

400
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:00,950
What...

401
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,330
What are you doing?

402
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,840
I don't think the happiness of defeating me

403
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,440
in the archery competition today

404
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,170
can comfort his broken heart.

405
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,690
Xuanyuan Yu, I can't believe this!

406
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,460
Second Madam, you can't go there.

407
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,970
My Lady!

408
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,030
Xiaohe.

409
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,370
You are immoral.

410
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,300
Since you got married,

411
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,220
you've always ignored the Mo family's rules.

412
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,910
Today,

413
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,860
you even came here to meet Sikong Shaoyun secretly.

414
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,490
So many people have seen it.

415
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,600
This has proved that the rumor is true.

416
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,810
Do you still want to quibble?

417
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,580
I'm not going to interfere

418
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,970
in your family affairs.

419
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,590
See you.

420
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,380
I should get going,

421
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,800
so that you can

422
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,850
punish her.

423
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,690
Looks like your lover is very heartless.

424
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,290
Yu, you have a good taste.

425
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,670
I wonder why you want to be with him.

426
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,960
Today, I saw

427
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,380
such a filthy scene.

428
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,200
I have to punish you.

429
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,920
Second Madam, don't!

430
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,460
Do it!

431
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,270
-Yes.
-Yes.

432
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,640
Who dares to touch me?

433
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,130
I thought it was some kind of powerful spell.

434
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,150
It turns out you're just acting.

435
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,090
What are you waiting for?

436
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,860
Go!

437
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,030
-Yes.
-Yes.

438
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,750
Yu, do you admit your mistake?

439
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,860
I did nothing wrong.

440
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,440
You're so stubborn.

441
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,410
Tie her up.

442
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,130
Yes.

443
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,290
-Yes.
-Let go of me!

444
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,060
Let go of me!

445
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,220
What a pity.

446
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,630
I came so close to killing her.

447
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,130
Let go of me!

448
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,790
That old woman came at a bad time.

449
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,960
I even put on a show with her.

450
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,130
How dare you!

451
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,440
You can't kill her.

452
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,690
Please don't kill her.

453
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,140
Behave yourself.

454
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,920
Don't come out without permission.

455
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,500
You can just tell me if you want to get beaten up.

456
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,830
I'm sorry.

457
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,890
I'm sorry.

458
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,110
My bad.

459
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,860
If I had known I can have a chance

460
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,450
to approach her by possessing you,

461
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,430
I wouldn't have taken the risk last time.

462
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,370
Young man,

463
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,830
you're a bit useful.

464
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,160
When I shoot arrows next time,

465
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,160
I'll show you

466
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,950
my exceptional archery skills.

467
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,530
Yu,

468
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,840
you can only blame yourself.

469
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,370
As a girl,

470
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,780
why are you so shameless?

471
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,150
You still won't admit your mistake?

472
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,720
Looks like you won't admit your mistake if I don't make you suffer enough.

473
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,240
Continue.

474
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,420
What's wrong?

475
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,570
Madam,

476
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,880
her back is stiff.

477
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,980
I feel discomfort in my hands.

478
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,440
Today, I'd like to see

479
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,730
how much longer she can hold on.

480
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,880
You two, beat her simultaneously.

481
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,580
Yan.

482
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,370
I saw her

483
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,370
meeting Sikong Shaoyun here secretly.

484
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,400
Honey.

485
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,370
Honey.

486
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:41,810
Honey.
