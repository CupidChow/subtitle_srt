00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,160
Shi Si.

5
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,820
Shi Si.

6
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,250
What's wrong?

7
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,920
Did you have a nightmare?

8
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,060
Come.

9
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,120
Let me help you up.

10
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,740
Let me ask you.

11
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,470
Did you participate in the Great War between Humans and Demons

12
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,970
four years ago?

13
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,050
Yes.

14
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,350
I told you.

15
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,710
I stabbed the demon lord.

16
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,280
Why are you asking this?

17
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,510
Where were you

18
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,530
after the war?

19
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,180
What do you mean?

20
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,130
Where did you go

21
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,790
after you stabbed the demon lord?

22
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,980
I went after the demon lord.

23
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,579
I was under his Blood Moon Illusion Spell halfway.

24
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,030
When I woke up,

25
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,430
the demon clan's army

26
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,800
had retreated.

27
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,610
My Lady.

28
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,490
My Lady.

29
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,450
Second Young Demon Lord is here.

30
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,870
Be careful.

31
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,490
Hurry!

32
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,950
Hurry!

33
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,760
Sister,

34
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,050
where are you going with my brother-in-law?

35
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,070
Why didn't you tell me?

36
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,470
You're so impolite.

37
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,400
It's none of your business.

38
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,190
Get lost!

39
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,130
My Lady!

40
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,260
Are you alright?

41
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,530
Your Lordship, go!

42
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,610
What are you doing?

43
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,040
You're back.

44
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,150
Did you find anything on the mountain today?

45
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,290
What I'm sure is that Yan has been captured by the demon clan.

46
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:48,909
But now, the problem is

47
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,000
how we can find the entrance to the Demon Realm.

48
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,200
No need to look for it.

49
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,880
Look at this.

50
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,240
This is my family's ancestral mirror.

51
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,260
My father told me

52
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,720
this mirror can create a small passage

53
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,360
between the human and demon realms.

54
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,260
As long as we stay in the mirror's barrier,

55
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,130
demons can't trace us.

56
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,530
Are you serious?

57
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,700
Why would I joke with you

58
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,150
at this moment?

59
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,300
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

60
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:12,630
I...

61
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,910
I forgot.

62
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,830
Don't look at me like that.

63
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,510
You went up the mountain to patrol.

64
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,910
I was busy too.

65
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,120
I've been working hard to study

66
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,720
how to use the mirror's barrier.

67
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,980
Have you figured out a way?

68
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,570
No.

69
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,490
I've always hated to practice spells since I was a kid.

70
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,390
That's not my ambition.

71
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,110
But

72
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,470
I've pretty much figured it out these days.

73
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,850
Don't look down on me.

74
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,390
Why don't we...

75
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,560
give it a try?

76
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,980
How?

77
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,950
Since we're looking for someone,

78
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,730
we have to know his location.

79
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,250
In this way, the passage can be opened quickly and accurately.

80
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,080
Do you have anything

81
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,750
related to Mo Yan?

82
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,100
No.

83
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,830
Anything is fine as long as it's related to him?

84
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,460
Yes.

85
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,490
That's right.

86
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,130
You two are cousins.

87
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,540
But this mirror requires a sacrifice.

88
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,400
You're a living person. How can you...

89
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,320
Mo Lan,

90
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,990
you can't sacrifice yourself

91
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,470
just to save Mo Yan.

92
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,630
What are you thinking?

93
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,750
Use my blood.

94
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,260
Hurry. It's urgent to save Yan.

95
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,760
Hurry up.

96
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,760
Give me your hand.

97
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,960
-Over there!
-Over there!

98
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,470
Move!

99
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,440
Hurry!

100
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,970
Yan!

101
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,720
Hang in there.

102
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,630
This way.

103
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,559
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

104
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,580
Don't let them escape!

105
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,600
Hurry!

106
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,360
Are you okay?

107
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,170
I'm fine.

108
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,530
Yan.

109
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,830
Come here.

110
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,740
The passage can't last long.

111
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,340
Shi Si, let's go.

112
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,290
What's wrong?

113
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,350
Shi Si.

114
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,730
Four years ago...

115
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,810
Shi Si.

116
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,920
It was you who cut off my horns.

117
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,280
Shi Si!

118
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,060
Yan.

119
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,710
Yan.

120
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,750
It was you

121
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,000
who cut off my horns.

122
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,110
Impossible.

123
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,880
Impossible.

124
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,450
It couldn't be me.

125
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,680
What's impossible?

126
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,810
Where is Shi Si?

127
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,920
Is she still in the Demon Realm?

128
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,630
Wait.

129
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,350
Calm down.

130
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,780
Yan,

131
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,000
let's go into the city to stay in an inn first.

132
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,360
You can take a rest there.

133
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,840
What's this about?

134
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,360
Your behavior

135
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,980
makes me look very strict.

136
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,550
Say something.

137
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,460
Wutan,

138
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,630
tell me.

139
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,360
Why didn't you help me today?

140
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,730
Your Lordship,

141
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,060
I...

142
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,020
I thought today,

143
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,520
they were no match for you.

144
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,870
That's why...

145
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,440
So you mean

146
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,270
I misunderstood you?

147
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,450
In this case,

148
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,050
if I give you one more chance,

149
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,690
would you still do that?

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,080
Your Lordship,

151
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,380
I've realized my mistake.

152
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,760
I'm loyal to you.

153
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,710
Even if I have the guts,

154
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,530
I will never

155
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,900
betray you.

156
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,360
Today,

157
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,640
I was careless.

158
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,810
Wutan,

159
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,000
then tell me.

160
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,400
How should I punish you?

161
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,780
I'm willing to join hands with Xuanyuan Sheng

162
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,290
to catch Mo Yan and First Young Demon Lord and take them back to the Demon Realm

163
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,740
to make amends.

164
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,010
I'm also willing

165
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,940
to do my best.

166
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,710
Okay.

167
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,270
Great!

168
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,430
You said it yourselves.

169
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,920
I'll give you one more chance.

170
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,630
You two can form a special team

171
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,150
to find them.

172
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,920
Remember,

173
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,470
if you fail again,

174
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,050
I don't know what I'll do.

175
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,570
You guys know

176
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,040
there is something wrong with my mind.

177
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,640
[Bilifu Inn]

178
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,160
What's wrong with Mo Yan?

179
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,240
It's like he has hysteria.

180
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,520
I don't know either.

181
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,880
Looks like he suffered a blow.

182
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,120
Is it...

183
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,190
still because of what happened last time?

184
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,750
Because of the stab?

185
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,190
I don't think so.

186
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,150
This is your room.

187
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,610
Rest early.

188
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,800
Will demons...

189
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,440
catch up with us?

190
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,430
What?

191
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,150
Are you scared?

192
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,550
I...

193
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,970
I'm not.

194
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,020
You know how to cast a spell now, right?

195
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,390
My spell can only help me escape.

196
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,270
It can't help me defend against enemies.

197
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,830
You want to sleep in the same room with me?

198
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,750
I...

199
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,440
I don't.

200
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,360
I...

201
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,390
-I'm going to kill you!
-Who are you?

202
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,190
Why are you beating me?

203
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,230
Stop! Stop!

204
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,870
No matter who I am, it's none of your business.

205
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,860
Calm down!

206
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,470
Why should I calm down?

207
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,500
I'm going to kill you!

208
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,900
Listen to me.

209
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:05,950
Are you okay?

210
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,680
I'm fine.

211
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,070
Stop looking at me!

212
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,350
Speak!

213
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,340
Who sent you here?

214
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,240
Speak!

215
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,080
Lan, is everything alright?

216
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,520
We caught a rascal.

217
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,030
Brother.

218
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:31,930
Brother.

219
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:32,990
Dongling?

220
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,120
Why did you choke me?

221
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
Why didn't you say anything?

222
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,790
You were choking me. How could I speak?

223
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,470
Brother,

224
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,790
you're here.

225
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,090
You rascal, I'm going to kill you!

226
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,960
I'm going to beat you to death!

227
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,540
-I'm going to beat you to death!
-He's not a rascal.

228
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,600
He is merely a pretty face.

229
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,750
I don't care!

230
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,620
I've seen a lot of girls.

231
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,660
I'm not interested in you.

232
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,450
Why are you beating me?

233
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,840
Why didn't you knock?

234
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,790
The door... is open.

235
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,210
Yes.

236
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
He saw it too, right?

237
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,250
Why are you only beating my brother?

238
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,720
Let go!

239
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,850
All of you, get out!

240
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,000
Get out!

241
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,980
Eat slowly. Don't choke yourself.

242
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,790
Let me ask you.

243
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,520
Why did you go in through the window

244
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,650
instead of the front door?

245
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,390
I was unlucky.

246
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,800
My money bag was stolen.

247
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Madam wouldn't let me in.

248
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,410
That's why I did that.

249
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,160
I wanted to find you first.

250
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,230
But I didn't expect to go into the wrong room.

251
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,300
You really didn't peep at her on purpose?

252
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,520
I swear.

253
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,910
I'm surrounded

254
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,710
by beautiful girls every day.

255
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,950
I've seen all kinds of beauties.

256
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,330
I admit

257
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,010
she is pretty.

258
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,700
-But she's not that…
-Enough.

259
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,020
The demoness...

260
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,490
Where's my sister-in-law?

261
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,570
She has gone to bed.

262
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,860
Brother,

263
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,810
after you left with Sister-in-law,

264
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,910
all demon-hunting noble families were shocked.

265
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,760
Also, our father was punished by the higher-ups.

266
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,850
Father...

267
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,610
After you left,

268
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,450
he actually asked me to rule the Mo family.

269
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,770
Isn't that interesting?

270
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,260
This has naturally reminded him of your strengths.

271
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,050
He is dissatisfied no matter what I do.

272
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,480
Brother,

273
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,020
you know this.

274
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,410
I'm used to being carefree.

275
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,850
Of course I can't stand being tied to this position.

276
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,260
I wanted to escape every day,

277
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,280
but my mother would catch me and take me back.

278
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,800
I ran away again and she caught me and took me back again.

279
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,280
She

280
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,700
has the ambition to rule all demon-hunting noble families.

281
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,880
But she's a woman.

282
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,569
She has never been in charge of anything important.

283
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,869
So over the past six months,

284
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,910
many people in Fengdu

285
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,339
have been dissatisfied with the Mo family.

286
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,790
Anyway, during this period,

287
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,590
I've been really upset because they've been forcing me.

288
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,620
I don't want to battle with my mother anymore.

289
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,490
So I thought

290
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,340
I can be free if I can find you.

291
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,200
So I came to look for you.

292
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,140
Dongling,

293
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,050
I can't go back to the Mo family yet.

294
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,920
Brother,

295
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,920
you've practiced spells since you were a kid.

296
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,110
You worked so hard

297
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,480
just to rule the Mo family

298
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,760
someday, right?

299
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,630
I'm giving the position

300
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,770
of the Mo family's ruler to you now.

301
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,840
Why don't you want it?

302
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,740
Now I have something more important to do.

303
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,910
Because of that woman, right?

304
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,850
What exactly did that demoness do to you?

305
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,280
Dongling, that's all I want to say.

306
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,180
It's your business how you want to understand my words.

307
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,510
No matter what I want to do, it's none of your business.

308
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,740
I don't need to explain to you either.

309
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,850
You're really hopeless!

310
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,770
He's hopeless.

311
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,810
Keep running, Fatty Fish.

312
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,040
Wutan,

313
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,430
be careful.

314
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,640
Don't kill him.

315
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,110
Your Lordship,

316
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,970
it's useless to keep him alive.

317
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,680
Use your brain.

318
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,510
My sister ran away with her human husband.

319
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,330
She is so humane now.

320
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,010
She won't leave her follower behind.

321
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,260
Your Lordship, you're wise.

322
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,820
Fatty Fish,

323
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,690
tell me where she is.

324
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,740
I'll go bring her back.

325
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,680
Okay?

326
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,700
Do you want to die?

327
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,120
I'm going to kill you!

328
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,110
I don't want to see him.

329
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,850
Get lost!

330
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:43,910
Take him away.

331
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,750
Right, Xuanyuan Sheng,

332
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,560
have you located Mo Yan and the others?

333
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,220
I think

334
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,020
there will be news soon.

335
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,870
In most cases, jealousy and anger

336
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,770
will make people lose their mind.

337
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,290
That child

338
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,340
has never been a tough-minded person.

339
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,660
You're so verbose.

340
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,290
You'd better get it done!

341
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,270
Wutan,

342
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,170
enough.

343
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,370
You guys can leave now.

344
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,390
Yes.

345
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,330
Yes.

346
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,130
What are you doing?

347
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,210
Stab me.

348
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,690
Why?

349
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,230
I saw your body.

350
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,150
Actually,

351
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,530
this has nothing to do with you.

352
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,000
You came to save me.

353
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,900
I should thank you.

354
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,610
When I called for help in the room just now,

355
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,800
you came here immediately.

356
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,400
Sorry.

357
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,460
I'll knock first next time.

358
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,730
Next time?

359
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,200
You want someone to bully me again?

360
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,700
That's not what I mean.

361
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,530
I mean...

362
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,130
in the future...

363
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,530
Well...

364
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,290
I forgive you.

365
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,670
It's late.

366
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,890
Why don't you go back to rest?

367
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,760
I'll stay here to protect you tonight.

368
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,890
Protect me?

369
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,500
From what?

370
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,910
What if a bad guy comes again?

371
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,210
Well...

372
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,140
I'll ask him to be responsible for me.

373
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,260
Why didn't you ask me to be responsible for you?

374
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:10,990
Do you want a sugar figurine?

375
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:13,900
Let's go.

376
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,490
I also want to eat sugar-coated haws later.

377
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,710
Okay.

378
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,290
Is there still someone selling them on the street at this hour?

379
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,230
Let's go find out.

380
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,150
Yan.

381
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,600
Be careful.

382
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,980
Don't move.

383
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:01,990
Brother-in-law,

384
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,530
we meet again.

385
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,750
What did you do to Mo Jialuo?

386
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,640
Nothing.

387
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,420
I just asked him

388
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,140
to lure you into the illusion realm

389
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,040
so that I can kill you easily.

390
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,850
He completed the task to some extent.

391
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,280
He's not really an outstanding subordinate.

392
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,470
This fish fainted again.

393
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,260
How rude!

394
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,720
He didn't even say hello to my brother-in-law.

395
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,910
You're crazy.

396
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,550
Brother-in-law,

397
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,010
you really are my confidant.

398
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,720
What a pity.

399
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,850
This leg is crippled.

400
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,180
Brother-in-law,

401
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,880
where is my sister?

402
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,340
Why are you mentioning her?

403
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,540
What?

404
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,340
You haven't learned enough lessons from her?

405
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,800
Brother-in-law,

406
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,070
the demon clan's great cause hasn't been accomplished yet.

407
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,220
I'm not interested

408
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,890
in arguing with you here.

409
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,230
By the way, Brother-in-law,

410
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,480
I have a gift for you.

411
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,480
Wutan.

412
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,330
Brother!

413
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,930
Dongling.

414
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,410
-Brother.
-Don't move.

415
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,400
Brother-in-law, you still don't know this, do you?

416
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,830
Your younger brother

417
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,050
leaked the information to Xuanyuan Sheng.

418
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,800
We reached an agreement that you would only catch the demoness, right?

419
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,600
Why are you going back on your word?

420
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,960
Why are you going to catch my brother too?

421
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,530
Don't hurt him.

422
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,990
So the rumor

423
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,370
about the Mo family's second young master is true.

424
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,790
He really is...

425
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,410
endearingly silly.

426
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,930
This loser

427
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,630
is useless to me now.

428
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,800
I'm giving him back to you.

429
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,380
Dongling.

430
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,430
Are you okay?

431
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:12,970
I'm fine.
