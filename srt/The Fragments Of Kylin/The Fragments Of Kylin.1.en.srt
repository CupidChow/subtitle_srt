teach you this?

192
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,750
I can't believe you don't know how to do this.

193
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,630
This is my first marriage,

194
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,270
so I'm not very familiar with it.

195
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,940
This is also my first marriage.

196
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,540
I know how to do it next time.

197
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,440
You're thinking about your next marriage now.

198
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,920
So the rumor is true.

199
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,640
Performing formal bows, entertaining guests, drinking cross-cupped wine,

200
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,650
and consummating...

201
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,280
We should consummate our marriage next.

202
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,770
[Wedding]

203
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,819
What are you doing?

204
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,619
Shouldn't we consummate our marriage?

205
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:22,740
You're shameless.

206
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,849
Why?

207
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,690
You clearly...

208
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,280
Clearly?

209
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,110
Forget it.

210
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,780
[Wedding]

211
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,420
Remember the two-year agreement.

212
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,120
During the two years,

213
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,810
behave yourself.

214
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,130
I...

215
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,740
What two-year agreement?

216
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,980
What's going on?

217
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,010
Why did he come out?

218
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,820
Something is not right.

219
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,540
So soon?

220
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,200
This is different

221
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,690
from what's written in the books.

222
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,410
What are you mumbling?

223
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,310
Nothing.

224
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,010
Looks like

225
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,030
they won't consummate their marriage tonight.

226
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,420
Thank God.

227
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,210
What did you say?

228
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,110
Do you think

229
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,230
they quarreled?

230
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,180
They just met today.

231
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,230
It's impossible.

232
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,740
Lady Yu is very good-tempered.

233
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,040
She never causes trouble proactively.

234
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,140
Young Master Yan is amiable.

235
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,860
He never speaks loudly to anyone.

236
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,510
Mo Yu!

237
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,060
Get me a quilt!

238
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,690
Coming!

239
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,480
Except this time.

240
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,060
What are you waiting for?

241
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,510
Hurry!

242
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,640
Coming!

243
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,620
Consummating our marriage

[Wedding]

245
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,570
has something to do with the candles, right?

246
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,480
Young Master Mo Lan.

247
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:34,330
[Wedding]

248
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,030
Yan.

249
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,270
You're back.

250
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,520
What's the situation?

251
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,740
As you said,

252
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,190
I interrogated one of them carefully.

253
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,250
Indeed, they are demons.

254
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,570
I tied him up

255
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,100
when I took him back.

256
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,460
But he just vanished into thin air on our way back.

257
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,250
It's not easy

258
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,130
for ordinary people to do that.

259
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,610
Where is he?

260
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,460
I don't know.

261
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,550
I had a blackout,

262
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,310
and he disappeared.

263
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,800
Darn it.

264
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,210
It's not your fault.

265
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,820
I failed in my duty.

266
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,260
You are overacting.

267
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,620
Thank you for your cooperation.

269
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,220
Yan,

270
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,610
did you find anything?

271
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,380
Thank you.

272
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,360
Have some water first.

273
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,160
[Wedding]

274
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,400
Nothing special.

275
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,720
But I also found something

276
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,770
in the tavern today.

277
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,060
When I was dealing with them,

278
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,290
they considered Xuanyuan Yu

279
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,790
as my accomplice.

280
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,000
They seized a chance

281
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,390
to attack her with the demonic aura.

282
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,150
But the demonic aura was very dark.

283
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,310
I don't think they're advanced demons.

284
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,030
They're just some stray soldiers.

285
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,900
I don't think they can cause big trouble.

286
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,440
Maybe

287
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,580
it was just a coincidence.

288
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:57,980
Yan,

289
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,820
this is not what you really think, right?

290
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,210
If you really think it was a coincidence,

291
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,680
you wouldn't have given up running away

292
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,640
and come back to get married.

293
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,880
There is something fishy about this.

294
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,320
Demons suddenly appeared after three years.

295
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,010
I'm worried

296
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,290
they're going to make a comeback.

297
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,710
I'll go to the tavern again to investigate tomorrow.

298
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,070
Maybe I can find something else.

00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,470
Yes.

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,020

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,910

everyone in the mansion

00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,830
has been gossiping about your love confession

316
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,990
to Young Master Sikong on the street.

317
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,550
This is Young Madam Yu.

00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,390
Let's go.

319
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,640
I wonder who spread it.

320
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,390
It spread faster than I expected.

321
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,810
Where is Mo Yan?

322
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,570
He went to the study last night.

323
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,590
According to the rules,

324
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,580
we should visit Master and Madam today.

325
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,930

You're very impressive.

337
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,400
if you can enlighten me.

it's very fragrant?
