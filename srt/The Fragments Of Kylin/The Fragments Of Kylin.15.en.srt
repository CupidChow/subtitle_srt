[Episode 15]

4
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,300
Shi Si.

5
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,870
Shi Si.

6
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,280
Shi Si!

7
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,640
Shi Si!

8
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,930
Shi Si.

9
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,500
Shi Si.

10
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,500
Wake up.

11
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,010
Shi Si.

12
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,460
Keep up!

13
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,740
Hurry up!

14
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,370
No.

15
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,120
-Something must have happened.
-Over there. Let's go!

16
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,420
Where are Shi Si and Mo Yan?

17
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,970
I need to follow them to take a look.

18
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,150
You are the...

19
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,420
Lower your voice.

20
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:52,870
Speak.

21
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,850
You are that little snake.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,550
Where are Shi Si and Mo Yan?

23
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,900
What happened here?

24
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,070
They fell into Master Mo's trap

25
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,200
and were severely injured.

26
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,130
Now, Mo Yan has escaped

27
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,560
with that lady.

28
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,470
I'm going to get reinforcements now

29
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,580
and then find them.

30
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,390
It seems you are very close to them.

31
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,190
Also, you're hiding here.

32
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,620
You're not

33
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,740
on Master Mo's side, right?

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,329
No. Absolutely not.

35
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,880
That's good.

36
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:18,700
So?

37
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,850
Do you want to come with me?

38
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,260
Sure.

39
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,270
Let me make it clear first.

40
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,500
You take care of yourself.

41
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,240
I'm a ruthless killer.

42
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,760
I won't have time to take care of you.

43
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:28,940
Oh.

44
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,590
Let's go.

45
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,100
Someone's here! Come here...

46
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,090
Brother Mo Lan.

47
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,670
Do you want to introduce yourselves first?

48
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,440
I am Xuanyuan Yu.

49
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,090
Come with me.

50
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:56,910
Shi Si.

51
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:57,900
Shi Si.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,570
Here!

53
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,980
There's someone in the cave!

54
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,100
Yu Zhou.

55
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:09,910
Thank you.

56
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,770
You're welcome.

57
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,100
That snake asked me to help you.

58
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,380
Wait for me. Slow down.

59
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,870
Slow down.

60
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,310
When can we

61
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,630
find them like this?

62
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,590
Let's split up.

63
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,780
This is the best way.

64
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,960
I'm going to look for them too, okay?

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,710
If that snake can do it,

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,730
I can do it too.

67
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,870
Although she is a snake,

68
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,500
she's one of the Five Mythical Beasts.

69
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:32,970
What about you?

70
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,010
What skills do you have?

71
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,560
I'm from a demon-hunting household.

72
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,290
Of course it's easy for me to look for someone.

73
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,490
Really?

74
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,840
You are so confident.

75
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,290
Why are you as bad-tempered as Mo Yan?

76
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,760
Why are the Mo family's men all like this?

77
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,190
I'm also wondering

78
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,550
why everyone related to the Xuanyuan family

79
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,350
is so troublesome,

80
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,720
whether they are true or fake.

81
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,490
What's wrong with you?

82
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,510
Brother Mo Lan,

83
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,800
I found Mo Yan.

84
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,820
Xuanyuan Yu.

85
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,490
I need you to do something.

86
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,940
Shi Si.

87
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,310
Shi Si.

88
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,590
You're awake.

89
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,570
Mo...

90
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,890
Mo Yan.

91
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,210
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,880
I didn't know it was my father's

93
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,830
Demon Slaying Formation.

94
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,190
It's very powerful.

95
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,250
Your injury...

96
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,390
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,820
I'm really sorry, Mo Yan.

98
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,350
I didn't expect

99
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,790
that I'm really a demon.

100
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,900
Actually,

101
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,090
I was aware of all the clues long ago.

102
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,140
I just wouldn't admit it.

103
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,070
I...

104
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,510
I don't want to leave you.

105
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,640
So I've been lying to myself and you

106
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,330
and avoiding the truth

107
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,659
to spend those days with you

108
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,690
till today.

109
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,240
I...

110
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,220
I deserve it.

111
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,490
It's okay.

112
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,100
Stop talking.

113
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,440
You disobeyed your father

114
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,830
and hurt your father for me.

115
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,370
You... You should go back now.

116
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,560
Listen to me. Go back now.

117
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,800
I can't get you implicated anymore.

118
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,820
The situation is already irreparable.

119
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,640
No.

120
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,170
There must be a way, right?

121
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,370
There must be a way.

122
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,840
You go back to the Mo family first.

123
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,000
Shi Si.

124
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,720
The Mo family now firmly believes I've betrayed the human race.

125
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,520
I can't leave you here alone at this time.

126
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,950
I'm really a jinx to you.

127
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,510
It's okay.

128
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,710
Don't cry.

129
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,470
A few days ago,

130
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,090
you said...

131
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,150
you said marrying into the Mo family

132
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,980
is like falling into the living hell.

133
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,070
But now it seems

134
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,929
marrying me

135
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,010
has brought bad luck to you.

136
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,340
Mo Yan,

137
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,550
I ruined your bright future.

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,780
I'll get even with Yu.

139
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,720
I'll give you...

140
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,790
a new one.

141
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,580
Okay?

142
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,030
Shi Si.

143
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,080
Shi Si.

144
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,180
Shi Si.

145
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,060
Shi Si.

146
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,310
Stop calling her name.

147
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,440
She just fainted temporarily.

148
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,930
The fragments you took from me not long ago

149
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,810
can restore demons' power.

150
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,160
Use them on her now.

151
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,460
Shi Si.

152
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,670
Shi Si.

153
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,800
Yu Zhou!

154
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,500
Maybe she can't withstand the fragments for the time being.

155
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,800
It's fine.

156
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,370
Yan.

157
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,630
Lan.

158
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,110
Actually, I didn't go far.

159
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,430
After I saw First Uncle go up the mountain,

160
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,380
I increasingly felt something was wrong.

161
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,440
So I wanted to come back to take a look.

162
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,140
Sorry.

163
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,980
I'm late.

164
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,680
No.

165
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,630
Now that you're here, I'm relieved.

166
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,320
Lan,

167
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,990
where are we going now?

168
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,440
Xuanyuan Yu is at the ferry.

169
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,420
The boat is ready.

170
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,380
Xiaohe and Mo Yu are already on the boat.

171
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,360
Lan,

172
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,960
now I...

173
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,990
Yan, you know this.

174
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,860
I stayed in the Mo family because of you.

175
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,660
If you leave,

176
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,360
what's the point of me staying there?

177
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,430
Mo Yan,

178
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,400
Brother Mo Lan,

179
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,020
this is where I say goodbye.

180
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,340
Lan Jia,

181
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,540
-thank you.
-You're welcome.

182
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,790
You humans would help each other.

183
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,370
Demons would do that too.

184
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,130
Although I'm young,

185
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,370
I understand

186
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,370
this principle.

187
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,070
I don't know

188
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,990
when she'll wake up.

189
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,550
I always feel she looks a little familiar.

190
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,640
Did you see her?

191
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,140
No.

192
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,800
Let's go down there to take a look.

193
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,200
Go!

194
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,150
Don't move.

195
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,200
If you suck out the poison for the demon lord,

196
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,340
you will die.

197
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,490
You're still young.

198
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,860
Live a few more years.

199
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,520
It's really you.

200
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,590
Looks like you'll awaken after being beaten up

201
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,970
by Master Mo.

202
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,720
What?

203
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,470
Nothing.

204
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,620
Someone is over there!

205
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,280
Hurry up!

206
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,400
Leave now.

207
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,600
I can hold them back for a while.

208
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,970
Lan Jia.

209
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,770
Little girl,

210
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,650
don't die.

211
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,730
Don't worry.

212
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,190
I'm very evil

213
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,520
in front of others.

214
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,110
I discussed with Mo Lan.

215
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,380
We're going to Yandu to seek refuge with my second uncle.

216
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,260
Is she...

217
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,570
Is she really a demon?

218
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,610
She...

219
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,530
really doesn't look like a demon.

220
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,910
She is.

221
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,620
If you are afraid of her,

222
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,650
you can leave now.

223
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,130
Mo Yan,

224
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,490
how could you say this?

225
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,700
I knew her earlier than you.

226
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,610
So did Xiaohe.

227
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,670
How could we abandon her

228
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,750
just because she's a demon?

229
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,680
A demon

230
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,440
is not a simple identity.

231
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,320
Lan,

232
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,460
are you still not able to change your opinion on demons?

233
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,260
If it weren't for Lan Jia and Yu Zhou,

234
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,580
we wouldn't have successfully escaped in Mount Niuyang.

235
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,370
I'm going out to get some fresh air.

236
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,750
Me too.

237
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,010
What's your opinion?

238
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,410
We've only known each other for a few hours, right?

239
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,290
Is it appropriate for you to ask this?

240
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,490
Only a few of us are on the boat.

241
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,880
There are few people I can talk to.

242
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,150
I'll...

243
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,470
just make do.

244
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,690
Actually, I'm half-demon.

245
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,700
No wonder you are so powerful.

246
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,190
My mother was a dragon.

247
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,950
She died in a demon slaying operation.

248
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,790
She was killed by the demon clan,

249
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,910
but her heart was broken by the human race.

250
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,220
My father died too.

251
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,100
They abandoned me

252
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,740
and died in West Liang Prefecture.

253
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,850
Yan asked me

254
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,140
why I can't change my opinion on demons.

255
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,070
Actually,

256
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,380
I just can't accept my dual identity.

257
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,490
Just like I can't accept

258
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,190
I'm half-human, half-demon.

259
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,410
But your existence

260
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,550
indicates

261
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,410
humans and demons are integrating, right?

262
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,270
Integrating?

263
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,500
In my opinion,

264
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,900
my existence itself is a joke.

265
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,740
I'm like

266
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,020
a tool that demons and humans

267
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,680
who are sworn enemies use

268
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,690
to present false peace and deceive themselves.

269
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,920
The dragon race has already experienced the bitter consequences.

270
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,350
Integration

271
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,210
is the fakest promise.

272
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,260
But...

273
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,800
maybe you managed to save them today

274
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,940
just because of your talent

275
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,250
from the dragon race.

276
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,410
This is precisely what I'm conflicted about.

277
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,810
I despise the skills that are essential for my survival.

278
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,480
But without the skills,

279
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,990
I can't protect the people I want to protect.

280
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,430
Isn't...

281
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,130
it good to have the skills?

282
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,170
What's good about it?

283
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,490
You are not like me.

284
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,150
I want to do my best to do something successfully,

285
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,240
but I always end up being fooled.

286
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
I'm so stupid.

287
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,800
Tell me.

288
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,550
Not every demon is evil, right?

289
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,970
Like Shi Si.

290
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,109
I've never seen anyone

291
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,660
as simple as her.

292
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:12,970
And you.

293
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,260
You would risk your life to save Mo Yan.

294
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,550
But there are also evil demons.

295
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:21,940
Like

296
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,660
the one who made Shaoyun a bad guy.

297
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,740
If it weren't for him,

298
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,930
Shaoyun wouldn't have...

299
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,050
You stood guard all night?

300
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,520
Yes.

301
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,880
Shi Si is badly injured.

302
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,070
She still hasn't woken up.

303
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,880
I want to go into the city to buy some medicine for her.

304
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,790
You can't go.

305
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,070
I'm afraid the Mo family has issued wanted posters

306
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,940
along the way.

307
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,910
It's too dangerous.

308
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,650
It's fine that I go alone.

309
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,570
You stay

310
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,470
and take care of them.

311
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,820
I'll go with you.

312
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,950
If you go with me,

313
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,100
who's going to protect them?

314
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,890
You also got hurt yesterday.

315
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,660
Don't worry.

316
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,130
Although I'm injured,

317
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,520
a few pursuers

318
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,600
are no match for me.

319
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:46,620
Okay.

320
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,970
Actually, you're not very afraid of her.

321
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:12,960
Right?

322
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,000
Yes.

323
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,910
I hope she can wake up soon.

324
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,840
She will.

325
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,100
My Lady, I'm going to take a look.

326
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,810
Okay.

327
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,950
Young Master Mo Lan! Young Master Mo Lan!

328
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,820
Mo Yu!

329
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,370
My...

330
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,820
My Lady?

331
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,800
My Lady?

332
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,640
Yu.

333
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,870
Yu.

334
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,310
Wake up, Yu.

335
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,270
She's fine.

336
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,770
She'll wake up soon.

337
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,100
My Lady,

338
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,880
you lost your memory.

339
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,180
Do you want

340
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,210
to remember

341
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,380
your past?

342
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,710
How?

343
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,570
We have Maya

344
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,260
in our hearts.

345
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,420
It's an illusion

346
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,080
and also the truth.

347
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,020
It has sealed the pain you don't want to face

348
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,040
and

349
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,810
the suffering that you can't let go easily.

350
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,270
Now, it's like

351
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,440
you're walking in a forest surrounded by fog.

352
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,550
Do your feelings

353
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,660
of bewilderment

354
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,830
and confusion...

355
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,410
outweigh your pain and suffering?

356
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,410
My Lady,

357
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,200
if you want to know the truth,

358
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,880
just nod.

359
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,890
Okay.

360
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,260
You know what?

361
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
The Mo family's Young Master Yan

362
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,650
married a demon.

363
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,500
I heard that yesterday on the mountain,

364
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,730
Master Mo cast a spell

365
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,080
and caught her.

366
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,720
A demon infiltrated into the Mo family?

367
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,380
She's so bold!

368
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,500
What happened then?

369
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:02,980
Don't go there.

370
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,670
The Mo family's Young Master Yan

371
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,640
has been implicated by the demon.

372
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,390
Since the Mo family is no longer reliable,

373
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,930
who should we rely on?

374
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,850
What about the Xuanyuan family?

375
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,960
The Xuanyuan family was over long ago.

376
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,080
How should we live our lives?

377
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,740
My Lady.

378
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,270
How did it go?

379
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:39,940
I'm okay.

380
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,570
My Lady,

381
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,300
why are you trembling so intensely?

382
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,460
What exactly did you see?

383
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,870
Nothing.

384
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,560
Just my previous injury.

385
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:56,840
My Lady,

386
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,150
in this case,

387
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,150
go back to the Demon Realm with me.

388
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,240
We all need you.

389
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,800
Three days.

390
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,410
Come and pick me up

391
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,110
in three days.

392
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,380
Three days?

393
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,160
During this period,

394
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,330
demons are not allowed to attack.

395
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,230
My Lady.

396
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,410
Lan!

397
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,190
When did you wake up?

398
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,590
What happened here?

399
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,510
What's wrong?

400
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,770
Did you lose your memory again?

401
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,760
Mo Yan.

402
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,890
You're back.

403
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,940
I just went into the city to buy medicine for you.

404
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,140
Mo Yan, promise me.

405
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,420
Don't leave me again.

406
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,300
Okay?

407
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,120
I won't.

408
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,210
What happened?

409
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,020
I don't know.

410
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,470
I suddenly fainted.

411
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,310
Let's talk outside.

412
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,630
Yu.

413
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,980
Shi Si.

414
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,710
Shi Si, you're awake.

415
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,840
Yu.

416
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,190
Why did I fall asleep?

417
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,770
Do you have any clue?

418
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,440
One thing that is certain is that I was under an illusion spell.

419
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,510
Also, the one who cast the spell

420
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,010
must be a master of illusion spells.

421
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,280
When I fainted,

422
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,810
I vaguely saw a very big fish.

423
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,580
Fish?

424
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,000
Mo Jialuo?

425
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:06,780
Yes.

426
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,230
It was also an illusion.

427
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,830
I think it was him.

428
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,400
He didn't attack you?

429
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,880
No.

430
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,260
Then why did he come here?

431
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,870
Could it be that he woke Shi Si up?

432
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,170
No.

433
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,470
We can't let the fish do whatever he wants.

434
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,710
We must arrive in Yandu as soon as possible.

435
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,640
Then we'll make plans.

436
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,430
If we speed up,

437
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,560
we can arrive tonight.

438
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,150
Mo Yan,

439
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,430
Shi Si wants to see you.

440
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,310
I can't believe you.

441
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,500
Your wife just woke up,

442
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,200
but you're here chatting with your brother.

443
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,790
I...

444
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,370
Yan,

445
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,690
just go.

446
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,230
Leave the rest

447
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,060
to me.

448
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,640
Okay.

449
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,170
What?

450
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,040
Are you going to defend him?

451
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,730
You're so mean.

452
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,160
[Yandu]

453
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,330
[Bilifu Inn]

454
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,430
Honey.

455
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,040
You've been on the boat all day.

456
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,130
You must be tired.

457
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,590
What's wrong?

458
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,840
You're clingier after you woke up.

459
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,790
Isn't it good?

460
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,390
It's good.

461
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,770
It's good as long as you can wake up.

462
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,350
Did you...

463
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,870
meet Mo Jialuo today?

464
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,470
Yes.

465
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,450
I did.

466
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,060
It really was his illusion spell.

467
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,370
Why did he come here?

468
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,750
After I was under his illusion spell,

469
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,220
it didn't take long for me to wake up.

470
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,100
I don't know why he came here either.

471
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,970
Let's not talk about this.

472
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,360
I just want to be with you now.

473
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,470
Okay.

474
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,400
We still have a lot of time

475
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,200
to be with each other.

476
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,510
Honey.

477
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,350
Yes?

478
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,660
Do you know what this is called?

479
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,040
What?

480
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,830
Throwing yourself at me.

481
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,940
What's next?

482
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,560
♫The person in the dream♫

483
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,230
No.

484
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,840
♫Falling like a flower♫

485
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,280
You still haven't recovered.

486
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:02,890
♫The heart withers into a desert♫

487
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,950
Mo Yan,

488
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,110
I want to have sex with you.

489
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:09,240
♫The wind and the rain have seen through the vagaries of fate♫

490
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,510
Now.

491
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:17,020
♫Where do you wander off to?♫

492
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,050
♫Can't see through♫

493
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,660
♫The karma of destiny♫

494
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,140
♫Who will accompany the song in my heart?♫

495
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,910
♫Time goes by♫
