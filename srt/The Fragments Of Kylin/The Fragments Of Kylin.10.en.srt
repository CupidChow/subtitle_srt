[Episode 10]

4
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:42,789
Fight against me!

5
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,910
Why didn't you use the power of a demon?

6
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,350
Believe it or not, I'll kill you.

7
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,050
It's not that I didn't choose to use it.

8
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,579
I just don't know how to use it at all.

9
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,020
I only have one power that may be a demon's power.

10
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,570
Because I have such a power,

11
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,550
ordinary weapons cannot hurt me,

12
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,270
except Moye Sword.

13
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,720
What a self-healing ability you have!

14
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,300
Am I really unable

15
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,520
to kill you?

16
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,130
You said ordinary weapons can't hurt you,

17
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,690
except Moye Sword.

18
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,160
That's because it's a magical weapon to kill demons.

19
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,360
I see.

20
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,480
Thank you.

21
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Go to hell!

22
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,750
Though I don't have Moye Sword,

23
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,130
I'll try killing you.

24
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,910
She failed to stop you.

25
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,550
Lan Jia is so useless.

26
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,520
I told you

27
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,960
that you can't make decisions for me.

28
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,800
I also told you

29
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,820
that when you lose your judgment,

30
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,940
I'll have to make decisions for you.

31
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,720
Why can't you just trust me?

32
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,980
She is so suspicious.

33
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,410
Why can't you kill her?

34
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,190
Let me say it again.

35
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,420
You can't hurt her.

36
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,990
If you do this again,

37
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,160
we will

38
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,760
have a battle against each other.

39
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,650
Step aside.

40
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,420
Mo Yan.

41
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,240
How come you were brave enough to confront Lan?

42
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,840
I confronted Mo Lan voluntarily.

43
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,810
I wanted to know something from him.

44
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,590
Just now,

45
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,160
another fragment was absorbed by me.

46
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,130
Can you

47
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,200
feel this?

48
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,450
You said you wanted to get close to me.

49
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,710
Looks like

50
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,340
you just wanted to get close to the fragment.

51
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,490
You got to know I wasn't Xuanyuan Yu long ago,

52
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,270
right?

53
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,330
If I'm a demon,

54
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,320
will you kill me?

55
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,590
The other day,

56
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,890
you asked me

57
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,220
if I knew what my heart wanted.

58
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,620
I know nothing

59
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,470
about many things.

60
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,780
For the past three years,

61
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,970
I've been in emptiness and confusion.

62
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,170
I didn't know where I came from

63
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,470
and I didn't know

64
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,450
where to go

65
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,080
until I married into the Mo family

66
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,070
and met you.

67
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,680
I'm very dumb.

68
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,720
But I know

69
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,240
I want to get close to you and rely on you.

70
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,370
It has nothing to do with the fragment.

71
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,060
Those fragments

72
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,930
only make me feel unsatisfied.

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,200
But when you're standing in front of me,

74
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,190
I know

75
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,020
that you are everything I want.

76
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,900
Everything you did for me

77
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,910
made me feel at ease,

78
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,970
made me obsessed with you,

79
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,090
and even made me lose myself in your love.

80
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
I feel I have changed a lot recently.

81
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,460
When I saw those rich ladies

82
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,750
look at you,

83
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,040
I was very mad.

would beat very fast.

90
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,810

Mo Yu, where are Her Ladyship and Young Master Yan?

144
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,070
I think they've gone to the front yard.

145
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,790
What's wrong?

146
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,950
A thief broke in.

147
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,990
All our food was stolen.

148
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,770
Even the hares we just hunted are gone.

149
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,390
Oh no.

150
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,020
It must have been done by demons.

151
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,230
Go report this to Young Master and Young Madam.

152
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,320
Where are you going?

153
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,740
The kitchen was robbed by demons.

154
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,160
I'm going to report it.

155
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,160
Who is she?

156
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,580
She is the demon who robbed the kitchen.

157
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,990
How timid you are!

158
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,740
How come you're afraid of a young girl?

159
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,200
You...

160
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,620
You are that snake.

161
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,340
You're so rude.

162
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,570
I'm Soaring Snake.

163
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,880
I'm not an ordinary snake.

164
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,680
Shut up!

165
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,920
You ate all our food.

166
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,290
How are you going to compensate us?

167
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,830
I'll go hunting.

168
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,890
I promise I'll bring back

169
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,850
much fresh meat.

170
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,250
No one will eat what comes out of your mouth.

171
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,040
You work hard here.

172
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,110
Don't worry.

173
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,990
I'll be obedient to you.

174
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,210
Brother Mo Lan.

175
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,250
I should go now and I'll be back soon.

176
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,620
Mo Lan, you...

177
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,960
Why are you

178
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,510
colluding with that demon?

179
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,560
I made that demon work for us.

180
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,470
Don't tell me

181
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,560
you want to go hunting yourself.

182
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,920
There is someone who is really colluding with a demon.

183
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,340
I don't know what he is thinking.

184
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,480
The food is good today.

185
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,480
Let's have a drink.

186
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,250
Here.

187
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,620
How is the food?

188
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,530
All of them were hunted by me.

189
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,940
Why are you here?

190
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,780
I'm here to hunt for you.

191
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,700
Brother Mo Lan.

192
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,540
Brother Yan.

193
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,890
I asked her to come to apologize to you.

194
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,010
Sit.

195
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,100
What are you doing?

196
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,950
You know her?

197
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,310
No.

198
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,710
Can I eat now?

199
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,450
Yes.

200
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:28,810
Let me ask you.

201
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,530
Why did you attack her?

202
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,630
I didn't.

203
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,180
Wutan Baluo did.

204
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,540
I'm telling the truth.

205
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,690
The other day, he came to me

206
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,820
and asked me to stall Mo Yan.

207
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,820
I asked why.

208
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,040
He answered that he wanted to kill someone.

209
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Are you the person he wanted to kill?

210
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,040
Stop cottoning up to us.

211
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,990
The fragment

212
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,130
was given to you by Wutan Baluo?

213
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,670
Yes.

214
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,080
He knew I was no match for you.

215
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,190
So he gave it to me.

216
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,720
He said that could make me stronger.

217
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,540
So I thought I'd better have it.

218
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,480
So later,

219
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,490
you ate a few villagers?

220
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,730
I didn't.

221
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,940
Wutan Baluo did.

222
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,020
He made you believe I did so many horrible things.

223
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,660
The flesh of those villager is old and smelly.

224
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,860
I don't like it.

225
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,430
I mean

226
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,750
I like eating small animals.

227
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,240
Just like you.

228
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,610
What does Wutan Baluo you talked about

229
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,910
look like?

230
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,180
She's a stupid short-sighted snake.

231
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,310
She can't see people's faces clearly.

232
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,080
But I remember

233
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,890
that he has feathers

234
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:41,930
and he can fly.

235
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,460
He also runs fast.

236
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,960
He's the poison-eagle.

237
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,150
The one who attacked you in the ancestral hall

238
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,150
was Wutan Baluo?

239
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,350
I didn't hear him introduce himself.

240
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,300
But

241
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
he has features that are similar to those you said.

242
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,640
And that day he called me...

243
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,510
I didn't expect Wutan Baluo to kill you in person.

244
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,550
He is the best killer in Demon Realm.

245
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,390
Sister, looks like you're really an important person.

246
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,150
Do you know

247
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,600
who sent him to kill her?

248
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,760
Only a few big shots

249
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,390
are able to get him to do that.

250
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,970
They're the demon lord,

251
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,210
First Young Demon Lord, Second Young Demon Lord,

252
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,500
and some elders.

253
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,420
But I don’t like to get involved in those things in Demon Realm.

254
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,110
I just want to be a free demon in the mountains.

255
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,830
So I don't have any more information to share.

256
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,760
Brother Yan.

257
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,460
Can I have a word with you?

258
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,710
Don't worry. She dare not hurt her.

259
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,880
[Xiao Xuan Village]

260
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,350
Brother Yan.

261
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,800
I don't know what you're hiding for her.

262
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,930
But now we've almost figured out everything.

263
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,400
Wutan Baluo wanted to kill her for some reason.

264
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,160
And he has asked many demons to find her.

265
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,330
Shi Si...

266
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,590
Let's call her that for now.

267
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,140
She might be a demon in the camp that is against Wutan Baluo's.

268
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,310
She may have something to do

269
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,170
with the battle between high-ups in the demon clan.

270
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,670
According to Lan Jia,

271
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,390
Wutan Baluo

272
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,230
wouldn't have tried to kill her himself otherwise.

273
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,390
What Lan Jia said

274
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,250
is not necessarily accurate.

275
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,740
Since she could be used by Wutan Baluo,

276
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,020
it's very likely

277
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,420
that what she told us is false information.

278
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,970
What is your real body?

279
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,150
I...

280
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,839
I'm one of the Five Mythical Beasts.

281
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,060
I'm Soaring Snake.

282
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,609
So it was you who injured my husband

283
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,089
and poisoned him?

284
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:15,829
I...

285
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,050
I had no other choice.

286
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,630
I'm just a pitiful snake.

287
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,859
I was supposed to be carefree in the mountains.

288
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:24,540
But

289
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,329
I was tricked and threatened by Wutan Baluo.

290
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,700
That's why I made mistakes.

291
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,120
Sister.

292
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,490
I really didn't mean to hurt you guys.

293
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,400
So you really don't know

294
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,690
why Wutan Baluo wanted to kill me?

295
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,830
Do you know

296
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,340
what a fragment is?

297
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,480
I get to decide whether Lan Jia can be alive or not.

298
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,890
She dare not fool us.

299
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,660
You've always hated to have anything to do with demons.

300
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,070
How come you trust Lan Jia so much this time?

301
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,670
Lan.

302
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,140
You should realize

303
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,870
that not all demons are bad.

304
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,110
Some of them are...

305
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,770
If it weren't for finding out her real identity,

306
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,360
I wouldn't have anything to do with demons.

307
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,190
Brother Yan, be rational.

308
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,830
What on earth do you want me to do?

309
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,020
I just want you to face the truth.

310
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,870
So,

311
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,870
I suppose you don't need me anymore.

312
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,760
What do you mean?

313
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,730
Brother Yan.

314
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,800
Take care.

315
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,760
Lan.

316
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,960
I'm thinking about

317
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,270
Lan Jia's words.

318
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,170
What words?

319
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,700
She said

320
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,420
she seemed to have met me before.

321
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,440
I feel I've met you somewhere before.

322
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,550
Where?

323
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,280
Let me think about it.

324
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,610
I blame my poor eyesight.

325
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,470
But I must have been very close to you back then.

326
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,210
Oh, I see.

327
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,590
A long time ago,

328
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,220
I was taken to Demon Realm.

329
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,940
They forced me to treat some big shot.

330
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,430
They wanted me to use my poison to cure him

331
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,640
and they asked me to suck blood out of the demon's bloody wound.

332
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,880
It was so disgusting.

333
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,900
What happened next?

334
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,410
I tried to escape on the way to Demon Realm.

335
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,500
But then a lot of demons came to catch me.

336
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,650
Of them, there was a beautiful girl.

337
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,780
When I was about to escape from them,

338
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,310
she suddenly caught me and squeezed my heart.

339
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,510
Speaking of which,

340
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,470
her face and scent

341
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,670
are somewhat like yours.

342
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,030
But...

343
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,890
Her hands were like burning fire.

344
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,380
I felt so uncomfortable when she touched me.

345
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,020
Her hands were totally different from yours.

346
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,170
Shi Si.

347
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,900
She might be in the camp that is against Wutan Baluo.

348
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,430
According to Lan Jia,

349
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,130
Wutan Baluo

350
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,470
wouldn't have tried to kill her himself otherwise.

351
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,730
What's wrong?

352
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,260
I'm thinking

353
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,970
how reliable Lan Jia's words are.

354
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,350
I don't know.

355
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,780
I can't remember.

356
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,630
I don't remember

357
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,500
anything of what she said.

358
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,230
Mo Lan

359
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,830
has left?

360
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,350
Yes.

361
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,830
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,000
It's not your fault.

363
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,790
I didn't handle it well.

364
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,040
He and I grew up together.

365
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,250
We spent more than ten years together.

366
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,680
Since that misfortune happened to his family,

367
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,010
he has been in my family.

368
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,370
We've never been apart before.

369
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,000
This is the first time he has been so determined to leave.

370
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,850
What happened

371
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,610
to his family?

372
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,820
Originally,

373
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,800
there are four high-class demon races in Demon Realm.

374
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,750
[Righteousness]

375
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,980
The dragon race is one of them.

376
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,590
But since many years ago,

377
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,540
the dragon race has been loyal to the human race.

378
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,740
The dragon race even contributed a lot to hunting demons.

379
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,510
Lan's mother, Suyun,

380
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,870
was one of those helpful dragons.

381
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,840
I used to think

382
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,820
this marked the beginning of the peaceful co-existence between the two races.

383
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,620
However,

384
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,900
things didn't go that way.

385
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,260
All right.

386
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,050
Stop arguing.

387
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,720
I'll let Yun Qi

388
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,550
complete the mission this time.

389
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,400
Yes, Boss.

390
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,820
Yun Qi.

391
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,220
You'll go to West Liang Prefecture to hunt Monster Taowu.

392
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,780
You must be very careful.

393
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,540
Don’t worry, Boss.

394
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,460
Boss.

395
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,710
He’s a member of the side family

396
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,740
This is such an important demon-hunting mission.

397
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,070
If he messes it up,

398
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,470
our clansmen will blame us.

399
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,610
That's right.

400
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,520
What should we do if Madam Dragon

401
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,170
colludes with the demons?

402
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,340
Lan.

403
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,230
Father.

404
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,620
Young Uncle.

405
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,260
Honey.

406
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,580
Is it settled?

407
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,230
Yes.

408
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,640
Boss let the side family complete the mission.

409
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,750
Great.

410
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,290
When we get the payment,

411
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,220
we'll have money to give salaries.

412
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,940
Let's reduce the number of our maids and valets later.

413
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,190
We'll try to give disciples of the side family reward

414
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,320
as much as possible.

415
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,940
They've been following us for years.

416
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,340
Life is not easy for them.

417
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,580
Don't worry.

418
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,610
I've made all the arrangements.

419
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,940
We three

420
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,620
can take care of each other.

421
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,950
We don't need servants.

422
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,700
Lan.

423
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,110
What do you think?

424
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,280
Mother, you're right.

425
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,040
I don't need servants.

426
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,750
I can do anything myself.

427
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,520
Your mother and I will stay in West Liang Prefecture for some days.

428
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,350
Be a good boy at home.

429
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,840
Okay?

430
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,830
Okay.

431
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,330
Young Uncle.

432
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,830
Let Lan stay with me in my house.

433
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,760
We haven’t practiced magic together for a long time.

434
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,310
Lan.

435
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,270
Do you want to stay with him?

436
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,130
Yes.

437
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,000
Then stay.

438
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:27,930
Yan'er,

439
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,880
Please take good care of him. Thanks.

440
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,040
No problem.

441
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,560
Yan'er has become more mature.

442
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,350
I believe

443
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,520
Sister Fangfei will be happy when she knows this.

444
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,580
Mother, I've become more mature too.

445
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,850
Look, I'm almost as tall as him.

446
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,220
You've really grown taller.

447
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,160
Suyun, look.

448
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,710
You're sweating.

449
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,260
Why are those jinxes here again?

450
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:52,920
I hate them.

451
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,600
They're going to take money from the main family again.

452
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,180
They're demons and should earn money the way demons do.

453
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,420
Do you think

454
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,630
that boy will grow dragon horns in the future?

455
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,530
I think he will.

456
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,950
I think so too.

457
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,560
What a brat!

458
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,150
Stop. Let's go.

459
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,160
Mother.

460
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,840
Yan'er.

461
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,640
We know we've done nothing wrong.

462
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,570
We don't need to quarrel with them.

463
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,330
Lan, I'll protect you from now on.

464
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,740
Even if you have dragon horns,

465
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,240
that'll be something great and impressive.

466
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,400
Brother Yan.

467
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,910
Thank you.

468
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,270
Hurry up.

469
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,570
Coming.

470
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,750
This way.

471
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,170
Are you okay?

472
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,440
I'm fine.

473
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,010
Yun Qi, what should we do now?

474
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,440
Elders,

475
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,810
take a rest here.

476
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,800
I'll go have a look.

477
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Yun Qi, it's dangerous out there.

478
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,110
Don't act rashly.

479
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,210
But we must destroy Monster Taowu this time.

480
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,510
I'm afraid the monster will escape.

481
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,040
Wait.

482
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,360
Monster Taowu is one of the Four Fierce Beasts.

483
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,260
We humans only have limited ability.

484
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,590
I'm afraid we're no match for the monster.

485
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,100
How about this?

486
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,240
Let the Madam Dragon go there and check the situation.

487
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,770
If the situation favors us,

488
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,920
we can attack the monster together.

489
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,060
Elder.

490
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,760
Yun Qi.

491
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,570
Madam Dragon can transform into a dragon.

492
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,360
Just let her fly there and check.

493
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,560
Monster Taowu won't be able to hurt her.

494
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:32,670
Yes.

495
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,230
Madam Dragon can fly.

496
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,920
If we go, we'll just be killed.

497
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,250
Madam Dragon, please fly there and check.

498
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,250
Don't panic.

499
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,450
Suyun.

500
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,110
Remember to come back and report the situation to us.

501
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,110
Don't kill the monster alone when the monster is injured.

502
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,440
Don't take all the credit.

503
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,150
You...

504
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:54,820
Hurry.

505
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,120
What happened next?

506
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,580
What happened to Young Uncle and the others?

507
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,490
Later,

508
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,300
Monster Taowu died.

509
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,490
[Mourn]

510
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,110
After Mo Lan's parents died,

511
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,070
the elders of Mo family

512
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:16,560
wanted to kick the dragon family out of the Mo family.

513
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,940
The son of the head of the side family is still alive.

514
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,470
What should we do about him?

515
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,460
After all, Mo Lan is a descendant of the demon clan.

516
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,330
It's inappropriate for us

517
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,750
to let him continue to stay in the main family.

518
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,020
From today onwards,

519
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,420
Mo Lan

520
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,480
should be seen as my real brother.

521
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,240
He should be taken care of by the main family.

522
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,440
From now on,

523
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,400
he and I are the children of the Mo family.

524
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,480
He should not be treated differently.

525
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,400
Only in this way

526
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,890
will the deceased be satisfied

527
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,270
and others be content.

528
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,780
I'll do as Yan'er said.

529
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,850
No more discussion about this.

530
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:03,970
From now on,

531
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:04,810
no one

532
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,980
can bad-mouth the deceased.

533
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,730
[Mourn]

534
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,420
Let's go.

535
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,490
Let’s go.

536
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,100
Lan.

537
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,780
I’ll be your brother.

538
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,400
No one will bully you.

539
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,610
Brother Yan.

540
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,870
[Mourn]
