[Episode 14]

4
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,190
You are so stupid and weak.

5
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,000
I can't believe that old turtle

6
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,340
has tried so hard to find you.

7
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,759
He has disgraced the demon clan

8
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,170
by being your supporter.

9
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,539
Young Lady,

10
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,910
since you like the human world so much,

11
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,370
stay here forever.

12
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,140
Farewell.

13
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,120
Sorry.

14
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,850
I'm late.

15
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,550
You came just in time.

16
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,240
You asked me to come half an hour later than you.

17
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,790
I dare not disobey.

18
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,560
Save Yu first!

19
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,230
Yu!

20
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,320
Yu, wake up!

21
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,720
Shaoyun.

22
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,930
Yu.

23
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,450
Shaoyun.

24
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,900
Yu, wake up.

25
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,470
Yu.

26
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,770
Don't scare me.

27
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,579
Wake up.

28
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,370
Shaoyun.

29
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,780
Shaoyun!

30
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,090
Yu.

31
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,780
You're awake.

32
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,560
Yu,

33
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,620
you're injured.

34
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,030
You must rest well.

35
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,300
What's wrong with me?

36
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,460
What happened?

37
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,710
You were in a coma.

38
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,720
I was so worried.

39
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,770
What is this place?

40
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,140
This is Xiao Xuan Village.

41
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,560
We're back?

42
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,350
Yes.

43
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,710
Just now,

44
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,350
I had a very long dream.

45
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,620
I dreamed Shaoyun...

46
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,880
Where's Shaoyun?

47
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,400
He...

48
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,600
He left.

49
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,120
Yu, don't move.

50
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,950
He left?

51
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,230
Where did he go?

52
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,380
Why did he leave?

53
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,019
Shi Si,

54
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,880
say something.

55
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,730
Why did he leave?

56
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,570
Tell me.

57
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,980
He kidnapped you.

58
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,340
When Mo Yan and I arrived,

59
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,770
he ran away.

60
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,700
What are you talking about?

61
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,100
Why would he...

62
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,780
My real name

63
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,630
is Wutan Baluo.

64
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,530
Yu,

65
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,930
are you okay?

66
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,490
What's wrong?

67
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,810
Yu.

68
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,550
Shi Si,

69
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:18,800
he...

70
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,420
he did this to me?

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,920
It was really him who did this to me?

72
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,970
He lied to me.

73
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,470
Why did he lie to me?

74
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,110
He's no longer Sikong Shaoyun.

75
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,130
He said

76
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,480
the demon has left.

77
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,340
How can it not be him?

78
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,440
Also, he knew he should come to Pucheng to find me.

79
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,650
It must be him.

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,530
Maybe...

81
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,390
that demon

82
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,680
is back again.

83
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,270
Shi Si.

84
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,070
Yu,

85
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,930
I know you're feeling sad now.

86
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,620
Don't worry. I'll accompany you.

87
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,630
I won't leave.

88
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,050
Shi Si,

89
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,320
let me have some alone time.

90
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:51,500
Okay.

91
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,080
I'll wait for you outside.

92
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,420
My Lady,

93
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,800
how is she?

94
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,770
She suffered a significant blow.

95
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,250
It's all Sikong Shaoyun's fault.

96
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,750
How are her wounds?

97
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,360
I've checked her wounds.

98
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,670
They are just some superficial injuries. They'll heal.

99
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,080
It's just that...

100
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,510
she is heartbroken.

101
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,830
You are the girl in the painting.

102
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,789
If you like this painting,

103
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,150
I

104
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,659
am giving it to you.

105
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,210
Shaoyun,

106
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,200
I like you.

107
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,470
Tell me.

108
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,840
Did

109
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,110
Sikong Shaoyun...

110
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,930
Did he change halfway

111
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,900
or has he never changed?

112
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,030
I don't have the guts to tell Yu

113
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,510
he admitted his intention of approaching her.

114
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,550
Love can't be forced.

115
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,140
She will meet her soulmate.

116
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,900
Don't worry too much.

117
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:46,870
Mo Yan.

118
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,350
Yes?

119
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,430
Tell me.

120
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,250
Can two people who love each other

121
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,310
really be together forever?

122
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,210
Of course.

123
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,230
If two lovers are separated by mountains and seas,

124
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,570
mountains and seas can be removed.

125
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,200
If only it were as simple

126
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,010
as you said.

127
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,850
Why can't things be?

128
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,980
There are boats to cross seas.

129
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,650
There are roads in mountains.

130
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,570
It's just a matter

131
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,220
of choosing to do it or not.

132
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,470
Okay.

133
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,390
Young Master Yan!

134
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,570
Young Master Yan!

135
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,550
Young Master Yan.

136
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,730
What's the matter?

137
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,260
According to the news from our spy,

138
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,980
Master will arrive at Xiao Xuan Village tomorrow.

139
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,610
Tomorrow?

140
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,120
Yes.

141
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,190
It takes at least five or six days to come here from Fengdu.

142
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,130
How come we just received the news?

143
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:56,730
I...

144
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,030
I don't know either.

145
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,360
But the spy said

146
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,660
Master's trip this time

147
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,950
is a secret.

148
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,030
No one else knows

149
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,650
except him and the elders.

150
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,010
-Father.
-Father.

151
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:37,960
Mo Yu.

152
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,630
Take the elders to the altar.

153
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,490
Yes.

154
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,080
Elders, this way, please.

155
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,730
Yan,

156
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,830
have you forgotten your identity

157
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,710
because you've been away from home for too long?

158
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,410
You've been married for almost half a year.

159
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,940
There have been many matters in the mansion lately.

160
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,330
I'm old.

161
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,220
I really don't have that much energy to handle all of them.

162
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,770
So I've been thinking

163
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,740
it's time for you to succeed me as the leader of the family.

164
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,200
Father,

165
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,550
you are still in the prime of your life.

166
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,350
It's been decided.

167
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,630
The elders are here too.

168
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,460
Let's hold

169
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,990
the succession ceremony here today.

170
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,190
We shouldn't waste more time.

171
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,430
The sooner, the better.

172
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,470
Yu.

173
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,060
Yes.

174
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,560
Yan is the eldest son of the Mo family.

175
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,500
He shoulders great responsibility.

176
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,560
You must assist him in the future.

177
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,540
Got it.

178
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,670
I came here in a hurry.

179
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,020
I'm going to take a rest.

180
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,210
My father

181
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,400
is not like this usually.

182
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,430
He always makes plans

183
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,850
before he takes actions.

184
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,530
This time,

185
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,420
it's very strange.

186
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,820
I don't know why.

187
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,500
Anyway,

188
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,030
he is your father.

189
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,850
He won't hurt you.

190
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,750
What's wrong?

191
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,360
No matter what happens,

192
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,480
you should stay by my side.

193
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,370
Understand?

194
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,690
What's going on?

195
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,200
You're acting cute

196
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,790
after becoming the leader of the Mo family.

197
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:15,990
I don't care.

198
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,240
You must promise me.

199
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,330
Okay.

200
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,390
I promise you.

201
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,320
I also want to be with you forever.

202
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,950
But what's meant to happen will happen.

203
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,560
Maybe

204
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,360
it's time to settle all scores.

205
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,830
Father.

206
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,210
Yan,

207
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,770
you are my son who I'm proud of.

208
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,750
Today,

209
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,690
I'm going to let you succeed me

210
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,470
as the leader of the Mo family.

211
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,250
I hope you won't let me down.

212
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,910
This formation is...

213
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,960
This formation

214
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,690
can enhance you two's power.

215
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,540
Go to the eye of the formation.

216
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,550
Yan,

217
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,130
there is one technique that I have never taught you.

218
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,860
Now, I'm going to teach you the last technique:

219
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,360
Rain Swallowing.

220
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,950
The Rain Swallowing technique is extremely domineering.

221
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,820
Stronger power is needed

222
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,620
to perform it compared with Lightning Chasing.

223
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,580
But Lightning Chasing symbolizes consumption,

224
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,020
while Rain Swallowing

225
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,210
symbolizes absorption.

226
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,970
Like this.

227
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,760
What's going on?

228
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,280
My power has been absorbed.

229
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,350
Father.

230
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,470
Mo Yan!

231
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,830
Father,

232
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,190
what are you doing?

233
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,040
Yan,

234
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,250
do you really think

235
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,930
I know nothing?

236
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,300
You need to shoulder the responsibility of the Mo family in the future.

237
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,100
A woman from the demon clan can't stay by your side

238
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,310
to disturb your mind.

239
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,440
You've valued love since you were little.

240
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,760
I don't blame you.

241
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,920
I am going

242
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,400
to find out her real identity for you.

243
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,520
If she is a demon,

244
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,250
her power will burst out before I absorb

245
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,710
all of it!

246
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,720
Father,

247
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,319
please let Shi Si go!

248
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,150
She really is a demon.

249
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,590
Shi Si!

250
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,170
Yan,

251
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,210
you're so unwise.

252
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,730
You gave her the Mo Ye Sword.

253
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,280
Take back the Mo Ye Sword

254
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,720
and kill that demon now!

255
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,380
You are the eldest son of the Mo family, the most honorable in the human race.

256
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,520
You and the demon clan are sworn enemies.

257
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,030
If you kill her personally,

258
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,520
I will forgive you this time.

259
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,420
After the succession ceremony,

260
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,230
the Mo family

261
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,230
will be yours.

262
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,750
Yan,

263
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,080
what are you waiting for?

264
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,300
Once she awakens,

265
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,220
she will kill everyone of the Mo family!

266
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,040
Shi Si!

267
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,710
Kill her!

268
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,740
Yan,

269
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,320
do it now!

270
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,270
Kill her!

271
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,020
Kill her!

272
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,690
Kill her!

273
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,580
Yan, you...

274
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,920
Shi Si, come with me.

275
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,790
Mo Yan.

276
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,900
Tell me.

277
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,740
Can two people who love each other

278
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,390
really be together forever?

279
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,410
♫The person in the dream♫

280
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,150
Of course.

281
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,010
If two lovers are separated by mountains and seas,

282
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,700
♫Falling like a flower♫

283
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,400
mountains and seas can be removed.

284
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:14,750
♫The heart withers into a desert♫

285
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:09,790
If only it were

286
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,590
as simple as you said.

287
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,790
It's all my fault.

288
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:21,100
♫The wind and the rain have seen through the vagaries of fate♫

289
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,600
I don't want to lose the warmth you gave me.

290
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,060
I've stayed in the human world for so long

291
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:28,880
♫Where do you wander off to?♫

292
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,330
that I almost forgot who I am.

293
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Why can't they?

294
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,800
There are boats to cross seas.

295
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,460
There are roads in mountains.

296
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,900
♫Can't see through♫

297
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,030
It's just a matter

298
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,880
of choosing to do it or not.

299
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,510
♫The karma of destiny♫

300
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,990
♫Who will accompany the song in my heart?♫

301

♫Time goes by and desolates love and hate♫

302
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,590
Sorry.

303
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,730

From now on,

308
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,590
I won't appear in your world anymore.

309
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:06,520
♫Your smile is like the spring breeze♫

310

323
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,350
