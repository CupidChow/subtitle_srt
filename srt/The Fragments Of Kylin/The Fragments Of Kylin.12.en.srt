[Episode 12]

4
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,990
One day,

5
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,170
I sneaked into the Sikong's Mansion.

6
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:52,789
Shao...

7
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,470
Do you mean

8
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,759
Sikong Shaoyun was possessed by a demon?

9
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,310
Yes.

10
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,120
I couldn't be mistaken.

11
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,450
Although I'm not good at magic,

12
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,400
I've met many demons

13
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,680
together with my father

14
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,220
since I was a child.

15
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,620
I can't defeat them,

16
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,490
but I recognize them very well.

17
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,829
I can tell

18
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,920
who is stronger or weaker at a glance.

19
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,790
Shaoyun...

20
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,770
No.

21
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,540
The demon that possessed Shaoyun

22
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,890
is definitely an expert.

23
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,140
And I read in a book that

24
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,940
people who are possessed

25
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,920
would be uncoordinated.

26
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,730
No wonder back then...

27
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I see.

28
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,590
So Yu,

29
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,960
did you see the demon's face?

30
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,060
It was too dark,

31
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,780
so I didn't see it clearly.

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,270
But

33
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,840
his claws

34
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,510
are definitely not something that the human race would have.

35
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,560
Shi Si.

36
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,840
I really don't know what to do.

37
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,350
I can only come to you.

38
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,329
Why did you come to her?

39
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,430
Why didn't you go to your father?

40
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,650
My father

41
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,000
has had difficulty in walking

42
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,160
since the Great War between Humans and Demons.

43
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,240
My Second Uncle

44
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:28,460
is now the head of the Xuanyuan family.

45
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,940
As a daughter who married into the Mo family,

46
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,070
there's no reason for me to go to my parents.

47
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,900
So, you want to

48
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,250
ask the Mo family

49
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,640
to help Sikong Shaoyun?

50
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,030
You may have forgotten

51
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,360
there are rumors about my wife, Xuanyuan Yu,

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,750
and Sikong Shaoyun having an affair.

53
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,380
Mo Yan.

54
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,820
I really don't know what to do.

55
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,480
I can only come to Shi Si.

56
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,070
I regret that I didn't take magic seriously

57
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,660
but dreamed of being a heroine all day long.

58
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,840
Now,

59
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm just a loser.

60
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,690
I've achieved nothing and gained nothing.

61
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,030
Shi Si.

62
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,720
Yu.

63
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,040
Don't worry.

64
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,660
There will be a way.

65
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,970
Don't take what Mo Yan said

66
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,290
to heart.

67
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,020
He is kind-hearted.

68
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,990
But he likes to talk tough.

69
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,210
He was right.

70
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,850
I didn't take your feelings into account.

71
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,920
He has no reason

72
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,730
to help his love rival.

73
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,370
Everyone has their own feelings.

74
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,850
No one loves to be cheated.

75
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,490
I have had a crush

76
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,200
on Shaoyun

77
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,380
since I saw him

78
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,310
at the Martial Arts Tournament that year.

79
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,530
After my engagement to the Mo family,

80
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,020
I even refused to compromise

81
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,440
and confessed my love in public.

82
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,240
Then you married into the Mo family on my behalf.

83
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,950
I thought

84
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,120
I could pursue my dream

85
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,480
and venture out

86
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,100
like Fairy Fangfei

87
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,220
but I failed.

88
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,760
When I went to find Shaoyun,

89
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,250
I found that he was possessed by the demon.

90
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,340
I couldn't save him

91
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,680
on my own, Shi Si.

92
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,270
In the end, not only did I drag you down,

93
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,680
but also couldn't protect my beloved one.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,310
It's not like that, Yu.

95
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,020
You didn't drag us down.

96
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,900
I'm doing well.

97
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,860
Mo Yan treats me well too.

98
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,650
I'm already very content.

99
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,130
Shi Si.

100
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,830
As Mo Yan said,

101
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,800
I have to take the blame.

102
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,280
But I'm really happy for you.

103
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,460
I remember when you got married,

104
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,420
you told me

105
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,970
you didn't have the right to love

106
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,930
and you didn't expect anyone to love you.

107
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,650
Maybe it's because you want nothing

108
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,440
so

109
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,780
now,

110
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,820
you can meet someone

111
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,510
who is sincere.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,760
Yu,

113
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,070
you will also meet someone

114
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,470
who really loves you.

115
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,040
Don't worry.

116
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,750
We will help you.

117
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,920
Everything will be fine.

118
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,550
Okay.

119
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,350
[Xiao Xuan Village]

120
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,070
This rabbit is so cute.

121
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,080
Let me tell you.

122
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,480
It must be delicious

123
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,180
if it's braised.

124
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,470
Come on.

125
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,670
Why are you always thinking about food?

126
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,730
What are you doing?

127
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,500
Mo Yan.

128
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,120
What are we going to do

129
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,560
with this little rabbit?

130
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,160
Can I eat it?

131
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,970
It's still alive.

132
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,590
But it looks like

133
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,800
it's going to die soon.

134
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,690
Look.

135
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,190
Don't touch it.

136
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,800
Is this the one brought by Xuanyuan Yu?

137
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,310
Yes.

138
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,520
I don't know what kind of injury it got.

139
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,280
Look.

140
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:29,910
It's...

141
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,610
Don't move.

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,159
A fragment?

143
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,290
Why is there a fragment here?

144
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,920
Today,

145
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,530
the second neighbor I was going to take you to

146
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,560
is the rabbits.

147
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,370
Why is the fragment

148
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,620
hiding in this little rabbit's belly?

149
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,930
I see.

150
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,890
It must have eaten it secretly.

151
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,300
Could it be

152
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,370
it was injured and dropped out

153
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,750
because it couldn't withstand such energy?

154
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,610
I didn't expect Xuanyuan Yu to seek refuge from Shi Si

155
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,620
brainlessly,

156
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,270
but she brought us a gift.

157
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,350
Who is it?

158
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,500
Your lady.

159
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,030
She is in that room.

160
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,600
Go ahead.

161
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,310
Take it.

162
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,550
Young Master.

163
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,040
What

164
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,810
is going on?

165
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,690
Congratulations, Mo Yan.

166
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,550
It takes no effort at all to get it.

167
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,190
Yeah.

168
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,550
Thanks to you for leading the way.

169
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,159
My Lady, it's really you.

170
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,370
Xiaohe.

171
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,080
Xiaohe, I miss you so much.

172
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,440
Long time no see.

173
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,559
Come on.

174
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,830
No.

175
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,400
We just got a living creature.

176
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,990
Are you having designs on it again?

177
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,790
Young Master.

178
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,920
She ate all our stocks.

179
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,010
There's nothing left.

180
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,890
Mo Yan.

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,230
A man who is never content is like a snake trying to swallow an elephant.

182
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,430
I'm far from

183
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,950
eating an elephant.

184
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,410
You still claim to be reasonable?

185
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,830
Should I thank you for your mercy?

186
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,330
You're welcome.

187
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,950
I'm not praising you.

188
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,620
Don't you understand human language?

189
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,920
I understand.

190
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,940
Aren't you a human?

191
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,950
You're the one who is not human.

192
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,190
I'm indeed not a human.

193
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:20,590
You...

194
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,120
How could you do this as a snake?

195
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,420
-What are you talking about?
-Enough.

196
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,010
Shut up!

197
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,760
I can't even find a quiet place.

198
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,900
Why are you following me?

199
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,190
What are you doing?

200
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,320
Little girl,

201
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,330
think carefully about what I have told you.

202
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,660
Say something.

203
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,790
Say something.

204
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,720
Who are you talking to?

205
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,020
Nothing.

206
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,490
I haven't mastered the martial arts you taught me before.

207
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,020
My swordsmanship is not as graceful as yours.

208
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,890
Teach me again.

209
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,600
Honey,

210
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,080
did you forget something?

211
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,710
What...

212
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,450
What is it?

213
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,390
Yu.

214
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,640
Shi Si.

215
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,170
Didn't we agree to go shopping at the foot of the mountain today?

216
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,360
I forgot about it.

217
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,420
Before this, Xiaohe and the others were the ones to do this.

218
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,680
Young Master Yan from the Mo family

219
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,710
has detained you in the mountain

220
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,880
for a month or two.

221
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,230
You have to go down the mountain for a walk.

222
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,390
What do you know?

223
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,060
It's beautiful here,

224
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,250
which makes it a good place for cultivation.

225
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,280
However,

226
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,310
those unambitious people with low spiritual energy

227
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,110
can't feel it.

228
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,550
Why are you being so...

229
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,190
Alright.

230
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,010
Let's go down the mountain for a walk.

231
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:28,570
Okay.

232
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,280
Honey,

233
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,110
it's been a long time

234
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,570
since we haven't gone to a market.

235
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,640
Let's go together.

236
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,060
Wait.

237
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,900
The sword.

238
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,260
-Go!
-Let's go.

239
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,240
Slow down.

240
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,230
Why is it so foggy?

241
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,590
Is it going to rain?

242
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,920
Be careful.

243
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,640
I have a bad feeling.

244
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,160
Don't jinx it.

245
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,270
We're having a girl talk.

246
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,680
Can you stay away from us?

247
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,700
Shi Si.

248
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,420
Why are you so worried?

249
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:09,840
Nothing.

250
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,210
Did Mo Yan bully you?

251
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,010
Do you want me to avenge you?

252
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,850
Why do you think so?

253
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,050
He seems

254
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,420
to have a bad temper.

255
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,970
He disses the others with just one mouth.

256
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,990
Yu,

257
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,160
I do have something

258
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,890
that I don't know how to tell him.

259
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,420
Mo Yan.

260
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,760
I need to go to the toilet.

261
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,440
Shi Si is coming with me to find a residence.

262
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,620
Wait here for a while.

263
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,260
Let's go.

264
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,720
You can tell me now.

265
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,350
Tell me.

266
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,710
Why can't you tell me?

267
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,750
Did he bully you?

268
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,030
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

269
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,260
No, no.

270
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,750
Yu.

271
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,200
Yes?

272
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,110
Let me ask you.

273
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,440
When you took me back to the Xuanyuan's Mansion three years ago,

274
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,560
did I...

275
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,280
It smells so good.

276
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,230
Yu.

277
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,710
Yu, what's wrong with you?

278
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,790
Who's there?

279
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,970
Who are you?

280
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,310
Come out!

281
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,420
Mo Yan.

282
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,280
Why are you here?

283
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,940
Let me tell you, Yu...

284
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,830
For me?

285
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,640
So many flowers.

286
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,790
So beautiful.

287
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,520
Mo Yan.

288
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,720
I forgot to tell you.

289
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,740
Yu and I got separated in the forest.

290
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,830
And I...

291
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,480
You're not Mo Yan.

292
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,120
Who are you?

293
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,760
My Lady.

294
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,330
Calm down.

295
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,550
Tell me!

296
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:50,770
My Lady.

297
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,990
I'm Mo Jialuo.

298
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,660
I'm Mo Jialuo.

299
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,390
Mo Jialuo?

300
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,110
It's you again.

301
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,600
My Lady.

302
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,980
Let's talk nicely.

303
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,350
Put the sword away

304
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,750
first.

305
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,340
My Lady,

306
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,380
are you having many questions

307
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,040
in your mind at the moment?

308
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,530
Tell me about it.

309
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,580
My Lady,

310
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,090
aren't you curious about

311
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,030
why you are here?

312
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,140
My Lady,

313
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,570
do you want to know

314
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,830
why

315
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,300
I dressed up

316
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,850
as Mo Yan?

317
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,350
Do I

318
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,450
seem familiar to you?

319
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,670
As if

320
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,400
we've known each other for a long time?

321
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,250
It's like we've met

322
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,780
in a dream.

323
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,710
I haven't met you in my dreams.

324
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:08,800
But,

325
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,300
how did you know?

326
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,970
How did you know what I was thinking?

327
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,160
My Lady!

328
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,109
This is my illusion.

329
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,960
Of course I know.

330
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:28,410
Where is Yu?

331
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,980
Yu?

332
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,770
Yu...

333
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,800
Is it that girl?

334
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,940
I've already...

335
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,890
Is she in danger?

336
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,530
How could she be in danger, My Lady?

337
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,180
She should be

338
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,930
sleeping at the moment.

339
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,460
My Lady.

340
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,410
At this point,

341
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,400
why are you still talking about other things?

342
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,720
Look.

343
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,590
At this moment,

344
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,080
in front of the beautiful scenery,

345
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
a man and a woman

346
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,610
are together,

347
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,710
with passion running through us.

348
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,100
Should we...

349
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,060
Old tortoise.

350
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,900
Silly fish.

351
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,590
You forgot your duty again.

352
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,420
Who are you?

353
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,180
What do you want?

354
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,870
You took me here.

355
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,420
What is your intention?

356
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,360
The elder of the demon clan, Bei Zuo,

357
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,460
sends regards to the First Young Demon Lord.

358
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,040
What are you doing?

359
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,140
Get up.

360
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,710
You...

361
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,230
You call me the First Young Demon Lord?

362
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,310
Shaoyun.

363
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,140
Wait for me.

364
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,310
Sikong Shaoyun is getting married today.

365
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,000
But the bride is not you.

366
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,870
He's getting married?

367
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,140
Who is he marrying?

368
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,970
Why are you here?

369
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,380
I was wondering why you were here.

370
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
It's been so long.

371
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,340
Where is Shi Si?

372
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,560
I...

373
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,480
I...

374
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,760
I don't know.

375
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,880
You are the first heir of the late demon lord.

376
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,330
After the war between the two races three years ago,

377
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,810
you went missing.

378
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,690
We have no choice

379
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,120
but to ask you to meet us in this way.

380
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,520
Please forgive us, First Young Demon Lord.

381
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,750
Yes, My Lady.

382
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,170
You're always

383
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,490
with that...

384
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,710
Mo Yan.

385
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,530
It's hard for me to take action.

386
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,570
This time, I finally got a chance.

387
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,080
Fortunately, your friend

388
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,210
is not good at magic.

389
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,610
Everyone in the Demon Realm is looking forward to it day and night.

390
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,890
Thank god,

391
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,180
I finally found the First Young Demon Lord.

392
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:22,530
I...

393
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,360
Old tortoise.

394
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,120
It was me who found her, okay?

395
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,630
How dare you say that?

396
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,900
If you hadn't been out of your mind

397
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,990
when you came here

398
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,510
and forgot to invite the First Young Demon Lord back,

399
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,210
do we have to wait till today?

400
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:35,990
This...

401
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,790
It's a restriction to my race,

402
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,220
I can do nothing about it.

403
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,110
All right.

404
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,870
Get up.

405
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,000
Thank you, First Young Demon Lord.

406
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,110
Stop calling me First Young Demon Lord.

407
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,720
I'm just an ordinary person.

408
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,420
You must be mistaken

409
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,930
and have come to the wrong person.

410
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,450
Can you let me out first?

411
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,410
My Lady,

412
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,910
you clearly have doubts in your heart too.

413
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,660
Why are you in a hurry to deny it?

414
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,730
Stop reading my mind.

415
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,550
No.

416
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,700
I'm sure I'm not mistaken.

417
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,820
Yes, My Lady.

418
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,260
You are my beloved one.

419
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,180
How could I mistake you for someone else?

420
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,310
Don't you understand human language?

421
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,250
I don't know what the Demon Realm is,

422
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,520
or any people in it.

423
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,730
I'm not the First Young Demon Lord.

424
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,750
You got the wrong person.

425
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,250
Don't waste your time.

426
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,380
My Lady.

427
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,440
I see.

428
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,090
That makes sense.

429
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,340
First Young Demon Lord,

430
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,480
may I know

431
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,930
if you

432
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,160
lost your memory

433
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,750
three years ago?

434
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,710
With the First Young Demon Lord's personality,

435
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,400
she won't leave the Demon Realm alone.

436
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,650
But if

437
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,010
she lost her memory

438
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,260
and was bewitched by the human race,

439
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,240
then...

440
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,290
I said I'm not.

441
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,780
First Young Demon Lord, you…

442
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,310
It's up to me

443
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,820
to decide who I am.

444
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,370
I don't need outsiders to speculate about it.

445
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,700
First Young Demon Lord,

446
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,670
if you regain your memory,

447
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,210
will you still insist on this?

448
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:29,750
I...

449
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,370
Sister.

450
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,690
Look at you.

451
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,320
Who are you?

452
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,310
Who am I?

453
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,550
I'm the king of this world.

454
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,470
And a king

455
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,250
has to prioritize his own desire

456
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,190
above all beings.

457
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,850
The future of the demon clan

458
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,880
is

459
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,930
to conquer the mortal world.

460
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,800
First Young Demon Lord,

461
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,960
everyone in the Demon Realm

462
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,510
wants you

463
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,170
to come back soon

464
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,340
and call the shots.

465
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,350
I'm not.

466
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,980
I don't want to be the First Young Demon Lord.

467
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,650
Whether it's the demon clan

468
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,810
or the survival of the mortal world,

469
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,340
it has nothing to do with me.

470
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,450
The First Young Demon Lord

471
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,550
seems to be awakened soon.

472
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,770
This is not awakening.

473
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,440
Her state is not right at all.

474
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,580
My Lady.

475
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,740
My Lady.

476
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,410
Take your time to recall it.

477
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,780
Think bit by bit.

478
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,930
We're not in a hurry.

479
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,050
No hurry.

480
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,150
We...

481
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,990
We'll take our leave first

482
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,950
and leave you to it.

483
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,130
Little girl,

484
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,430
don't you trust me?

485
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,280
Shi Si.

486
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,080
Shi Si.

487
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,590
Shi Si.

488
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,880
Shi Si, what's wrong?

489
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,940
Why are you sleeping here?

490
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,090
What's wrong?

491
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,270
Did the demon come to you again?

492
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,770
Are you hurt?

493
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,940
I'm fine.

494
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,580
It's just that

495
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,510
I met that fish again

496
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,620
and fell into his illusion.

497
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,660
I knew it was him.

498
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,810
I sensed that Mo Ye was nearby just now.

499
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,130
The only explanation is you were in an illusion.

500
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,450
What brought him here?

501
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,050
Hasn't he given up his obsession with you?

502
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,480
What?

503
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,680
What did I miss?

504
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,200
Nothing.

505
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,830
What's wrong with him?

506
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,620
Nothing.

507
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,970
He was worried

508
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,840
I would be taken away by a fish.

509
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,940
He doesn't deserve it.

510
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,910
Young Master Yan.

511
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,500
You're really something.

512
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,230
You are jealous of a fish.

513
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,220
Shut up!

514
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,540
What?

515
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,680
Why are you looking at me?

516
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,390
Nothing.

517
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,450
I keep looking at you

518
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,690
because I think you're good-looking.

519
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,950
Really?

520
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,480
Yes.

521
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,370
Of course.

Yes.

A little.

525
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,230
Come on.

526
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,550
Let's go down the mountain and eat something delicious.

527
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,390
Mo Yan.

528
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,140
You can put me down.

529
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,770
I can walk on my own.

530
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,450
-Well done, Mo Yan.
-Put me down.

531
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,600
Put me down.

532
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,230
No.

533
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,920
Mo Yan.

534
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,440
Is that okay?

535
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,430
She seems to be too close

536
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,580
to these humans.

537
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:48,980
How about

538
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,520
we take her back forcibly?

539
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,780
If she doesn't regain her memory,

540
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,940
even if we take her back,

541
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,380
I'm afraid she's no match for him.

542
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,250
But I think

543
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,030
if we let her indulge herself now,

544
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,300
she will be more painful

545
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,560
in the future.

546
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,960
This is what she has to experience.

547
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,250
Once she regains her memory,

548
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,430
I believe

549
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,050
she will come back.

-It smells good.

577
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,760
[Roast]

578
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,720
Mo Yan.

579
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,880
Have you ever eaten roasted squid?

580
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,860
Of course I have.

581
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,020
When I was cultivating in Xiao Xuan Village,

582
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,720
I often went down the mountain to eat roasted squid.

583
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,120
Boss.

584
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,340
Keep the change.

585
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:23,980
Okay.

586
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:24,470
Hold on.

587
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,590
Mo Yan likes to eat roasted squid.

588
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,090
Does Mo Yu know that? ("Mo Yu" sounds like "squid" in Mandarin)

589
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,120
Not only does he know about it,

590
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,480
but he loves roasted squid more than I do.

591
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,340
The world is getting worse because of cannibalism.

592
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,640
Sir, your roasted squid is ready.

593
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,280
How is it?

594
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,300
It's delicious.

595
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,120
Oh no!

596
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:50,200
[Roast]

597
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,630
Someone fainted.

598
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,570
Help!

599
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,430
-Does anyone know him?
-What happened?

600
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:49,960
Let's go.

601
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,080
Excuse me.

602
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,320
Yu.

603
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,200
Shaoyun.

604
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,080
Physician Chen.

605
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,500
How's Shaoyun?

606
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,350
Just tell me how to treat him.

607
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,880
Don't worry about the cost.

608
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,060
Uncle Chen,

609
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,680
just be frank.

610
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,890
He

611
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,550
hadn't eaten for days,

612
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,290
so he fainted.

613
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,760
As for your mention

614
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,950
of him being possessed by a demon,

615
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,680
I found void magic power

616
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,350
in his meridians

617
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,610
and no traces of demonic aura.

618
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,450
I didn't find anything wrong with it.

619
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,650
Maybe we need some time

620
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,990
to observe.

621
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,510
Or maybe

622
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,500
I'm not good enough at medicine.

623
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,550
You are the best physician in Fengdu.

624
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,590
Don't say that.

625
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,280
You happened to retire in Pucheng.

626
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,740
Sorry for disturbing you.

627
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,150
Don't mention it.

628
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,890
The Mo family is my former boss.

629
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,130
I'll prescribe

630
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,120
a tranquilizer for him first.

631
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,480
Thank you.

632
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,960
Since he's fine,

633
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,340
I'll order someone

634
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,680
to send him home as soon as possible.

635
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,660
No way.

636
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,710
Yu.

637
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,070
Now that the demon has been removed from Sikong,

638
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,640
we should contact the Sikong Family as soon as possible.

639
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,420
The Sikong family only focuses on their business.

640
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,750
They don't know much about demon hunting.

641
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,560
What if...

642
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,600
What if the demon comes back again?

643
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,200
They don't know anything.

644
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,590
How could they deal with it?

645
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,750
What are you going to do then?

646
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,110
I...

647
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,260
After all, I'm from the demon-hunting household.

648
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,790
I have the responsibility to take care of him.

649
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,260
What can you do?

650
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,030
I...

651
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,180
Don't underestimate me.

652
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,980
Although my magic is not as good as yours...

653
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,990
You're far worse than me.

654
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,210
Shi Si.

655
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,880
Look at him.

656
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,270
I...

657
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,380
Please.

658
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,960
Mo Yan.

659
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,600
Although the demon has been removed from Sikong Shaoyun,

660
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,250
we don't know

661
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,880
whether he will be possessed after this.

662
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,560
Also,

663
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,320
it's indeed strange

664
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,270
for him to appear here suddenly.

665
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,830
As Yu said,

666
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,210
if we send Sikong Shaoyun

667
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,610
back to the Sikong's Mansion,

668
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,070
it might not be a good idea.

669
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
That makes sense.

670
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,250
At this point,

671
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,280
we should observe him for a few more days.

672
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,550
After he wakes up,

673
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,040
we'll discuss it further.

674
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,390
Okay.

675
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,860
Shaoyun.

676
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,870
Why do you seem preoccupied?

677
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,320
I'm thinking about

678
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:56,130
a series of strange events that happened today.

679
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,800
It gives me a bad feeling.

680
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,260
Why are you also superstitious?

681
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,760
It's about you.

682
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,960
I can't be careless.

683
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,600
You suddenly disappeared today.

684
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,750
I was scared.

685
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,000
What were you afraid of?

686
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,000
I was afraid that you'd leave me.

687
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,480
Mo Yan.

688
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,890
Have you ever thought about

689
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,800
what Mo Lan said

690
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,820
might be true?

691
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,060
I have thought about it.

692
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,760
Me too.

693
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,730
You know what?

694
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,180
I've never liked to run away

695
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,610
since I was young.

696
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,409
But since I met you,

697
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,370
I've always wished that

698
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,830
time could pass slowly.

699
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,969
It's as if the truth

700
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,120
will never come by doing so.

701
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,870
I'm a coward, aren't I?

702
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,830
I'm the coward.

703
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,050
If possible,

704
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,389
I hope...

705
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,150
Shi Si, Mo Yan.

706
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,250
Shaoyun is awake.
