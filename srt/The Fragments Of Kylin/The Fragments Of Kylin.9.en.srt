[Episode 9]

4
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,350
Young Master

5
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,190
This beast is way too scary!

6
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,390
So it is a Tengshe,

7
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,259
one of the Five Mythical Beasts.

8
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,720
So it has been hiding here?

9
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,280
Young Master

10
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,509
You know it?

11
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,740
More than that.

12
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,900
I have badly injured it before.

13
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,270
Consider this as a reunion.

14
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,990
Lan Jia,

15
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,080
long time no see.

16
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,230
Oh it's you, Mo Yan.

17
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,510
We're in the middle of nowhere,

18
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,190
I don't suppose you are here to chat?

19
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,590
You have been doing evil in this vicinity,

20
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,850
so I'm here to kill you.

21
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,350
Nice timing.

22
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,400
I want to test

23
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,910
the treasures I have collected recently.

24
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,600
Young Master

25
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,920
what is this?

26
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,670
This is Lan Jia's snake poison.

27
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,200
It's extremely corrosive.

28
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,380
Extremely corrosive?

29
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:03,910
Snake!

30
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,590
Snake poison?

31
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,880
Hang on.

32
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,990
Her snake poison's

33
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,250
potency has became way stronger.

34
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,630
What happened?

35
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,190
My Lady.

36
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:28,740
What's going on?

37
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,150
Xiaohe.

38
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,710
Don't panic.

39
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,750
That's great My Lady.

40
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,210
The water has stabilized.

41
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,160
Mo Yan

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,100
how long you intend to cowardly hide in the barrier?

43
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:03,930
Oh no

44
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,170
My power hasn't fully recovered.

45
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,510
Mo Yan

46
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,480
Why is it still the same trick?

47
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,220
While the wound you slashed before

48
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,560
will never heal,

49
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,250
now,

50
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,280
you can't even touch me.

51
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
Mo Yan

52
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,470
you haven't improved at all.

53
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,910
I'm very disappointed.

54
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,540
My Lady.

55
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,220
What should we do?

56
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,850
The water is moving again.

57
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,170
Are you alright?

58
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,170
Young Master Mo Lan, you're back.

59
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,100
What happened?

60
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,050
I don't know.

61
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,530
Not long after Mo Yan left this morning,

62
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,909
the poison came flooding in.

63
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,310
Where did Brother Yan go?

64
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,390
He said there were unusual mountain activity

65
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,040
and he just left.

66
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,560
He said he's going...

67
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,110
Oh no!

68
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,800
My Lady, calm down!

69
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,160
You won't be able to help,

70
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,540
worst still, you might cause trouble.

71
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,910
Something must have happened to Mo Yan.

72
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,950
Young Master Yan is so powerful.

73
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,430
With Young Master Mo Lan going as well

74
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,210
they will be fine. Don't worry.

75
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,390
Please calm down.

76
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,090
That's right.

77
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,770
He will definitely be fine.

78
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,090
Brother Yan

79
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,710
Before I find you,

80
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,530
please do not have any mishap.

81
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,700
Young Master

82
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,360
Young Master!

83
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,040
I'll kill you!

84
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,930
Alright,

85
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,210
if you are killed by me,

86
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,190
it's worth it.

87
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,700
You this stupid snake.

88
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,150
Do you want to die?

89
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,030
You're just a half-baked dragon.

90
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,080
I have a fragment.

91
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,680
Why should I be afraid of him?

92
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,150
Brother Mo Lan.

93
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,920
I was wrong.

94
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,230
I didn't mean it.

95
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,200
I just wanted to try this fragment.

96
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,760
This treasure can enhance one's power.

97
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,110
I just wanted to give this a try,

98
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,640
I didn't want to kill Mo Yan.

99
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,690
I can give it to you.

100
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,120
Don't kill me.

101
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,190
If I kill you,

102
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,550
I can still take away the fragment.

103
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,909
Mo Yan is poisoned by my snake poison.

104
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,710
You don't want him to die, do you?

105
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,490
I can give you the antidote.

106
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,310
I promise

107
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,530
I won't come out and commit evil again.

108
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,930
Brother Mo Lan.

109
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,110
I'm still young,

110
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,350
and immature...

111
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,440
Could you give me one more chance,

112
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,350
please?

113
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,590
Brother Mo Lan, I'll give you the antidote.

114
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,250
Get lost!

115
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,340
Don't let me see you again.

116
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,920
I don't want to see you too.

117
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,300
Brother Yan

118
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,520
Brother Yan!

119
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,990
Mo Lan

120
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,360
Why hasn't he woken up?

121
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,280
He just took the antidote for snake poison,

122
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,940
the effect won't be that fast.

123
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,510
Is he badly injured?

124
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,250
Yes.

125
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,410
Do you know he got hurt because of you?

126
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,010
What?

127
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,900
He used Lightning Chasing to disperse your poison last night,

128
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
and almost exhausted all his power.

129
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,110
As for his meeting with that stupid snake today,

130
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,020
if I hadn't arrived in time,

131
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,260
he would have reduced into a pool of poison.

132
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,130
But he told me...

133
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,350
Lightning Chasing?

134
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,000
He said he can use it at will, right?

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,240
Lightning Chasing is a technique used to increase power.

136
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,080
In battles,

137
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,850
it is the crucial move to win in a blow.

138
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,280
It was never meant for doing treatments.

139
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,120
Depending on how long the treatment takes,

140
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,670
equal power are needed to maintain the physical form.

141
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,360
It is akin to the meridian points

142
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,690
being pierced by extremely sharp powers.

143
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,420
You know how

144
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,010
damaging it is to his body?

145
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,550
Three years ago,

146
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,120
the head of the Xuanyuan family was poisoned

147
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,520
by the Demon Lord Shuntian's demonic aura.

148
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
The poisonous gas

149
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
is hundred times more poisonous than bats.

150
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,780
Dozen of Xuanyuan's family sorcerers

151
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,830
used Lightning Chasing to disperse the poison.

152
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,430
They died exhausting their power and imploded their meridians.

153
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,030
Even so, Xuanyuan Chang still did not recover.

154
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,210
You know

155
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,320
about this, right?

156
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,270
Xuanyuan Chang is your father,

157
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,470
you surely know that.

158
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,920
Unless...

159
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,630
you are not Xuanyuan Yu.

160
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,260
Is it strange that I know?

161
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,210
You tried so hard to hide it from us

162
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,850
to help the Demon Clan in harming him.

163
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,210
What?

164
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,300
You are entangled with the Demon Clan,

165
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,830
do I need to spell it all out?

166
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,270
I'm not.

167
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,200
You're not what?

168
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,470
Have you been truthful to him?

169
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,300
You both have been married for so long.

170
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,030
How many times has he saved you?

171
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,480
He did so much for you.

172
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,000
Do you think you're worthy of it?

173
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,690
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,420
Young Madam is out.

175
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,060
Young Madam!

176
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,320
Is Young Master awake?

177
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,190
Well...

178
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,260
No way they are fighting now right?

179
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,120
But why does she look like

180
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,920
she is crying?

181
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,570
Lan

182
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:13,730
Brother Yan

183
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,320
You...

184
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,170
Why are you back?

185
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,470
What?

186
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,560
If I don't come back,

187
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,510
you'd have been killed by that stupid snake.

188
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,450
You saved me?

189
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,800
You transformed into a dragon?

190
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,710
If I didn't transform into a dragon, how can I...

191
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,440
Nonsense!

192
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,320
How could you...

193
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,690
Brother Yan

194
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,240
In that situation–

195
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,520
Your life is shortened by five years every time you transform.

196
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,200
Why were you so impulsive?

197
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,610
As long as I can save you,

198
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,380
I don't mind reducing my life by even 50 years.

199
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,600
Brother Yan

200
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,730
You gave me my life.

201
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,430
No matter what happens to me,

202
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,850
I won't let you die.

203
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,320
If you die,

204
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,840
I will kill all the people I need to kill.

205
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,040
Lan

206
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,300
don’t do this again.

207
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,480
As long as you're not in danger again.

208
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,580
Did you kill Lan Jia?

209
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,960
No.

210
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,230
She negotiated with me with your antidote,

211
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,090
so I let her off.

212
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,280
This girl is quite sensible.

213
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,840
Although Soaring Snake is known as a small dragon,

214
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,930
it's not worthy before you, a real dragon.

215
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,800
It's just a worm.

216
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,830
However,

217
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,040
unlike before, her snake poison

218
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,580
became more poisonous.

219
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,400
It is because of this.

220
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,820
That's why her power improved.

221
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,530
No wonder.

222
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
No wonder she can break my barrier.

223
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,080
Just say it.

224
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,870
Xiao Xuan Village was attacked today.

225
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,860
My wife...

226
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,420
Your fake wife is fine.

227
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,920
I came back initially

228
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,980
to discuss with you to capture Lan Jia

229
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,790
but ended up saving your wife.

230
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,240
Lan

231
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,600
thank you.

232
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,760
I just think

233
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,970
if she dies because of a snake bite,

234
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,870
It's too embarrassing to be killed by a snake bite.

235
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,670
A snake.

236
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,400
You mean Lan Jia?

237
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,470
That's right.

238
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,650
I suspect it's a diversionary tactic.

239
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,040
On that note,

240
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,950
this stupid snake is usually very lazy.

241
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,550
Since the last time you subdued it,

242
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,280
she hasn't caused any trouble.

243
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,990
However, this time the scout reported that
it had eaten several villagers.

244
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,650
I suspect something is amiss.

245
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,610
And sure enough,

246
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,620
it was because of this fragment

247
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,900
Just like the bat.

248
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,600
You mean

249
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,800
Lan Jia was also ordered to kill her?

250
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:51,880
Yes.

251
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,900
You're not cultivating today?

252
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
You don't seem happy that I am awake.

253
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,630
No.

254
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,280
I'm happy.

255
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,850
You're crying?

256
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,670
Why?

258
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,990
Please,

259
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,340
don't get hurt because of me anymore,

260
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,470
okay?

261
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,530
My injuries were caused by the demon clan.

262
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,130
It has nothing to do with you.

263
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,599
It's cold outside.

264
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,270
Let's go back inside and rest.

265
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,079
Mo Yan,

266
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,520
I really don't know what to do.

267
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,580
I’ve told you before

268
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,090
not to trust me anymore.

269
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,800
But whenever I was in danger,

270
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,590
I always hoped you would come to save me.

271
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,480
I know it's wrong,

272
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,720
but I just can't help

273
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,240
thinking of you.

274
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,490
You're so kind to me

275
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,610
even though you don't know who I am.

276
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,880
Then why won't you tell me？

277
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,940
If I say,

278
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,060
I don't even know my own identity,

279
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,210
would you think I'm lying to you?

280
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,870
I don't want to deceive you anymore.

281
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,040
I don't know since when,

282
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,000
but I just don't want to do that to you anymore, Mo Yan.

283
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,240
Even if you ignore me,

284
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,460
or despise me,

285
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,380
I accept it.

286
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,410
Do you even have a conscience?

287
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,700
I've become like this because of you.

288
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,520
Yet you still say I despise you.

289
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,010
Yes.

290
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,030
Lightning Chasing is so dangerous,
but you used it to heal me.

291
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,510
Why didn't you tell me?

292
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,620
You were so badly injured.

293
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,800
I was completely helpless.

294
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,610
Why didn't you tell me?

295
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,470
Do you know

296
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,640
these calamities may even be caused by me?

297
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,270
I don't want to see you get hurt.

298
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,670
If you get hurt, then I...

299
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,640
I just don't want to lose you,

300
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,560
Mo Yan.

301
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,620
Alright, alright.

302
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,990
Don't cry anymore, don't cry.

303
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,880
I...

304
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,800
Do you even know

305
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,400
your own heart?

306
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,240
I don't.

307
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,240
You are crying over me,

308
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,540
don't you know by now?

309
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,680
Will you cry for Sikong Shaoyun?

310
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,670
What about Mo Jialuo?

311
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,390
No.

312
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,350
Mo Yan.

313
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,150
You...

314
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,260
You may not know,

315
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,980
but I already know.

316
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,120
About what?

317
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
I'll wait for you.

318
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,370
But hurry up.

319
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,880
The demon clan has been attacking you frequently of late.

320
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,280
Your magic is still insufficient to defend yourself.

321
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,540
To ensure your safety,

322
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,080
I'll entrust you with the authority over the Mo Ye Sword.

323
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,560
In case any misfortune occurs

324
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,690
when I'm not around.

325
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,550
This...Mo Ye Sword

326
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,880
is the sacred artifact of the Mo Family.

327
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,630
You're going to give it to me?

328
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,360
Don't worry,

329
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,400
I'm just sharing it with you.

330
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
The sword remains under my control.

331
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,910
No.

332
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,610
You know what I've told you

333
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,550
about my identity...

334
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,680
It's irrelevant.

335
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,840
I just want to

336
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,190
do everything in my power to protect you.

337
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,080
I will bear

338
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,940
all the consequences.

339
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,190
But I can't...

340
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,490
If you don't want to see me get hurt again,

341
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,580
then do as I say.

342
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,050
Mo Ye Sword is a top-tier demon-hunting artifact.

343
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,740
It's selective and demanding in its choice of master.

344
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,070
Therefore, when gaining control over it,

345
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,010
you must calm your mind and focus.

346
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,750
Ensure that the magical energy in your meridians

347
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,210
does not flow in the opposite direction
to the sword's energy.

348
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,790
It's already midday.

349
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,970
Why is there still no movement?

350
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,100
Mo Yu,

351
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,480
have My Lady and Young Master Yan gotten up yet?

352
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,720
It’s still early.

353
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Let me tell you...

354
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,090
Yesterday, they...

355
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,430
No kidding!

356
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,980
Really! I'm telling you...

357
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,880
What's the big idea!

358
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,030
Don't fill your head with nonsense at such a young age,

359
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,860
or you'll wear yourself out too soon!

360
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,050
If you haven't seen it,

361
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,910
how do you know what I'm watching?

362
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,040
Did I say I haven't seen it?

363
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,360
Then tell me...

364
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,420
My Lady, Young Master Yan, you're up!

365
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,660
Young Master,

366
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,700
you just recovered from your injury,

367
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,820
please take care of yourself.

368
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,600
For what?

369
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,020
In a broad daylight like this,

370
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,620
try to be a bit more discreet.

371
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,460
That's right.

372
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,120
Both Mo Yu and I are still young.

373
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,670
What are you talking about?

374
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,530
It's so hot.

375
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,140
Here, have some water.

376
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,780
It's normal to feel this way right after the ritual ends.

377
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,330
Be careful not to catch a cold.

378
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:17,830
Okay.

379
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,840
You had gunpowder for breakfast?

380
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,600
It's okay.

381
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,040
You go ahead and eat.

382
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,190
I'll go and take a look.

383
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:34,720
OKay.

384
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,880
My Lady, you don't look well.

385
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,950
Are you okay?

386
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,560
Mo Yan

387
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,040
has shared the authority to wield

388
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,570
the Mo Ye Sword with me.

389
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,280
My Lady,

390
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,870
the meal is ready.

391
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,400
Why aren't they back yet?

392
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,270
It's getting dark already.

393
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,440
Xiaohe,

394
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,500
it looks like it's going to rain soon.

395
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,420
Take an umbrella to the bridge to meet them.

396
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:41,960
Okay.

397
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,100
Just come out.

398
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,110
Where is Mo Yan?

399
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,390
I found an excuse to trap him.

400
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,230
In these mountains,

401
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:50,100
there are still quite a few demon clan members
who will listen to me.

402
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,220
As long as he's safe,

403
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,110
I'm relieved.

404
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,190
I’m afraid you’re the only one who can put him in danger.

405
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,980
You, Young Madam, have truly good tactics,

406
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,780
even gaining the control over the Moye Sword.

407
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,080
Without the authority,

408
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,090
perhaps you can't even touch it, right?

409
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,830
What exactly do you want?

410
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,780
I know what you want to ask me.

411
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,340
But I really can't

412
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,000
answer that question.

413
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,130
You're hiding something.

414
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,480
No.

415
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,640
I lost my memory three years ago.

416
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,490
I don't remember anything.

417
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,460
Three years ago.

418
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,820
Neither too early nor too late,

419
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,640
indeed

420
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,090
intriguing.

421
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,870
You suspect

422
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
I'm affiliated with the demon clan?

423
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,180
Is there even any doubt?

424
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,850
All your behaviors are beyond common sense.

425
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,820
That fish

426
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,070
also called you "My Lady".

427
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,700
Since we came to Xiao Xuan Village,

428
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,780
the demon clan has been after you time and time again.

429
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600
Who exactly are you?

430
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,430
I don't know.

431
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,160
Then at this point...

432
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,880
Please don't.

433
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,880
Are you still trying to quibble?

434
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,620
You pretended to be Xuanyuan Yu from the beginning,

435
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,220
hiding everything from Yan.

436
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,020
He knew early on all the doubts about your identity,

437
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,220
yet still treated you like ever before.

438
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,280
How can you

439
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,250
trample on his sincerity like this?

440
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,200
You mean

441
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,290
Mo Yan thinks I belong to the demon clan as well?

442
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,180
Unfortunately,

443
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,990
he's been blinded by you

444
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
and naively believes that

445
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,730
you would confess to him voluntarily.

446
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,770
He can tolerate it.

447
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,040
But I can't.

448
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,790
I didn't mean to deceive him,

449
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,720
nor did I intend to trample on his sincerity.

450
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,520
I just...

451
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,190
Even if I misjudged,

452
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,310
I shall take

453
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,910
all the blame alone.

454
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,360
I know I can't defeat you.

455
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,490
If I die,

456
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,220
please tell him for me,

457
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,680
thank him for trusting me.

458
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,290
Mo Lan,

459
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,990
please make sure

460
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,440
to always protect him well.

461
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,640
You need not say more.

462
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,050
I'll eliminate anyone or anything

463
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,990
that could do harm to him.

464
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,400
Come at me!
