1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,100
You already bought popcorn?

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,020
Let's get... Let's get the couple's set.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,972
I'm getting caramel popcorn. What do you want?

4
00:00:13,754 --> 00:00:16,237
I want original.

5
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:20,773
A couple's set, please. Half caramel, half original.

6
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:26,293
 @User Not Found 

7
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,791
You're trash.

8
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:47,593
You can't stop thinking about it, right?

9
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,123
You regret it.

10
00:00:51,123 --> 00:00:53,428
You try to justify it.

11
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:58,126
Hey!

12
00:00:58,126 --> 00:01:02,230
This is one of the reasons I like you.

13
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,905
But you should think about your feelings before your friends'.

14
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,324
The most important thing is you. Not someone else.

15
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,538
Go! Go to the cinema.

16
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,102
If it doesn't work...

17
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:25,737
If they ask why you're there, just tell them you want to watch the movie with them.

18
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:29,056
What's wrong with that?

19
00:01:41,277 --> 00:01:43,790
 Shin Yi Joon 

20
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,270
 Bayleef Coffee 

21
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,901
Hi.

22
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:03,057
Let me help you.

23
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,354
Instead...

24
00:02:09,372 --> 00:02:11,573
Don't fall in love with me.

25
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:15,703
What?

26
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:19,881
Okay.

27
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:21,499
Let's go.

28
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,080
 9 

29
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,680
 9 

30
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,210
 8 

31
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:48,870
Do you want to try it?

32
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,982
I've never tried it.

33
00:02:50,982 --> 00:02:54,723
I'll teach you. Come here.

34
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,296
- To load the gun... 
 - Me, too!

35
00:02:58,296 --> 00:03:00,489
Pull once.

36
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,220
It's this, right?

37
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,505
Do you see the black dot?

38
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:15,022
What? What did you say?

39
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:17,639
- Put your face as close as you can to this. 
 - Okay.

40
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,909
Don't aim for the center. Aim for the spot slightly above the center.

41
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:25,163
This is so hard.

42
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,670
 9 

43
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,940
 10.1 

44
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,780
 65.1 
 75.2 

45
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,700
 10.1 

46
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,290
 10.1 

47
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,032
Wow!

48
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,354
You're really good.

49
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:08,622
Oh! Wow... You're very good!

50
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:10,239
A marksman.

51
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,986
Thank you.

52
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,291
Did I do well?

53
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:19,142
Wow, Min Jae! You're a better shot than me.

54
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:33,908
That was fun. Can I try again?

55
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:35,321
Sure.

56
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,556
Can I even eat popcorn?

57
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,411
Are you going to eat the whole thing?

58
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:55,346
Oh... Sorry.

59
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,926
Can I pull this up?

60
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,438
Is this right?

61
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,569
Why?

62
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:22,029
It's a bit too much?

63
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:24,562
Why?

64
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,148
Are you getting butterflies?

65
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:29,357
No.

66
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:33,017
You're just pretending anyway.

67
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:37,863
Are you being sarcastic? Did you learn that from No-Min?

68
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:39,468
You've learned some skills.

69
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:40,951
What?

70
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:46,663
No, no. That's not what I meant I mean...

71
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,913
Thank you.

72
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:55,599
Actually,

73
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:59,748
I couldn't figure you out at first.

74
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:06,154
You confused me. You seemed nice but cold.

75
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:08,997
You seemed friendly but sometimes felt like a stranger.

76
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,042
But...

77
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,351
I think I know you now.

78
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:22,042
You're always helping others.

79
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:29,179
I'm glad I'm friends with you.

80
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,117
Yu Min Jae.

81
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,062
Why do you think I'm helping you?

82
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,642
It was okay, I guess

83
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,290
Ah, the movie was about this.

84
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,597
You didn't like it?

85
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:10,541
No, I liked it.

86
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,183
It's already so late.

87
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,003
How are you getting home?

88
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:21,756
Ah. Hye Joon, are you taking Min Jae home?

89
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:26,640
No. We're going separately.

90
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:32,058
Ji Wan! We have to take the same bus.

91
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:34,296
Huh?

92
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:38,732
Yes, but...

93
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:40,129
Let's go together.

94
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,331
What?

95
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:44,004
It'll be boring if I take the bus alone.

96
00:07:45,054 --> 00:07:48,103
Then... Bye, guys.

97
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:53,875
Come on. Aren't you coming?

98
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:59,648
1407 will be here soon Run, Ji Wan!

99
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:25,400
The moon

100
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,567
is very beautiful today.

101
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,753
Yeah. It is.

102
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:39,952
Hey, should we go?

103
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:55,387
What are you doing?

104
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:58,147
What?

105
00:08:58,147 --> 00:09:00,823
You're doing this on purpose.

106
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:03,703
You even skipped classes for this.

107
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:05,722
I know.

108
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:09,448
It's just that...

109
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,886
You're trying too hard.

110
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:17,513
I had no idea you'd lie about getting asked out.

111
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:23,005
Ji Wan. Why are you so desperate?

112
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:25,347
This is not like you.

113
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:30,971
What are you talking about, Hye Joon?

114
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:34,367
You don't have feelings for Shin Yi Joon.

115
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:39,772
You don't like Yu Min Jae.

116
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:41,667
Is that why you're doing this?

117
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:44,887
It's not true.

118
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:46,754
Hye Joon.

119
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,718
What's wrong with you?

120
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:50,734
You're being childish.

121
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,300
 Bus stop 

122
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,830
We're a bit similar.

123
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,682
You know that, right?

124
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:07,399
That's why I can see right through you.

125
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:10,259
I know, right?

126
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:14,950
Stop obsessing over Shin Yi Joon.

127
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:19,419
I know that you don't like him.

128
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,171
I can also see through you.

129
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:28,710
Let's stop here.

130
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,036
It's more advantageous for both of us to be friends.

131
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,508
But if you cross the line again,

132
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:43,543
I won't stand by.

133
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:58,687
Did you like the movie?

134
00:10:59,878 --> 00:11:01,845
It was...

135
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:06,054
It was sadder than I expected.

136
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,929
But...

137
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:15,870
I couldn't concentrate.

138
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:21,192
Right.

139
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,004
 Is he angry? 

140
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:33,066
It was uncomfortable, wasn't it?

141
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:37,266
 Why did she bring Shin Hye Joon? 

142
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:45,332
I'm sorry.

143
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:49,104
For asking without thinking.

144
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,315
For making you uncomfortable.

145
00:11:58,977 --> 00:12:01,796
No! Umm...

146
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:04,818
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:06,473 --> 00:12:09,613
For interrupting your date.

148
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:28,858
 Han Ji Wan... Shin Hye Joon... 

149
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:32,967
 The rumor about you asking every girl out. 

150
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:34,654
 You're... 

151
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:37,301
 You're... 

152
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:42,377
The movie...

153
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:46,081
Why did you ask me out?

154
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:54,375
 You're the only person 

155
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,664
 that I can talk to 

156
00:12:57,664 --> 00:12:59,629
 with a smile. 

157
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:06,309
 I wanted you to say that I'm the only one 

158
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:08,063
 that can make you smile. 

159
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:11,675
 But 

160
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:17,388
 I can't tell what's in your heart? 

161
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:27,889
I'll leave now.

162
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,768
Yu Min Jae!

163
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:42,904
It was good.

164
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,423
Because you were there.

165
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:58,614
It was good for me, too

166
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:19,086
 Shin Hye Joon: Did you get home safely? 

167
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:21,114
 Ji Wan: Min Jae, are you home? 

168
00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:35,546
 You might not feel the same, but what I wanted to say was... 

169
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:48,063
 I don't know how you feel about me, 

170
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:51,791
 but I can't help but like you. 

171
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:58,137
 Your words made me happy, again. 

172
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:03,922
 I 

173
00:15:03,922 --> 00:15:06,166
 still live in the past 

174
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,075
 when we were together. 

175
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,620
 Seeing that I can't bring myself to erase those memories. 

176
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:17,964
 This wasn't my original intention. 

177
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:29,040
 I hate myself 

178
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:32,894
 for not saying it out loud. 

179
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:37,127
 So I decided 

180
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:39,451
 to just 

181
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:41,725
 like you 

182
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:43,947
 secretly. 

183
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,360
 UTUBE J's playlist | 'I don't know how you feel about me'... 

184
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:26,100


185
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,453

 @Next episode 
 - Let's just tell them 
 - No! 

187
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:37,068
 I didn't want to lie to you, Da Ye. 

188
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:39,792
 You seem to think about the boys more than us. 

189
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:44,489
 I guess Shin Yi Joon is done with going through girls. He's clinging to one girl now. 

190
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:47,349
 - No way! 
 - It's true. 

191
00:16:47,349 --> 00:16:48,679
 You said you didn't want people to find out. 

192
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,844
 You asked me to help. 

193
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:51,911
 Stop!
