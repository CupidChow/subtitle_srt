1
00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:02,218
You're pretty.

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:03,140
You're really pretty.

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,325
Like this?

4
00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:06,539
- When I'm like this? 
 - You look good.

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,052
 @User Not Found 
 Behind The Scenes 

6
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:12,891
 Yi Joon and Hye Joon's first meeting
 You two are the same age. 

7
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:14,492
- That's what she says. 
 - Yes, I knew.

8
00:00:14,492 --> 00:00:16,310
- Oh, really? 
 - Yes.

9
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,308
 Awkward Yi Joon and Hye Joon 

10
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:19,302
When is your birthday?

11
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:20,921
- March 15th. 
 - Oh! You're older.

12
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:21,924
 Same age anyway, LOL 

13
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:23,724
- When is yours? 
 - May.

14
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,544
What should we talk about?

15
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:27,140
Well...

16
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:32,266
We thought maybe you two should play a game to get rid of the awkwardness.

17
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:36,704
 Halli Galli is here! 
 Be careful what you wish for. 

18
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,851
 Faster than light  
 Wow!

19
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:40,998
He's good!

20
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:48,213
 Wrong move 
 LOL 

21
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:53,536
Hye Joon is sleeping.

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,283
- I'm giving him advantages. 
 - Oh, advantages?

23
00:00:56,283 --> 00:00:58,028
I'll start.

24
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,119
 Hye Joon wins just like that!  
 Wow!

25
00:01:01,902 --> 00:01:05,941
 Tap tap tap tap tap 

26
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,100
 Yi Joon sweeps away the cards 

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,523
You're really good!

28
00:01:09,523 --> 00:01:11,488
Maybe you've got long arms.

29
00:01:12,854 --> 00:01:14,700
 Cards are piling up 

30
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:17,033
Big scores.

31
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,979
 Yi Joon wins again 

32
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:24,132
Take them.

33
00:01:24,132 --> 00:01:27,221
- It's not easy. 
 - You should be younger to win.

34
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,590
 Yi Joon on a roll, LOL  
 Oh...

35
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,174
 The game ends with Yi Joon's perfect win 

36
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,219
Have you taken the MBTI test?

37
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,422
I'm an ESFP.

38
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:36,638
ESFP?

39
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,306
S-ESFP.

40
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,553
I'm an ISTP.

41
00:01:39,553 --> 00:01:43,477
Only two factors are different. E, I, and the other one.

42
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,064
You're outgoing?

43
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,065
I'm not outgoing.

44
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,312
But "I" means you're not social.

45
00:01:48,312 --> 00:01:51,523
I think the "I" should be changed.

46
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:52,613
Are you a shy person?

47
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,822
Yes.

48
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,709
 End of conversation, LOL 

49
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,037
That's why you're an "I."

50
00:01:58,037 --> 00:01:59,442
Oh, that's right.

51
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:04,499
Hye Joon, do you read your lines as is, or...

52
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,604
You mean improvising?

53
00:02:05,604 --> 00:02:07,374
I'm not good at it.

54
00:02:07,374 --> 00:02:08,958
So you usually memorize the basic lines?

55
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,080
Yes.

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,613
 The other actor  
 I like to go along the other actor's line.

57
00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:13,620
Oh...

58
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,660
You're quietly pressuring him.

59
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,056
 Begin reading lines!  
 Are you still upset at the incident?

60
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,533
About what?

61
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,528
Never mind.

62
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:27,514
Do we go to an actual field?

63
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,774
- Yes, near the faucet. 
 - Faucet or the field?

64
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,642
Oh, that's good.

65
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,263
- Why is it good? 
 - Huh? I... 
 - Did you imagine it?

66
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:36,447
 Yi Joon's dream scene is a field scene  
 I imagined it.

67
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:42,085
You read lines together with Yi Joon today.

68
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:44,426
Please tell us how it was.

69
00:02:44,426 --> 00:02:47,698
Today was the second time reading lines.

70
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,804
And it was my first time with Yi Joon.

71
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:56,734
He's very good-looking with a small face, and he's taller than me.

72
00:02:57,531 --> 00:03:02,822
And he makes me comfortable, so I really enjoyed it a lot.

73
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:03,829
Please give a compliment.

74
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:04,808
- Oh, compliment? 
 - You only received it.

75
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:05,995
Hye Joon.

76
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:07,141
Hye Joon!

77
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:10,085
 He's not a robot.  
 Even his name is so handsome.

78
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:13,188
About what you said earlier... Which one?

79
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:14,949
- That he looks like school president. 
 - Oh!

80
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:16,883
I've said it earlier.

81
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:19,772
His eyes are very clear.

82
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,439
His hairstyle is so pretty.

83
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,495
And he looks like the school president.

84
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:28,280
Hye Joon plays the school president in the series,

85
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,135
and it suits him well.

86
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:31,987
I also have something to say.

87
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:33,030
 Obtains the right to speak  
 Proceed.

88
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,459
Objection!

89
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:36,397
Yi Joon' is usually described as a cold type.

90
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:37,592
He looks cold.

91
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,469
Oh, really?

92
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:40,178
- For real. 
 - Really?

93
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:42,231
You have such a cold look.

94
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:45,679
You have such a nice look.

95
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,411
 LOL 

96
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:51,331
I think I'll have fun.

97
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:52,976
And now…

98
00:03:52,976 --> 00:03:56,392
I want to become close with Hye Joon as a friend of the same age.

99
00:03:56,392 --> 00:03:59,235
 Finish before it gets awkward again 

100
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:00,324
The end!

101
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:03,410
 In the midst of a basketball court scene 

102
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,999
 Yi Joon scores in just one shot 

103
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,021
Let's make some noise.

104
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,269
Okay!

105
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:20,761
 Plenty of handsomeness 

106
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,250
Nice!

107
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:25,223
What's that!

108
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,075
Look!

109
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:33,506
- Please! 
 - Nice!

110
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:37,680
You suck, haha.

111
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,262
So bad.

112
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:45,621
The camera is not rolling.

113
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:47,728
Save your energy.

114
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,085
 That was like a teen movie 

115
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,990


116
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,167
We should do a commercial.

117
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,431
 Human Pocari...♥ 

118
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,962
 Checking movements in detail!  
 Should I stare like this?

119
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:14,355
What's so uncomfortable?

120
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,783
They want to get closer with you, too.

121
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:21,191
Oh, right!

122
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:23,423
Then when are you coming home?

123
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:27,144
Never mind.

124
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:28,684
Call me when you come.

125
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:30,483
I'm off.

126
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:38,420
 Awkward arm pose 
 Today is the second time with each other 

127
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:42,050
This is Yi Joon's real high school.

128
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,003
He's right.

129
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:44,952
It's so cool here at night.

130
00:05:44,952 --> 00:05:48,045
The lights sparkle at night.

131
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:51,026
They're so fascinating.

132
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:54,395
Your eyes are so fascinating.

133
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:57,645
Are you two good at playing basketball?

134
00:05:57,645 --> 00:06:00,097
I don't know if you saw the scene before.

135
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:02,157
I'm really good.

136
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,740
I'm very good at it.

137
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,097
 Statement of conviction  
 I'm just joking, I prefer soccer.

138
00:06:09,097 --> 00:06:10,108
How about you? What do you like?

139
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,824
I like soccer. Are you good at it?

140
00:06:11,824 --> 00:06:13,455
- I like soccer. 
  Change of attitude faster than light  
 - I like basketball.

141
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:14,902
- You like basketball? 
 - Yes.

142
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:16,484
Are you sure?

143
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:18,493
I didn't play it properly yet.

144
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm too tired.

145
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,717
 Curious at the equipment  
 What is it called?

146
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:25,416
- This thing? 
 - Yes, we want to remember the name...

147
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,215
- It's called a jammer. 
 - Jammer. 
 - Jammer!

148
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:28,676
Windjammer, to be exact.

149
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:30,110
Oh, wind!

150
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,770
Call it jammer to look like a pro.

151
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,312
 Trying it out right away  
 Wow, is it a windjammer?

152
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,244
Wow, how did you know?

153
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:39,463
 Proud  
 I practiced... I found out...

154
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:41,109
- Like this. 
 - "You good?"

155
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,716
 "You're good" 

156
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:44,913
Where are we, So Hyun?

157
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:47,068
We're at a karaoke!

158
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:49,696
Ta-da!

159
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:51,191
Why are we here?

160
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:55,457
We're here for Min Jae's welcome party!

161
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:59,022
I enjoyed your singing just now.

162
00:06:59,022 --> 00:06:59,909
For real...?

163
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,499
Yes.

164
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:05,295
You might be surprised to see me sing for real.

165
00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:08,792
But I'll keep it a secret!

166
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:10,967
I have been practicing a dance more, for a while.

167
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,265
Which one?

168
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,055
Movie Star by CIX.

169
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:16,384
Movie Star!

170
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:18,850
I really like the song.

171
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,952
It's an honor.

172
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:21,209
- Oh really? 
 - Yes!

173
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:22,877
- Do you know CIX? 
 - I do.

174
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:26,495
- For real? 
 - I like the member called Bae Jin Young.

175
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:29,950
Wow, we have similar taste.

176
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,933
I know.

177
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,452
 Karaoke live concert  
 Lyrics by Bae Jin Young! Love it!

178
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,851
 with Bae Jin Young of CIX! 

179
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:36,793
Did you really write the lyrics?

180
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:38,886
Of course.

 Imagination scene in the movie theater  
We  look at each other?

200
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:56,505
- Yes, look at each other. 
 - And then?

201
00:08:56,505 --> 00:08:57,622
 Fails to hold in the laughter 

202
00:08:57,632 --> 00:09:00,190
I become cheesy from here?

203
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,290
 Mellow 

204
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,640
 Fails again 
 LOL 

205
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,377
What should I do here?

206
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:08,371
 Cringe  
 You're so pretty... 
  LOL 

207
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,053
You're so pretty...

208
00:09:10,053 --> 00:09:11,921
You're so pretty, Min Jae.

209
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:13,876
- Pretty. 
 - Pretty...

210
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:16,247
 Heart drops♥ 

211
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,268
 Movie theater scene starts now! 

212
00:09:24,674 --> 00:09:28,234
 Hands meet while having popcorn 

213
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,843
You're so pretty...

214
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:42,537
- Cut! 
 - That was an okay cut.

215
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:44,425
Okay.

216
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,219
 Q. How did you practice the cheesy tone?  
 On the script...

217
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:52,581
It said to act like Choi Joon.

218
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,339
So I practiced it like this.

219
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,554
"So pretty..." 
 I was going for a funny tone like this.

220
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,264
 Can't give up the comedy  
 But that wasn't what they wanted.

221
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,840
I had to act as if I fell in love with Min Jae.

222
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,603
Because Min Jae is so pretty...

223
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,616
it was very easy for me!

224
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:11,194
 Reality scene in the movie theater 

225
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:13,053
I'm putting it up.

226
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:22,968
Is this... right?

227
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:24,628
Why?

228
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,863
It's a bit... weird.

229
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,340
 Q. Which scene is it?]/i&gt; 
 We're at the movie theater. 

230
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:36,761
Min Jae and Yi Joon were supposed to watch the movie together.

231
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,764
But Ji Wan got in the way.

232
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:47,155
So I'm helping Min Jae and Yi Joon become closer.

233
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:49,891
I'm trying to make fun of Yi Joon

234
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:54,103
and make him jealous.

235
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:57,290
 Unpredictable Hye Joon 
 Suddenly shows off his popcorn 

236
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,366
 Yum 

237
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:05,112
 Q. Did Yi Joon just get jealous?  
 Hye Joon…

238
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,563
What do you call this?

239
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:07,292
Armrest?

240
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:10,378
Armrest! He just lifted it up.

241
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:15,098
I've never put it up at a movie theater in my whole life.

242
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,968
Seriously.

243
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:22,051
So it felt very new when I read this script.

244
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:24,526
Wow... Lifting the armrest...?

245
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:29,642
It's unexpected.

246
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:32,438
I haven't been to the theater a lot,

247
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:34,443
even when I was young.

248
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,558
It's been a while.

249
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:40,306
I was very excited on the way here.

250
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:43,280
I need to go prepare the scene.

251
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:47,397
So I'll continue with the rest of the interview later.

252
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:48,917
Bye!

253
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:50,788
You get scared for a minute.

254
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:54,213
Then think, "who is this and what is this situation?"

255
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,397
 Hyun Jin and Ji Wan rehearsing  
 Why do you make me come all the way here?

256
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:02,479
Hey!

257
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:04,364
Stop it.

258
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:05,608
Yu Min Jae?

259
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:09,060
You need to walk up to this point.

260
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:12,790
You haven't changed.

261
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,611
You think you're the best, and you only think of yourself.

262
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:20,063
 Min Jae holds onto No-Min's hand 

263
00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:23,638
But I still have feelings for you.

264
00:12:23,638 --> 00:12:25,166
Feelings?

265
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,673
Stop joking.

266
00:12:26,673 --> 00:12:27,837
What?

267
00:12:27,837 --> 00:12:29,390
 Q. Why did you hold No-Min's hand?  
 To show her I'm here for her.

268
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,852
That I'm on her side.

269
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,281
Love you, No-Min.

270
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:38,740
- Me too! 
 - Hmph!

271
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,440
We'll start from there.

272
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,860
Okay, let's go.

273
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,099
Is this a video?

274
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:55,380
The next time you follow me,

275
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,403
I won't be the only one in trouble.

276
00:13:00,873 --> 00:13:02,506
Let's go.

277
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:08,971
Cut!

278
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:10,456
 Q. How was it when your friends came?  
 I was so moved.

279
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,250
 Moved 

280
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,926
They are such kind friends.

281
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,073
What I did…

282
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:17,828
Although I was mean to them.

283
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,382
 Guessing Hyun Jin's actual name  
 Seung Gyu!

284
00:13:19,393 --> 00:13:21,331
Wow, how did you know?

285
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:22,648
Wow!

286
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:25,207
 She doesn't know his last name  
 What's your last name?

287
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:27,901
Lee!

288
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:29,978
Lee Seung Gyu?

289
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:32,079
 The answer was Lee Seung Gyu  
 Is my name funny?

290
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,652
Your last name is very common.

291
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:39,349
He said he's not cold.

292
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:40,637
Not cold at all.

293
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:42,180
I don't know what cold is.

294
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,136
And he keeps on saying, "I'm cold."

295
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:49,466
I asked him if he wanted a blanket, but he wrapped his neck with it.

296
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:51,612
- It's very very... 
 - I'm warm now.

297
00:13:51,612 --> 00:13:55,237
 Q. What scene is this?  
 Yi Joon is in middle school

298
00:13:55,237 --> 00:13:58,091
and is getting counseling with the teacher.

299
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:03,363
I've had some counseling when I was a student.

300
00:14:03,363 --> 00:14:06,487
So I'll quickly get an okay cut

301
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:10,959
and let the UNF team and the staff all go home.

302
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,601
Leave work on time. 
  Leave work 

303
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,843
 Middle schooler Yi Joon is in counseling  
 You know him.

304
00:14:14,843 --> 00:14:17,204
He's smart and sincere.

305
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:20,019
I think he just told them to write his name instead of mine.

306
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:23,595
You can go now I'll take care of the rest.

307
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:24,447
Do I go this way?

308
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,694
This direction...

309
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:28,926
And then get caught by her.

310
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:33,737
 Real_final_last_scene.mp4  
 It is the last scene for real.

311
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:37,251
Finally, in this long journey,

312
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:41,212
 He's not sleep-talking  
 with many lines...

313
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:44,399
- Let's get ready. 
 - Yes, that's right. 
  Quick exit. 

314
00:14:46,364 --> 00:14:48,153
Cut!

315
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:48,982
Okay!

316
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:52,200
Let's shoot the grabbing hand again.

317
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,851
 Real_real_final_real_last_scene.mp4  
 Real real last cut!

318
00:14:54,851 --> 00:15:00,398
 EU couple sharing a heat pack♥ 

319
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:04,661
You said you don't feel good…

320
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,657
Never mind, it must be closed.

321
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,998
Then...

322
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:12,828
You want to go to the karaoke?

323
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,560
Cut! Okay!

324
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,210
Cut. Okay.

325
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,728
Thank you!.

326
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:22,852
 Long-waited kiss scene behind!  
 Meet eyes here.

327
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:26,144
- Then I pull her in... 
 - That's right.

328
00:15:26,144 --> 00:15:29,015
I smile as I pull, then become more serious.

329
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:30,304
Yes, that's right.

330
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,102
 S#220.Park-Evening 
 Yi Joon and Min Jae lean against each other 

331
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:33,761
 as they listen to the music on the phone  
 Wow!

332
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:35,968
I really like this song.

333
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,061
Isn't it good?

334
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,771
I like all the songs on this playlist.

335
00:15:40,715 --> 00:15:45,422
The reply on "Even if I've never gone out, I want to have a kiss" was...

336
00:15:46,622 --> 00:15:48,438
It was the most impressive.

337
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:49,685
I'm going to delete all the comments.

338
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:52,355
Don't. It's okay.

339
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:55,329
 Awkward on their first kiss scene 

340
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,320
Cut!

341
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,690
Oh my.

342
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,547
 Stomach growl 

343
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:08,052
 LOL 

344
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,480
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,542
It was so loud.

346
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,220
 A cut due to the growling sound  
 Why is it so loud?

347
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,190
- Wow! 
 - Just a little bit longer.

348
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:15,808
It's so loud.

349
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:20,396
The reply on "Even if I've never gone out, I want to have a kiss" was...

350
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,362
It was the most impressive.

351
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:24,900
I'm going to delete all the comments.

352
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,210
Don't. It's okay.

353
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,230
 How will it go this time? 

354
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:42,734
 Yi Joon's hand was awkward 

355
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:44,712
I'll start from the laugh.

356
00:16:44,723 --> 00:16:46,605
Ready.

357
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:50,260
Action!

358
00:16:56,116 --> 00:17:00,978
The reply on "Even if I've never gone out, I want...

359
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,927
Never gone... out?

360
00:17:02,927 --> 00:17:04,734
Yes.

361
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:06,850
Oh, that's right.

362
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,600
 Continues right away! 

363
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,525
Action!

364
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:21,681
The reply on "Even if I've never gone out, I want to have a kiss" was...

365
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:23,517
It was the most impressive.

366
00:17:23,517 --> 00:17:25,252
I'm going to delete all the comments!

367
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,750
Don't. It's okay.

368
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,106
Cut, okay!

369
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,008
I'm going to delete all the comments!

370
00:17:58,008 --> 00:18:00,370
Don't. It's okay.

371
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,914
Wait, hold on.

372
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,764
 Q. What scene is this?  
 Min Jae and Yi Joon are...

373
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:19,677
They're being lovey-dovey.

374
00:18:19,687 --> 00:18:22,852
Yes, lovey-dovey.

375
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,921
Lovey-dovey.

376
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:33,880
 Lovey-dovey in reality 
 Taking a selfie 

377
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,602
Ta-da!

378
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:53,798
 Looking at the photos taken together  
 They came out well.

379
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:57,119
There's something missing in Min Jae's photos.

380
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,967
That special...

381
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:04,617
 Realistic photo analyst of Min Jae  
 freshness that only Min Jae has.

382
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:09,231
It was a very exciting and fun moment.

383
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,008
You're the queen for today.

384
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:12,793
How was your first kissing scene?

385
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:13,819
 So surprised  
 What??!!

386
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,988
Oh, first kiss scene...

387
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,998
I think Min Jae and I

388
00:19:19,998 --> 00:19:24,196
became a bit closer.

389
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:28,941
Since we were sitting together, we got to talk a lot.

390
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:31,744
I felt closer to her.

391
00:19:31,744 --> 00:19:33,689
We are becoming closer.

392
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:36,647
 A few bloopers from the hard drive! 

393
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:39,456
Guys, did you two promise to meet here without me knowing?

394
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:40,746
 Flower petal on Yi Joon's shirt 

395
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:41,852
Cut!

396
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:44,611
This is great!

397
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:46,646
I'm hungry.

398
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:57,462
 Drops the phone out of excitement  
 I'm sorry.

399
00:19:58,412 --> 00:19:59,178
I'm sorry.

400
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:00,950
Okay, now the ending!

401
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:09,850
 Cut, because of the shaky table 

402
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,344
I saw it once by chance.

403
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,774
 What was the line? 

404
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:18,434
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:20,268
What was it?

406
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,597
Action!

407
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:28,726
I'm sorry!

408
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:29,750
Shall we go on from the previous scene?

409
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,690
You went a little too forward.

410
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,982
You pushed me too hard.

411
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:33,814
It was too hard?

412
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:36,284
Honey.

413
00:20:36,284 --> 00:20:37,418
Cut!

414
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:38,424
Cut!

415
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:40,263
Okay!

416
00:20:40,263 --> 00:20:42,307
What was it?

417
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,062
Okay, cut!

418
00:20:43,062 --> 00:20:44,160
"You," then what was it?

419
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,177
He might have just wanted to go together because we're friends.

420
00:20:49,177 --> 00:20:52,601
 What was it... LOL 

421
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:54,022
Cut! We'll try one more time.

422
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:56,405
I'm sorry.

423
00:20:58,192 --> 00:20:59,982
I really like this song.

424
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:00,993
Isn't it good?

425
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,779
I like all the songs on the playlist.

426
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:07,855
I'll do it over. It's, "It's so good."

427
00:21:07,855 --> 00:21:09,143
It's so good!

428
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:12,382
Han Ji Wan... I'm sorry.

429
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:16,141
 Cute 

430
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:19,052
Use your energy to find out...

431
00:21:19,052 --> 00:21:21,329
the opponent's...

432
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,832
Use your energy to find out the opponent's movement.

433
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:31,431
And bring out the hidden spirit when no one is around!

434
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:36,023
Cut! Um...

435
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:40,080
 Stop the birds...  
 When you...

436
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:44,693
- When you...
  Bird sounds 

437
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,097
Cut!

438
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:50,199
Action!

439
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,297
You can be disappointed.

440
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:56,796
 Caw caw caw 

441
00:21:56,796 --> 00:21:58,192
- You can be disappointed. 
 - Cut.

442
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,481
 Birds are having a party  
 But why are they so...

443
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,920
I know...

444
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:08,848
Cut!

445
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:10,836
Okay, cut.

446
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:14,478
Cut.

447
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:15,511
Cut!

448
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:16,660
Cut!

449
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,490
Okay, cut

450
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:21,109
Cut!

451
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:23,316
Okay, cut.

452
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:28,271
 Holding in laughter 

453
00:22:29,964 --> 00:22:33,810
What... do you mean?

454
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,645
The...

455
00:22:34,656 --> 00:22:36,578
I'm sorry.

456
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:40,149
Deduction?

457
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,223
When you wear it…

458
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,671
Cut!

459
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,765
I messed it up.

460
00:22:54,765 --> 00:22:56,450
Can't you stay a little longer?

461
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,207
Okay, four minutes.

462
00:22:58,207 --> 00:22:59,707
No... five minutes.

463
00:22:59,707 --> 00:23:01,735
Three.

464
00:23:01,735 --> 00:23:03,682
Okay, four minutes!

465
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,285
You're pretty today, Min Jae.

466
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,274
How about tomorrow?

467
00:23:08,285 --> 00:23:09,763
I'm more pretty.

468
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,481
How about the day after?

469
00:23:11,481 --> 00:23:13,720
I don't know about that.

470
00:23:36,422 --> 00:23:40,609
Okay, cut! Now the ending.

471
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:42,312
Is it an okay cut?

472
00:23:42,312 --> 00:23:44,631
It's an okay.

473
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:49,537
Okay!

474
00:23:49,537 --> 00:23:50,804
Cut! Okay.

475
00:23:50,815 --> 00:23:54,065
Min Jae!

476
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,168
Why didn't you call me?

477
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:58,662
 A surprise birthday party for Min Jae after the shoot 

478
00:23:58,662 --> 00:24:00,462
There are two green candles. Do you have a yellow one?

479
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:02,420
Red!

480
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,253
♪ Happy birthday ♪

481
00:24:12,253 --> 00:24:15,304
♪ Happy birthday ♪

482
00:24:15,304 --> 00:24:16,827
 Surprised, grateful, and moved  
 What's this?

483
00:24:16,837 --> 00:24:20,240
What is it, what is it?

484
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,200
Blow the candles.

485
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,766
- Did you make a wish? 
 - Of course!

486
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:24,850
Are you moved?

487
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,756
- I'm so moved. 
 - Okay okay.

488
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,389
- Here's the cake. 
 - Thank you.

489
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:34,580
 Sweet Yi Joon even wrote a letter  
 I wrote a letter!!

490
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,102
- But there's no gift. 
 - It's embarrassing.

491
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:38,493
This is the present.

492
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:40,728
Thank you.

493
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,491
- Where should I look? 
 - The center?

494
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:44,390
How about one by one?

495
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,078
See here first.

496
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:49,824
One, two, three!

497
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:53,825
 Last going-to-school scene!  
 You're so short I didn't notice you.

498
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,611
You're not even 180cm tall.

499
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:59,313
I'm taller than 180cm!

500
00:24:59,313 --> 00:25:00,840
You're talking nonsense.

501
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,405
Right?

502
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:03,652
It's Shin Yi Joon.

503
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:05,329
 Brain: I'll hold my laugh 

504
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:06,407
 Mouth: I'll smile  
 Hey, Yi Joon!

505
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:07,297
Let's do that over.

506
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,041
 LOL 

507
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,374
Good boy!

508
00:25:11,374 --> 00:25:14,821
Why is the one next to you so ugly?

509
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,087
You're so pretty.

510
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:26,408
When we're like this?

511
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:27,284
- Even when we're like this? 
 - It came out well.

512
00:25:27,284 --> 00:25:28,444
My legs hurt.

513
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,576
Cut!

514
00:25:29,576 --> 00:25:33,540
 User Not Found... Last ending scene  
 What are you going to do?

515
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,544
Hey, Yi Joon.

516
00:25:37,544 --> 00:25:39,960
What do you like about Min Jae?

517
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:43,057
Everything.

518
00:25:43,057 --> 00:25:43,667
What did he say?

519
00:25:43,678 --> 00:25:45,942
Everything.

520
00:25:45,942 --> 00:25:47,579
Min Jae!

521
00:25:50,123 --> 00:25:53,800
 These were the bloopers!  
Min Jae?

522
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,359
Everyone worked so hard.

523
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,260
I was so happy and enjoyed filming a lot.

524
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,723
Thank you so much for watching.

525
00:26:08,723 --> 00:26:10,594
I love you.

526
00:26:10,594 --> 00:26:12,212
Bye!

527
00:26:12,212 --> 00:26:14,573
Director, the staff members

528
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,951
and the actors all worked really hard.

529
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:22,247
I can't believe it's already over.

530
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,073
Honestly, as I was playing Hye Joon,

531
00:26:25,073 --> 00:26:28,237
it was challenging but fun.

532
00:26:28,237 --> 00:26:32,246
Acting-wise,

533
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:36,420
I think I could have done better.

534
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,931
Thank you for enjoying User Not Found and watching it.

535
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:43,159
Goodbye!

536
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,300
I'll do the clap.

537
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,313
One.

538
00:26:46,324 --> 00:26:48,640
Three, two, one!

539
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,646
I still can't believe it.

540
00:26:50,656 --> 00:26:54,507
After the last scene,

541
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:56,615
I think I'll be in tears.

542
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,560
I'll miss it a lot...

543
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,987
 Watery  
 Oh...

544
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,810
I'll miss it.

545
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,467
Thank you for enjoying User Not Found.

546
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:11,213
It was my first time as an actor.

547
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,538
I think I started out well.

548
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:17,845
Everyone on the set was so nice so

549
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,550
I was able to finish off well.

550
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,131
It really means a lot to me.

551
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:22,922
Oh, and I...

552
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:27,229
I wanted us to have a last meal together

553
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:30,269
or do something together.

554
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,214
But because we're in the COVID-19 situation,

555
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:35,896
we can't fully celebrate.

556
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:38,688
We'll do it some other time.

557
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,617
I really enjoyed it.

558
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:44,944
Bae Jin Young playing Shin Yi Joon on User Not Found

559
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,571
will hit the slates.

560
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,162
Yi Joon on User Not Found...

561
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:50,677
The end!

562
00:27:50,677 --> 00:27:53,380
It took us a long time to get here.

563
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,718
I'm very sad that this is our last shoot.

564
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,762
We really worked hard on this series.

565
00:28:00,773 --> 00:28:03,557
So please enjoy watching it.

566
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:05,423
Thank you!

567
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,115
