1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,253
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:06,714
What are you saying sorry to me?

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,411
I bought those shoes ages ago,

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,692
so the thought of checking it with you

5
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:15,481
didn't occur to me.

6
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:21,014
However much I study

7
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:22,871
or try,

8
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:24,274
I guess

9
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,818
I just can't ever be popular.

10
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,445
That's not true.

11
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,738
You didn't get caught.

12
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,490
I mean...

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,158
That's true.

14
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,181
But I'm pretending to be you right now.

15
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:41,291
But you used to be a hip fashion icon,

16
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,177
who people would take pics of. You were just so coolâ€”

17
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:48,998
How do you know about me getting pictures taken?

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,935
That's a bit of a stretch.

19
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:00,627
Also,

20
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,479
you pull it off quite well too.

21
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:09,236
I'll teach you about designer brands like that one where it's hard to tell.

22
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,853
Come here.

23
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,339
Are you using this place by any chance?

24
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,926
No.

25
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,360
Bye.

26
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,483
Drop the act.

27
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,194
Let me in...

28
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,589
as a new secret member.

29
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,475
 User Not Found 

30
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:58,310
Honestly, you need me.

31
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,162
You don't know that someone wrote this anonymously yet, right?

32
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,950


33
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,341
"Have you seen the new girl in class 7?"

34
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,893
"She seems ordinary, surprisingly."

35
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:17,242
"There were a lot of rumors about her, that she used to be a trainee"

36
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:20,999
 "and she got expelled but she doesn't seem special at all." 

37
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:25,395
 "She got humiliated for wearing knock-off shoes to school today." 

38
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,041
"It looks like she made up the rumors herself at this point."

39
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,871
"I think Han Ji Wan and the girls will ditch her soon."

40
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:35,322
"I pity her."

41
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,474
 Did you see the anonymous post uploaded yesterday? 

42
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:38,575
 That's her from class 7? 

43
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,310
 That's her. 

44
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,329
Being popular is just like that.

45
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:47,542
They pay attention to you because they want to be your friend,

46
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,127
but also because they want to

47
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,422
bring you down.

48
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,716
Like what you are doing right now?

49
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,379
I just want to get close.

50
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,975
 I liked how everyone was interested in me. 

51
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:09,338
 How would I know if was genuine or not? 

52
00:03:09,338 --> 00:03:11,774
I told you so.

53
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,779
The friendship you are talking about?

54
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,572
That doesn't exist in the first place.

55
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,703
It's not like you know everything.

56
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,783
They may have been honest with me, at least.

57
00:03:28,783 --> 00:03:29,943
Fine.

58
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,320
Suit yourself.

59
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,840
Good for you to have that many friends.

60
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,975
You can't even tell who is genuine and who is not.

61
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:42,765
 I thought they would feel the same way because we were friends. 

62
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,826
You're one to talk.

63
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,410
What?

64
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,439
It looks like

65
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,733
you hate to deal with those rumors,

66
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,768
and that's why you've chosen to lie low.

67
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,422
Kids talk about you too.

68
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,559
 I heard she is such a freak. 

69
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:05,061
 A total weirdo. 

70
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,248
 It's a matter of time before she gets bullied. 

71
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,174
That's what I heard.

72
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:11,626
It's because

73
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:15,038
you are acting is a bit over the top.

74
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:17,507
Right, right.

75
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,717
I know everything.

76
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:23,864
I know what everyone thinks and says,

77
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,224
and I can change that too.

78
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,434
So I'll tell you everything I know.

79
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,479
Trust me.

80
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,650
What do I do?

81
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,612
It's all my fault.

82
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,821
Oh, no, no.

83
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,656
You didn't know.

84
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,783
She's right.

85
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,034
We didn't know.

86
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:44,993
That's right.

87
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,994
Right?

88
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:51,707
I can't see why she would lie.

89
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:59,323
I'm worried I might have hurt her through my mistakes.

90
00:04:59,323 --> 00:05:03,594
I just wanted to talk to her because I thought she was the same as me.

91
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:09,226
Hey, it's because you're too kind.

92
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,227
Don't worry about it.

93
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,520
It's not your fault.

94
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,896
She's right.

95
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,672
Don't worry.

96
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,117
Min Jae.

97
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,745
Are you upset with me?

98
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,433
What?

99
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:32,422
No.

100
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:36,186
I wouldn't have done that if I had known.

101
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:37,962
Sorry.

102
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,803
Let's not keep secrets from each other.

103
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,279
Okay?

104
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,872
Why did Ji Wan apologize, though?

105
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,082
The shoes are Min Jae's.

106
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,043
Maybe Min Jae pulled Ji Wan aside and said something to her,

107
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,461
because she got humiliated?

108
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:22,064
Ji Wan is so kind.

109
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:33,876
   

110
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:41,354
 Look 

111
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:44,195
 Did you see this? It's totally you. 

112
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,660
It's page 80.

113
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,413
Turn in your homework

114
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:52,288
- when the class is over. 
 - Okay

115
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:54,755
The penalty is 10,000 won if you don't turn them in.

116
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:56,787
Seo Hee, you've already reached 50,000 won

117
00:07:56,787 --> 00:07:57,833
 2ju_un tagged you in a comment 

118
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,275
Open your book to page 81.

119
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:01,898
Let's talk about factorization today.

120
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,510
Factorization is

121
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,303
the expression of a polynomial

122
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:10,407
in the form of two or more polynomials.

123
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,450
 Did you see this? It's totally you. 

124
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,328
She's active on In***gram recently

125
00:08:18,762 --> 00:08:21,109
To put it in simpler words, when there is ma + mb,

126
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,627
 ji.vvani added to their story 

127
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,504
minus the M that they both have,

128
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,422
put a bracket...

129
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,506
 So relatable 

130
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,049
 Why do I always end up apologizing? 

131
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,577
 Is that why I feel like I'm always walking on eggshells? It's getting tiring. 

132
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,587
Use a quadratic equation,

133
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:34,556
and now it's a cubic equation

134
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,110
 Yu Min Jae 

135
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:48,485
You factorize it,

136
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:50,055
a + b,

137
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:51,055
put a bracket,

138
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:52,979
A squared - AB...

139
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:55,480
 Why do I always end up apologizing? Is that why I feel like I'm always walking on eggshells? It's getting tiring. 

140
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,920
 Is this about me? 

141
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,165
 Min Jae. 

142
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,833
 Are you upset with me? 

143
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,193
 No. 

144
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:04,894
 Sorry. 

145
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:16,848
 The chat is awfully quiet today. 

146
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,759
 Did they make another chat without me or something? 

147
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,581
 Shin Yi Joon: You don't really use In***gram, do you? 

148
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:26,066
 Why are you not responding? 

149
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,652
 Did you see this? It's totally you. 

150
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,454
 What's the occasion? 

151
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,235
 Right, I don't get 

152
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:38,219
 notifications. 

153
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:39,646
 It's Min Jae's account. 

154
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,356
 Mu Ming: Are you busy? 

155
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:43,708
 I've got to talk to you. 

156
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,460
 What do I do? 

157
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,313
 Meet me at Ujeong station at 2 pm tomorrow. 

158
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:51,257
 I won't wait if you're late. 

159
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,767
 Is she upset? 

160
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,184
You're early.

161
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,185
Huh?

162
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,694
Yeah.

163
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,256
I'll sit here.

164
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,373
By the way, is everything okay with Ji Wan?

165
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:18,851
Yes, nothing special.

166
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:19,787
Why are you asking?

167
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:22,564
I saw her story and was wondering if something was going on.

168
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:28,086
Is it because of the anonymous post?

169
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:31,204
No, no, no. That's not it.

170
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:32,857
It's totally cool between them.

171
00:10:32,857 --> 00:10:36,719
People just gossip when they know nothing about it.

172
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,163
I think Ji Wan has a misunderstandingâ€”

173
00:10:39,163 --> 00:10:40,765
Oh, what I'm trying to say isâ€”

174
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,933
Don't worry.

175
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,051
I won't tell anyone.

176
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:45,812
I just asked because it's you.

177
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,079
Huh?

178
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,515
I can just trust you, Da Ye.

179
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,402
I can tell you are a good person.

180
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,195
Stop it.

181
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,865
I mean it Yu Min Jae said the same thing.

182
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,868
She said you're the most easy to talk to.

183
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,945
Oh, Min Jae did?

184
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:16,000
 Someone tagged you on their story. 

185
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:22,717
What the??

186
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:24,041
 So relatable. 

187
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,587
 You're too kind, Ji Wan. 

188
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:27,579
 Stop walking on eggshells with everyone. 

189
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:29,592
 Let's not say anything 

190
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:30,835
 if you can't say it directly. 

191
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:33,751
She posted this just so I can see it, right?

192
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:46,497
 Seong Su 

193
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:50,693
Hello?

194
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:53,129
 Hey! What's going on? 

195
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,839
 Just tell me. Who's it? 

196
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,967
Oh!

197
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,335
It's nothing.

198
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:03,072
You don't wanna mess with me.

199
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:18,946
 Wow, so pretty. 

200
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:25,386
 I thought I could pull off pretending to be her. 

201
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:30,274
 It would be ridiculous for everyone to think I'm her. 

202
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,397
Oh, you're on time.

203
00:12:36,397 --> 00:12:37,881
Let's go.

204
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,534
To where?

205
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:40,635
A secret lesson.

206
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,628
We're going to practice today.

207
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:48,218
What if we bump into our classmates?

208
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:50,894
Oh? It's Kim Seong Su!

209
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,976

 Preview of the next episode coming up! 

210
00:13:01,976 --> 00:13:04,367
 @Next episode 
 - That's enough. 
 - Cute 

211
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,109
 Why are you trying to go the extra mile for Min Jae? 

212
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:08,997
 I feel like I should protect 

213
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,039
 her feelings. 

214
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,791
 Min Jae is so kind. 

215
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,725
 Shin Yi Joon! 

216
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,937
 It's because you don't follow the student dress code. 

217
00:13:15,937 --> 00:13:17,338
 I do follow it sometimes. 

218
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,048
 Is it weird to have my heart pound 

219
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,051
 when I don't know how he's feeling? 

220
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,636
 Bonus clip 

221
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,472
Reacting seriously to subtle, passive-aggressive posts is amateur.

222
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,143
Hey, don't forget to add Kim Da Ye to your close-friend list before you post it.

223
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,735
Okay.

224
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,839
Hey, how is it?

225
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:36,607
Annoying.

226
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,301
That will take Ji Wan off guard.

227
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:42,655
She will realize that I, Yu Min Jae, am not easy.

228
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,408
It looks like Kim Da Ye will side with Min Jae soon.

229
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,938
We get along well, surprisingly.

230
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,486
Why are you helping her, by the way?

231
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:59,471
You're friends with them.

232
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,382
What're you talking about?

233
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,909
You don't believe in friendship, either.

234
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:13,394
 Did you see this? It's totally you.
