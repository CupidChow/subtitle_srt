1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,900
Why are you mad, Yi Joon?

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,800
Calm down.

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,600
Let go of me.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,700
It was you again, wasn't it?

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,300
 @User Not Found 

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,160
 2 years ago  
 Nice!

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,200
Nice!

8
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,200
♫  Very naturally, raise the corners of your lips  ♫

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,160
Please!

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,800
♫  even if it's a little too much  ♫

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,200
It's too hot.

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
I'm exhausted.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,000
That was fun.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,090
It's been so long since I had this much fun.

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,420
♫  Even I erase myself until it becomes transparent  ♫

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
 You're coming later, right? 

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,200
Oh, I already have plans.

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Again? With whom?

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
Is it with that guy with the headphones?

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,600
Why do you not hang out with us these days? It's upsetting.

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Hey, even if I go, I feel shy with everyone except you.

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,400
It's uncomfortable.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,000
 You were my closest friend. 

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 But for the first time, I felt inferior. 

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
- Want to go gaming later? 
 - Sure.

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,600
I'm so excited.

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
I need to up my rank.

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,800
But he sucks at the game.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,600
You guys are worse than me.

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,500
Hey! Then...

31
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,000
Is Shin Yi Joon coming as well?

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,900
Why?

33
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,800
We look cooler with him.

34
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,300
I'll ask him.

35
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,100
Really?

36
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,800
Promise me.

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,300
 Do they really want to be my friends? 

38
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,000
Then...

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,900
 Or become your friends through me? 

40
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,400
It's uncomfortable.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
What do you mean uncomfortable?

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,470
They just want to be friends with you. That's why they're calling you.

43
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,400
Call me before coming over. I'll be going first.

44
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,400
 And yet, you kept hanging out with other guys. 

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,400
 Especially the weird ones, more than me. 

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,600
 And one day, I came upon it. 

47
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,200
&nbsp;

48
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,500
 - Thank you. 
 - That was good. 

49
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,300
 - Was it? 
 - Yeah. 

50
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,300
 Okay, okay 

51
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,900
 - That was good. 
 - No, I'll do it again. 

52
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,600
 Hello. 

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
 - I've never seen... 
 - Do it again. 

54
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,400
 Hello. 

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,500
 Oh, I already have plans. 

56
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,200
 Again? With whom? 

57
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,800
 Is it with that guy with the headphones? 

58
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,000
 or known this side of you. 

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,500
 And I've never known this side. 

60
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,600
   
  of myself.  

61
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,500
What is this? This is crazy.

62
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,100
Who filmed this?

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,920
I'm better, right?

64
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,980
This is weird.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,300
Hey.

66
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Stop.

67
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,600
 Suddenly, everyone changed because you and I fought. 

68
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,700
Let go of me.

69
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes. I knew this would happen.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,100
I was stupid for thinking of you as my friends.

71
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,400
Hey! Hey!

72
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,400
Let go of me!

73
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,000
I said let go!

74
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,100
Why did you do it? 
  School violence survey 

75
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,700
 Who: All the students involved 
 Shin Hye Joon 

76
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,000
 Aren't I better than him? 

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,700
 This is weird. 

78
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll just let this slide because of what you have shown so far.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You have good grades and are a nice person, Hye Joon.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,300
 I don't know if I'm a good guy or a bad guy. 

81
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,500
Yes.

82
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,600
 It's just that...  
 - Right?

83
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,900
 That's how everyone sees me. 

84
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,600
 It works in my favor. 

85
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,200
Yes.

86
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,900
Okay.

87
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,700
 I think that's why I chose that mask. 

88
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,600
You can go now.

89
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,400
 Shin Yi Joon, I can never be like you. 

90
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:27,600
 Whether it be studying or personality or finding out others' secrets. 

91
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,000
 I've tried my best. 

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,600
- Did you see this? 
 - Who is this?

93
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,000
 But I didn't show it. 

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,400
I'll keep it a secret. From others.

95
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,300
 Do you want to know a secret? 

96
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,900
 Talk all you want. 

97
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,200
 No one is going to believe you. 

98
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,900
 This photo is all I need to make them believe. 

99
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,300
 I kept it well hidden. 

100
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,800
 Is it because you don't know anything? 

101
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,100
 You were by my side again. 

102
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,000
 I felt anxious. 

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,800
 Why? 

104
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,000
 Nothing. 

105
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,100
 Then, I came upon it again. 

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 The side of you I've never seen before. 

107
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,450
 2ju_un @yoo.minjae05: Did you see this? It looks like you 

108
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,400
 Oh, it's Yu Min Jae! 

109
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,700
 You're wearing the same thing as me. 

110
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,500
 Your secret. 

111
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,400
 Why? 

112
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,200
 You're lying to me. 

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 How upsetting. 

114
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,200
 As I did then, I clearly like you 

115
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,600
 but hate you sometimes. 

116
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Why did you do it?

117
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,300
Really.

118
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,200
You haven't changed, not even a little bit

119
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,600
I was helping you.

120
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,300
You don't know anything.

121
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,900
The one who doesn't know anything is you.

122
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,300
Did you and Shin Yi Joon really have a fight?

123
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,600
Why did you guys fight?

124
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,700
Who said that?

125
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,100
Of course, we didn't fight.

126
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,100
 I did it for fun at first. 

127
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,200
 Can I join? 

128
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,900
 Your secret club. 

129
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,400
 I wasn't trying to do something. 

130
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,300
 Why are you being like this? 

131
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,200
 You're being childish. 

132
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,600
 Han Ji Wan's jealousy... 

133
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,800
 Let's order a couple set. 

134
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,600
 and your reactions. 

135
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,000
 Can I pull this up? 

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,500
 Well... 

137
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,700
 Are you getting butterflies?   

138
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,200
 No. 

139
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,300
 You're just pretending. 

140
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,400
 There were moments I didn't expect at all. 

141
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,300
So Yu Min Jae and Shin Yi Joon went home together?

142
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,200
- Thanks to you? 
 - Yup!

143
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,500
Jeez, that fool.

144
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,600
I really didn't know what was going on when I gave her that advice.

145
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I really didn't think she'd bring those two together

146
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,900
so she could be a good friend.

147
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,200
She's such an idiot.

148
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,600
That's exactly what I'm saying.

149
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,500
I didn't know things would turn out like this.

150
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,100
I really thought you'd humiliate

151
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,600
Yu Min Jae once you found out about her after transferring to the school.

152
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
Then what about you?

153
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,700
You love hanging out with us.

154
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,900
That's true.

155
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,800
I don't have to pretend in front of you guys.

156
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
The fact that you have a twisted mind?

157
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,600
Or that you like to intellectually bully others?

158
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,900
Hey. Yu Min Jae became your friend because she's nice.

159
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,340
Look who's talking.

160
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,000
It's amazing how all her thoughts

161
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,000
show on her face.

162
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,200
Yeah, for real.

163
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,700
In every moment, she's sincere.

164
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,200
I think I'm starting to understand what you meant before.

165
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,100
It's been a while...

166
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,900
since I had someone who trusted me without wanting something from me.

167
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,400
 It used to be you, Shin Yi Joon. 

168
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,000
Why did you do it this time?

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,500
This time?

170
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,400
It was you who exposed Han Ji Wan's past and took a slight at Yu Min Jae last time.

171
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,300
You caught me.

172
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,400
What's good is good.

173
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,700
We became friends, and at least other guys won't talk smack about Yu Min Jae now.

174
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,800
Why did you do it?

175
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,300
I thought you didn't like Han Ji Wan.

176
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,410
Besides, more people were getting annoyed with—

177
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
It was you?

178
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,900
How could you, of all people, do that to Ji Wan?

179
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,200
Why can't I?

180
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,900
She's your friend.

181
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,000
She is?

182
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,400
She's only hanging out with us because there's something in it for her.

183
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,300
You really scare me.

184
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,400
Don't you think you're being too naive?

185
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,800
Rein in your naivety.

186
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,500
Yu Min Jae.

187
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,300
You have to use people. Only the fools get used.

188
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,100
She never thought of you as her friend.

189
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
Then...

190
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,400
You must have thought the same way too.

191
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,600
After I came to this school, I had nightmares every day.

192
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,100
If they find out about my past...

193
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:41,000
What will happen to me if they figure out my past that's so different from now?

194
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,100
But knowing all my secrets,

195
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,200
you kept it all to yourself, helped me,

196
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,400
and listened to all my worries.

197
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,200
I really thought of you as my good friend

198
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,700
That's...

199
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,500
So you pitied me.

200
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,900
You were just planning on using it someday.

201
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,210
But I believed you to be my friend.

202
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,600
 Because you are my friend. 

203
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,000
 I wanted to help because I thought of you as my friends. 

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,500
 Both Shin Yi Joon 

205
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
 and you. 

206
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,700
 Shin Yi Joon: Good night. 

207
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:54,760
 No! I overslept! I'm so late. 
 What are you doing now? 

208
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,300
I was worried about you.

209
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,400
You didn't reply to my texts.

210
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,600
Sorry.

211
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,800
I just felt...

212
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
down today.

213
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
I missed you.

214
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:10,700


215
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,800
 @User Not Found 
 Preview will begin shortly 

216
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,600
 @Next episode 
 My friend told me 

217
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,200
 a real friend is someone who waits by your side 

218
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,300
 until you're ready to say it yourself. 

219
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,400
 But before that, why did you guys fight? 

220
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,400
 I wanted to sing you this song.
