1
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:06,852
Why didn't you tell me you went out with him?

2
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:13,789
 Do you know him? 

3
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:15,666
 Nakwon High senior Cha Hyun Jin. 

4
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:16,634
 He's really popular— 

5
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:18,043
 Who asked about him? Ji Wan did— 

6
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:20,006
 Han Ji Wan? You're still so stupid. 

7
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:23,632
 So stop acting like you're me and respond to her. 

8
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:24,680
 Maybe... 

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,560
 I don't like it. 

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,138
 Min Jae got so angry...  
 Huh?

11
00:00:29,138 --> 00:00:32,665
And why you moved to our school.

12
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:36,461
 I don't know what it is. 

13
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:39,131
 But I thought you wanted to change, like me. 

14
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:41,508
 You didn't want their attention. 

15
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,444
 You wanted none of it. 

16
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,020
 That's why you're here. 

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,171
 That's all I want. 

18
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:50,148
 Not to get anyone's attention and just graduate. 

19
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:52,578
 If they think you're me, 

20
00:00:52,578 --> 00:00:54,621
 then they'll think I'm you. 

21
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,397
 Invisible. 

22
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,019
 @User Not Found 

23
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,229
 Counseling Room 
 Violence Prevention Committee 

24
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,314
 4 months ago 

25
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:09,077
Are you okay?

26
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,042
 Soulmate Ji Hee: Cheer up 
 Hyun Jin: Love you lots 

27
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:33,951
 Hyun Jin: Min Jae please think it over 

28
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,002
Shall we go in?

29
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,258
Must you do this?

30
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,598
You really want to do this to me?

31
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,695
 Hyun Jin 

32
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:20,005
 Min Jae, open up! 

33
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:22,918
 Show me your face. 

34
00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:24,177
 Min Jae? 

35
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,004
 Min Jae! 

36
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:27,814
 Min Jae, open up. 

37
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,816
 What's wrong? 

38
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,351
 Min Jae! 

39
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,736
 Open up. 

40
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:33,737
 Hyun Jin: Sorry honey. 

41
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,846
 Min Jae! 

42
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:35,864
 Hyun Jin: Talk to me. 

43
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,126
 I'm worried. 

44
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:38,825
  - Open up!  - Hyun Jin: Please pick up, please  

45
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,119
 Hyun Jin asked to break up. 

46
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,288
 Min Jae might want to lie to get revenge. 

47
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,706
 Kids these days are fast. 

48
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,250
 How can you trust their words? 

49
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,235
 They might be lying. 

50
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,337
 Hyun Jin's future is so promising. 

51
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,335
 Do you want to block the way? 

52
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:53,757
 Listen here! 

53
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,418
Enough is enough!

54
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:57,427
- Everyone— 
 - What do you mean, enough?!

55
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,055
Please calm down.

56
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,808
It is a sensitive issue.

57
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:07,260
We will also refer to other students' words.

58
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,146
Well...

59
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,171
 Testimony 

60
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:39,169
They were dating each other.

61
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,506
Min Jae told me about him a lot.

62
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,810
We're best friends.

63
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,378
About how she can do it better...

64
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:51,565
 What are you saying, Ji Hee? 

65
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,443
 Listen to her best friend speak. 

66
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,777
 Can you say it's forced? 

67
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,987
 Mrs. Cha... 

68
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,239
 How can you say that? 

69
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,557
 Is this... 

70
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:04,819
 I... really didn't know. 

71
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,773
I'm sorry, Min Jae.

72
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:11,485
I couldn't help it.

73
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:12,502
 What? 

74
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,854
My feelings...

75
00:04:15,697 --> 00:04:17,799
I can't control them.

76
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,418
I tried because you're my best friend.

77
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:25,290
 Best friend? You? 

78
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:30,117
But I didn't tell you.

79
00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:31,797
I liked him before you,

80
00:04:31,797 --> 00:04:36,924
maybe even more than you, for a very long time.

81
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,945
That's why I helped him out.

82
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,683
Sorry.

83
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,744
Why are you crying?

84
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,691
You didn't have to be this way.

85
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,342
 So, 

86
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:54,778
 instead of me, 

87
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:57,764
 you wanted to protect your love. 

88
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,751
 Everything with me was fake. 

89
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,167
 She's underage. 

90
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:10,310
 Everyone knows about it. 

91
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,813
 How can she act natural? 

92
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,716
 She insisted on having a school violence committee. 

93
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,011
 She must be embarrassed. 

94
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:22,347
 What can she do? 

95
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:23,740
 She should move to another school. 

96
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,126
 She'll go insane if she stays. 

97
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:30,300
 She planned it all to get back at Hyun Jin. 

98
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:37,901
 I was angry and furious 

99
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:40,282
 that, just like before, 

100
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:45,084
 I couldn't do or say anything. 

101
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,842
- Seo Jung Bin. 
 - Here.

102
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:52,461
- Shin Hye Joon. 
- Here.

103
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:53,937
Yoo Min Jae.

104
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,255
Here.

105
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,064
Yoo Min Jae.

106
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,570
I thought she was tough.

107
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,822
I didn't think she was forced to move here.

108
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,156
 "Not wanting to break up..."  
 I've got the chills.

109
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,491
 "Ex-girlfriend's False Violence Report."  
 She's so shameless.

110
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,842
 "Star player of Nakwon HS might have been withdrawn from nomination." 

111
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:09,527
- Min Ji Hoo. 
 - Here.

112
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,504
- Yoon Chan Yeong. 
 - Here. 
 - Lee Seol Ah.

113
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,114
-  I didn't know.  
 - Lee Eun Ji.

114
00:06:13,114 --> 00:06:14,912
 Not at all. 

115
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:17,109
- Kim Na Eun. 
 - Here.

116
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,030
About Yu Min Jae...

117
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,131
I know.

118
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,949
You know?

119
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,067
How do you know they're...

120
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,072
Well...

121
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:35,040
She could have... had a boyfriend.

122
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,782
Because she's pretty.

123
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:46,405
You know to say things like that?

124
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,937
You really don't care at all?

125
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:54,605
You must've heard the rumors.

126
00:06:58,224 --> 00:06:59,543
I know what happened, so don't—

127
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:01,637
Nothing changes.

128
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:06,150
I already like her.

129
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,131
 That's right. 

130
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:11,139
 This is what I liked about you. 

131
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,333
Stop acting cool.

132
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,701
Why weren't you like this before?

133
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,478
Look who's talking.

134
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,988
Stop acting like a goody-goody.

135
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:19,256
A goody-goody?

136
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:21,366
I'm a nice guy.

137
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:23,133
I'm upset...

138
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,347
You said you hate these words.

139
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,495
I don't care, I'm upset. I feel upset. I feel so upset!

140
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,378
Hey, Shin Hye Joon.

141
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:47,104
Do you know why I hate those words?

142
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,268
Why?

143
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:53,806
 I'm upset. 

144
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,290
 Hye Joon. 

145
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,602
You just think as you please.

146
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,625
That's why you're upset.

147
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,342
 Did you bring it yourself? 

148
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:24,612
 It was my fault. 

149
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:33,533
 The person who gave them the file was me. 

150
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,165
 Agreement 

151
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:39,358
 I already apologized to Taehyung. 

152
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:41,954
 Victim: Kim Taehyung 

153
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,970
 I don't know if he'll accept it. 

154
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,022
 It has nothing to do with Hye Joon? 

155
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,225
 You know. 

156
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:57,760
 He's smart and diligent. 

157
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,192
 I think he asked to write his name instead of mine. 

158
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,722
 I see. 

159
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,619
 I'll take care of the rest. 

160
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,462
 You may go now. 

161
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,486
 We're letting it go because we know how you've behaved. 

162
00:09:31,486 --> 00:09:35,573
 You're smart and a nice kid. 

163
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:37,701
 Okay. 

164
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,595
What?

165
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,173
Why...

166
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:44,274
Why didn't you say so?

167
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,086
If I talk about

168
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:52,005
what I've done, that doesn't feel right.

169
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,638
It's uncool.

170
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,098
Are you insane? Cool or uncool.

171
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,376
You might have been in serious trouble.

172
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,011
You're smarter than me.

173
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:05,229
- Your grades— 
 - Hey!

174
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,158
You're like my mom.

175
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,245
Hey.

176
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,661
Thanks.

177
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,587
I get it.

178
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,456
But your thoughtfulness,

179
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,549
you should say out loud.

180
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,597
So tell Min Jae that.

181
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:35,217
She's slow, like you.

182
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,762
Did you hear?

183
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,013
Of course.

184
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,756
You saw the anonymous board?

185
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:43,625
She's so shameless.

186
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,311
Proudly sitting there.

187
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,646
She's too much.

188
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,065
I know.

189
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,359
How can she lie like that?

190
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,026
Is she insane?

191
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,864
I knew it from the beginning.

192
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:17,857
 Of all times, I didn't want to see him. 

193
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,951
Why aren't you saying anything?

194
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,006
You told me.

195
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,627
 My friend said this once... 

196
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:57,740
 Real friends are those who stay by your side when you really want to open up. 

197
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,524
I can wait.

198
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,689
Whenever you need someone.

199
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,580
Whenever you want to talk about it.

200
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,127
Whenever it may be.

201
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,359
Thanks.

202
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:11,980
Someday, I'll tell you everything.

203
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:20,316
Right, and...

204
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:31,048
This was as a friend.

205
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,983
Next time we meet,

206
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,073
let's stop being friends.

207
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:55,020


208
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,240
♫  One day in my heart  ♫

209
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,010
♫  You gently approached me  ♫

210
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:11,510
♫  I can hear your voice calling me  ♫

211
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,228
 @User Not Found 
 Next episode's preview, coming up 

212
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,440
 Next episode 
 When are you coming back to school? 

213
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,092
 Before I tell others, 

214
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,993
 I wanted you to be the first to know. 

215
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:24,912
 So I hope you're not upset anymore. 

216
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:26,449
 Why are you being nice? 

217
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,408
 Am I right? 

218
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,168
 Min Jae. Yu Min Jae. 

219
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,604
 You screwed up my life, then you disappeared like that? 

220
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,550
 You screwed up everything.
