1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,235
Do a cartwheel.

2
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:03,605
Sure, no problem. Wait...

3
00:00:03,605 --> 00:00:05,923
- What? 
 - I'm wearing a skirt.

4
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,616
Si Woo can do it right now.

5
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:08,759
Show her. Show her right now.

6
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,126
Your pose was weird. You're supposed to start like this

7
00:00:11,126 --> 00:00:12,678
Yes.

8
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,192
Bye.

9
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:21,688
Girls.

10
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,565
Let's go to the cafeteria.

11
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,467
We already did.

12
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:26,985
We called you,

13
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,446
but you were too busy talking to other guys.

14
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,614
Sorry.

15
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,350
They kept asking me to do a cartwheel.

16
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,245
Cartwheel? What's that?

17
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,397
Oh, it's a gymnastics technique.

18
00:00:38,397 --> 00:00:40,156
Like this.

19
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,027
Shin Hye Joon kept teasing me.

20
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:45,970
Ah.

21
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:50,800
I told you yesterday.

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,194
What was it?

23
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:53,887
Min Jae.

24
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,538
Yeah?

25
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:57,307
Sometimes,

26
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,644
it feels like you care about the boys more than us.

27
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,419
That's not how you do it, Hye Joon.

28
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:04,497
- How do you do it? 
 - Huh?

29
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:08,033
It's not true.

30
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:10,070
Hye Joon, I'm talking. Look at me.

31
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,487
Sorry.

32
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,831
 @User Not Found 

33
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:26,904
 Da Ye: We came outside to eat. Enjoy your lunch, Min Jae 

34
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,977
 I've been excluded from 'we' 

35
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,645
 all of a sudden. 

36
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,922
 I don't know why. 

37
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,854
Why are you eating alone?

38
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,274
Oh, I...

39
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:12,256
I think we should counterattack.

40
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,076
Hold on.

41
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,413
The rumor must be true.

42
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,173
Yu Min Jae and those two.

43
00:02:28,173 --> 00:02:29,616
They look like characters...

44
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,118
out of a romance comic.

45
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:33,654
But the genre is soap opera.

46
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,947
This is crazy.

47
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:36,907
How did she seduce them?

48
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,150
Wow, Yu Min Jae.

49
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,243
Incredible! Unbelievable!

50
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,453
Tell me about it.

51
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,288
 Friends? 

52
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,222
 The girls? 

53
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:47,950
 They will turn their backs on you in an instant. 

54
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,861
 Remember that. 

55
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:54,030
 Is this what Min Jae meant? 

56
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,725
Where are you going?

57
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,803
To the classroom.

58
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:11,891
Why did you sit here?

59
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,368
You're not helping.

60
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:17,847
I was going to solve everything.

61
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,461
Anyway, I'll handle it, so stay out of it.

62
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:27,240
I'll do whatever I want.

63
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,656
Do one at a time.

64
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,383
Just one.

65
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:05,768
I think the girls are mad at me for something.

66
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,415
Maybe I'm imagining things.

67
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,595
That's what you would want to believe.

68
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:19,272
But it feels like everything has changed overnight.

69
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,100
Maybe I've been hanging out too much with the boys.

70
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,771
But it's not true.

71
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,373
I hang out with the girls too.

72
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,344
Or...

73
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,654
Maybe it's because I kept asking her to eat with me

74
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,817
when she's on a diet.

75
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:45,035
- Stop it. 
 - Huh?

76
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,911
Are you stupid?

77
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:51,514
They made up their minds to hate you.

78
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,710
What?

79
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,629
Can't you see?

80
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,949
Now if you smile, they'll hate you for smiling.

81
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:01,626
If you cry, they'll hate you for crying.

82
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,597
They're making up reasons to hate you.

83
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,582
Not that they hate you because there's a reason.

84
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,856
So,

85
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,384
don't look for reasons to hate yourself.

86
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,934
I guess Shin Yi Joon is done with going through girls.

87
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,552
He's clinging to her now.

88
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:28,962
No way.

89
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,021
It's true.

90
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:33,076
But she watched a movie with Shin Hye Joon.

91
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:34,693
- What? 
 - Really? 
 - Yes!

92
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:37,337
Yu Min Jae is something.

93
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,730
Maybe she had to transfer because she got into trouble with boys.

94
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,367
You could be right.

95
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:45,971
She flirted with Shin Yi Joon from the first day.

96
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,765
When Han Ji Wan let her into her group and became her friend.

97
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:51,418
Unbelievable.

98
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,353
To be honest,

99
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,239
Han Ji Wan is more my style than Yu Min Jae.

100
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,241
What are you saying?

101
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:58,859
- Whatever. 
 - Stop talking.

102
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,379
Yu Min Jae is too bossy—

103
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,282
Oh! I'm sorry.

104
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,808
What the...

105
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:09,235
I apologize.

106
00:06:12,898 --> 00:06:15,750
Be more careful.

107
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,577
Let's go.

108
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,271
They don't have the balls to say it to her face.

109
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,545
Oh... Hi!

110
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:51,703
 Min Jae, you know something? 

111
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,388
 I've already done it. 

112
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:55,731
 Min Jae, you know something? 

113
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,555
This time...

114
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,015
I was trying to make a bold move.

115
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,868
 I think... 

116
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,986
 I think we should counterattack. 

117
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,806
 Hold on. 

118
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,127
 Wait... 

119
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,132
 Wow, Yu Min Jae is unbelievable. 

120
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,174
 Tell me about it. 

121
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,454
 Where are you going? 

122
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,665
 To the classroom. 

123
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,001
Maybe I can't make it happen...

124
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:33,573
 Music Room  
 Study results show that classical music

125
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,352
improves your concentration when you study.

126
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:38,787
So today,

127
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,790
you will listen to Mozart and

128
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,899
study on your own.

129
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,918
Open your books. Start studying.

130
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:53,510
 Self-study 

131
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:04,800
 Should I keep my distance from Yi Joon for a while? 

132
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,215
 Because the rumors will grow.

 I'm sorry about before 

136
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,293
At the back!

137
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,669
Shin Yi Joon!

138
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,662
You're supposed to be studying.

139
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,667
 Oh no. 

140
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,644
 I promised myself to like him secretly. 

141
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,924
 But it's getting harder to contain 

142
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:34,151
 my growing feelings for him. 

143
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,888
 Thank you. 

144
00:11:36,888 --> 00:11:38,139
 You made me smile 

145
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:41,750
 for the first time today. 

146
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:53,930

 Do you want to know a secret? 

151
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,149
 No one knows. Only I know this. 

152
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,619
 Someone in our class used to be very different. 

153
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:57,887
 Was it you? 

154
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,796
 Have you lost it? 

155
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,548
 You haven't changed at all? 

156
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,841
 I've been having nightmares every night. 

157
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:06,844
 If everyone finds out about my past, what will happen to me?
