1
00:00:07,031 --> 00:00:08,732
Yu Min Jae.

2
00:00:20,496 --> 00:00:22,469
I like you.

3
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,610
 Whatever you want 

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,799
I'm confessing my feelings

5
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:40,849
for you honestly.

6
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:49,343
When I'm with you,

7
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:08,275
 this is what happens... 

8
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,410


9
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:15,950
 I can't help it. 

10
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:45,539
 @User Not Found 

11
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:51,460
 What should I say? 

12
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,237
 I haven't been honest... 

13
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:18,857
Let's go.

14
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:21,031
Your parents will be worried.

15
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:25,219
You know what?

16
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,200
Can you give me some time?

17
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,052
Sure.

18
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:53,953
Answer...

19
00:02:54,672 --> 00:02:56,592
My answer

20
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:02,868
will be the same as your feelings.

21
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:20,385
I want to be honest with you too.

22
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:47,702
-  Hello—  
 - Min Jae!

23
00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:48,785
I...

24
00:03:48,785 --> 00:03:51,581
I just got asked out by Yi Joon.

25
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:53,196
 What? 

26
00:03:53,196 --> 00:03:57,303
But to tell you from the beginning...

27
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,559
 I'll tell you the rest in person tomorrow. 

28
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:05,791
- There's more? 
 - Yes!

29
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:09,807
I only talked about the bit where we sang at the karaoke.

30
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:12,016
Alright, see you tomorrow.

31
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:14,697
- I'm hanging up. 
 -  Thank you. 

32
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:17,548
For what?

33
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:24,964
If it weren't for you, this wouldn't have happened in my life.

34
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:29,571
 It would've been like before, right? 

35
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:35,983
Thanks for being friends with me, Min Jae.

36
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:38,069
Thank you so much.

37
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:43,891
It might seem shameless to say this,

38
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:46,885
but I think I transferred schools to meet you.

39
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:49,793
 - I need your help. 
 - Let go of this... 

40
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:51,926
 Just follow back. 

41
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:53,174
 What? 

42
00:04:54,737 --> 00:04:56,362
You fool!

43
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,985
You were the one to reach out to me.

44
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:01,842
Not me.

45
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:08,924
 Even if the kids didn't mistake you for me, 

46
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:14,796
 they would've all liked you if they spent time with you. 

47
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:20,979
Mumin...

48
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:22,630
Oh, seriously!

49
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,825
You've been using that nickname as well lately.

50
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:35,507
 That kind of friend or friendship in your head doesn't exist in the first place. 

51
00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:41,606
 Aren't you supposed to share secrets with your friends? 

52
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:42,618
 Let's go. 

53
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:43,865
 Where? 

54
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:45,763
 A secret lesson. 

55
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:54,161
 I've done a good job, right? 

56
00:05:56,396 --> 00:06:00,324
Me, too... There are more things that I'm grateful about.

57
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:09,760
 One, two, three! 

58
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,397
 Min Jae, are you going to be this pretty tomorrow as well? 

59
00:06:13,397 --> 00:06:15,783
 We were dating. 

60
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:17,877
 Counseling Office 
 School Violence Self-Governing Committee 

61
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,655
 Do you like it that much? 
   

62
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:22,031
 Yes, of course! 

63
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,002
 It must be hard for you, too. 

64
00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:27,224
 Transfer schools, I guess. It'll be impossible to attend school without going insane. 

65
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:29,784
 Because you're my precious friend. 

66
00:06:29,784 --> 00:06:32,120
 Let's take one together, come here! 

67
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,595
 Hurry, come on over. 

68
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,040
 Swipe to unlock 

69
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,790
 miinzziin 

70
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:30,562
Geez! So when are you going to make up with Shin Yi Joon?

71
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:32,468
I don't know.

72
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:36,987
But before that, why did you guys argue?

73
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:47,116
Hye Joon.

74
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:51,426
Guys like you can just sit there pretending to be cool without saying anything.

75
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:53,838
But a funny character like me needs to make a fuss—

76
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:56,292
We have our reasons.

77
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:02,206
Oh, right! You know, Yu Min Jae, right?

78
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:03,986
Yu Min Jae?

79
00:08:03,986 --> 00:08:07,000
You know, there's one more Yu Min Jae in your class.

80
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,767
The one that goes, "Mumin."

81
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:13,033
The strange transfer student.

82
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,149
What about her?

83
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:19,330
My radar has worked again.

84
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,509
And she's not ordinary.

85
00:08:23,873 --> 00:08:26,157
She has a hidden secret.

86
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:30,220
Why?

87
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,052
Though she looks like that, she's a transfer student with a hidden identity!

88
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:37,522
Something like that, you know? Huh?

89
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:40,384
When you watch films or TV series,

90
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:43,222
 the class star dressed up as a loser. 

91
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,692
 Content that gives a true lesson to bullies, you know the kind! 

92
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,988
You know what I mean, right?

93
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:55,285
You think that makes sense?

94
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,547
She just seemed like a quiet girl.

95
00:08:57,547 --> 00:08:59,731
You've watched way too many movies.

96
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:01,283
Huh?

97
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:05,094
I swear that's what she's aiming for. I saw it myself!

98
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:09,854
When no one's around, her hidden vigor—

99
00:09:14,832 --> 00:09:16,747
Just eat up.

100
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,601
What are you doing?

101
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,819
For Ji Wan.

102
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:24,780
- What is it? 
 - Snacks, snacks.

103
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:35,278
Where's Ji Wan?

104
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:37,649
Can't find her.

105
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,008
Please put this on Ji Wan's seat.

106
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,626
She was pretty.

107
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,245
Hey, bring a photo from middle school!

108
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,928
Huh? No one here would be confident!

109
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:04,066
Huh?

110
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:06,915
This... is yours.

111
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,415
Geez, you have no mercy.

112
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,708
Hey, Yi Joon.

113
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:21,213
I think right now is okay for me to look a little cool.

114
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:23,056
I mean, you're just...

115
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,744
You act just like Shin Hye Joon.

116
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:26,258
There he comes.

117
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,519
Hey, Hye Joon!

118
00:10:39,476 --> 00:10:42,282
When are you two going to make up?

119
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:48,381
After her loser days were revealed, Han Ji Wan is hanging out with

120
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,344
Oh Ye Ji and her friends from the neighboring school.

121
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:52,797
Aren't they all scary?

122
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:55,093
But then, who'd accept her now?

123
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:57,478
I think they've all sided for Yu Min Jae.

124
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,403
Hey, Hanji!

125
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:02,637
You interested in meeting a guy?

126
00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:06,889
This guy only dates really pretty and famous girls.

127
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:08,934
Who is it?

128
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:13,423
If you go out with him, no one will be able to say anything about you.

129
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,840
That's right, that's right.

130
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,851
He's seriously popular.

131
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,954
At least look at his picture!

132
00:11:19,954 --> 00:11:22,196
He's really good-looking.

133
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:26,948
He goes to a school in Seoul, but he came here for training.

134
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:31,973
Meet him.

135
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:34,910
I know you want to pay them back.

136
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:44,970


137
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:51,261
 @User Not Found 
 Preview of the next episode coming up 

138
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:54,867
 Next episode 
 Are you really satisfied with hiding yourself like this? 

139
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:56,198
 Thank you. 

140
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:58,890
 Min Jae, you are really nice. 

141
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,031
 You're planning to hang out with Han Ji Wan again after all that? 

142
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:04,265
 So don't you dare to pretend to be me and give answers. 

143
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,771
 About Yu Min Jae... 

144
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:07,106
 I know. 

145
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:08,561
 You know? 

146
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,487
 I'll wait 

147
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:12,211
 until whenever that may be.
