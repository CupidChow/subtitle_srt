1
00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:01,768
 What are you doing after school? 

2
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:03,519
- Me? 
 - Yeah.

3
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:05,005
Want to go grab something to eat?

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,173
Sure!

5
00:00:06,197 --> 00:00:08,090
What do you like?

6
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:13,886
Min Jae. Can I ask you something?

7
00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:17,033
Okay.

8
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:20,728
You said you're from Nakwon High, right?

9
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,357
 @User Not Found 

10
00:00:31,357 --> 00:00:35,076
Is she insane? How can she even talk to you?

11
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:38,303
I know. Some nerve!

12
00:00:38,303 --> 00:00:41,348
Well. That's who she is.

13
00:00:41,348 --> 00:00:43,168
She's so mysterious.

14
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,819
Is she lying again?

15
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:46,179
Maybe.

16
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:51,733
We should've just asked you straight up instead of listening to Ji Wan.

17
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:54,171
We didn't know she was lying.

18
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:55,013
Yeah.

19
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:57,839
 I often feel uncomfortable. 

20
00:00:57,839 --> 00:00:58,576
Really?

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,194
 Is that true? 

22
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,175
Something didn't feel right.

23
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:08,338
 When I wasn't around, what would they have told Ji Wan? 

24
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:12,505
I'm pissed. Am I the only fool?

25
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:21,222
It's alright, though.

26
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:25,601
- What is it? 
 - What is it?

27
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,946
It's nothing!

28
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:34,548
 Min Jae was always by my side. 

29
00:01:34,548 --> 00:01:37,260
So what did Ji Wan say, Min Jae?

30
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,368
You were surprised, weren't you?

31
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:44,721
Not much.

32
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:50,943
Ji Wan...

33
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,255
When I first came to this school,

34
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:58,208
you were the first person who reached out to me.

35
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:01,153
 Hi! 

36
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:03,873
 Um... Hi. 

37
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:14,000


38
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:19,163
Thank you for that.

39
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:26,186
I don't think you are

40
00:02:26,186 --> 00:02:29,840
any more different than before.

41
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:37,547
We haven't talked about

42
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:42,328
why you did that to me

43
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:48,430
I hope we can stay as friends like before.

44
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,705
Thanks.

45
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:58,251
You are such a kind person Min Jae.

46
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:02,598
No.

47
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:08,170
Right, what were you trying to say?

48
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,507
Nothing much.

49
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:15,903
I have a blind date.

50
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,814
Is that so?

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,043
Things like last time won't happen again.

52
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:29,826
He and I live in different areas,

53
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:33,546
and he's much older than me, so I was a bit worried.

54
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,841
But he's very famous,

55
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,726
and he's the leader of some sports team,

56
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:40,444
so my friends forced me to meet him.

57
00:03:40,444 --> 00:03:44,006
It turns out he's from your former school.

58
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,947
So I thought you might know who he is.

59
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,716
 What should I do... 

60
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:57,737
 I didn't get permission from Min Jae yet... 

61
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:02,759
Who is he?

62
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,637
He looks like an actor.

63
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:17,064
He's so good-looking.

64
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:20,526
Really?

65
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,196
 He's so handsome. 

66
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,090
 Min Jae might know who he is... 

67
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:30,403
I'm not sure.

68
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:34,920
I'll ask my friend about him.

69
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,553
I hope he is a nice guy.

70
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,282
Thanks.

71
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,525
It's nice to talk to you like this

72
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:48,546
after a while.

73
00:04:57,414 --> 00:04:58,998
What?

74
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,583
Do you know him?

75
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,527
Nakwon High senior Cha Hyun Jin.

76
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:06,648
He's really handsome.

77
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:08,941
Why do you ask?

78
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,360
I looked him up.

79
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,470
He's the main athlete of Nakwon High, and he's really popular—

80
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,572
Who asked about him?

81
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:17,483
Ji Wan did—

82
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:20,970
Han Ji Wan?

83
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,599
You're still so stupid.

84
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:27,177
Huh?

85
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:29,504
And you keep asking for my help?

86
00:05:29,504 --> 00:05:31,948
You haven't changed at all.

87
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,451
Min Jae...

88
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:37,811
You still want to be friends after what she did to you?

89
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:44,366
Now that Da Ye and Eun Ji are gone, you want to be one of her servants?

90
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,289
Don't talk like that—

91
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,157
And why didn't you ask for my permission?

92
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,534
- That's— 
 - Hey!

93
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:57,746
Stop kidding yourself and keep your promise.

94
00:05:57,746 --> 00:06:00,761
I was just helping.

95
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:05,405
So stop acting like you're me and respond to her.

96
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,293
I don't like it.

97
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,957
Are you

98
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,083
done talking?

99
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,392
Why? Now you're gonna yell at me?

100
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:22,973
You've changed a lot.

101
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,637
 I'm sorry... 

102
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:39,765
 I didn't mean to say that. 

103
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:42,843
 I didn't mean to hurt you. 

104
00:06:43,784 --> 00:06:49,355
 The moment I heard that name, everything came back rushing to my head. 

105
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:55,364
 How I felt back then... 

106
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,534
 The feeling. 

107
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:00,386
 The sound. 

108
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:11,964
 Everything was so vivid. 

109
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,589
You...

110
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,183
Sorry.

111
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,614
But...

112
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,090
I don't think you should be alone.

113
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,588
Did you have a quarrel with Min Jae, too?

114
00:08:01,323 --> 00:08:02,757
No.

115
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:07,433
Then. Did someone call you a loser?

116
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:11,664
You two are mean to me these days.

117
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:20,806
I made a mistake with Min Jae.

118
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:26,970
I couldn't get angry at him back then.

119
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,391
So instead, I got angry at Min Jae.

120
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,920
Who's he?

121
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,369
The reason I came to this school.

122
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:48,825
You and I both are quite twisted.

123
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:51,138
We don't trust friends.

124
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:56,593
We weren't like this from the beginning.

125
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,489
 Why are you helping? 

126
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:01,732
 You're friends with them. 

127
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,976
 What? 

128
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,754
 You don't believe in friends, either. 

129
00:09:10,742 --> 00:09:13,627
But seeing you makes me think things over.

130
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,089
I shouldn't be like that.

131
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,991
That's nonsense.

132
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:28,605
I'm not going to doubt a good friend because I was hurt by others.

133
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:33,489
What if they get tired of us and leave?

134
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:39,380
Min Jae and Yi Joon.

135
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,517
Hey, it's more complicated

136
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:49,830
than you think.

137
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:52,500
You dummy.

138
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,051
I'm off.

139
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,930
We might get into a quarrel soon.

140
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,617
We need Min Jae.

141
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:04,720
Hey.

142
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:10,901
Do you enjoy living like this?

143
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,388
Hiding yourself away?

144
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,982
Why do you ask?

145
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,011
Well I want to quarrel outside.

146
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:35,410
 Changed to miinzziin 

147
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:49,165
 When I was Yu Min Jae, 

148
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,811
 everything was perfect. 

149
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:58,515
 I was happy. 

150
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:06,473
 Say no more. 

151
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:08,426
 Min Jae, let me make a call. 

152
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:10,494
 Sure. 

153
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:11,838
 I'll be back soon. 

154
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:13,572
 Okay. 

155
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,424
 Just a second. 

156
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:18,127
 Look at you. 

157
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:21,221
 Come here and chat with me. 

158
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:26,235
 What should I do? 

159
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:28,587
 What's wrong? 

160
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:32,506
 He might talk about it again on that day. 

161
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:34,526
 That he wants to do it. 

162
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:36,513
 You guys went out for a long time. 

163
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:38,631
 So it's about time he brings it up. 

164
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,408
 Is that so? 

165
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,492
 But I'm not ready yet. 

166
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:47,706
 You're such a scaredy cat. 

167
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,500
 You're a handful. 

168
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,128
 Well, he can wait if he's my boyfriend, right? 

169
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:56,407
 You've never done it, either. 

170
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:58,017
 Me? 

171
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,445
 I already have experience. 

172
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:02,796
 Really? 

173
00:12:02,796 --> 00:12:07,165
 Hey, I bet he's worried. 

174
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:09,011
 You know what? 

175
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:12,980
 Boys get hurt, too, when they're turned down. 

176
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:34,429
 I really have to go now. 

177
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:36,663
 I'll get in trouble. 

178
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:38,449
 Time is too short. 

179
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:40,384
 I feel the same way. 

180
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,886
 Oh, right! You said you'll grant me a wish. 

181
00:12:44,622 --> 00:12:48,400
 You said you'll grant me a wish when I win. 

182
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:50,578
 Oh... Right. 

183
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:52,296
 It's this weekend. 

184
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:55,416
 My parents are going on a trip. 

185
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,918
 Tell your parents in advance, okay? 

186
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:05,541
 If you don't want to, then it's okay. 

187
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,312
 Min Jae. You know what? 

188
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:13,350
 I trained really hard preparing for the game. 

189
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,336
 It was really tough. 

190
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,754
 And I fell down during the game and hurt my arm. 

191
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:20,007
 It still hurts. 

192
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,260
 Ow, it hurts. 

193
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,662
 Okay. 

194
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:27,130
 For real? You promise? 

195
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,141
 You like it that much? 

196
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,100
 Yes! Totally. 

197
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,061
 Can you stay a bit longer? 

198
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:35,138
 You're so pretty today. 

199
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,734
 Sorry. 

200
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:50,446
You're bad at playing hard to get.

201
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:52,273
I wanted to apologize first.

202
00:13:52,273 --> 00:13:53,824
Why do you say you're sorry?

203
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:56,752
 Well... 

204
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,404
 Did you hear? 

205
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,972
About Min Jae?

206
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,207
Because of that incident, she came to our school.

207
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:04,769
Everyone is surprised.

208
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:06,971
There's even an article about it.

209
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:11,649
My friends from another school asked if she was that pretty,

210
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,594
and I told them no.

211
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:15,004
By the way...

212
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:18,614
Is it true about her and Cha Hyun Jin?

213
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:21,335
 How can she act natural when everyone knows? 

214
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:22,445
 She must be embarrassed. 

215
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,805
 She should move to another school. 

216
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:26,573
- Moomin! 
 -  She'll go insane if she stays. 

217
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,694
Min Jae, is something wrong?

218
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:38,928
Min Jae?

219
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:41,040
Just a minute...

220
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,941
Min Jae, thanks.

221
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,314
Huh?

222
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,830
I met with Hyun Jin yesterday.

223
00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:26,525
I wanted to talk to you about that.

224
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:31,802
But before that, I want to ask you something.

225
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,542
What is it?

226
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:44,080
Why didn't you tell me you went out with him?

227
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,305
