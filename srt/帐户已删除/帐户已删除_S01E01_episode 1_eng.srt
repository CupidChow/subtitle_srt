1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:08,990


2
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,369
 Yu Min Jae who's moving to another school. 

3
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:21,390
 Before I go to bed, I always imagine this. 

4
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:33,101
 Turning beautiful after taking my glasses off. 

5
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:36,447
 Learning how to do makeup, 

6
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:38,826
 lets me find my hidden beauty. 

7
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:39,501
 Let's make a lot of friends in Woojung High School. 

8
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:41,428
 Starting a new life in a place 
   

9
00:00:41,428 --> 00:00:43,335
 - where no one knows me. 
 - Come with us. 

10
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,150
 Can you give me your number? 

11
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:45,242
 So cute. 

12
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:47,341
 You're really pretty. 

13
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:50,620
 And becoming a popular girl everyone knows. 

14
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:56,554
 @User Not Found 

15
00:00:56,554 --> 00:00:58,940
 First day at a new school 

16
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,430
 And now, all my fantasies could come true. 

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,552
With this— Yes!

18
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:12,500
I won't look like a loser.

19
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:16,744
- I've tried my best. 
 - Hey, Sin Hye Joon, Sin Yi Joon!

20
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,094
- Hi! 
 - Wait for me.

21
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:24,277
- You surprised me. 
 - Seong Su!

22
00:01:24,277 --> 00:01:27,356
- You did that on purpose! 
 - No, I didn't

23
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:41,990
 I won't even ask to join a clique like that. 

24
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:46,445
 Today's goal is 

25
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:49,499
 finding a best friend that I can eat lunch with from now on. 

26
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:51,324
I can do it!

27
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:08,960
Ji Hu, clean that up.

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,641
Come on, Teach!

29
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:13,783
 What should I do? 

30
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:16,447
 My mind's going blank. 

31
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:18,078
My name is not Ji Hu.

32
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:20,344
My name is Seok Jin.

33
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:23,144
You guys look alike.

34
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:26,022
No, we don't.

35
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:27,448
Be quiet.

36
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:32,300
We have a transfer student today.

37
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:38,891
 Everyone's looking at me. 

38
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:42,078
 Don't look so dark, just as I practiced. 
   

39
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,278
 Look cheerful. 
   

40
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:47,466
 No matter what I do, I'm always... 

41
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:51,390
 Hi, my name is Yu Min Jae 

42
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,713
 Invisible to them. 

43
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:58,261
 They never cared about what I did. 

44
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,223
Hi, my name is Yu Min Jae.

45
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,757
 Wha- What is this? 

46
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:23,966
 What do I do? 

47
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:26,114
- I have a question! 
 - Don't ask.

48
00:03:26,114 --> 00:03:30,716
 - Maybe my efforts weren't in vain.  
 - If you have questions, ask her yourself.

49
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:32,948
You can go to your seat, Min Jae.

50
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:41,579
So is she the...

51
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,230
I think so. But she looks more normal than I expected.

52
00:03:56,617 --> 00:03:59,004
 The real game begins now. 

53
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:02,667
 Making a best friend. 

54
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,337
 Who should I talk to first? 

55
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:06,888
- So handsome. 
 - I know.

56
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,808
 Lv. 6 
 Did you listen to their new song?

57
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:11,430
Of course! I thought my ears were going to melt.

58
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,546
 That's it! 

59
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:18,960
We have to go to their concert this time

60
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,140
Hey guys, I like them, too…

61
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:27,119
I hate people like you the most!

62
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:29,793
What did you just say?

63
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:32,071
If you're going to be a fan, you have to love them all!

64
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:34,931
- What do you care? 
  - Um… No, this is too scary. 

65
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:37,236
If you just like him, what about the other members?

66
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:39,759
- Let me go! 
 - You said you're his fan!

67
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,431
 Lv.8 

68
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:47,477
Guys, which chapter are you—

69
00:04:47,477 --> 00:04:48,935
I can't believe I got the question worth two points wrong.

70
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,299
I feel very Cu.

71
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:53,544
A play on words using Cu, the element symbol of copper.

72
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,607
How elegant.

73
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:04,705
 Again, I'm all alone during the break time. 

74
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,609
 So what if the school has changed? 

75
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,788
 I still can't say a word to other kids. 

76
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:13,242
   

77
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:14,980
 Who are you...? 

78
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,010
 I'm invisible once again. 

79
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:27,897
 She's probably like the others. 

80
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,437
What the...

81
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:33,557
Sorry.

82
00:05:33,557 --> 00:05:36,267
 This is the first time something like this has happened. 

83
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:39,540
Do you want to eat this?

84
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:46,780
 Do you want to eat this with me? 

85
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:53,337
 Oh, no thanks. You eat it. 

86
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:57,193
 I went to a concert last time... 

87
00:05:57,193 --> 00:05:59,409
 Hey guys, do you want this? 

88
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,320
 I love this flavor. 

89
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,513
 - It looks delicious! 
 - Try it! 

90
00:06:02,513 --> 00:06:04,395
 Here. 

91
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:07,989
 - It's good, right? 
 - So good. 

92
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:09,085
 It's good. 

93
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:10,664
 - It's amazing. 
 - It's so good.   

94
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:12,124
 I was eating that! 

95
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:13,732
 My favorite cheese flavor! 

96
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:17,170
 - Isn't it amazing? 
 - I love it. 

97
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:22,504
- If you don't like this— 
 - That's not it.

98
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:24,333
Thank you.

99
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:30,193
That's her.

100
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:32,630
The transfer student we all talked about.

101
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:38,705
Wow, did she already get someone to buy her snacks?

102
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:44,131
Wait for me.

103
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:46,170
Do you want to share this, too?

104
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,860
I also brought some snacks.

105
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,832
 Oh my gosh. 

106
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:10,150
 I feel like things are going to be different in this school! 

107
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:21,544
Hi there. 
  Name: ??? Popularity Lv.57 

108
00:07:21,544 --> 00:07:23,595
 This is also the first time.

00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:24,632
 This never happened before. 

110
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:26,389
Oh, hello.

111
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:27,746
I'm Han Ji Wan.

112
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:30,770
And they are Lee Eun Ji and Kim Da Ye.

113
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:35,561
 Why are girls like them talking to me? 

114
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:39,732
Min Jae, you are really pretty.

 4 ways to wittily react when you receive a compliment. 

120
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,780
 Returning a compliment. 

121
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,814
 This method is returning the compliment you received... 

122
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:59,887
No, you're prettier.

123
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:02,597
What are these two pretty girls saying?

124
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:04,514
 Pretty girls? 

125
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:07,486
 That includes me? 

126
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:11,471
 Is my new style doing the job? 

127
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:14,906
Min Jae, if you transferred from Gangnam, this place must be boring for you.

128
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:18,415
 I'm not from Gangnam. 

129
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,122
 But if I say that now, it may sound like I'm pointing it out. 

130
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:25,019
- I'm not from— 
 - But were you really FTT?

131
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:26,819
 FTT? 

132
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,243
 FTT… 

133
00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:30,429
 Oh! Forced to transfer. 

134
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:33,040
Yes, of course!

135
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,757
 Wait, is it short for something else? 

136
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:42,971
 I moved because of my father's work, so I was forced. 

137
00:08:44,012 --> 00:08:45,829
I heard that Min Jae is also good at studying.

138
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:48,027
What are you going to do for your extracurricular? Something related to studying?

139
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,015
 Um... I'm not good at studying. 

140
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:53,447
Oh! I also use this hand cream.

141
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:55,991
Guess we have similar tastes.

142
00:08:55,991 --> 00:08:57,888
Twinsies!

143
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,385
Yeah. So it seems.

144
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:05,348
Right, Min Jae. Do you want to eat lunch with us today?

145
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:11,080
 These pretty girls asked me to eat with them first. 

146
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,334
 My gosh! Maybe I really sounded like a social butterfly just now. 

147
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:29,793
 Not just one but three lunch buddies? 

148
00:09:31,691 --> 00:09:34,847
 Something really does change if you try hard. 

149
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:40,050
 No, maybe I had a potential that even I didn't know about. 

150
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,628
Oh, hey!

151
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:50,478
Sorry, sorry.

152
00:09:50,478 --> 00:09:51,942
You were trying to hit me with it, weren't you?

153
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:54,605
Come on, Kim Seong Soo.

154
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:57,125
No, I wasn't.

155
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,114
 Ji Wan is friends with everyone and really popular. 

156
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:04,194
- Who threw this so badly? 
 - It was Sin Yi Joon, wasn't it?

157
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,692
 He's so handsome. 

158
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,984
Right, Min Jae! I'll introduce you to them

159
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:16,727
 Me? To who? Wait... To them? 

160
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:20,856
 To a guy who looks like that? 

161
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:29,064
 Maybe he'll talk to girls like Ji Wan but definitely not to girls like me. 

162
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:33,683
Let's go.

163
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:47,662
This is Min Jae. She transferred to our class today.

164
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,782
 Talking to boys is... 

165
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:55,495
 I've never talked to them before.  

166
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:57,477
 No, what should I say? 

167
00:10:57,477 --> 00:10:59,260
 What should I say? 

168
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,080
 How to not look easy / Makeup 

169
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:05,030
Oh! Is she the one you guys talked about...

170
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:08,524
last week.

171
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:11,799
But...

I'm Kim Seong Su.

174
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:23,981
 I'm scared. 

175
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:26,517
 How can I talk to them when I can't look them in the eyes? 

176
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:28,571
 How... 

177
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:33,553
 What? 

178
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:12,916
Sorry.

179
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:31,200
