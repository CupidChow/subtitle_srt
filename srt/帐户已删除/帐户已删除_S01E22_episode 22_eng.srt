1
00:00:01,152 --> 00:00:05,107
 I hope everyone realizes how beautiful and awesome 

2
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:07,442
 the real Yu Min Jae is. 

3
00:00:08,231 --> 00:00:10,718
 I hope they all know. 

4
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,064
Who is she?

5
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,100
 @User Not Found 

6
00:00:36,957 --> 00:00:38,843
Min Jae!

7
00:00:39,885 --> 00:00:42,504
You're so pretty!

8
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:43,851
Stop it!

9
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:46,802
You're pretty, too.

10
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,040
I'm really happy.

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,718
Why?

12
00:00:53,822 --> 00:00:55,618
Actually, I...

13
00:00:55,618 --> 00:01:00,908
Someday, I wanted to spend a day with you as an ordinary friend.

14
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:10,676
There was a time when you wished I didn't exist.

15
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:12,575
When did I?!

16
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:14,046
"You don't need this anyway!"

17
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:15,296
"Can't you let me do this?"

18
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:17,536
Oh, come on!

19
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:22,534
Are you ready?

20
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes.

21
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,603
Hold on.

22
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:30,815
Um... Give me ten minutes.

23
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:47,142
Why did you run here in the morning?

24
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:51,740
I have something I wanted to say first.

25
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:58,606
Thanks for waiting for me.

26
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:10,415
I'm not the Yu Min Jae you know.

27
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:15,612
What?

28
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:20,849
I'm making a confession, honestly.

29
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,527
You can be disappointed.

30
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:35,996
If you don't like me anymore, I can understand.

31
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:44,679
Even for me, it's not cool.

32
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:48,870
But...

33
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:56,514
before I told the others, I wanted to tell you first.

34
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:05,216
Why?

35
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:15,545
That's who I become when I'm with you.

36
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:28,755
I don't have to act like Min Jae in school, as if I know everything and I'm amazing.

37
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:29,568
 The Perks of Being... 

38
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:32,048
 - You watch movies like that? 
 - No. 

39
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:33,322
 You used to walk like this. 

40
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:36,010
 Well, the other day you also... 

41
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:49,511
 In those moments, I solely felt like myself. 

42
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:59,578
And I enjoyed those moments that I spent with

43
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:01,987
you the most.

44
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,731
Then...

45
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,536
Let's stop.

46
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:30,050
Okay.

47
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,010
Thanks for everything.

48
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:58,747
Where are you going?

49
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:06,870
Today is the day.

50
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,543
Let's stop...

51
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:19,604
being friends.

52
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,060
After hearing everything...

53
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,039
You're still okay with it?

54
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:33,569
That's why

55
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:37,546
I like you even more.

56
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,980
♫  And I say yeah, we are so different  ♫

57
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,540
♫  I was surprised at first a-ha  ♫ 
 ♫  I like it because it's different now  ♫

58
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,660
♫  It seems to be filling up with something big.  ♫

59
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,030
♫  I'm surprised again a-ha  ♫ 
 ♫  so good now  ♫

60
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,802
- What's this? 
 - I told you I saw them.

61
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:07,991
Why is she here like that?

62
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:08,997
Is this a movie or what?

63
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:10,487
How come no one believed me?

64
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:12,192
Isn't she that weirdo?

65
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:14,344
Oh my gosh, what's this?

66
00:06:14,344 --> 00:06:15,279
She's insane.

67
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,245
For real.

68
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:20,220
She must've needed a friend.

69
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,070
If you can't say it upfront, just don't say it.

70
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,340
What?

71
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:41,169
Now you talk about Yu Min Jae. Who's going to be next?

72
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:49,138
I told you we should avoid being the last. What's all the fuss?

73
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:51,364
Everyone take your seats!

74
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,369
It'll be exam day soon.

75
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:01,854
- Kang Min Chan. 
 - Here.

76
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,236
- Kim So Yeong. 
 - Here.

77
00:07:04,236 --> 00:07:05,768
- Park So Hyun. 
 - Here.

78
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:07,880
- Seo Jung Bin. 
 - Here.

79
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,556
- Yu Min Jae. 
 - Here.

80
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,946
- Yu Min Jae. 
 - Here.

81
00:07:26,338 --> 00:07:27,805
 I came to this school three days ago... 

82
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:29,470
 What are you doing? 

83
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,577
 Um... I should explain what happened. 

84
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:37,347
 I guarantee our teacher doesn't know the difference. 

85
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:42,963
 But still. There are others, too. 

86
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,337
 Let's go. 

87
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:54,549
Why were you absent without notice?

88
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:04,982
Well, you're back now.

89
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:08,560
You need to take care if you want to rank 1st.

90
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:15,967
 As if nothing had ever happened, 

91
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:19,768
 the school and we 

92
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:21,323
 went back to our places. 

93
00:08:21,323 --> 00:08:24,130
Answer to number 5 is 3.

94
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:28,062
Number 6 is 4.

95
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:33,932
Number 7 is 2.

96
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,604
 Even the grades are back. 

97
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,458
Well. At least you let everything out before the test.

98
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,489
But I thought you'd do a bit better.

99
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:53,505
There were too many happenings for me to study for the exam.

100
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:55,873
More than me?

101
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:57,905
 Characteristics are back, too. 

102
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,603
You're mean.

103
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:01,766
But this question...

104
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:04,358
Didn't she get it wrong 3 or 4 times?

105
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:06,203
No, five times.

106
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:11,377
No, this is like this and like this, isn't it?

107
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:13,313
Did you memorize the formula yet?

108
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:15,860
I did! It's...

109
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,052
 Oh! 

110
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:25,830
 The user ID that confused everyone and made me act like her 

111
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,695
 and screwed us up from the start. 

112
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:31,060
 We decided to delete it. 

113
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,120
 Confirmation of deletion 

114
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:42,544
It's a bummer.

115
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,077
No, it's not.

116
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:48,067
Oh, do you want your photos?

117
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,590
It's okay.

118
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,680
Now everything is different from back then.

119
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,429
We have one more thing to delete.

120
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:04,409
What is it?

121
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:08,889
This.

122
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:11,260
I tried to delete it

123
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,847
but I was hesitant.

124
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:22,704
But now I've changed as well.

125
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:29,380
Do you still have that dream?

126
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,382
Not anymore.

127
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:41,333
 Screwed up hearts 

128
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:45,379
Help yourself.

129
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,913
 and screwed up relationships. 

130
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,838
Let's finish this and go for ice cream.

131
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:01,164
- Let's hurry! 
 - Let's go.

132
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,135
I love this song.

133
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:07,476
Isn't it nice?

134
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:09,683
Everything on the playlist is my style.

135
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,388
You've got some great taste.

136
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:17,184
Is this what you recommended last time?

137
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:19,342
Was it Jnam?

138
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:22,263
Do you listen to it often?

139
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:23,936
Yes.

140
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,842
 When I was having a hard time, I found this song by chance 

141
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:30,098
 and was comforted by it. 

142
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:33,080
 Jnam commented, "I sometimes cry in secret, so please stay alive." 

143
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:40,447
Whenever something happened, as if we had connected,

144
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:42,709
he made similar posts.

145
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,882
So sometimes I replied.

146
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:47,500
Actually we...

147
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,425
 You may not feel the same way, but what I tried to say then was... 

148
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:53,172
 We even talked once. 

149
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:56,353
 But I'll keep it a secret. 

150
00:11:56,353 --> 00:11:58,004
What is it?

151
00:11:58,004 --> 00:12:00,172
I'm curious.

152
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:01,226
It's nothing.

153
00:12:01,226 --> 00:12:03,077
What is it?

154
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:04,096
Look.

155
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:07,373
The title, it's just like us.

156
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:10,387
Why do you smile?

157
00:12:11,787 --> 00:12:13,355
I'm happy.

158
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,181
At what?

159
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:20,912
Thank you...

160
00:12:25,392 --> 00:12:27,587
Yootokking.

161
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,902
 As if you want to disappear from this world. 

162
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:33,848
 Something like that. 

163
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:38,816
 Then, what do you do? 

164
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:40,781
 I do nothing. 

165
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:46,024
 I just live. 

166
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:49,260
 Just disappear, or live like this (playlist) 

167
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:57,556
 It's a pretty moon. 

168
00:12:58,745 --> 00:12:59,957
 Yeah. 

169
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:01,821
 You're right. 

170
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:06,419
 Then, did you listen to the playlist I recommended? 

171
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,144
 - Yeah, I liked the songs. 
 - Right? 

172
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:11,970
 Jnam Playlist 

173
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,319
You...

174
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,008
What are you?

175
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:22,447
Then you were...?

176
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:23,534
Oh!

177
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:28,661
"Even if I've never gone out, I want a kiss." Its reply was...

178
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,657
It was the most impressive.

179
00:13:32,657 --> 00:13:34,224
I'm going to delete all the replies.

180
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:36,205
Don't.

181
00:13:55,082 --> 00:14:00,713
 I even found out other secrets that I didn't know. 

182
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:12,287
You're so short, I didn't notice you.

183
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:14,881
You're not even 180cm tall.

184
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:16,618
I'm taller than 180cm!

185
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:19,024
You're talking nonsense.

186
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,996
Right?

187
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:22,119
Yeah.

188
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,761
Ji Wan!

189
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:26,345
Good morning.

190
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,594
Did you have breakfast?

191
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:31,059
Yes.

192
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,863
Bye.

193
00:14:34,963 --> 00:14:37,724
 The first day of school seems like yesterday. 

194
00:14:37,724 --> 00:14:40,591
 But already a semester has passed by. 

195
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:43,260
No-min.

196
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,144
Let's go together.

197
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:46,721
You're early today!

198
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:49,189
It's Shin Yi Joon.

199
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,358
Hey, Shin Yi Joon!

200
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,850
♫  Very naturally raise the corners of your lips  ♫ 
 ♫  even if it's a little too much  ♫

201
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,352
I'm not used to him smiling like that.

202
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:14,417
Why not?

203
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:15,510
He's awesome.

204
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,880
♫  Everyone try to be alike  ♫

205
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,010
♫  Even I erase myself  ♫ 
 ♫  until it becomes transparent  ♫

206
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,270
♫  (more changing my all)  ♫

207
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,045
 Unlike the first day of worries, 

208
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:35,347
 I have accomplished more than I expected. 

209
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:44,701
 Thanks, Min Jae of the past. 

210
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:46,874
Hey, Yi Joon.

211
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:49,460
What do you like about Min Jae?

212
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,590
♫  I like it because it's different now  ♫

213
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,293
Everything.

214
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:55,247
- What did he say? 
 - Everything.

215
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:56,640
Min Jae.

216
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,190
♫  I'm surprised again a-ha  ♫ 
 ♫  so good now  ♫

217
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,770
♫  surprised at first  ♫ 
 ♫  I like it because it's different now  ♫

218
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,418
 Thanks 

219
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:14,910
 for changing me without knowing. 

220
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,160
♫  surprised again  ♫ 
 ♫  so good now  ♫

221
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,943
 For letting me sing out in front of others. 

222
00:16:22,943 --> 00:16:25,230
 For making me reach out first. 

223
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,970
♫  I look different, like I'm proud of myself  ♫

224
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:32,030
 For letting me have great memories with true friends. 

225
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,250
♫  It piles up one by one, so deep  ♫

226
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,320
♫  hold everything mine  ♫

227
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,950
♫  Now stick with me and grow me more  ♫

228
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,600
♫  You resemble the rain  ♫

229
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,584
 For everything to be possible. 

230
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:45,748
 That beginning. 

231
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:47,211
 The start. 

232
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:48,947
 That day. 

233
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:50,480
 Thanks for your courage. 

234
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,440
♫  I'll go like this  ♫

235
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,160
♫  Take care of each other  ♫

236
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,110
♫  and I say  ♫ 
 ♫  yeah we are so different  ♫

237
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,690
♫  I was surprised at first a-ha  ♫ 
 ♫  I like it because it's different now  ♫
