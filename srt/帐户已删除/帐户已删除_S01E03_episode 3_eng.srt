1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:02,040
You're not her, right?

2
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:04,988
Yu Min Jae.

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,244
- I'm— 
 - Right.

4
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:15,388
Technically, you weren't pretending to be her since you're also Yu Min Jae.

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,102
I knew it.

6
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:21,587
Could you please—

7
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:24,848
I'll keep this a secret from the others.

8
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,794
Why?

9
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,805
Because it's fun.

10
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:32,790
But when she shows up...

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:40,040


12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,750
Never mind.

13
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:49,591
But it's so unfair.

14
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,635
It's not that I wanted to lie.

15
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,904
I'm just a new student

16
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,804
 and all of a sudden... 

17
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,480
I knew it! Did you skip class from the first day?

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,190
That's... Um...

19
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,056
Hold on! The next period is...

20
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:07,025
 Oneulhaggyo | Woojung High School 
 Time Table 

21
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,253
Did you come back to take our homeroom teacher's class?

22
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:11,142
Oh, right!

23
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:14,732
How come you don't follow me back on Ins**gram?

24
00:01:14,732 --> 00:01:15,867
Huh?

25
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:17,603
Why do you have so many followers?

26
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:19,179
I'm so jealous.

27
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:22,730
You're on another level

28
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,219
I'm trying to get more followers.

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,647
This is your account, right?

30
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,640
 yoo.minjae.05 

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,827
 Oh... No! 

32
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:37,130
 I have to tell her. 

33
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,181
- That's... 
 - Oh right!

34
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,043
I couldn't tag you last time.

35
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:46,048
Could you follow me back too? 
  Requested 

36
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:47,090
- Me too. 
 - Me too!

37
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,483
Me too! 
  Requested 

38
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:56,607
But I don't use Ins**gram these days...

39
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,079
 Oh... Shoot! 

40
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,898
 I'm seriously doomed. 

41
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,711
 User Not Found 

42
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,460
Here! A gift. 
  #602, Sooyoung APT, 7 Gyoseo-ro, Yeonsu-gu 

43
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:18,972
Oh... You scared me

44
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,498
What's this?

45
00:02:20,498 --> 00:02:22,024
Read it.

46
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:31,109
But why is the last digit of the phone number a question mark?

47
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,562
Wow... Where's the thank you?

48
00:02:34,562 --> 00:02:36,448
Do you know how hard it was to get this?

49
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:39,918
 Hye Joon is helping me because he's nice... Right? 

50
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:41,519
 He's completely different from the other boys. 

51
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,029
 He's like the typical male lead of a teen romance! 

52
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,706
 Romance? That's why... 

53
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,023
 I'll keep this as a secret. 

54
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:47,709
 Not a chance. 

55
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,469
Are you curious?

56
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,296
Do you want to know why I'm helping you?

57
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,515
Why are you helping me?

58
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,614
I feel bad for you.

59
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:06,211
You're trying so hard to do something.

60
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:09,572
And it's not like you're not Yu Min Jae, right?

61
00:03:13,752 --> 00:03:15,503
Thanks.

62
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,243
 He must've thought I was pathetic. 

63
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:28,190
 Even I thought I was pathetic. 

64
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,360
 Being popular like "Yu Min Jae"? 

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,464
 I've never even hoped for something like that. 

66
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,691
 Hey, friend! Please talk more at your new school. You're awfully quiet. 
 Do I know you? 

67
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,752
 What's today's lunch menu? 
 Got nothing to write. 

68
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:40,903
 Guys! Guys! 

69
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:43,014
 So I talked a lot. 

70
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,057
 Although we've never been close, 

71
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,542
 I thought you always looked discouraged. 

72
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,086
 You should smile more. 

73
00:03:48,086 --> 00:03:50,129
 And changed a lot of things about myself. 

74
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,717
 I thought everything was different this time because I worked hard. 

75
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,155
 Why did we have to have the same name? 

76
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,775
 While I lived as the other Min Jae, 

77
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,969
 Min Jae, you look so pretty. 

78
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:06,729
 Look at the pretty girls complimenting each other. 

79
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:09,457
 This is Min Jae. She's a new girl in my class. 

80
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,175
Oh? Oh!

81
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:14,395
 Is she the girl everyone was talking about last week? 

82
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:15,713
 She's perfect. 

83
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,540
 She even gets good grades. 
   

84
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,926
 I realized how different our lives were. 

85
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:25,673
 I felt so pathetic for believing that my life had changed. 

86
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:29,093
I just want to disappear from this world.

87
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:31,679
 Then I won't have to go to school 

88
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:35,333
 when you come tomorrow. 

89
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,559
Geez, you scared me.

90
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:27,968
B-But,

91
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:30,463
what were you doing here?

92
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,667
Hey! Um...

93
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:38,572
 Should I tell her or not? 

94
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,590
 30 minutes ago 

95
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,576
 CAUTION-DROP 

96
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,000
 I thought she was having bad thoughts. 

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,709
Never mind.

98
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,246
Huh?

99
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,230
I mean, this!

100
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:16,942
This is my favorite.

101
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,947
I thought you were buying everything in the store.

102
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,668
Sorry.

103
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,489
Why are you sorry?

104
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:45,505
You like strawberry flavor, huh?

105
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,220
Are you alright?

106
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,706
Huh?

107
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:14,500
What do you mean?

108
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,287
You know...

109
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,466
Have you ever had that thought?

110
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:35,895
You feel so scared and ashamed of yourself

111
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,417
that you secretly wish

112
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:44,530
to disappear from this world.

113
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:52,054
You probably never had that experience, right?

114
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,325
I have.

115
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:24,045
What do you do when you have that thought?

116
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,320
I don't do anything.

117
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:37,625
I just continue to live.

118
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,840
 Outcast because of lying 

119
00:08:58,513 --> 00:09:03,080
 I ran across a title which comforted me. 
   

120
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,970
♫  You are more beautiful than the stars in the dark sky  ♫ 
 ♫  You are dazzlingly pretty  ♫

121
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,740
♫  After losing you because of blurred vision for a moment  ♫ 
 ♫  After finding your reflection in the water again  ♫

122
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,221
 I blankly listened to the song 

123
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,520
 on some stranger's playlist. 

124
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,648
♫  Your voice that I can hear from the end of the street  ♫

125
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:20,869
 Thank you, it was comforting. 

126
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:24,379
 I wanted to disappear from the world 

127
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:27,117
 but I wasn't the only one who thought that way. 

128
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:31,042
 Add a public comment 

129
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:33,375
 When all my efforts pushed me over the edge, 

130
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,830
 I became so depressed that I wanted to disappear. 

131

 But your playlist really helped me, Jnam 

133
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,192
 I should go on and live life to the fullest. I can do that, right?

 Class 1-7 

148
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,476
 She's finally coming today. 

149
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,860
Quiet down, guys!

150
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,478
Attention, please.

151
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:05,982
We have another new student in our class today.

152
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:07,475
Come on in.

153
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:11,596
 She's smart 

154
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:13,164
 and pretty. 

155
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:15,532
 I can never be a match for... 

156
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,909
Hi!

157
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:27,228
I'm Yu Min Jae.

158
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:28,695
Eh? Yu Min Jae?

159
00:11:28,695 --> 00:11:29,972
- What the... 
 - Seriously?

160
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:32,007
Min Jae, you guys have the same name.

161
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:34,051
But she's so different from our Min Jae.

162
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:35,970
Doesn't she look so quiet?

163
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,897
- That's so cool! They have the same name. 
 -  What?
