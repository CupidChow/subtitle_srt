1
00:00:02,741 --> 00:00:04,587
Min Jae.

2
00:00:05,747 --> 00:00:08,000
Someone's calling for you.

3
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:18,913
 That's because you never wear your uniform properly. 

4
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:21,220
 I sometimes dress properly. 

5
00:00:29,254 --> 00:00:33,018
 User Not Found 

6
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:36,387
Why did you call me?

7
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:42,524
Notes for Korean. Can I borrow them?

8
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:20,456
Bye.

9
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:06,317
 I recommend tracks No. 2, No. 7, No. 9, and No. 11. 

10
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:07,943
What's this?

11
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:10,580
Who listens to a CD these days?

12
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:24,217
Attention!

13
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:30,166
You will practice passing in teams of two.

14
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:34,982
If you don't do it properly, you'll see my fireball shot.

15
00:02:34,982 --> 00:02:37,127
To your positions.

16
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,401
Min Jae, will you be my partner?

17
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:41,874
Sure.

18
00:02:45,342 --> 00:02:47,544
I'll throw first.

19
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:01,154
Da Ye.

20
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:02,889
Yeah?

21
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:10,407
You know the thing you said yesterday.

22
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:16,685
 She has a crush on someone. 

23
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:18,152
 What? I didn't know. 

24
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:19,990
 Tell me, tell me. 

25
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,864
 He's just a friend. 

26
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:28,963
 But sometimes he says something that gives me butterflies. 

27
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:32,615
 Butterflies? That means he's more than a friend. 

28
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:38,303
 But he could be thinking of you as just a friend, right? 

29
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:40,440
Catch.

30
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,990
- That's good. 
 - Right?

31
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,998
 Thanks. 

32
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:56,483
I...

33
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:59,250
I'm going through a similar thing.

34
00:04:00,957 --> 00:04:03,159
I don't know if he feels the same way.

35
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,610
Maybe I'm being weird and reading into things.

36
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:11,454
No! No, you're not weird.

37
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:13,454
It's the same for me.

38
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,881
Well, well.

39
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:34,086
Are... you okay?

40
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:38,320
Yes, No-Min is fine.

41
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:48,782
I heard the other kids say that she's weird.

42
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,071
Really?

43
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,420
You have tied your hair quite well.

44
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,733
Wait a minute.

45
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:05,850
Min Jae, what are you wearing?

46
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,166
Huh?

47
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,480
Oh... This?

48
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,800
 Destroy 
 Sicko World 

49
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,678
What's this?

50
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:16,451
 It's so... 

51
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,926
 It's cute! 

52
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:19,661
 It's similar to something 

53
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:22,380
 I wore in middle school. 

54
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,800
 Back when everyone... 

55
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,866
 Did you see her clothes? 

56
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,396
 - Terrible. 
 - Is she a cartoon character? 

57
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:29,406
 She's dressed like a loser. 

58
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:34,041
Min Jae Chan!!!

59
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:36,940
Is that...

60
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,430
You're like Annie Chan from the anime Yiwanot.

61
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,972
I watched all of it except for the movie.

62
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:46,075
You have good taste.

63
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,664
You look cute.

64
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:57,239
You're such a goddess.

65
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,176
This is the hottest T-shirt these days!

66
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:11,144
It costs 384,000 won!

67
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:12,362
 What is happening? 

68
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:15,623
Wow, Hye Joon. You know quite a bit!

69
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:16,749
You're right.

70
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:18,441
It looks so good on you!

71
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:20,663
It's really cute.

72
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:23,324
No wonder it looks perfect on you.

73
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:26,920
Min Jae, can you tell me where you bought it?

74
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,827
Oh, the shop's hidden in an alley by Woojung Station.

75
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:34,072
I'll send you the address.

76
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:35,368
Can I have your number?

77
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:37,176
My number?

78
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:40,364
Here.

79
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:46,320
 No, why me? 

80
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:49,236
 You said so yourself. 

81
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:53,577
 "I can change what everyone thinks and says." 

82
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,820
 I didn't put it like that. 

83
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,745
 I know nothing about girls' fashion. 

84
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:00,016
 You're smart. 

85
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:00,886
 Memorize it! 

86
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:04,170
 Think of it as a test. 

87
00:07:09,944 --> 00:07:11,478
 Anyway, 

88
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:15,518
 no one will pay attention to me. 

89
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:24,237
 But they will listen to you. 

90
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,987
 Please do me a favor. 

91
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:33,145
 Then let me ask you a question. 

92
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:35,080
 What is it? 

93
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:46,213
 Why are you doing all of this to do favors for Yu Min Jae? 

94
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:51,397
 I told you. 

95
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:57,675
 Your idea of friendship doesn't exist. 

96
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:02,985
 You don't know everything. 

97
00:08:03,906 --> 00:08:05,680
 To me... 

98
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,400
 - This. 
 - Huh? 

99
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:12,555
 Stop. 

100
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:15,480
 She could've been sincere. 

101
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,766
 Yeah. 

102
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:24,482
 It felt like I had a real friend thanks to you. 

103
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:29,529
 I want to protect her. 

104
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:32,508
 Her innocence. 

105
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:41,253
 It looks good on her. 

106
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,542
 She must be annoyed. 

107
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,128
Min Jae is so nice.

108
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,789
Answering all of their questions.

109
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:53,550
Exactly.

110
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,166
She makes people feel comfortable.

111
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:58,040
Definitely.

112
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:09,386
 Shin Yi Joon: Did you listen to it? 

113
00:09:09,386 --> 00:09:14,206
 Hye Joon: Where are you? 

114
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:18,498
 This is strange. 

115
00:09:18,498 --> 00:09:20,407
 Very strange. 

116
00:09:22,252 --> 00:09:27,890
 Guy friend 

117
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,370
 My guy friend confessed to me. 

118
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:38,061
It all leads to romance?

119
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:40,490
Is there anything else?

120
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:56,117
 Gifts for a guy friend 

121
00:09:56,117 --> 00:10:00,266
 Why did my guy friend give me a present out of the blue? 

122
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,669
 He could've given it to you as a friend. 

123
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,939
 I knew it. 

124
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,570
 Presents mean he has feelings for you. 

125
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:21,591
Hi.

126
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:29,839
Oh, this is...

127
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:44,610
Let's call it even.

128
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:46,923
For the CD you gave me.

129
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:51,526
One ticket?

130
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,285
What?

131
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,709
Oh, you don't want to go alone. I'll buy another one.

132
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:58,355
What about you?

133
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:04,078
What? Me?

134
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:09,411
What are you doing this Saturday?

135
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,650
Saturday?

136
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:16,748
Come with me.

137
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:18,307
What?

138
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,771
Just the two of us?

139
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:26,394
Just the two of us?

140
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:30,137
Or I can ask everyone in the group chat—

141
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:32,223
You don't want to?

142
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,445
What?

143
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:36,342
You don't want to go with me?

144
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:39,615
I do.

145
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,127
Min Jae.

146
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:53,564
Can you take me to the clothing store you mentioned?

147
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,163
I want to go.

148
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:57,151
How about this Saturday?

149
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,137
Can we go another day?

150
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:03,340
I have plans this Saturday.

151
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,986
Really?

152
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:06,803
With who?

153
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:10,229
Oh... Shin Yi Joon.

154
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,187
What happened is that I—

155
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:13,249
Classic.

156
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:17,231
He likes to go to the cinema when he has nothing else to do.

157
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:21,854
Oh, you guys go to the cinema often?

158
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,478
But seeing that he hasn't asked everyone,

159
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:29,887
he must really like you.

160
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:32,490
Gosh, no.

161
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,973
No, no, no.

162
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:37,244
No. I know him well.

163
00:12:37,244 --> 00:12:39,333
This means something.

164
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:42,841
You think?

165
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:47,277
Maybe he asked me to come with him as a friend.

166
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:50,760
Min Jae, did you get butterflies?

167
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:53,145
No, I...

168
00:12:53,145 --> 00:12:55,129
Eun Ji and her guy friend—

169
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:58,249
Hey! Are you and Eun Ji the same?

170
00:12:59,018 --> 00:13:01,210
I'll help you!

171
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,160
Do well!

172
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:10,020
 Maybe he really likes me? 

173
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:23,385
 Min Jae, which one is the cutest? 

174
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:26,561
 Min Jae? 

175
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:29,691
 Min Jae. 

176
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:32,155
 Min Jae! 

177
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:34,129
 Min Jae. 

178
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:36,195
-  Min Jae— 
 - Stop 

179
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:37,705
 I'm looking at them. 

180
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:39,750
 Calm down. 

181
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:43,406
 What is the occasion? 

182
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:50,204
 Which one? 

183
00:13:51,626 --> 00:13:53,999
 What's going on with you? 

184
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,122
 You're acting suspicious. 

185
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:01,340
 The seventh hair band. 

186
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:24,808
 Is this one of those "guy friend becomes boyfriend" situations 

187
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,424
 that I read about on social media? 

188
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:35,300
 We're sharing popcorn and then... 

189
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:45,555
 You're pretty. 

190
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:16,494
 Min Jae. 

191
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:22,790
 Can we talk? 

192
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:29,140


193
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,445

 Next episode 
 Shin Yi Joon asked me to be his girlfriend. 

195
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:37,652
 What would you choose between friendship and love? 

196
00:15:37,652 --> 00:15:39,807
 The important thing is you, 

197
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:40,915
 not anyone else. 

198
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:43,159
 Sometimes it's better to stay as friends that aren't really friends. 

199
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:43,908
 Shin Hye Joon. 

200
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:45,798
 If you're not sure what's in her heart, 

201
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:46,774
 I'll help. 

202
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:48,122
 Don't fall for me. 

203
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:49,463
 Yu Min Jae. 

204
00:15:49,463 --> 00:15:51,585
 What is in his heart?
