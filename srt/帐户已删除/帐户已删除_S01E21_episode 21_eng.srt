1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:08,960


2
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,902
 @User Not Found 

3
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,731
She caused problems here and there and now she's all alone.

4
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:42,198
Then do you hang out with me because you don't want to be alone?

5
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,671
Ji Wan.

6
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,273
That's mean.

7
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:50,116
Yeah.

8
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:03,622
 Hyunjin : Missed call
 Are we meeting on Friday? 

9
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,256
Ji Wan.

10
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:19,929
We're not friends anymore.

11
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:22,323
I came to say sorry.

12
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,201
You're lying.

13
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:27,945
You don't have an ulterior motive?

14
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,567
No.

15
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:35,136
I don't do that anymore.

16
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:43,169
You might not have thought so, but...

17
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,463
I...

18
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:49,658
I thought we were friends.

19
00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:53,736
But I don't know if we're really friends or what you think about me.

20
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:11,614
I know.

21
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:18,377
That's why I want you to stop giving yourself a hard time.

22
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,886
Let's stop.

23
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,949
It's hard for you to be calculative all the time

24
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:32,935
to maintain your image, isn't it?

25
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:45,080
I think she might be the person that I know.

26
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,024
Really?

27
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:49,503
I had a hard time because of her.

28
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,905
She almost ruined my career.

29
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,874
I could've joined a better team.

30
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,533
But I couldn't.

31
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:57,827
But...

32
00:02:57,827 --> 00:02:59,730
She was the one who lied and caused trouble,

33
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,872
so it all ended well for me.

34
00:03:01,872 --> 00:03:04,266
It must've been tough.

35
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:06,019
It's her, isn't it? Her name is...

36
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:07,520
Min Jae.

37
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,548
Yu Min Jae.

38
00:03:09,548 --> 00:03:11,216
 Wow! 

39
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:13,518
 That's what I thought. 

40
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,724
- Is it her— 
 - It's incredible.

41
00:03:18,724 --> 00:03:24,066
I wanted to see her again and ask her

42
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:28,632
why she did that to me.

43
00:03:28,632 --> 00:03:31,594
How could she have done that to me?

44
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:37,117
 I don't like you 

45
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,561
 but I can feel it. 

46
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:41,421
What's the matter?

47
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,749
Nothing.

48
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:46,467
Are you hungry?

49
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:48,853
Shall we have something nice to eat?

50
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,923
Whatever you want.

51
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:53,120
What do you like to eat?

52
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,940
 yoo.minjae.05 

53
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:09,557
Yeah.

54
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:12,485
You're probably disappointed in me too by now.

55
00:04:13,612 --> 00:04:16,738
 I always thought you were really cool. 

56
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,216
 Stop pretending. 

57
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,110
 That's not cool. 

58
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,578
 She could've meant it. 

59
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:23,746
 You don't even know what's real and what's fake. 

60
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:28,056
 If she was a real friend, she would've waited. 

61
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:29,677
 The truth is... 

62
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:31,062
 Hi! 

63
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,447
 I'm Yu Min Jae. 

64
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:35,575
 ...I'm not any different. 

65
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,703
 Don't act like you know me. 

66
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,291
 You wanted to change like me, didn't you? 

67
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,727
 You didn't want to attract any attention. 

68
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:47,662
 You don't need it. 

69
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,839
 Isn't that why you're here like this? 

70
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:53,410
 I don't have any expectations anymore. 

71
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,170
 I told you that I wanted a quiet life. 

72
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,473
 But deep down, I must've liked it. 

73
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:07,628
 Student Id 
 Yu Min Jae 

74
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:13,477
 I was the same as you. 

75
00:05:13,477 --> 00:05:16,590
 I was scared of the group chatroom becoming quiet, 

76
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,568
 scared of not having anyone around me. 

77
00:05:20,137 --> 00:05:22,997
 If I see 

78
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:25,066
 the changed expression on your face... 

79
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:28,259
 Are you... done talking? 

80
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:32,557
 ...I won't be able to go back to school. 

81
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,578
 You're not like her. 

82
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:42,605
 You were always there for me through everything. 

83
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,121
 Min Jae. 

84
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,432
 After that day 

85
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:01,994
 I went back to being the old me. 

86
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:05,081
She caused problems here and there and now she's all alone.

87
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:07,583
 I eat alone. 

88
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:10,294
 People belittle me. 

89
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,215
 But one thing has changed. 

90
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:16,634
 I'm okay with it now. 

91
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:19,387
 I don't care. 

92
00:06:20,572 --> 00:06:22,582
 I'm waiting. 

93
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,375
 I'll wait until you tell me. 

94
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,361
 I want to be a good friend to you 

95
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:30,264
 just like you are to me. 

96
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,376
No!

97
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,468
 I'm sad... 

98
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:03,589
 But I'm also hungry. 

99
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:18,561
 Sweetie, I made this for you. 

100
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:23,773
 And the snacks are from your friend Min Jae. 

101
00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:27,779
 There are two Min Jaes and you want the same things. 

102
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:30,933
 I know you'll get through this well. 

103
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:34,528
 I love you. 

104
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,126
 Of course, 

105
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:52,079
 I'll be waiting quietly. 

106
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,964
 But I want to show you that I'm waiting, 

107
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:01,929
 that I'm here for you, and that I worry about you a lot. 

108
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:08,337
Hey!

109
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:31,944
Why...

110
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,188
Why are you crying?

111
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,957
Just...

112
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:40,069
I didn't even know that happened.

113
00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:41,587
I was pathetic.

114
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:45,914
I asked you to switch because of Instagram followers.

115
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:48,586
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:52,349
No.

117
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:54,935
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,711
I'm sorry that I put you through this.

119
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,674
Then...

120
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:05,434
When will you come back to school?

121
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:10,966
You didn't want me to transfer to your school, remember?

122
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:14,545
That's...

123
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,350
I know that

124
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,878
you like me too.

125
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:24,655
What?

126
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,293
 Hey! 

127
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:33,453
 I like you for those qualities, but... 

128
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:38,133
 Think about yourself before you think about your friends. 

129
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:44,272
 The most important person is you, 

130
00:09:44,272 --> 00:09:46,694
 not other people. 

131
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,641
To me,

132
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:54,977
you're the most important person.

133
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,922
If it weren't for you,

134
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,467
I wouldn't be who I am today.

135
00:10:11,469 --> 00:10:12,853
Then...

136
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:18,306
I want everyone to know how incredible, pretty,

137
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:20,736
and amazing Yu Min Jae is.

138
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:26,472
And that the ridiculous rumors they're talking about are not true.

139
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:31,311
I want everyone to know that you're the victim.

140
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,784
You are Yu Min Jae too, silly.

141
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,893
 Ji Wan 

142
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,091
I won't answer it.

143
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,952
 Ji Wan 

144
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:12,029
 Min Jae. 

145
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,915
 Help me... 

146
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,687
Ji Wan.

147
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,905
Why didn't you answer my calls?

148
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:33,158
I'm busy studying for the exams.

149
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:37,645
I'm sorry that I asked her to introduce us

150
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:39,923
when things are so hectic.

151
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:42,659
Ah... I see.

152
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,264
- I'm sorry, I'll tell Ye Ji— 
 - You could've told me sooner.

153
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:50,692
What?

154
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,946
Are you

155
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,289
kidding me?

156
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:58,800
Are you freaking kidding me?

157
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,937
You made me come all this way.

158
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:05,741
Hey!

159
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:16,426
Stop.

160
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:20,397
Yu Min Jae?

161
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:23,792
What are you doing here?

162
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,886
You haven't changed at all.

163
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:28,438
Still using violence toward the wrong people.

164
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,119
You disappeared after ruining my life.

165
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:53,939
You didn't lose anything.

166
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,566
It wasn't my fault.

167
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,726
You ruined everything.

168
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:01,845
You blew things completely out of proportion and made a lot of people miserable.

169
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:04,450
You did that.

170
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,094
Me?

171
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:11,648
I liked you a lot, Min Jae.

172
00:13:11,648 --> 00:13:14,401
What did I do so wrong?

173
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:19,781
We dated for a long time.

174
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,619
I did it because I liked you.

175
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:25,787
Everyone does it.

176
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:30,083
You couldn't do it for me? I was your boyfriend.

177
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,219
Whatever.

178
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:34,880
You always did what you wanted.

179
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:38,675
Even when I first asked you out.

180
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,987
Even your friend said so.

181
00:13:43,765 --> 00:13:45,825
You called her?

182
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,727
Why do you think there's no one around you?

183
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:56,977
You think you're better than everyone else.

184
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:59,371
You only think about yourself.

185
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:03,641
- But I still like you. 
 - You like me?

186
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:04,827
Don't make me laugh.

187
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:05,945
What?

188
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,388
Hey!

189
00:14:08,206 --> 00:14:10,049
Let's get this straight.

190
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,817
I went easy on you.

191
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:16,104
You have no future if you can't play baseball,

192
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:19,725
so I let you off easy.

193
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:21,769
Hey.

194
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,649
 Everyone does it. 

195
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:30,877
 You couldn't do it for me? I was your boyfriend. 

196
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:32,421
Well...

197
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:37,782
If you keep skipping practice and going to another city to meet girls,

198
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:41,430
your baseball career won't work out either.

199
00:14:44,993 --> 00:14:46,602
Let's go.

200
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:51,958
Hey! Yu Min Jae.

201
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,817
- What?! 
 - What?!

202
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:04,469
Stop bothering us.

203
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,732
Next time, I won't let you off easily.

204
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,487
Let's go.

205
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,998
Wait.

206
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,467
It feels like it's been a long time.

207
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,412
- What? 
 - What is?

208
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:41,598
You two, like this.

209
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:44,384
Have you decided to stop fighting?

210
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:46,963
Stop fighting.

211
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:48,873
You're going to make up like this anyway.

212
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:51,158
You fight and make up.

213
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:04,585
I miss having Han Ji Wan and Yu Min Jae in this group.

214
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:11,610
Who is that?

215
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:17,700
♫  Very naturally, raise the corners of your lips  ♫ 
 ♫  even if it's a little too much, again, like that  ♫

216
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,300
♫  As if there is a fixed answer  ♫ 
 ♫  Everyone try to be alike  ♫

217
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,550
♫  Even I erase myself  ♫ 
 ♫  until it becomes transparent  ♫

218
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,460
♫  (more changing my all)  ♫

219
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,990
♫  you, like the sun  ♫

220
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,792
