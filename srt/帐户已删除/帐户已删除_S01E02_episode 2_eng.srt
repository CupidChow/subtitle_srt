1
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,647
 What do I do? 

2
00:00:15,647 --> 00:00:17,584
 What should I say? 

3
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,254
 How to not talk not awkwardly on the first day. 

4
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:23,398
 If it's too hard, make sure to keep a smile on your face while talking. 

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,776
 No one hates a smiley face. 

6
00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:30,239
Hmmm.

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,806
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,648
Wow!

9
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:42,083
Oh, that's why...

10
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,216
Are you...

11
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,190
Never mind.

12
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,915
 I'm screwed. 

13
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:08,526
 It's over. 

14
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,614
 User Not Found 

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,992
So typical.

16
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,493
Don't worry, Min Jae.

17
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,936
That's just how Yi Joon is.

18
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:19,771
Ugh, that punk.

19
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,206
Ugh!

20
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll apologize on his behalf.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,376
- I'm taking off. 
 - See you.

22
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,508
That's Yi Joon's cousin, Hye Joon.

23
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,035
Shin Hye Joon, Shin Yi Joon.

24
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:34,803
But they're totally different.

25
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,248
Hye Joon is the class president.

26
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:39,433
He has good grades

27
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,476
and is just so different from other boys.

28
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,669
Eww.

29
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,480
He's kind and has good manners.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,649
 He's like a character straight out of some teen movie. 

31
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,320
You all didn't forget that the Korean language assignment is due tomorrow, right?

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,671
- Ugh! 
 - Shoot!

33
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:55,848
I thought some of you might have forgotten.

34
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:58,492
I'll mention it again in a group chat later tonight.

35
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,730
Don't forget to check the timetable.

36
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,623
The timetable.

37
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:20,091
Hey, Min Jae Did you get "Oneulhaggyo" downloaded on your phone? 
  (Oneulhaggyo - a student schedule and assistance app.) 

38
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:21,875
Oh, yes! This one?

39
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,769
 Oneulhaggyo 

40
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,922
Yeah, that one.

41
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,776
Everyone in our school uses it.

42
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:34,528
If you type your school and class here...

43
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,228
Ta-da!

44
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,412
The timetable shows automatically.

45
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,473
 Woojung High School 
 Timetable 

46
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:46,258
It updates itself automatically, so just check the timetable on this app.

47
00:02:46,258 --> 00:02:48,126
When it comes to school lunch...

48
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,062
Hye Joon! Hurry up!

49
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:54,857
I'll tell her the rest.

50
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:57,052
- Will you?
 - Yes.

51
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,594
Thanks.

52
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,558
You can check the lunch menu here as well.

53
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,620
Wednesday menus are usually the best. 
  Lunch Menu 

54
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,880
Oh? What is that? 
  New Message 

55
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,357
Oh It's an anonymous forum.

56
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,068
Everything comes up here in real-time.

57
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,694
Really?

58
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,421
You forgot your book again?

59
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,185
He's...

60
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,603
By the way,

61
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,423
are you really into Yi Joon?

62
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:53,582
What?

63
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:54,818
Never mind.

64
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,154
Anyway, he is the opposite.

65
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,640
He dated senior girls.

66
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,116
They say he's better now,

67
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,368
but his personality used to be...

68
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,711
I mean, even now,

69
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,804
he always looks like this.

70
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:09,833
Hye Joon always takes care of his mess.

71
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,777
Poor Hye Joon.

72
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:12,836
Ugh!

73
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,156
Although they're family, they're just so different.

74
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,424
I don't know how they hang out together.

75
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,511
Anyway,

76
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,888
I know you're good, Min Jae,

77
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,347
but it won't be easy to deal with Yi Joon.

78
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,279
 I used to hate classes 
   

79
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,131
 where we had to move classrooms. 

80
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,034
 Like a kid who is left alone 

81
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,912
 and trying so hard to survive in a musical chair game. 

82
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,580
Hey, Min Jae!

83
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,956
Come sit with us

84
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,001
I saved you a seat

85
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,044
For me?

86
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,528
Here!

87
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,407
Oh?

88
00:04:58,407 --> 00:04:59,899
Hi!

89
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,971
You're friends with Han Ji Wan.

90
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,565
That means we're friends, too.

91
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,277
Oh,

92
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,715
I can read the room.

93
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:16,617
Let me find you two seats so you can sit together.

94
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,026
Everyone has their assigned seat!

95
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,036
Go sit down! Go sit down!

96
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:22,712
- Sorry, ma'am. 
 - Go sit down!

97
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:23,865
There are musical notes.

98
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,870
There are dynamics, tempo, etc.

99
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,014
But these four are

100
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,374
the key points

101
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,625
-  So awkward.  
 - So make sure

102
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,752
to remember them.

103
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,325
Let's have a look at rhythm.

104
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:40,775
Rhythm is a regular.

105
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:43,277
-  See?  
 - or an irregular flow of musical notes

106
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,604
-  You guys are destined.  
 - We'll have a look at this

107
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:47,497
in Mozart's symphony.

108
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:48,890
Also, a melody is...

109
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,557
- Seong Su. 
 - Yes!

110
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:52,978
It's only been a minute, and you can't stay focused already?

111
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:53,837
Sorry.

112
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:55,652
- Focus! 
 - Yes, ma'am.

113
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:58,083
 - To someone like Ji Wan,  
 - Rhythm, a melody, tempo, and dynamics

114
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,050
 That's just how Yi Joon is. 

115
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,220
 You were aiming at me, weren't you? 

116
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,638
 Ugh, Kim Seong Su! 

117
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:06,599
 No, I wasn't. 

118
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,536
 Hey, Min Jae. 

119
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,996
 Let me introduce you to my friends. 

120
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,165
 even this kind of situation... 

121
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,061
 Huh? 

122
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,429
 We'll get close and all eventually 

123
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:48,240
 since we're in the same friends group. 

124
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,409
This part.

125
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:58,435
Let's have a look at rhythm.

126
00:06:58,435 --> 00:06:59,377
Yi Joon...

127
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,923
Rhythm is a regular or irregular flow of musical notes.

128
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:07,169
We'll have a look at this in Mozart's symphony.

129
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:08,507
Also, a melody is

130
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:13,525
a flow in which the pitch of a note matches its rhythm.

131
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:16,336
We'll have a look at it in Mozart's symphony as well.

132
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:19,648
Music tempo means how fast the music is.

133
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:23,108
When it comes to this Mozart's symphony...

134
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,847
The new girl in class 7, right?

135
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,573
Earlier with Yi Joon...

136
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:32,117
I heard she was hitting on him.

137
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,188
Are you adjusting to the new school and all?

138
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:45,131
Everyone is so nice to me.

139
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,317
Right.

140
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:49,343
Every one of my students is good and kind.

141
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,184
By the way, your hair...

142
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,310
 Oh, no! 

143
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,803
 It's my first time dyeing my hair. 

144
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:02,674
Right, it's brown in the picture, too.

145
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:04,594
I remember it now. You were a trainee at an agency.

146
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:06,819
Your dad told me.

147
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,530
 Does he know my dad? 

148
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,865
Wow!

149
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,725
Different! Different!

150
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:12,951
Pretty!

151
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,660
So cool!

152
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,748
Hey, Min Jae, if you get to be on TV, you have to come see me.

153
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,007
Promise me?

154
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:21,935
Sorry?

155
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:25,130
Anyway, I asked to see you

156
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,439
to tell you

157
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,467
that we'll have one more new classmate.

158
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,969
 It should be easy to become friends 

159
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,780
-  since we both are new.  
 - Help her out like how the others did.

160
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,323
As both of you are new,

161
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:37,374
it'll be easier to get close to one another.

162
00:08:37,374 --> 00:08:39,085
Okay.

163
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,337
Let's see.

164
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:43,522
Not this one.

165
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,317
Hey, Seok Jin.

166
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,236
Wow, you're so fast! Where are you going?

167
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,182
 Huh? 

168
00:08:52,182 --> 00:08:54,317
 This... 
   

169
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:56,212
 Wait a minute. 
   

170
00:08:56,212 --> 00:08:58,204
 She has the same name? 

171
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,622
Sir! I'm Ji Hoo!!

172
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,374
Are you prosopagnosic or something?

173
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,194
Prosopagnosic? Hey, you think I'm your uncle or something?

174
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:05,587
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,222
 I'm not Ji Hoo, I'm Seok Jin. 

176
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:10,915
 It's because you two look alike.

 Oh! Is she the one they were talking about last week? 

181
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:24,890
 Everyone has got me mixed up with the other Min Jae? 

182
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,733
Oh, wow! You two have the same name.

183
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,779

 I think so.

00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:41,299
 Oh! Is she the one kids were talking about last week?

 Really?

00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,687
 But... 

201
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,313
 She's quite ordinary. 

202
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,882
 Did you see how she got the drop on us? 

203
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,407
 Hi, I'm Yu Min Jae. 

204
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,412
 Wow, that's sick. 

205
00:11:04,412 --> 00:11:05,899
 I see it now. 

206
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,208
 Were you really expelled from the last school? 

207
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,294
 Yes. 

208
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,572
 So... Sorry. 

209
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,158
 Why things were so different all of a sudden. 

210
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:16,651
 How these things could happen to me 

211
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:19,094
 for the first time. 

212
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,085
Did you see the new girl?

213
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,519
I heard she's super pretty.

214
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,897
I haven't seen her.

215
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,940
The one who got expelled from some school in Seoul?

216
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,483
Seems she's kind, unlike what everyone said.

My friend is in class 7,

218
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,487
and she said she shared some food and all.

219
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,780
 Yeah. 

220
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,999
 It wasn't me. 

221
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,576
 How are you adjusting to the new school and everything? 

222
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,053
 Everyone is so nice to me. 

223
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,456
 We'll have one more new classmate. 

224
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,775
 She was a trainee? I heard she's super pretty. 

225
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,427
 Everyone thought 

226
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:52,961
 I was this girl. 

227
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:56,064
 - Min Jae. 
 - Min Jae. 
 - Min Jae. 

228
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:58,635
 Why did you pretend to be her? 

229
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,094
 Such an imposter. 

230
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,180
 What a lie. 

231
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,798
 You stole someone else's life. 

232
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:05,099
 Why would we have been nice to you? 

233
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,410
 if it had not been for that. You're nothing. 

234
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,270
 You played along, didn't you? 

235
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,605
 Goosebumps (cheesy or creepy). 

236
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,940
 Fake Yu Min Jae. 

237
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,476
That's you.

238
00:12:31,476 --> 00:12:33,310
Yu Min Jae.

239
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,590
 Ji Wan: Hey, Min Jae. 

240
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:40,318
 Is my friend feeling any better? 

241
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:42,220
 My friend? 

242
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,864
 It looks like we like the same things! 

243
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,860
 Twinsies. 

244
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,434
 Right! 

245
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,412
 That's something I've been using. 

246
00:12:51,412 --> 00:12:54,507
 I didn't mean to lie. 

247
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,234
 They just had me mixed up with her. 

248
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,200
Hello.

249
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,576
It was so sudden earlier.

250
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:09,546
Yeah. Hi.

251
00:13:09,546 --> 00:13:11,165
Since when were you here?

252
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,110
The other day in the teacher's room, the teacher said

253
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,545
the new girl

254
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,088
got good grades

255
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,006
and was pretty.

256
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:22,060
But something happened,

257
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,678
and that's why she was transferring to our school.

258
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,966
He wouldn't tell me about what happened, though.

259
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:31,018
It got me curious.

260
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,323
Can you tell me what it is?

261
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:39,318
I can't sleep at night when I'm curious about something.

262
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,512
What?

263
00:13:42,512 --> 00:13:43,972
Why?

264
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,283
Isn't that about you?

265
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,788
Say something.

266
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,459
What do you mean?

267
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:02,858
You're not...

268
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,613
Yu Min Jae.

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:18,880

273
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,535
 Min Jae and Yi Joon, you two planned to meet up on the sly, didn't you? 

274
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,195
 - I'm sorry. 
 - It's not your fault. 

275
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,414
 It's not your fault. Also, it's not like you're not Yu Min Jae. 

276
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,941
 Can you keep the promise? 

277
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,585
 There is one more new girl in our class. 

278
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,337
 Hello, I'm Yu Min Jae. 

279
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,713
 Let's give them nicknames. 

280
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,090
 Popular Min Jae. 

281
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,341
 Outcast Min Jae. 

282
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,426
 So make sure 
   
   

283
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,880
to remember them.

284
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,920
Hey, Yi Joon.

285
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,004
Let's have a look at rhythm. Rhythm is a regular

286
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:55,853
or an irregular flow of musical notes.

287
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,816
We'll have a look at this in Mozart's symphony.

288
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,451
Also, a melody is

289
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:06,364
a flow in which the pitch of a note matches its rhythm.

290
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,367
We'll have a look at it in Mozart's symphony as well.

291
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,730
Music tempo

292
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,483
means how fast the music is.

293
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:16,874
In this symphony, andante's mainly used.

294
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:21,302
We'll see where he used it later.

295
00:15:21,302 --> 00:15:26,990
And lastly, the symphony...

296
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,410
there, the piano...
