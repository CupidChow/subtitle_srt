1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:02,694
Then,

2
00:00:02,694 --> 00:00:05,363
you can go tell them now.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,012
I can't.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,791
Can't you let me do it?

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,498
You don't need it anyway.

6
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,984
Friends,

7
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:29,727
your story and attention.

8
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,867
I don't know what happened,

9
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,045
but didn't you want to change just like me?

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,332
You didn't want other kids' attention.

11
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,217
You didn't want anything.

12
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:44,602
That's why you showed up like this.

13
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,450
 Wow! I had a really hard time because of this! 

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,542
If that's the case…

15
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,918
If that's really the case,

16
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:04,489
let me do it.

17
00:01:07,342 --> 00:01:09,094
You can say that I have no pride

18
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:11,889
and that I've gone crazy.

19
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:13,474
But

20
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:16,409
I was so happy the past three days

21
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,762
living as you.

22
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:21,023
I wasn't that invisible kid

23
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:24,250
that nobody knew or cared for.

24
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,460
For the first time,

25
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,321
I got to live as Yu Min Jae.

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,609
Even though it was all because of you.

27
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:35,170
Still,

28
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,097
other kids,

29
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,624
my friends…

30
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:39,933
If they start to hate me—

31
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,251
Yes.

32
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:43,098
That's because it's your first time.

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,023
What will change?

34
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,676
If I accept their friend requests,

35
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,995
they will all see my pictures

36
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:56,607
Are you okay with that?

37
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,052
Friends?

38
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,730
Other kids?

39
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,873
It'll only take a second for them to turn their backs on you.

40
00:02:04,873 --> 00:02:06,860
Get it together!

41
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,800


42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,309
 Then what should I do? 

43
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:18,454
 There's nothing I can do. 

44
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,003
 User Not Found 

45
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:29,998
Oh? It's Yu Min Jae.

46
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:32,486
You looked up as soon as I said Yu Min Jae's name.

47
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,904
I just looked up.

48
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,530
No way.

49
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,694
Do you really like her?

50
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,499
What are you talking about?

51
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,566
Right?

52
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:50,003
So why does Kim Seong Su keep saying that nonsense?

53
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,197
He said he had a hunch.

54
00:02:52,197 --> 00:02:56,285
Like how Yu Min Jae suddenly held you that day,

55
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:58,427
he said you two will become an item.

56
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,510
Of course, I put money on that never happening.

57
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,528
I'm right, right?

58
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,139
That's not going to happen, no?

59
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,198
I have no interest...

60
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,743
in attention-seekers like her.

61
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:24,938
Hey!

62
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,448
What are you guys talking about?

63
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:28,133
Something secretive?

64
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,227
Are you curious? Do you want me to tell you?

65
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:31,903
Yes, tell me!

66
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:34,155
Rumors about Yi Joon and Yu Min Jae.

67
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:36,241
I asked if they were true.

68
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:38,492
Oh, that?

69
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,429
But Yi Joon,

70
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,097
do you really like Min Jae?

71
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,594
If you're going to keep talking nonsense, I'm going to leave first.

72
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,546
Okay, I'm sorry.

73
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:51,815
If Yi Joon says no, then it's no.

74
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,176
Oh, right! What are you guys doing today?

75
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:56,653
We're thinking about holding a welcome party for Min Jae after school.

76
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,471
You're coming, right?

77
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,469
Who knows?

78
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:06,246
Maybe if you two become real friends like us, those rumors might disappear.

79
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,906
I'll attend for sure!

80
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:11,652
Yi Joon will come if I say I'm going.

81
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:15,004
He's not saying anything now because he's embarrassed.

82
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,965
You're crazy.

83
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,511
Hey, wait for me.

84
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,787
I'll tell them.

85
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:25,623
No, I won't.

86
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:27,441
I'll tell them.

87
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:29,102
No, I won't.

88
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,470
I'll…

89
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,697
I'll…

90
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,818
Well…

91
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,237
Maybe they might actually not hate me.

92
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,363
 Lo-Min? 

93
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,190
 Pop-Min Jae. 

94
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,585
 Lo-Min Jae. 

95
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,495
 No-Min Jae Because she has no presence. 

96
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,330
 Do you want to eat this with me? 

97
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,248
 Oh, no thanks. You eat it. 

98
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,994
I should tell them the truth.

99
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:00,650
 All got time after school?? 
 There's a party for Min Jae at a karaoke! 

100
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,451
Karaoke?

101
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,097
 It was my dream to go there 

102
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,558
 with my friends. 

103
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,143
 Just this once. 

104
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,561
 It should be fine if I tell them the truth 

105
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,863
 after the party, right? 

106
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,973
Yu Min Jae's welcome party will be at a karaoke.

107
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:24,657
You're going, right?

108
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,840
 Damn it, that's so embarrassing. 

109
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,147
Why?

110
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,921
Nothing.

111
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,231
What?

112
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,190
I can't hear you.

113
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,853
It's a welcome party for Yu Min Jae.

114
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,740
So isn't Yu Min Jae going to sing?

115
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,736
 I've never been to karaoke before. 

116
00:06:34,736 --> 00:06:37,455
 What should I sing? 

117
00:06:37,455 --> 00:06:39,631
How about you?

118
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:41,343
You never sing either.

119
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:42,652
That's right!

120
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,547
I've never heard Yi Joon sing before.

121
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,098
I'm curious.

122
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:49,559
You have such a nice voice, so you must be a good singer.

123
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,235
Sing for us.

124
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:52,704
Sin Yi Joon, will he sing?

125
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,332
Will he?

126
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,883
Shin Yi Joon!

127
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,402
- Shin Yi Joon! 
 - I won't sing

128
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:01,287
in front of other people.

129
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,209
How cold.

130
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,129
Still?

131
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,836
Yu Min Jae.

132
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,729
What are you going to sing?

133
00:07:19,382 --> 00:07:22,909
 What song do I have sing to not kill the mood? 

134
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,411
 Gosh… I don't have a clue. 

135
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:28,014
 I've only heard of K-pop stars' names. 

136
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,199
 It'll be game over 

137
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,118
 if I could show them a perfect dance. 

138
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,496
Now, next up is our Yu Min Jae's…

139
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,665
Let's listen to Min Jae's song!

140
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,724
Min Jae, what are you going to sing?

141
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:42,408
Yu Min Jae! Yu Min Jae!

142
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:44,568
Yu Min Jae!

143
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,841
 After all… 

144
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,484
 Yes… 

145
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,905
 This is my last chance. 

146
00:07:57,252 --> 00:07:59,361
 I'll just sing the song I know. 

147
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,273
 The ending song 

148
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,300
 of my life is…! 

149
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,642
♪ I know I wouldn't ♪

150
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:16,145
♪ fit in your world ♪

151
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:24,954
♪ But I belong to me ♪

152
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:33,830
♪ I want to fly freely ♪

153
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,939
♪ like a bird towards that sky ♪

154
00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:39,853
♪ towards that star ♪

155
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:51,569
♪ I belong to me ♪

156
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,418
 Why 

157
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,886
 is no one talking? 

158
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,636
Wow, Min Jae that was awesome!

159
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,197
I got goosebumps.

160
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:16,347
- Wow You're such a pro! 
  - What's going on? 

161
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,406
I thought I was at a concert.

162
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:19,566
-  Was I pretty good?  
 - I've never heard this before.

163
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,590
Me neither.

164
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,385
Um, I'll use the restroom.

165
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:30,194
Who'll sing next?

166
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,140
Where are you going?

167
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,366
Get me a soda.

168
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,815
 Oh! 

169
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,608
 What is he doing out? 

170
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:46,001
 It's awkward, so I should hurry— 

171
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,200
Here.

172
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,685
Oh,

173
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,938
thank you.

174
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,266
I enjoyed your song.

175
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,576
Huh?

176
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,996
That was a first.

177
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,751
Oh!

178
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:11,493
Thank you.

179
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,258
I saw that movie too.

180
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:17,267
You know, The Perks of…

181
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,144
You watched that too?

182
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:20,962
I love that movie too.

183
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:22,413
It was originally a musical—

184
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,906
No.

185
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,459
I just happened to see it a while ago.

186
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,130
Anyway…

187
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,400
You did well!

188
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,254
I really thought hard about what to sing.

189
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:06,357
Actually, I don't know any popular songs these days.

190
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:10,794
It's my first time coming to karaoke with close friends like you.

191
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,941
 I shouldn't have said that. 

192
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,411
Should we go back in?

193
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,721
They must be thirsty.

194
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,030
Sure.

195
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,891
Oh, and…

196
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,185
We just look like we're close.

197
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,123
But we're not actually close.

198
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,238
 Today… 

199
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,698
 I must tell them the truth, right? 

200
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,612
 I hope that this moment and today 

201
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,748
 go on forever. 

202
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:53,670
 Today must be just another day for him, right? 

203
00:11:56,908 --> 00:11:58,108
Um…

204
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,645
Shin Yi Joon.

205
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:03,481
What's your favorite song?

206
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:05,333
Me?

207
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,502
I was just curious.

208
00:12:07,502 --> 00:12:09,337
I wanted to know

209
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,680
what kind of song you'd sing.

210
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,603
Maybe you could show me…

211
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:26,604
 But 

212
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:28,815
 that'll never happen. 

213
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,866
 When you guys learn the truth, 

214
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:33,570
 you will no longer be friends with me. 

215
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,545
Oh?

216
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,172
Min Jae accepted my friend request.

217
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,205
I'll post the photos we took earlier.

218
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:39,842
-  She accepted it?  
 - Yes, me too!

219
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,619
But Min Jae's account…

220
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:43,470
It's quite interesting.

221
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,507
What's Min Jae's account ID?

222
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,323
What... do you mean?

223
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:51,062
 If I accept their friend requests, 

224
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,231
 they will all see my pictures. 

225
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,183
 Are you okay with that? 

226
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,328
 Yu Min Jae. 

227
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,897
 What are you thinking? 

228
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,882
