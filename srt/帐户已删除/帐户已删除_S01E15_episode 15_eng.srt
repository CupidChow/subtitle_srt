1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,200
Um... Tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes)?

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,600
Tteokbokki sounds good.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,900
Malatang (hot spicy soup) also sounds good.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,300
Then let's eat that.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,400
Ji Wan, why didn't you answer my call?

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,800
What?

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,000
Sorry.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,000
I've really reflected on what I did.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,100
That's why I've been waiting for you.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,700
Hye Joon, what are you talking about?

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,700
What are you saying all of a sudden?

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:52,350


13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,500
Da Ye.

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,700
Yeah?

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,300
Can I talk to her alone for a second?

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,300
Oh, Th-Then...

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,000
Ji Wan, I'll be going first.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,600
It seems like you two have something to talk about.

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,800
 @User Not Found 

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,300
Why are you going this far?

21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,200
You know how Da Ye feels about you.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,700
Knowingly doing this to me is too mean.

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,400
I just did what you did.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,300
What?

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,100
You also know how Da Ye feels.

26
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,600
And that's why you used her feelings.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,700
Knowingly doing that was too mean.

28
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,600
I don't want to fight you like this.

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,900
We're friends, right Hye Joon?

30
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,340
Besides, you also know how Shin Yi Joon feels.

31
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,100
If I do this, isn't it better for you?

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,700
This is your chance.

33
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,100
Of course, we're friends.

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,400
Ji Wan, speaking of which,

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,500
do you want to know a secret?

36
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,000
What?

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,300
No one else knows about this but me.

38
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,600
Someone in our class was very different in the past.

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,900
She used to be the so-called loser.

40
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,600
But she doesn't look like that at all now.

41
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,900
You're curious as to who she is too, right?

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,200
 Anonymous 1: Did you see this? 

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,600
 Anonymous 2: Jeez, this is crazy 

44
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,400
- Did you see this? 
 - Who is this?

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,500
 Anonymous 1: What's wrong with her?  
 Even I'm embarrassed.

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,600
 Anonymous 2: Is this for real?  
 So shameless.

47
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,000
I could never have imagined this.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,300
 An old picture of the prettiest girl from 7th class of 1st year. Haha.  
 I want to unsee that.

49
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,700
Wow, I'm just baffled.

50
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,200
Now, time to play dodgeball!

51
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,200
 Here it goes again. 

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,840
 These attacks with no particular reason keep following me. 

53
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,600
How did he do that?

54
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,600
Hye Joon's so awesome!

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,700
I agree.

56
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,900
- Are you alright? 
 - Yeah.

57
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,300
Maybe Yu Min Jae really has something with Shin Hye Joon, just like the rumors say.

58
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,500
She's so over the top.

59
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,400
 Why is this happening? 

60
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,400
 What did I do so wrong? 

61
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,000
 Hey, stop. 

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
 They're just coming up with reasons to hate you. 

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,900
 So stop looking for your own shortcomings. 

64
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,600
 What's important is you, 

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,800
 not somebody else. 

66
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,000
Here.

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,100
 I will no longer 

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,900
 think to myself and hurt myself. 

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh no.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,500
- What the! 
 - What was that?

71
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,800
Shin Hye Joon can't get out so soon.

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,900
We no longer have our ace!

73
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,780
What should we do? He's our team ace.

74
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,800
Really?

75
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
- How can we play without him? 
 - Exactly.

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Hey, pass it to me.

77
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,100
 If I just stay still and do nothing, nothing will change. 

78
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,700
- Hurry. 
 - Pass me the ball.

79
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,300
- She can't just pass the ball like that. 
 -  Ji Wan. 

80
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,500
Hey, what are you doing?

81
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,500
 I don't care what you say. 

82
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,300
 Just please tell me your story. 

83
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
What was that?

84
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,500
- What did she just do? 
 - Wow!

85
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Min Jae.

86
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,600
Is she a sports student?

87
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,700
Is she a professional athlete?

88
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,200
I don't think so.

89
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:12,100
I don't know about that, but that was awesome.

90
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,200
What?

91
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,300
Min Jae!

92
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,400
- That pass must have been a mistake. 
 - What did I just see?

93
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,500
 Good job! 

94
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,100
That was awesome. So fascinating.

95
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,200
- That was crazy. 
 - Wow!

96
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,900
- Did you see this? 
 - Jeez.

97
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,400
She looks so different.

98
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,800
Are you sure this is the same person?

99
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,100
Is this for real?

100
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,700
Min Jae, did you...

101
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,300
What is it?

102
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,600
It's nothing.

103
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,600
Then why are you hiding it?

104
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,800
Guess you don't know what's happening now, but you've gone viral on the Anonymous Community.

105
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,500
 Anonymous Community 
 The prettiest girl in classroom 7...She looks totally different. It's Han Ji Wan. 

106
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,400
 The secrets I've been guarding with my life 

107
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,200
 got exposed all at once. 

108
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,800
 And of all things, it was revealed in front of you 

109
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,800
 by none other than you. 

110
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,700
 Do you want to know a secret? 

111
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,800
 Someone in our class was very different in the past. 

112
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,200
 You're curious as to who she is too, right? 

113
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,700
 Now you finally look like you... 

114
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,800
 from your Haejin Middle School days. 

115
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,200
 Han Ji Wan 

116
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,900
 So what? 

117
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,600
 Try telling people. 

118
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
 No one is going to believe you. 

119
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,400
 This photo is all I need to make them believe. 

120
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,100
 Did you always know about this? 

121
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,800
 About what? 

122
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800
 Why are you going this far? 

123
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,600
 Like you said, I'm also your friend. 

124
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,500
 So why are you doing this to me? 

125
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,500
 The one who's being mean is you. 

126
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,500
 Since when were you all so close to Yu Min Jae? 

127
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,400
 I was your friend... before her. 

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,500
 Hello, I'm Yu Min Jae. 

129
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,200
 Min Jae, that was awesome. 

130
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
 I got goosebumps. 

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,700
 We have to take the same bus. 

132
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,100
 It looks so good on you. 

133
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,200
 Min Jae, can you... 

134
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,700
 Why does everyone like what you do? 

135
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
 Is it because you were always popular? 

136
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,500
 When I did it... 

137
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
 Come here. 

138
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,900
 I'll draw eyeliner for you. 

139
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
 Come over here. 

140
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,500
 Stay still. 

141
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,600
 You look much better. Lift your head. 

142
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,300
 Everyone... 

143
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
 hated me. 

144
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,700
 I knew this would happen. 

145
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,100
 I'm the idiot for thinking of you as my friends. 

146
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,600
 I used to think you were so different from me. 

147
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,400
 But for some reason, 

148
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,300
 I was able to get my courage up that day. 

149
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,500
 Do you need this? 

150
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,100
 It looks like you need that more than me. 

151
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,200
 No one will like you the way you are now. 

152
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,100
 You need 

153
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,000
 to have something to offer 

154
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,700
 for someone to consider you as their friend, 

155
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,400
 whether it be grades, looks or personality. 

156
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,300
 Even if you can't become number one. 

157
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,300
 Though there are some people everyone wants to make friends with even if they don't do anything. 

158
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,000
 I wonder if you even remember that day. 

159
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,200
 Hi! 

160
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,600
 Hi. 

161
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,500
 You know my name, right? 

162
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,000
 He's Shin Yi Joon. 

163
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,800
 Hi. 

164
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,000
 Hey there. 

165
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,900
 - Let's go to the cafeteria. 
 - Okay. 

166
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,100
 Do you want to come too? 

167
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,900
 Maybe it's because I became 

168
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,200
 number one like you said. 

169
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,700
 Sure! 

170
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,000
 Let's go. 

171
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,600
 You were so nice to me... 

172
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,100
 before Yu Min Jae showed up. 

173
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,800
 What? 

174
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,500
 Crazy bastard. 

175
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:33,300
 So why did we all turn out like this? 

176
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,900
