1
00:00:00,301 --> 00:00:03,377
Why are you bothering me again? What if someone sees us?

2
00:00:03,377 --> 00:00:06,756
That's why I called you here. There should be no one.

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,576
Hide, hide, hide.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,313
You're so mean, you lead me on.

5
00:00:16,313 --> 00:00:18,101
Hey, what kind of a relationship—

6
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,620
I never said yes.

7
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,967
They were right.

8
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,155
You are the worst.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:45,000


10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,580
- Me? 
 - Go. Go.

11
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:15,558
I just came here.

12
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:17,934
Since when were you watching?

13
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:19,754
I saw nothing!

14
00:01:42,628 --> 00:01:44,520
It's not like that.

15
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,669
 User Not Found 

16
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:16,819
There! One more.

17
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,672
We all have 'J's in our name.

18
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:19,764
How about me?

19
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,832
Your nickname is Da Yejji, so J from Jji.

20
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:24,927
- Cute. 
 - Cute.

21
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:29,488
Should we get accessories or friendship rings with this sometime?

22
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:32,410
Our name is this now since there are four of us.

23
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,288
I have to change the name on my phone.

24
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:39,190
So, now that we're in the same group,

25
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,295
can I ask you something, Min Jae?

26
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:45,097
Sure, shoot! What is it?

27
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:49,500
I don't mean to be nosy, but I've heard you used to be a trainee.

28
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,988
You're a good singer and all.

29
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,049
But why did you quit?

30
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,509
Right, I was curious, too.

31
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,626
- It's a good opportunity. 
 - Right.

32
00:02:57,626 --> 00:03:00,996
You were a trainee?

33
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:04,693
Which agency was it?

34
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:07,335
- So curious! 
 - Tell us.

35
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,530
Well...

36
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,899
The thing is...

37
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:12,867
It's...

38
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:25,771
It's okay. You don't have to tell us if you don't want to.

39
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,735
Sorry for asking. It could be something difficult to share.

40
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:36,298
 I ruined the atmosphere. 

41
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:38,627
You all know it's due today, right?

42
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:40,078
Shoot, I forgot.

43
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:41,455
I forgot to do it.

44
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,047
- Did you do it? 
 - Hey, let's do it together.

45
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:44,192
Sure, let's do it together.

46
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:46,152
Is it due tomorrow?

47
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:09,423
I've done a good job, right?

48
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:14,863
By the way, even when it's an emergency, do I still need your permission?

49
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:17,531
Of course.

50
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,652
Anyway,

51
00:04:20,652 --> 00:04:23,611
I mean, if I don't tell them,

52
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:28,258
they will think I'm keeping a secret from them

53
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:30,045
and not opening up.

54
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:32,371
You really think...

55
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,902
 she's your friend? 

56
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,215
 Min Jae, 

57
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,553
 I know she is not. 

58
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,290
 I've been there and done that. 

59
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,102
Min Jae?

60
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:09,256
 Alright. I'll just keep it to myself for now. 

61
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:10,585
Never mind.

62
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:12,186
Anyway,

63
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:16,192
being nosy and trying to dig up a secret you might want to hide.

64
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:18,517
What kind of a friend is that?

65
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:22,178
Hey, that's an exaggeration.

66
00:05:22,178 --> 00:05:24,698
Also, aren't you supposed to

67
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:29,501
share secrets with your friends?

68
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,565
I've never done it before, though.

69
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,543
If she was your real friend

70
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,763
she would have waited

71
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:45,983
until you were ready to talk about it and rely on her.

72
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:59,859
♪ I don't fit in your world ♪

73
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,765
♪ The next! ♪

74
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:02,587
♪ Level! ♪

75
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:05,364
How did it go?

76
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,151
 He definitely saw me. 

77
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:21,150
 He's pretending he didn't see me. 

78
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,343
Hey!

79
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:48,258
Oh! I usually dress more neatly—

80
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:49,892
Hey!

81
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,867
 I thought we were getting closer. 

82
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,992
Yu Min Jae.

83
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,636
Yeah?

84
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:18,250
You didn't tell anyone, right?

85
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,939
Sorry?

86
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,326
The other night.

87
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:30,860
 You are the worst. 

88
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:41,226
No, I didn't.

89
00:07:41,226 --> 00:07:45,445
Don't tell anybody... that you saw me today.

90
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:47,032
Why?

91
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:59,576
Can you even hear me?

92
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:07,704
Oh, the thing is...

93
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,589
So did you...

94
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,457
Oh, on my first day as well!

95
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,702
You were ignoring what I was saying and just listening to music instead?

96
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,831
I didn't hear it.

97
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,629
No, I mean— Well...

98
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:34,185
I didn't know what to say if you talked to me.

99
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,083
Huh?

100
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:43,556
It takes a while for me to open up.

101
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,185
You?

102
00:08:48,185 --> 00:08:50,388
I mean it.

103
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:55,632
On top of that, at first, you went around like this.

104
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:57,153
I did?

105
00:08:57,153 --> 00:09:01,079
You made your delivery girl on your first day too.

106
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:03,834
I did?

107
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:08,253
You were like, "Sorry," after you tripped her.

108
00:09:08,253 --> 00:09:10,399
When did I...?

109
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,559
So,

110
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:17,404
I thought you were scary.

111
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:19,008
Me? Scary?

112
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:22,145
But you, of all people, thought

113
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:24,154
I was scary?

114
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:32,560
While we're at it, you were like, "I never said yes."

115
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,410
It's hard for me to say no.

116
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,525
You too?

117
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,986
Me too.

118
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:54,950
How about that time at the karaoke?

119
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,795
Never mind. Let's go.

120
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:10,159
Where were you going?

121
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,736
I just came out for a walk.

122
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,144
Min Jae! Let's go.

123
00:10:29,144 --> 00:10:30,296
 I don't hate 

124
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:32,773
 PE classes now. 

125
00:10:32,773 --> 00:10:34,059
 Because I'm no longer alone. 

126
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:37,040
Okay, I just have to tie my shoe.

127
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:49,422
What's up?

128
00:10:49,422 --> 00:10:51,250
Let's go.

129
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,279
- It's so cute. 
 - I know, right?

130
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,372
Did you get it recently?

131
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:03,011
You've got new shoes, right?

132
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:05,655
Yes.

133
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,542
So cute.

134
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,002
Of course, you have good taste!

135
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,745
I've wanted to get them as well.

136
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:15,235
 - We have the same taste!  
 - So cute.

137
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:17,210
 Having browsed online 

138
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,370
 to study fashion paid off.  
 - Cool.

139
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,522
How much did you pay? Pricey, right?

140
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:22,598
Sorry?

141
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,942
I've wanted to get them, but they're too expensive.

142
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,520
 Huh? What's going on? 

143
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,546
Hard to get your hands on them as well.

144
00:11:28,546 --> 00:11:29,714
So cool.

145
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:33,226
 They were not that expensive. 

146
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,643
A part-time job?

147
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:37,313
Or did your parents buy them for you?

148
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:39,832
- So jealous. 
 - So jealous.

149
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,243
What's the name of this brand?

150
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:44,681
Oh, I can't remember the name suddenly.

151
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:45,747
What's it?

152
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,048
Mackie Mackie.

153
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:50,417
Right! It's their new product, right?

154
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,219
No, it isn't.

155
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:55,179
Huh? Then?

156
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:58,007
What? A knock-off?

157
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:01,136
No way.

158
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,206
Sorry.

159
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,161
 What do I do? 

160
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,230
 I didn't know. 

161
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,990
 There was such a brand? 

162
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,547
 I didn't even know. 

163
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:46,376
We've got the same shoes.

164
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,084
It doesn't feel good to find out

165
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:59,243
 that you have a secret I don't know about, 

166
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:03,497
 because it means I'm bothering you like that time. 

167
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,840
Couples (matching) shoes?

168
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,984
You two have the same taste even in shoes.

169
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:17,971
Wait.

170
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:24,208
