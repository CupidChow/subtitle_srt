1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,786
What?

3
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,946
You seem to be in a good mood.

4
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:21,638
It's the same as usual.

5
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:25,709
You're lying to me these days.

6
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:28,515
I'm upset.

7
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:34,670
Shin Hye Joon.

8
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:39,505
When you say that...

9
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:42,252
I really hate it.

10
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:45,150
Really?

11
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:50,251
How upsetting.

12
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:01,690
 @User Not Found 

13
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:07,526
What's the matter?

14
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,255
Ji Wan?

15
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:13,018
- Yes. 
 - Tell me.

16
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:15,027
I'm fine.

17
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:23,109
What's the matter?

18
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:25,062
What is going on?

19
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:26,925
Min Jae.

20
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:31,195
Do you like Shin Yi Joon?

21
00:01:31,918 --> 00:01:33,334
What?

22
00:01:35,018 --> 00:01:36,445
No.

23
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:38,135
No.

24
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:40,229
Really?

25
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,751
Actually...

26
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:48,484
He asked me out.

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,107
Shin Yi Joon asked me out.

28
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:58,011
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:18,899 --> 00:02:22,043
I... I really didn't know.

30
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:24,470
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,883
I was worried

32
00:02:26,883 --> 00:02:31,886
how you might react to this situation, especially because of what I said.

33
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:35,464
But I didn't want to lie to you.

34
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:41,234
Yi Joon and

35
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:45,595
you are both very precious friends to me.

36
00:02:50,096 --> 00:02:51,899
Ji Wan.

37
00:02:56,685 --> 00:02:58,396
Really.

38
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:01,913
You really don't have to worry about me.

39
00:03:02,676 --> 00:03:05,352
Don't stress out alone.

40
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,565
And...

41
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,894
I don't like Shin Yi Joon!

42
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:16,643
Really?

43
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:20,144
Yes.

44
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:21,906
Really.

45
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:28,408
Ji Wan.

46
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,503
So,

47
00:03:29,503 --> 00:03:32,337
what are you going to do?

48
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,958
I'm going to tell him no.

49
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,603
I'm going to stay friends with him.

50
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:40,546
Right.

51
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:42,672
And you know too, right?

52
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:46,798
How he asks out all the girls around him.

53
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,259
 And you know too, right? 

54
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:03,042
 How he asks out all the girls around him. 

55
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,445
 Yeah. 

56
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,878
 That's what he does. 

57
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,472
 He only asked me if I wanted to watch a movie 

58
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:10,577
Yeah.

59
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:13,080
What male bestfriend for a person like me?

60
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,848
Male bestfriend?

61
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:23,847
No, I mean...

62
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,640
My younger sister asked me for advice about a boy.

63
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,734
I was trying to think of an answer.

64
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,887
I didn't know you had a younger sister.

65
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:32,683
I'm good at giving dating advice.

66
00:04:32,683 --> 00:04:33,863
So,

67
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:35,327
tell me.

68
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:37,654
My sister has a really close male friend.

69
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:39,573
A male friend and a

70
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:41,810
female friend who she's really close with.

71
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,327
The boy asked her girl friend out.

72
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:49,001
But after that

73
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:51,083
the boy asked my sister to the cinema,

74
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,209
just the two of them.

75
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:56,003
He's trash.

76
00:04:58,482 --> 00:05:00,855
Ah, trash.

77
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:04,423
So,

78
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:08,131
should my sister go to the cinema

79
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:10,353
with that boy?

80
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:12,772
I mean, what was he thinking

81
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:14,378
asking out that girl

82
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:16,826
and then asking my sister to go to the cinema with him?

83
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:21,047
Do you like him?

84
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:22,540
What?

85
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:24,706
Do you like him?

86
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:26,361
Shin Yi Joon.

87
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,298
What?

88
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:31,256
No!

89
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:34,260
I know everything even if you don't tell me.

90
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,545
You're so easy to read.

91
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:40,803
Your "sister" is you,

92
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:43,060
the "male friend" is Shin Yi Joon.

93
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,472
Then, your close female friend

94
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:46,224
that he asked out must beâ€”

95
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:47,933
Stop!

96
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:51,768
This is messy.

97
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,723
You have to think carefully.

98
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,811
If you're not sure of his feelings,

99
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:03,272
sometimes it's better to just pretend to be friends.

100
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,187
If you make the wrong choice,

101
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:10,655
you could lose your friend forever.

102
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,469
 Why are you doing all of this 

103
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,785
 to do Yu Min Jae a favor? 

104
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:43,227
Hey!

105
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:45,080
Won't you apologize?

106
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:48,939
What?

107
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:49,773
What?

108
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:51,538
What did you say?

109
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:54,750
What do you do with your eyes?

110
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,698
You were the one who hit me. Why do you expect me to apologize?

111
00:06:57,698 --> 00:06:59,245
Hey!

112
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:00,678
You...

113
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:03,275
What?

114
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:05,681
Should I also keep walking

115
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:07,597
without watching where I go?

116
00:07:10,022 --> 00:07:11,833
N-No.

117
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:14,808
Come on.

118
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:22,275
Whoa!

119
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:27,501
Hey!

120
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:33,038
I saw something over there.

121
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:35,555
But now it's gone.

122
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,991
You're here early.

123
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:04,485
I also got here early.

124
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:06,994
Oh!

125
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:07,990
Wow!

126
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,031
You look really nice today.

127
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:14,083
You haven't bought popcorn and soda, right?

128
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,087
I'll buy those.

129
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,169
Why?

130
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:22,427
Because it's our first time at the cinema together.

131
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:24,272
That's not what I meant.

132
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:27,486
Why are you here?

133
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:28,918
Ahhh!

134
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:31,547
Min Jae didn't tell you?

135
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:47,161
What's the matter?

136
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:52,024
What did you want to ask me that couldn't wait until tomorrow?

137
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:53,500
Min Jae.

138
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,875
Umm...

139
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,075
The thing is...

140
00:08:57,075 --> 00:09:00,065
You've dated a lot of guys, right?

141
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:02,412
Why do you ask?

142
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,910
Well. It's just,

143
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,449
you were popular,

144
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:08,926
so you must have a lot of guy friends, and

145
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:10,893
a lot of guys must've asked for your number.

146
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:12,211
And asked you out

147
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:15,273
And you've dated a lot of guys, right?

148
00:09:15,273 --> 00:09:16,352
Maybe...

149
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,024
Ten guys?

150
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,295
No, a popular girl like you

151
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:21,571
must've dated a hundred guys?

152
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:24,564
Gee. Stop teasing me.

153
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,009
Shin Yi Joon?

154
00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:30,228
What's up with the both of you?

155
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:31,538
It's him, right?

156
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,574
I knew it.

157
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:35,214
That's why you asked me to pick out your outfit yesterday.

158
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:37,417
Ah... No, no.

159
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:40,113
That's not the problem right now.

160
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,255
Then what is?

161
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:42,534
Umm...

162
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:45,908
Well, between friendship and love,

163
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:48,173
what would you choose?

164
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,884
   
 Her best friend said so. 

165
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:58,750
 - You can't believe everything they say. 
 - Girls that age... 

166
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,853
   

167
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,996
I...

168
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:13,037
Why do you ask?

169
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:15,209
What's more important to you?

170
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:37,990
   

171
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,609
 Min Jae What's this? 

172
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:49,558
 The movie is tomorrow at 7 o'clock. 

173
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:50,512
 What? 

174
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:52,395
 I'm really okay. 

175
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:56,162
 I don't want this to ruin our friendship. 

176
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:57,350
 No. 

177
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,396
 I'm sure Shin Yi Joon wants to watch it with you. 

178
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:07,387
 My two close friends dating each other would make me happy. 

179
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,801
You're a fool. You're such a pushover.

180
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:12,793
What?

181
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:15,183
I'm being the cool and good friend.

182
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:16,709
A true friend.

183
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,978
Am I not?

184
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:18,896
Cool? Cool?

185
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:20,525
What, cool?

186
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,730
Don't lie to yourself.

187
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,280
That's so not cool.

188
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,402
Ah! But, It was the right thing to do.

189
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:30,567
Hye Joon said so.

190
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:32,385
Shin Hye Joon?

191
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:42,823
So, you arranged a movie date.

192
00:11:42,823 --> 00:11:45,556
for Han Ji Wan and Shin Yi Joon?

193
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:47,068
Yes.

194
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,741
Hey.

195
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:52,200
You are the worst.

196
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,386
You knew everything and used her, didn't you?

197
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:56,056
You're really trash.

198
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:58,135
   

199
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:03,356
Caramel popcorn? Or onion flavor?

200
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,724
I'm not having any.

201
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,023
Geez... Don't eat my popcorn later.

202
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:09,856
Two colas

203
00:12:09,856 --> 00:12:12,522
and one large caramel popcorn, please.

204
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,316
What the hell?

205
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:22,771
Watching a movie just the two of you?

206
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:24,760
Min Jae.

207
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,940
Are you here to watch a movie with Shin Hye Joon?

208
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:34,243
 Why are you doing this? 

209
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:36,175
 Shin Hye Joon. 

210
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,748
 Why did you do that? 

211
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:41,778
 We'll take care of the rest. 

212
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:43,671
 You can go now. 

213
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,881
