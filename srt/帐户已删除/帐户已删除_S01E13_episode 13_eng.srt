1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,690
- Oh, really? 
 - He said so.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,430
- It really happened.
 - Ohh.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,830
Did you do the homework?

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,444
 Go! Go to the cinema. 

5
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:13,013
 Watching a movie just the two of you? 

6
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:16,574
 Min Jae. 

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:24,950


8
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,456
I'll leave now.

9
00:00:32,456 --> 00:00:34,450
Yu Min Jae.

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,961
I liked it.

11
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:51,175
Because you were there.

12
00:00:56,648 --> 00:00:58,966
 At any rate, he enjoyed it 

13
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:02,780
 because I was there at the cinema, right? 

14
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,138
All right.

15
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:07,167
Your first exams of the semester are coming up.

16
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,328
No! Why do we have to take exams?

17
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:11,638
 Oh, right. 

18
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,905
 It's exam period. 

19
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:15,583
Why do exams exist?

20
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,702
This is an important time.

21
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,829
I hope you're not having secret crushes

22
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,748
or dating each other.

23
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,380
Over here. These two are dating.

24
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:27,504
Quiet!

25
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:32,197
Guys. I've never hoped for you to get top marks

26
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:35,169
but to just stop being the worst-performing class.

27
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,948
But finally, we have a savior who will lead us out of the pit.

28
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:42,376
A big round of applause for Yu Min Jae!

29
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,375
She'll increase the average score for this class.

30
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,973
Yeah, I heard that she gets good grades.

31
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:54,730
Ms. Si Yeon told me that her mock exams score was one of the top in the country.

32
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,824
 Oh, right. 

33
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:58,743
We look forward to it.

34
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,179
Me...?

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,940
- It's up to you now. 
 - We're looking forward to it.

36
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,126
 What do I do? 

37
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,087
 I forgot that your grades are terrible. 

38
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:12,340
I heard Yu Min Jae is one of the top students.

39
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:16,938
 @User Not Found 

40
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:19,972
 Lunch meals  
 Today's lunch is...

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,537
Today's menu is tteokbokki. Who wants to eat?

42
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:27,762
- Me! 
 - Me.

43
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:29,524
Let's go to lunch early today.

44
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,260
I don't feel like eating today.

45
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,095
Why, Ji Wan?

46
00:02:34,095 --> 00:02:38,364
You know I get indigestion when I'm stressed out.

47
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:40,402
Why? Did something happen?

48
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:42,344
Is something bothering you?

49
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:50,202
It's nothing.

50
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:53,604
Ji Wan, you need to eat to feel better.

51
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:56,817
Should we get you some bread?

52
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:00,187
 Stop it. 

53
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:03,032
 Are you genuinely nice or are you pretending to be nice... 

54
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:05,384
- Let's do that. 
 - Yeah.

55
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:07,787
 like me? 

56
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,589
I'm fine.

57
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:15,969
Then, we're really going.

58
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,730
We're really going.

59
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,440
You won't regret it, right?

60
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,234
All right, see you later.

61
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,960
Let's go, Min Jae.

62
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,978
Let's go.

63
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:26,589
- What else is on the menu? 
 - Corn dogs.

64
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,500
- And yogurt. 
 - Corn dogs?

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,140
Corn dogs. Corn dogs. Corn dogs.

66
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,470
 Is it because of yesterday? 

67
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:43,130
 Ji Wan- Min Jae, are you home? 

68
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,142
 Min Jae. 

69
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,935
 Let's go. 

70
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,142
 I didn't hate you from the beginning. 

71
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:05,245
 Hi, I'm Yu Min Jae. 

72
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:09,039
 I thought of you as a rival at first. 

73
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,860
 But I quickly realized that I had nothing to worry about. 

74
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,482
 Because... 

75
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:20,359
She's more average than I expected.

76
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,971
 you were average. 

77
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:26,591
 Min Jae, you're really pretty. 

78
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:28,751
 My compliments? 

79
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:30,228
 Doesn't her hair look cute? 

80
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,881
 I'm sure you'll do great because you have a great voice 

81
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:33,832
 Sing something. 

82
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:36,009
 I give compliments to get closer to people. 

83
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,704
 So it wasn't hard. 

84
00:04:38,704 --> 00:04:41,171
 Min Jae. Let's go! 

85
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,233
 Okay, but let me finish this. 

86
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:48,021
 You had a lot of weaknesses. 

87
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,089
 Those are so pretty. 

88
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,716
 I wanted to buy them too. 

89
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:53,450
 They are the new Mackie sneakers, right? 

90
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,319
 No, they're not. 

91
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,147
 You weren't as good as me at certain things. 

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,610
 What... 

93
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,162
 I knew the attention would come back to me soon. 

94
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:08,350
 Min Jae is so much prettier than me. 

95
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,200
 You think so? 

96
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,170
 But... 

97
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:17,441
 I was wrong. 

98
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:23,346
 Everything you did was weird and nerdy. 

99
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:25,449
 Min Jae, that was amazing. 

100
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:26,376
 But... 

101
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,129
 - It looks really good on you. 
 - You look cute. 

102
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,647
 why does everyone like you? 

103
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:32,414
 - It looks really good on you. 
 - You look like a goddess. 

104
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:33,891
 It's as if 

105
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:35,668
 You look really cute. 

106
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,502
 That's so cute. 

107
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:38,746
 You're so much prettier. 

108
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:39,865
 You look like a princess. 

109
00:05:39,865 --> 00:05:40,891
 You look really pretty. 

110
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:42,917
 You look great. 

111
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,398
Ji Wan, you were here the whole time?

112
00:05:49,398 --> 00:05:52,317
I'm on a diet.

113
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:55,120
You're already so thin.

114
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,554
Whoa, No-Min!

115
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,424
Let's just tell everyone. It'll solve everything.

116
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:33,701
Should we?

117
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:35,111
No!

118
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:36,113
I mean...

119
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:40,231
If you don't want everyone to find out, you have to study.

120
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:44,653
It's easy for you to say because you're smart.

121
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:49,264
Average kids like me can't even do one thing well.

122
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:52,520
Maybe you're right...

123
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,806
It's not easy.

124
00:06:57,015 --> 00:07:01,592
We're just good at different things.

125
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:06,441
You can make people trust you and open up to you easily.

126
00:07:14,075 --> 00:07:19,710
If you're not good at studying, what are you good at?

127
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,582
I'm...

128
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,511
I'm not good at using my brain.

129
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,865
Using my body?

130
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:31,809
Sports?

131
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:33,077
Sports!

132
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,570
Really?

133
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,131
You're right. The shooting game!

134
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:40,234
You missed it, right? She was amazing.

135
00:07:40,234 --> 00:07:41,386
Yeah.

136
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:44,289
I can never get better at studying...

137
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:49,598
but I can practice sports until I get better at them.

138
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:51,554
Oh, actually,

139
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,630
I've been practicing cartwheels.

140
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:17,371
Ta-da!

141
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:29,742
It's the same for studying.

142
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:34,170
Just keep doing it until you get better at it.

143
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,057
Why did you get it wrong?

144
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:47,083
We studied it together.

145
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,386
Didn't you memorize the formula?

146
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,823
Can you teach me one more time?

147
00:08:53,823 --> 00:08:55,285
Look, the function...

148
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,462
Yeah.

149
00:08:57,462 --> 00:08:59,855
Min Jae disappeared again.

150
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:03,133
She's been disappearing during breaks recently.

151
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,702
Ji Wan, are you okay?

152
00:09:04,702 --> 00:09:06,304
You ate nothing today.

153
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:07,664
Do you want some of this?

154
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:09,407
No, I'm fine.

155
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,984
I have no appetite today.

156
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,255
Is something wrong?

157
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,381
What's the matter?

158
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,360
What is it?

159
00:09:22,787 --> 00:09:24,347
What's it? Tell us.

160
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:27,500
I'll tell you when I know for sure.

161
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,158
Okay. Yeah.

162
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,300
She'll tell us.

163
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,689
What are you doing?

164
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:00,866
Are you coloring?

165
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,536
It's nothing.

166
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,021
You can't get better grades like this.

167
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:07,949
You said you didn't want everyone to find out.

168
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:10,134
You asked for my help.

169
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,513
I've reached my limit.

170
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:18,408
I can't concentrate.

171
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,321
Sometimes,

172
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,414
it feels like there's a wall between us.

173
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,317
What?

174
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:29,319
You're too perfect. 
  (TN: Word game using the words byeok- wall and wanbyeok-perfection) 

175
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,505
Shut up.

176
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:33,808
This won't do.

177
00:10:33,808 --> 00:10:37,511
I need to do some stretches.

178
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:42,316
Are you not texting with Shin Yi Joon?

179
00:10:42,316 --> 00:10:45,727
Um... We are, but...

180
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:51,692
Is this you in middle school?

181
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,321
You're so pretty in this picture.

182
00:10:57,015 --> 00:10:59,391
Why are you looking at my stuff without permission?!

183
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:05,581
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:10,719
Did I hit you? Let me see.

185
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,797
Wait, wait. Tissue, tissue.

186
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,640
Oh my gosh! My nose!

187
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,800
- My nose is bleeding. 
 - Tissue, tissue.

188
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,118
You didn't hit me.

189
00:11:17,118 --> 00:11:18,094
All of a sudden...

190
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,280
Hey. That's not much blood. It won't kill you

191
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,610
What to do?

192
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,651
Suddenly...

193
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,720
A nosebleed...

194
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,106
What?

195
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,283
Why are you smiling?

196
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:36,412
You really get a nosebleed when you study hard.

197
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:39,172
I thought it was a lie.

198
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,348
You're so silly.

199
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,160
Go home if you're going to keep disturbing me.

200
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,700
Can we take one selfie?

201
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:18,254
I want to record this day.

202
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:21,406
Yu Min Jae's first nosebleed!

203
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:26,590
Come on. Look at the camera just once.

204
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,733
One, two, three.

205
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,169
This picture is kind of cute.

206

 #StudyingForExams #FirstNosebleed 

207
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,290
 Whoa! 

208
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:31,327
 #StudyingForExams #FirstNosebleed 

209
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:32,738
 I've been waiting. | You're so pretty. | A nosebleed? I have exams too! 

210
00:13:32,738 --> 00:13:33,865
 You look cute even with a nosebleed. | I'm so happy you're back 

211
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:35,231
 A new post after ages. | Beautiful and smart. 

212
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,057
 What happened? | Take care of yourself. | It's been a while. 

213
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:40,194
 Whoa! Min Jae, don't study too hard. | Trying to be the top student? | Oh my god! 

214
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,722
 People say 

215
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:47,559
 that hard work can't beat born talent. 

216
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,329
 People like you, 

217
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,396
 who are naturally smart and athletic 

218
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,840
 don't know 

219
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,893
 how hard I try. 

220
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:57,103
 Movie ticket 

221
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:04,639
 Emotionally recharged. A movie and a shooting game. It was fun. 

222
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,380
 What movie did you watch? 

223
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,563
Hi, Ji Wan.

224
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:22,126
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you before.

225
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:23,481
No, it's fine.

226
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:27,975
You guys went together because you were all free, right?

227
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:30,227
But...

228
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:33,046
You like Hye Joon, right?

229
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:34,832
What?

230
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:39,825
I was going to keep this a secret until you bring it up.

231
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:44,614
Min Jae told me this once, saying that it was a secret.

232
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:47,711
Yu Min Jae?

233
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:51,123
I told her one of my secrets too.

234
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,185
That Shin Yi Joon asked me to be his girlfriend.

235
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,328
He did?

236
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:01,324
After I told her that, then she and Shin Hye Joon showed up together

237
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:04,052
to our date.

238
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:06,639
But that's...

239
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,391
something she can't do to us.

240
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:12,677
We're friends.

241
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:14,305
Wait.

242
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:16,274
I'm so confused.

243
00:15:16,274 --> 00:15:19,134
Right. I was too.

244
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:23,431
But I at least didn't want to lie to you.

245
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:25,224
Da Ye.

246
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:37,250
