1
00:00:00,127 --> 00:00:03,805
What if we run into our classmates?

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:07,150
Oh? Isn't that Kim Seong Su?

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:13,180


4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,559
Phew!

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,694
Come on! Don't pull a prank like that.

6
00:00:18,694 --> 00:00:22,979
But... They won't recognize me anyway.

7
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:25,508
You're right, but...

8
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:27,584
Just follow me.

9
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:32,751
 User Not Found 

10
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:34,026
Isn't it too intense?

11
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:36,106
No, it's cute.

12
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,165
- Look. 
 - No.

13
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,661
- What about this one? 
 - This one?

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,943
I can't wear this.

15
00:00:45,943 --> 00:00:47,234
Doesn't it remind you of tteokbokki?

16
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:49,265
It's cute.

17
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:51,179
Just this one?

18
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:54,050
- Is it cute? 
 - Yes.

19
00:00:57,896 --> 00:00:59,650
What about this?

20
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:03,430
This!

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,236
Mmm?! I don't like it.

22
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:06,942
You don't like it?!

23
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:14,231
Why is it so expensive?!

24
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:15,562
I mean...

25
00:01:15,562 --> 00:01:21,219
I'm not doubting your sense of fashion,

26
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,832
but this is...

27
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:25,245
This is what?

28
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:26,485
It's like...

29
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:29,697
It's similar to something that

30
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:33,045
I wore in middle school

31
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:36,406
Back when everyone...

32
00:01:36,406 --> 00:01:37,773
 Don't sit alone. 

33
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:39,874
 - Let them sit alone. 
 - Why am I alone? 

34
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:41,033
 - What! 
 - Hey, look 

35
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,238
 Did you see her clothes? 

36
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:43,328
 - Whoa! 
 - That's terrible. 

37
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:45,259
 - Is she a cartoon character? 
 - Exactly. 

38
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:48,120
 - Is she still in elementary school? 
 - Look at her pigtails. 

39
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,431
 - So weird. 
 - Yeah. 

40
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:53,968
No!

41
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:56,665
This is back in fashion these days.

42
00:01:57,622 --> 00:02:00,170
You said you were studying on Instagram.

43
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:03,614
Are you pranking me again?

44
00:02:03,614 --> 00:02:05,727
No, I'm serious—

45
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:08,132
Never mind.

46
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:10,330
Wear this.

47
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,237
If you don't trust me,

48
00:02:12,237 --> 00:02:13,607
I'll buy the same thing.

49
00:02:13,607 --> 00:02:15,402
Satisfied?

50
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:19,080
We're buying two.

51
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:25,025
Thank you.

52
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:28,357
Wow! It's so cute.

53
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,171
Look.

54
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:11,123
So this is why kids go to cafés all the time.

55
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:12,843
It's so pretty.

56
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:15,320
You've never been to a café like this?

57
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:18,479
 You won't believe me, right? 

58
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,519
 If I say I've never done anything like this before. 

59
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,200
I haven't.

60
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:29,848
I only saw pictures.

61
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:58,903
Keep looking down and tilt your head slightly toward me.

62
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:00,045
Like...this?

63
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:01,788
That's cute.

64
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:04,408
You look really good right now.

65
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:06,804
It's time to change your profile picture.

66
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:11,406
Stop now.

67
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:13,734
I'll take your picture.

68
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:16,213
You're bad at taking photos.

69
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:23,229
 What are you guys up to? 

70
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:24,737
 I'm gaming. 

71
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:26,707
 My battery died. 

72
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:31,936
 Da Ye Jji: Min Jae, what are you doing? 

73
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:33,549
 I'm sending you a direct message because I miss you. 

74
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:35,981
Who is that?

75
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:37,834
Han Ji Wan?

76
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:38,739
Yes.

77
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:41,326
I was worried because everyone was so quiet.

78
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:42,837
I'm relieved.

79
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:44,829
Yeah, well...

80
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:46,621
I'm glad.

81
00:04:47,325 --> 00:04:51,209
 Shin Hye Joon: I told you not to worry. 

82
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:52,510
Oh...

83
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,768
Right!

84
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:55,626
Shin Hye Joon.

85
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,441
But still...

86
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:04,676
Won't he be helpful?

87
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:08,472
All right.

88
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:11,003
Yay, I've got your permission.

89
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:17,483
 Yu Min Jae 

90
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:24,825
 You're at the Pink Pool café? 

91
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:27,875
What?

92
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,126
Why are you hiding your phone?

93
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:31,615
Are you texting a girl?

94
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:33,642
What are you saying?

95
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:35,965
You're not texting Yu Min Jae?

96
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:45,724
 Hey! 

97
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:47,738
 Is this Shin Hye Joon? 

98
00:05:49,753 --> 00:05:51,601
Why are you smiling?

99
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,955
 There's something you're not telling me, 

100
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:59,936
 so I also want to have a fun secret. 

101
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,078
Nothing.

102
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:07,262
Something interesting happened.

103
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:13,498
What?

104
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,834
 anonymous1: The new girl was all bark and no bite. 

105
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,016
 I know everything. 

106
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:21,868
 I know what everyone is saying and thinking. 

107
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:24,758
 And I can change it any time I want. 

108
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:26,710
 I'll tell you everything. 

109
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,283
 Trust me. 

110
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:34,025
 - Did you see this? 
 - I wasn't born to be a popular kid. 

111
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,786
 That's ridiculous. 

112
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:37,901
 You didn't get caught, right? 

113
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,501
 Can I join you? Your secret club. 

114
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,184
 "Did you see the new girl?" 

115
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:44,720
 "I was surprised that she was more average than I expected" 

116
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,290
 Delete post 

117
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:53,661
 Listen to this. This song is really good. 

118
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:54,973
It suits you too.

119
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:58,271
All right. See you tomorrow.

120
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:04,804
What's with the title?

121
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:05,948
 I Want to Tease You Every Time I See You 

122
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:17,925
Eun Ji. Who is this?

123
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:20,029
He's just a friend.

124
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:21,747
He's my friend who's a boy.

125
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:24,585
You two went to play games alone?

126
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,217
Stop it.

127
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:30,171
He's the only one on the same game level as me.

128
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:31,327
There's been no romance?

129
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,782
No.

130
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:34,299
Did you watch the drama?

131
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:35,730
Of course.

132
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,208
Isn't my outfit cute?

133
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,489
You look cute.

134
00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:40,951
If you can't stop thinking about him,

135
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:43,898
he's probably more than a friend, right?

136
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:44,943
What?

137
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:47,737
What's going on? A potential boyfriend?

138
00:07:47,737 --> 00:07:49,520
- Who is it? 
 - Never mind.

139
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,946
Who is it?

140
00:07:50,946 --> 00:07:52,397
No...

141
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:01,733
- Girls, let's share these. 
 - Oh!

142
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,506
I ran into Hye Joon at the store and he bought them for me.

143
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:06,402
What were you talking about?

144
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,645
Kim Da Ye has a crush on someone.

145
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,624
Really? I didn't know. Tell me, tell me.

146
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:16,481
He's just a friend. A friend who is a boy.

147
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:21,222
But sometimes he says something that gives me butterflies.

148
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:24,424
Butterflies? That means he's more than a friend.

149
00:08:24,424 --> 00:08:25,437
Exactly.

150
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:29,829
But he could be thinking of you as just a friend, right?

151
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:32,803
Yeah.

152
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,910
You said he's just a friend. Do we know him? Who is it?

153
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,257
Min Jae! Do you have a close guy friend?

154
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,280
Oh, I...

155
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,202
 I didn't use to have friends. 

156
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:49,362
 Let alone a guy friend... 

157
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,070
 If my male best friend does this to me, does he have feelings for me? 

158
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,473
Ji Wan, have you been friends

159
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:56,920
with Shin Hye Joon and Shin Yi Joon for long?

160
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,917
Oh.

161
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,412
We first met in high school.

162
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:05,323
Hye Joon and Yi Joon are both sweet and mischievous when they're with me.

163
00:09:05,323 --> 00:09:08,502
But other people find it hard to approach them because they seem cold at first.

164
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:10,561
Yes, they can be cold.

165
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:14,439
 Ah... So he's like that to everyone. 

166
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:16,429
Can I have this one?

167
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:25,353
Yi Joon, Shin Yi Joon.

168
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:28,445
Behave like a student.

169
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:30,896
- Okay? 
 - Yes, sir

170
00:09:30,896 --> 00:09:33,742
This is your last warning.

171
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:35,960
Understood?

172
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,514
Go.

173
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:51,782
Did something happen?

174
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,947
No.

175
00:09:53,947 --> 00:09:56,743
He does that when he's in a bad mood.

176
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:58,961
He vents it on me.

177
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,029
That's because you never wear your uniform properly.

178
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:10,047
Minus points.

179
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:15,432
Minus points. Minus points. Minus points.

180
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:18,495
Minus points?

181
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:33,388
I sometimes dress properly.

182
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:35,508
You never listen to the teachers.

183
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:37,630
I sometimes do.

184
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,277
Oh, right! Did you listen to the playlist?

185
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:44,533
I liked that song.

186
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:47,334
Look at those two.

187
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:51,049
I was right, Shin Hye Joon.

188
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,556
What is that?

189
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,813
Min Jae.

190
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:22,491
Someone's calling for you.

191
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,620
 Shin Yi Joon 

192
00:11:51,098 --> 00:11:54,291
 That's because you never wear your uniform properly. 

193
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,776
 I sometimes dress properly. 

194
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:57,830
 You never listen to the teachers. 

195
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,148
 I sometimes do. 

196
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:02,131
 He's... 

197
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:05,134
 dressed properly. 

198
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:13,920


199
00:12:18,353 --> 00:12:20,979
