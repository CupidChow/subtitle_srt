1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Oh? Min Jae accepted my friend request.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,400
But Min Jae's account is quite interesting.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,200
What... do you mean?

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,400
Here.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,400
 No Posts 

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,000
-  Thank god.  
 - Min Jae, why aren't there any posts on your account?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,300
I'll be the first to tag her. Looks pretty, right?

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,000
Me too.

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,000
 Min Jae is… a little weird. 

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,600
 User Not Found 

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,300
That was so funny. How can she sing that in front of us?

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,500
You seem happy.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,000
Yu Min Jae, she's so funny.

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,500
You're talking a lot about her lately.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,900
Who? Yu Min Jae?

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,900
Why? Does that bother you?

17
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,500
You said you have no interest in her.

18
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,100
Hey, but you…

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,800
You're still not hung up on that incident, are you?

20
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,500
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,500
If not, then never mind.

22
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,600
 Shin Yi Joon, will he sing? 

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
 Will he? Will he? 

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,400
 - I won't sing 
 - Shin Yi... 

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,600
 in front of other people. 

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,600
 Why did Yu Min Jae accept the requests? 

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,000
 What is she thinking? 

28
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,100
 Jnam's Playlist 
 One day, I want to sing this with you 

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,900
 At a karaoke with my friends 

30
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,700
 ji.vvani tagged you in her post 

31
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,300
 Look at her smile. 

32
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,800
 Friends? 

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
 They're useless. 

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Look.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,900
She clearly only chose photos that she looks good in.

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,200
 Thank you so so much. 

37
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,800
 You're my savior… For real. 
 Is there anything you want to eat? 

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,700
 Or anything you want to have? Tell me. 
 I'm just so grateful! 

39
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,600
Jeez.

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,900
What a sucker.

41
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,100
 Tomorrow, after 3rd class break, rooftop. 

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,600
 Follow me to the rooftop! 

43
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,300
Did I act too friendly?

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Turn to page 46.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,400
You have to know what relative keys are to understand the song "Mother."

46
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,000
Relative keys…

47
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
 Gosh! She scared me. 

48
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,900
What?

49
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,900
- Now, next… 
 -  He scared me. 

50
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,300
Let's read about modulation.

51
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,900
 What's happening? 

52
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,700
-  He's talking to me.  
 - If you read page 46.

53
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,300
- Oh… 
 - Do you see the song "Mother"?

54
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,700
Aren't you sleeping today?

55
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,000
I've never slept.

56
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,800
Is that so?

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,900
My mom asked me to take a picture on a sunny weekend.

58
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,900
There were tears in her voice.

59
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,200
A noble breath to leave only a smiling and bright face.

60
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,600
With your love, my body became a sea of tears.

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,200
The scent of my mother, who hugged me with love,

62
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,300
is getting deeper as the years go by.

63
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,800
Yes, good job.

64
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,100
Now, on page 46…

65
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
No-Min.

66
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,100
No-Min.

67
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,600
No-Min I made you this nickname.

68
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,500
Because you're as white and as cute as the character Moomin.

69
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,800
 Rubbish. Look at her 

70
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,100
 How about No-Min? No-Min is cute 

71
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,600
 - Why? 
 - No-Min Jae 

72
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,500
 Because she has no presence 

73
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,200
I'm sorry,

74
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,200
but could you move your desk a little bit?

75
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,800
You kept showing up in my selfies I'm sure you wouldn't want that either

76
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,200
 Of course. Whatever you say. 

77
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,500
You too.

78
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,200
All the comments are about how pretty Min Jae and Ji Wan are. Da Ye feels excluded.

79
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,900
I know. If I had your faces, I'd be taking selfies every day.

80
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,500
Don't say that. And Min Jae is much prettier than me.

81
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,600
- Is she? 
 -  That's not what you're thinking. 

82
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,700
Look, all the comments are about Min Jae.

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,400
But… It looks like Min Jae didn't press like on our photos.

84
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,000
She said that she doesn't go on Instagram that often.

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,300
-  Planning doubts in their mind.  
 - I also don't do it that often.

86
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,100
But you press like on all our photos.

87
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,800
True, I love pressing like.

88
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,700
Min Jae has more than 5,000 followers. Why did she delete all her photos?

89
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,400
I know, right? Why did she?

90
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,700
I feel like Min Jae has a lot of secrets.

91
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,900
And it kind of feels like she's not opening up to us.

92
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,300
 - Finishing by playing a victim? I'm speechless.  
 - I know, right.

93
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,700
Come to think of it, she is really like that.

94
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,600
She barely showed any response when we posted the photos yesterday.

95
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,000
Really? It's probably because she just moved to a new school.

96
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,200
Hey, Ku Ming.

97
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,900
I'm going to borrow your concept.

98
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,100
I just said it because I wanted to be closer to her. So you guys shouldn't think that way.

99
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,400
Min Jae is our friend.

100
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,800
Sorry. No-Min made a mistake.

101
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,100
It's fine, I'm okay.

102
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,200
Are you okay?

103
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
Thank you.

104
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,300
Wow!

105
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,700
You're so pretty.

106
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,700
Huh? Umm...

107
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,400
No... Anyway.

108
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,200
Thank you for saying yes to my atrocious request.

109
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,700
Forget it. It wasn't that big of a deal.

110
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,400
I've been thinking...

111
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,000
and like you said, I don't need them anymore.

112
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,400
Whether it's friends or attention.

113
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:47,300
You told me before that you were invisible in your previous school.

114
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,300
Yes.

115
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,600
That's what I need.

116
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,500
I just need to graduate quietly without being noticed.

117
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,400
Now that I think about it, if the other kids think of me as you,

118
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,300
then they'll think of you as me.

119
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,200
An invisible person.

120
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,300
So we can be each other like—

121
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,700
Really?

122
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,300
For real?

123
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,900
But...

124
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,700
I have one condition.

125
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,300
What is it?

126
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,900
It's obvious.

127
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,700
What's obvious?

128
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,300
That you're a nerd.

129
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,400
Then what should I do?

130
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,700
Before you do anything, ask me first.

131
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,500
And don't look it up on the internet.

132
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,300
I'll tell you.

133
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,600
You…

134
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,500
You said that you're happy, right?

135
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,200
Yes!

136
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,600
For the first time, I've joined a clique,

137
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,400
hung out with boys, and had other kids come up—

138
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,500
That's when it's most dangerous.

139
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,300
They can turn their backs on you in a second.

140
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,800
But...

141
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,900
you also make it obvious.

142
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,500
About what?

143
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,900
You stand out too much even when you're just standing still.

144
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,000
You're too pretty even with the glasses.

145
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,100
And you're so confident,

146
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,200
so you have this cool vibe even when you're not talking.

147
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,000
Whatever.

148
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,800
You're also… pretty.

149
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,400
That!

150
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,300
You have to speak that small so other kids can't hear you.

151
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,500
I get it, so don't ever come near me with Han Ji Wan's clique

152
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,000
that you always hang out with.

153
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
 Like that, 

154
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,900
 our secret agreement began. 

155
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,200
 Do you want to delete? 

156
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,800
 I will delete the old me and live as the new me in my new school. 

157
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,600
 Do you want to delete? 
 Yes 

158
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,800
 Your account has been deleted 

159
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,700
 We decided to teach each other 

160
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,000
 how to erase all presence as an outcast 

161
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,400
 and how to enjoy popularity among friends 

162
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,500
 as a social butterfly. 

163
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,400
But…

164
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,600
I have one more favor to ask.

165
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,300
What now?

166
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,500
Can you also tutor me on something else?

167
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,000
Math. You have good grades.

168
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,900
You— You have bad grades?

169
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,600
Why? You don't even play.

170
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,800
I mean…

171
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,100
They're not that bad, but…

172
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,300
 Min Jae, what are you going to wear tomorrow? 

173
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,600
 I'm thinking about wearing this outfit with that hairpin! What do you think? 

174
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,400
Gosh, she talks nonstop.

175
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,100
Is she trying to kill me with all the questions or what?

176
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,500
Jeez!

177
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,100
Why did I say yes to her?

178
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,400
 Oops! 

179
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,500
 Did I interrupt your studies? 

180
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:45,200

 - How long were you watching me? 
 - I didn't see anything! 

184
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,100
 Min Jae, you've got great taste! I wanted to buy that too. 

185
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,900
 What the… She's wearing a fake. 

186
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,400
 Can you… hear me? 

187
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,700
 Well, that's— 

188
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,900
 Then, all this time! 

189
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,000
 Min Jae, can I ask you a question? 

190
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,800
 - I want to know. Tell us. 
 -  Can't you tell us?
