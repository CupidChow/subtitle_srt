1
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:23,840
 Yu Min Jae 

2
00:00:29,187 --> 00:00:32,065
 I really don't want to go to school. 

3
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,101
 The day when my transfer to a new school had been decided... 

4
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,369
 I made up my mind. 

5
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:40,255
Hi, I'm Yu Min Jae.

6
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:44,017
 I'm going to live quietly from now on until the day I graduate... 

7
00:00:44,017 --> 00:00:45,269
Min Jae, you guys have the same name.

8
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:46,404
Eh?

9
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:48,264
But she's so different from our Min Jae.

10
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:50,658
Doesn't she look so quiet?

11
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:52,844
That's so cool! They have the same name.

12
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,096
 But... 

13
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,248
 Why is there a kid whose name is the same as mine? 

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,344
 Ugh... So annoying. 

15
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:06,048
 User Not Found 

16
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,725
Min Jae!

17
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:19,677
 In my last school that's where my place used to be. 

18
00:01:19,677 --> 00:01:20,839
 At the back of the classroom. 

19
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:22,916
 In front of the mirror. 

20
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:27,101
 We wore lipstick together, and ate snacks together. 

21
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,628
 What? 

22
00:01:43,628 --> 00:01:45,888
 Is it just my imagination? 

23
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:51,694
Hi, I'm Ku Ming.

24
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,947
Hi.

25
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,409
 My School 
 Oneulhaggyo 

26
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,511
 Yeah. 

27
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:00,762
 Friends. 

28
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:02,305
 Popularity. 

29
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:05,233
 They're all meaningless. 

30
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,071
 Why is she looking this way? 

31
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:15,265
 But why did she show up looking like that? 

32
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:17,737
 Should I be glad about it? 

33
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,856
 I have to tell her... 

34
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:22,016
 We need to talk— 

35
00:02:52,364 --> 00:02:54,640
I know you.

36
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,904
Why did you dress up like that?

37
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:02,990
That's not how you really look.

38
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,538
What do you mean?

39
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,619
Go on.

40
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,492
You're pretty and have a lot of friends.

41
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,525
I know you're being like this on purpose.

42
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,826
Can I talk to you later—

43
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,894
I have nothing to say to you.

44
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:42,838
later and in the future.

45
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:45,410
Don't act like you know me.

46
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,938
You're wrong on that one.

47
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,406
You know how accurate my love radar is, don't you?

48
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,483
I can feel it.

49
00:03:55,485 --> 00:04:01,288
I think the new girl is good enough to melt

50
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:04,351
Yi Joon's cold heart.

51
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:06,962
It's different this time.

52
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:09,024
Everyone's talking about that today.

53
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:10,750
Look at this anonymous forum.

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,461
 Honestly, SYJ must've done it on purpose. 

55
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,903
 Everyone will root for them if they actually go out. 

56
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:18,680
Your love radar's about you and Han Ji—

57
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,266
When did you know about it?

58
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:30,561
My predictions have never been wrong.

59
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:34,140
That's why all the questions I pick are on the tests.

60
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,659
Hye Joon, you're seriously freaking annoying!.

61
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:43,348
Yi Joon and Min Jae?

62
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:45,135
I know him well.

63
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,453
That's exactly why he'll never go out with her.

64
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:52,700
He despises getting humiliated in front of people.

65
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,660
Hey. You upset?

66
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,987
 What?! 

67
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:06,156
What did you do?

68
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:08,307
Did you really go see her yesterday?

69
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,584
 Did you hit her? 

70
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,702
 Or threaten her? 

71
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:22,797
No. There's no way you would've done that.

72
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:25,007
Did you get on your knees?

73
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,670
I still have to sort things out with her.

74
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,282
You're scarier than I expected.

75
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:34,450
I should be careful.

76
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:44,273
So you're going to keep your promise, right?

77
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:50,040
You guys have the same name but opposite personalities.

78
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,493
We should differentiate them since it's confusing.

79
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:52,527
How?

80
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:54,387
Should we call you guys Pop-Min and Lo-Min?

81
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,922
Pop-Min?

82
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,932
"Popular Min Jae" and "Loner Min Jae"

83
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:00,260
What do you think?

84
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,054
Hey! How could you call our Min Jae "Pop-Min"?

85
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:05,531
- It sounds likes she's gonna pop. 
 - Was it too much?

86
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,291
Right, Min Jae?

87
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,051
I'm okay with it.

88
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:10,604
Yeah, that was too much.

89
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,522
There are other cute names.

90
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,536
Cute names? Like what?

91
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,777
How about Mu-Min?

92
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,444
Mu-min is cute, isn't it?

93
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,146
- Mu-min? 
 - Why Mu-min?

94
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,165
Moo Min Jae, Mu meaning, "Invisible."

95
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,263
I have to give you credit for this.

96
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,615
Totally.

97
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:33,309
Since our Min Jae is Yu Min Jae.

98
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,029
Should we take a photo?

99
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,715
 Did she hear everything? 

100
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,019
 I hear everything. 

101
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,029
 What? 

102
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:45,405
 Why don't you guys just yell in my ears? 

103
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,808
 Well, I didn't care about it either... 

104
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,619
 In the past. 

105
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,821
Min Jae. Let's take a selfie.

106
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:56,215
S-Sure.

107
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,808
Huh? "S-Sure"?

108
00:06:57,808 --> 00:07:00,011
I thought we were friends.

109
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:01,238
 Why did she have to 

110
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:04,815
 bring all her friends and hang around here— 

111
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,970
 They're not friends. 

112
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,580
One more.

113
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:21,713
Adding a little romance to the dreary classroom.

114
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,671
Yi Joon, Min Jae... Something's going on between you guys, right?

115
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,473
You guys decided to meet here without telling me, huh?

116
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,933
Am I right? Say it.

117
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:50,110
Stop that.

118
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,404
Stop what? Tell me.

119
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:55,307
There's something going on between you two, right?

120
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:01,820
I'm adding a little rhythm to the rod of affection.

121
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,949
- Clean up the mess. 
 - Yes, sir.

122
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:05,743
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,137
Clean it up.

124
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,160
What was interval again?

125
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,180
It's the distance between the two tones.

126
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:22,360
You have to know this to understand

127
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,290
whole step and half step...

128
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,344
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:36,879
I told you guys to do your music homework last class.

130
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,851
 I feel small again. 

131
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,879
 When I try to do something in front of someone 

132
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,880
 who appears to hate me, I just freeze. 

133
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:55,323
What's the interval between do and re?

134
00:08:55,323 --> 00:08:56,494
A whole step...

135
00:08:56,518 --> 00:08:57,879
The interval between re and mi?

136
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,456
A whole step. The interval between mi and fa?

137
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,932
A half step. It's a half step. Why is it a half step?

138
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:05,945
That's right.

139
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,229
You guys should pay special attention to this part.

140
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:17,389
Now, rhythm is a pattern of regular or irregular beats...

141
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,711
Oh! Hey—

142
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:42,164
I told you to stop acting like you know me.

143
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,626
- It's... 
 - What do you want from me?

144
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:49,725
I...

145
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:53,075
What?

146
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,773
- I need your help. 
 - Let go of this—

147
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,442
Just follow back.

148
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:03,210
What?

149
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,064
Could you just follow back on Ins**gram?

150
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,791
I promise I won't bother you anymore.

151
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:17,131
Actually, I transferred to this school and three days ago...

152
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:22,868
So people think you're me?

153
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,360
Hey.

154
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,746
Whether it was a misunderstanding or not,

155
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:34,511
you're the one who created this problem by saying nothing at all.

156
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,909
Was it because you couldn't say it?

157
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,519
Or...

158
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,032
did you not say anything on purpose?

159
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,343
 But if I say it, everything will be over. 

160
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:53,611
 I was scared. 

161
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,823
 I've changed because I wanted to make friends... 

162
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,900
 Since our Min Jae is Yu Min Jae. 

163
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,311
 Aren't you basically a liar? 

164
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:02,120
 I'm getting goosebumps. 

165
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:07,097
 Not because I wanted to be hated by people and become a loner. 

166
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,900
♫  Just as much as the time we needed  ♫

167
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,260
♫  With my heart that wanted to be hurt  ♫

00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:20,796
   
 Friends? It's only a matter of time they turn their backs on you. 

171
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:23,774
 Min Jae seems to have a lot of secrets. 

172
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:25,743
 You said you were happy, right? 

173
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:29,089
 For the first time in my life, I'm not some invisible, nameless kid, 

174
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,441
 but I can live as Yu Min Jae. 

175
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,767
 Huh? It's Min Jae. 

176
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:34,260
 Do you really like Min Jae? 

177
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,444
 I'm not interested in attention seekers like her.
