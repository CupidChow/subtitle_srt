1
00:00:01,444 --> 00:00:06,144
I was worried because I couldn't reach you.

2
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:10,238
Sorry.

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,209
I wasn't in a good mood

4
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:17,563
today, so...

5
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:21,838
I missed you.

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:31,940


7
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:42,152
I'll get going.

8
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:47,161
Now that I got to see you.

9
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:57,148
Do you want to go to a cafe?

10
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:09,980
I mean, you said you're not in a good mood.

11
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:14,540
Never mind, it would've closed.

12
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,634
Or... Do you want to go for karaoke?

13
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:29,694
 @User Not Found 

14
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:41,436
Oh, yeah.

15
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:44,933
You hated singing, right?

16
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:48,190
I'm sorry I didn't think that far.

17
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,424
I don't hate it.

18
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:08,625
I actually... like it.

19
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:12,215
I mean...

20
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:21,016
I liked it.

21
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,411

30
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,408
 But 

31
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,985
 as expected, I couldn't do it. 

32
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:17,479
 I think you'll be good at it, you have a nice voice. 

33
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,467
 Sing for us. 

34
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:20,865
 - Oh! 
 - Hey, Yi Joon doesn't sing. 

35
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:22,542
 - Do you think he'll sing? 
 - Is Shin Yi Joon going to sing? 

36
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:26,747
 Shin Yi Joon! Shin Yi Joon! 

37
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:30,182
 I won't. Not in front of others. 

38
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:32,687
 Still? 

39
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,784
 Because of you. 

40
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:41,680
 Alright, next is Yu Min Jae's... 

41
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,324
 Yeah, let's listen to Min Jae sing. 

42
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,363
 Min Jae, what are you going to sing? 

43
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:46,631
 2 years ago 
 - Why is it always soccer? 
 - Basketball! 

44
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:48,353
 - Why basketball? 
 - Basketball is really not it. 

45
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,392
 - All of a sudden? 
 - This really isn't it. 

46
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:51,427
 Dude, do it on your own. 

47
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:52,443
 Do it on your own. 

48
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:54,015
 - Then, gaming cafe? 
 - Gaming cafe, gaming cafe, go! 

49
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:56,028
 Come on, I said let's play soccer What do you mean gaming cafe? 

50
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,647
 - We don't have enough people for soccer. 
 - Huh? 

51
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:00,643
 - Games? 
 - Gaming cafe. 

52
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:02,286
 We should go for games, come on. 

53
00:04:02,286 --> 00:04:03,944
 - Two hours? 
 - What game should we play? 

54
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:04,930
 Who is he? 

55
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,028
 My cousin, Yi Joon. 

56
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:08,799
 Yi Joon. 

57
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,592
 Let's play soccer later. 

58
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,985
 You can be the striker. 

59
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:18,040
 And the goalkeeper because you're tall. 

60
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,705
 I always thought that you were amazing. 

61
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:26,531
 You're smart and good at making friends. 

62
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,394
 Even if you help me like this, it's still difficult for me. 

63
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:39,535
 And then for the first time 

64
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:42,571
 I found something that I thought I might be good at. 

65
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:45,256
 - I'll take it. 
 - Okay. 

66
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:47,355
 One, two, three! 

67
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:49,833
 Hello! I'm Kim Taehyung. 

68
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,640
 My height is 172kg. 

69
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,211
 - My weight is 52... 
 - Dude! 

70
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,179
 Why? 

71
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:55,884
 Oh? Oh, right, darn it. 

72
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:58,120
 - Don't be nervous and— 
 - I'm so nervous. 

73
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,454
 - Mention the name of the agency. 
 - Oh, right, right. 

74
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:02,905
 Hello, I'm Kim Taehyung. 

75
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:05,125
 I am applying for an audition at Why Entertainment. 

76
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,635
 Hello! 

77
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:08,907
 I am applying for this... 

78
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:10,686
 - Why... Enter— 
 - Oh, what are you doing? 

79
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,129
 "Hello!" What is this? 

80
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:13,251
 Oh, I'm so nervous. 

81
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:15,607
 When I did it, you said it was nothing. 

82
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,214
 - Again, again. 
 - I'll try again. 

83
00:05:17,214 --> 00:05:18,248
 Hello! 

84
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:23,044
 I'm Shin Yi Joon, applying for this audition at Why Entertainment. 

85
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:24,979
 Um, my specialty is singing. 

86
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,774
 I will begin. 

87
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:41,515
 Okay, we're ready. 

88
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:44,548
 - We just have to click it! 
 - Hold on, hold on. 

89
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:46,602
 Dude, shall we pray? 

90
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:49,742
 Okay. 

91
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:51,785
 I've practically prayed to almost all the gods. 

92
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,455
 It's forty-four minutes right now, I'll click after one minute. 

93
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,024
 - Okay? 
 - Okay. 

94
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,218
 I'll click it at quarter to! We have a minute left. 

95
00:05:58,218 --> 00:05:59,235
 Forty seconds. 

96
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:01,194
 - Dude, what time is it now? 
 - Forty-five seconds. 

97
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,821
 Dude! 

98
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,937
 Argh! Cover it! 

99
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:13,231
 Dude, promise me. 

100
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:15,902
 That we will root for each other regardless of the results. 

101
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:17,644
 - Of course. 
 - For real? 

102
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,558
 Root for each other even if just one of us passes! 

103
00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:21,269
 Hold on, alright 

104
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:24,233
 Oh, that was so tough. 

105
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:26,203
 So I wanted to show you. 

106
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:27,208
 Oh, right. 

107
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,234
 When will you come home later? 

108
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:30,695
 Why? 

109
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:35,339
 Because your words were most important to me. 

110
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:39,119
 Never mind. 

111
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,371
 Call me later when you come. 

112
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:42,216
 I'll get going first. 

113
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,720
 I'm so sleepy. 

114
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,315
 What's with you? This is gross. 

115
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:05,413
 But I'm hungry. 

116
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:06,725
 Dude, what should we eat? 

117
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:09,494
 - Dude, isn't he amazing? 
 - He's really good. 

118
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:11,056
 - Dude, what is it? 
 - Wow! 

119
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,420
 Wow, aren't I better? 

120
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,885
 Why? He's good. 

121
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:16,382
 Hey, rap for us, rap. 

122
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:17,592
 - Rap? 
 - Yeah. 

123
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:19,840
 Koo koo ka ka. 

124
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,887
 I'm better, aren't I? 

125
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:23,643
 - Dude, you're good. 
 - Can I brag? 

126
00:07:25,485 --> 00:07:26,905
 Hey! 

127
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:29,914
 Stop it. 

128
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,762
 I had nothing to ask you. 

129
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,034
 What was even worse was that... 

130
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,729
 in my head, at that moment... 

131
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:03,868
 - Rap for us, rap. 
 - Rap? 

132
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:04,760
 Okay. 

133
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,476
 Koo koo ka ka. 

134
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:07,930
 - Yi Joon... 
 - I'm better, aren't I? 

135
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,269
 - Dude, you're good. 
 - Can I brag? 

136
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:13,602
 Oh... I'm glad it's not my video. 

137
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:16,856
 Have you ever had that thought? 

138
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:20,365
 You're so afraid and so pathetic 

139
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:25,385
 that you want to disappear without anyone knowing. 

140
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:27,774
 I have. 

141
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:36,916
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

142
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,906
Maybe that's why...

143
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,667
I can't sing in front of others

144
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:54,574
because I think everyone will laugh at me.

145
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:01,844
I keep getting reminded

146
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:06,412
of that moment.

147
00:09:14,747 --> 00:09:19,585
It's my first time talking about this

148
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:24,596
with someone else.

149
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:30,529
 I wanted you to tell me 

150
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,695
 that I was the only person you shared this with. 

151
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,936
 I didn't know Shin Hye Joon was available as well. 

152
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:46,743
 Yeah. 

153
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:51,240
 Let's all go together next time. 

154
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:07,576
Is that so?

155
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:18,823
I mean, you weren't that interested.

156
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,921
I just happen to ramble on.

157
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,888
My friend said this...

158
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:39,401
Real friends are those who stay by your side

159
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:44,269
when you really want to open up.

160
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,189
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,271
Should I sing something?

162
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:26,655
I'll cheer you up.

163
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,750
♫  Very naturally raise the corners of your lips  ♫

164
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,720
♫  even if it's a little too much  ♫

165
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,960
♫  Again, like that  ♫

166
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,290
♫  As if there is a fixed answer  ♫

167
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,560
♫  Everyone try to be alike  ♫

168
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,940
♫  Even I erase myself  ♫

169
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,900
♫  until it becomes transparent (more changing my all)  ♫

170
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,270
♫  You, like the sun  ♫

171
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,200
♫  make a way  ♫

172
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,500
♫  Run along  ♫

173
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,180
♫  I keep running out of breath  ♫

174
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,410
♫  I'm just the wind  ♫

175
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,480
♫  Blowing slowly like this  ♫

176
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,240
♫  Let's fill the sky with us  ♫

177
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,790
♫  and I say yeah  ♫

178
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,120
♫  we are so different  ♫

179
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,410
♫  I was surprised at first a-ha  ♫

180
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,580
♫  I like it because it's different now  ♫

181
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,570
♫  It seems to be filling up with something big.  ♫

182
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,680
♫  I'm surprised again a-ha  ♫

183
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,290
♫  so good now  ♫

184
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,124
Wow, I'm exhausted.

185
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,589
You don't have to do it, I'll do it all!

186
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:51,920
♫  I'm surprised again  ♫

187
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,690
♫  so good now  ♫

188
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,320
♫  I'm surprised again  ♫

189
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,240
♫  so good now  ♫

190
00:13:06,892 --> 00:13:08,305
What?

191
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:14,724
I want to try.

192
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:35,271

Someday...

224
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:21,658
I wanted to sing this song for you.

225
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:34,873
Should I tell you something about myself, too?

226
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,732
 But then, what's your favorite song? 

227
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:43,487
 - Me? 
 - Yes. 

228
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:45,769
 I'm just curious. 

229
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:50,161
 I wondered what you'd sing. 

230
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:56,332
 "Confession" 

231
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:02,909
 Can you sing that for me later... 

232
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:04,905
 Back then, 

233
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:10,269
 I thought I'd never see you sing. 

234
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:12,266
Why?

235
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:13,882
That's because...

236
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:17,538
 If you found out I'm not the Yu Min Jae you thought I was, 

237
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:20,231
 I thought you'd hate me. 

238
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:23,412
 I thought you'd hate me. 

239
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:27,028
It's just...

240
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:29,916
I didn't think we'd get close.

241
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:46,440
Yu Min Jae.

242
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,619
I like you.

243
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,324
 @User Not Found 

244
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:12,158
 Bonus clip  
 Are you ready?

245
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:15,717
Your voice is too small. Are you ready?

246
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:16,952
Cut it out.

247
00:18:16,952 --> 00:18:18,123
Dude, you...

248
00:18:18,123 --> 00:18:19,797
I know you're going to do it properly when I play the music.

249
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,463
I know you too well, Shin Yi Joon.

250
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:22,578
- I'm going to play it. 
 - Okay.

251
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:24,401
- You have to do it. 
 - Okay, okay.
