[Episode 25]

4
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,650
My knife skills are poor.

5
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,580
So I bought vegetables and meat

6
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,440
that don't need any knife skills.

7
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,970
It's rare for you to come back.

8
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,430
I've done everything I can

9
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,180
to save time.

10
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,100
They're overcooked.

11
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,860
Not too overcooked though. They are still edible.

12
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,280
It seems like you are not that reliable

13
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,479
in buying groceries.

14
00:01:58,979 --> 00:01:59,940
I've provided free labor,

15
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,470
so don't be picky.

16
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,640
The dishes are so few in amount today.

17
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,040
They're all half a plate.

18
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,840
Aunt Gui Xiao doesn't really know how to cook.

19
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,400
Food shrinks in size when they are cooked.

20
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,910
No wonder you didn't eat much.

21
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,590
If I eat more,

22
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,360
there's none left for you two.

23
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,710
It's the last piece.

24
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,590
I'll leave it to you.

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,200
Eat it.

26
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,370
You can have it if you want.

27
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,650
I'm not hungry.

28
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,560
Really?

29
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,660
You bought it in advance?

30
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,290
You rarely come back.

31
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,520
I knew you would go back home,

32
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,920
so I bought it in advance.

33
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,410
So thoughtful.

34
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,170
It's basic etiquette.

35
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,100
I know what to do.

36
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,970
You've grown up.

37
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,079
Screw you.

38
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,800
I lost my key before this.

39
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,880
This is the new one.

40
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,760
Take this.

41
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,050
Throw away the old one.

42
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,180
I just praised you.

43
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,800
People always have flaws.

44
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,630
I have a clear self-consciousness

45
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,790
about this.

46
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,910
Cut the crap.

47
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,079
If you have a chance,

48
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,660
introduce the lawyer who was

49
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,460
in charge of your mom's divorce case to me.

50
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,790
OK. He's my old friend.

51
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,660
Call him anytime if you need him.

52
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,710
I might not need him. It's just in case.

53
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,340
So I know who to turn to.

54
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,160
Are you still going

55
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,710
to persuade your mom to divorce this time?

56
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,290
Since he

57
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,190
had a fight with my mom last time,

58
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,320
he moved out.

59
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,330
He comes back for dinner,

60
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,260
but he lives outside the rest of the time.

61
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,459
I want to find a chance

62
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,760
to talk to them.

63
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,420
Actually, last time at the hospital,

64
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,300
I wanted to talk to your mom

65
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:22,960
about this.

66
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,470
But I realized

67
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,670
we weren't that close.

68
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,810
I was afraid

69
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,700
it might backfire if I mentioned it.

70
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,660
But my mom and your mom chatted

71
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,520
for a long time.

72
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,640
Your mom was there too?

73
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,860
We happened to be together

74
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,860
that day.

75
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,140
After hearing that your mom was ill,

76
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,540
she offered to visit her.

77
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,140
I think it was pretty good.

78
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,860
The first meeting between our parents

79
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,740
went very well.

80
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,460
Thank you.

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,900
It's my duty.

82
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,700
If one day

83
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,900
my dad is ill,

84
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,140
and I'm not in Beijing,

85
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,530
you have to take care of him too.

86
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,530
You can't escape.

87
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,460
But my dad has a secretary to take care of him.

88
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,420
He might despise you

89
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,940
for not taking good care of him.

90
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,790
You'd better not suffer the indignity.

91
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,320
What are you talking about?

92
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,510
I have to go.

93
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,070
Alright, you should go home now.

94
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,590
I'll try to come back early.

95
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,180
Drive slowly.

96
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,030
Shen Jin.

97
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,540
When you call my name,

98
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,400
you don't have to be so emotional.

99
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,740
Please sit down, Mr. Gui.

100
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,880
Thank you for meeting me.

101
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,010
To be exact,

102
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,250
this time I'm meeting you of my own free will.

103
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,650
The last time we met, you picked me up without informing me.

104
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,820
Last time, I couldn't help myself

105
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,460
after hearing you were back.

106
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,540
When you were young,

107
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,860
you couldn't help yourself

108
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,659
when you saw pretty young girls.

109
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,140
Now you are older, but you still can't help yourself

110
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,540
when you meet old flames.

111
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,200
You should be more mature.

112
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,030
You're still the same.

113
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,130
I can never win an argument with you.

114
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,320
I am a diplomat.

115
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,610
The art of talk

116
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,340
is a basic professional ethic.

117
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,540
I think this would be the last time

118
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,790
we meet.

119
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,780
Consider it as a farewell

120
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,260
for everything in our past.

121
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,430
From now on,

122
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,820
we won't contact each other anymore?

123
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,020
We're still friends.

124
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,530
You can come to me if you face any problems.

125
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,659
I'm willing to help.

126
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,430
But I think

127
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,590
you don't need my help

128
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,150
given your current status.

129
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,750
You are different to me.

130
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,650
A friend who is different to you.

131
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,680
We are not young anymore.

132
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,980
Let's not harp on

133
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,100
things that happened

134
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,110
in the past.

135
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,760
We should talk about

136
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,810
the divorce procedure.

137
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,430
If you don't want anything,

138
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,660
I will feel bad.

139
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,360
Have you signed it?

140
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,270
Yes.

141
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,179
Thank you.

142
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,260
Thank you for setting me free.

143
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,400
You have always been free.

144
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,370
That's different.

145
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,000
With your signature,

146
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,640
I can finally belong to myself.

147
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,900
Are there any changes

148
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,030
or something you need to amend on this?

149
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,160
No.

150
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,310
Good.

151
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,940
If so, I don't need to show it to my lawyer.

152
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,600
I trust you.

153
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,280
Next time, we will meet at the divorce registration office.

154
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,140
Actually,

155
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,400
I have a thousand things to say to you.

156
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,750
But,

157
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,150
I don't know how to start.

158
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,240
What do you want to say?

159
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,420
I want to talk about

160
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,050
those days when we were poor.

161
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,450
And those ordinary days.

162
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,580
It was just a short period.

163
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,860
Since your career

164
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,120
got off to a good start,

165
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,090
everything has changed.

166
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,980
Now that I think about it,

167
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,100
it's already blurred.

168
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,670
When people get on in years,

169
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,220
they like to recall the past.

170
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
But, I like to move on.

171
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,360
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

172
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,620
I haven't decided yet.

173
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,320
I'm leaving.

174
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,480
The bill is on you. It's the last bill.

175
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,850
OK, leave it to me.

176
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,700
Remember what I said.

177
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,000
If you need any help,

178
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,090
just tell me.

179
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,660
You too.

180
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,950
Miss Shen.

181
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,090
Hello.

182
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,020
We've met a few times,

183
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,040
but I don't know how to address you.

184
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,680
We probably won't meet each other again,

185
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,650
so you don't need to know my name.

186
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:17,650
OK.

187
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,810
My boss

188
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,760
is the CEO of a listed company.

189
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,940
If there are

190
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,050
any bad rumors...

191
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,680
Don't worry. There won't be.

192
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,660
The things between us

193
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,260
had happened a long time ago.

194
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,710
It's all in the past.

195
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,710
I've warned her.

196
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,730
Have a seat.

197
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,270
I know her well.

198
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,870
You don't have to say those things to her.

199
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,460
I've been with you for so many years.

200
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,190
The women I loved

201
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,360
are all kind by nature.

202
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,660
Come and help me move these things.

203
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,500
OK, brother.

204
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,170
OK, Chen.

205
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,150
Hello, Chen.

206
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,480
Lu Chen.

207
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,830
Your mom has been staying here for days.

208
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,980
Your sister has also visited her before this.

209
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,040
How is she feeling?

210
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,940
Not bad.

211
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,100
It's not the first time

212
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,900
she has wanted to have a divorce.

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,400
We're already used to it.

214
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,340
Aren't you getting used to it yet?

215
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,400
Yes, I'm used to it.

216
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,380
But, I want her to live a better life.

217
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,340
Your mom hasn't eaten today.

218
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,470
When you talk to her,

219
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,180
ask her to eat something.

220
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,110
I'll go over there now.

221
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,430
Mom.

222
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,900
I thought you weren't coming back.

223
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,590
I'm seldom back in Beijing.

224
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,920
Of course I'd come home.

225
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,190
This is not a home.

226
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,060
Don't say those dispiriting words.

227
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,790
Now I am back.

228
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,450
You can rely on me.

229
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,560
Have a seat.

230
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,190
Here.

231
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,090
I drafted this by myself.

232
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,850
At first, I wanted to ask Gui Xiao,

233
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,130
but later I thought

234
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,390
it was between you two.

235
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,980
I'd better keep the details

236
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,050
to myself.

237
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,670
My elder sister, brother-in-law,

238
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,520
and younger sister haven't seen it yet.

239
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,320
Aside from me,

240
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,620
only you and my dad know about it.

241
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,030
It's in duplicate.

242
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:03,910
Mom.

243
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,780
If there's no problem from your side,

244
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,110
I'll pass it on to my dad.

245
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,360
I don't feel like looking over it.

246
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,140
This is your marriage.

247
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,740
You have to make your own decision

248
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,720
for the beginning and the end.

249
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,930
If so, I'll take my time going through it.

250
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:35,750
No hurry.

251
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,730
I'll leave after dinner.

252
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,460
When are you leaving?

253
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,380
Tomorrow.

254
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,060
You're always in a hurry.

255
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,130
It's common

256
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,570
for my profession.

257
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,400
I wish you could be home more often.

258
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
After graduating from high school,

259
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,790
you went to work at Qining

260
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,660
and seldom stayed at home.

261
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,250
I'll always be there for you.

262
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,300
You can rely on me.

263
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,510
Although I'm not in Beijing,

264
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,560
I will be back

265
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,700
whenever you need me.

266
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,310
Have you had lunch already?

267
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,930
I've eaten a few pieces of bread.

268
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,150
I'll cook a meal for you.

269
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,340
No need.

270
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,670
Just wait for me.

271
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,580
No need.

272
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,340
I'm good at cooking, mom.

273
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,000
You're like me.

274
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,170
Yes.

275
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,180
I often watched you cook when I was young,

276
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,140
so I learned how to cook little by little.

277
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,130
Actually, my elder sister is also good at cooking.

278
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,060
If you have time,

279
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,380
visit her home more often

280
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,240
and have a meal.

281
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,620
I don't feel like disturbing her.

282
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,100
When you two were little,

283
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,400
you stayed with me.

284
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,770
Although we were not poor back then,

285
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,900
there was no warmth of home.

286
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,460
Now she has made it.

287
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,890
She has a good husband

288
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,110
and she is living her own life now.

289
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,460
It'll cause her trouble if I go to her.

290
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:57,980
It won't.

291
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,070
You are her mother.

292
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,940
Gui Xiao is a fashion enthusiast.

293
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,200
When I leave this time,

294
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,319
I'll ask her to take you shopping.

295
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,640
We've got the marriage certificate.

296
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,089
From now onwards, she is your daughter-in-law.

297
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:16,300
If you can't reach my elder sister, you may go to Xiao.

298
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,900
Her working hours are flexible.

299
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,700
She can spend more time with you.

300
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,599
You have a home now.

301
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,630
You may wait inside.

302
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,790
It'll be ready soon.

303
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,460
Sure.

304

305
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,350
OK.

Eat slowly.

307
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,560
You should have some too.

308
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,000

Yes.

317
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,130

He deliberately bought those with low alcohol content

322
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,400
to take his time and chat with your dad.

323
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,790
I won't go in with you.

What's there to thank?

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,350
But today,

381
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,240
my mom has made a choice first.

382
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,010
No one will stop you

383
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,290
whether you decide to stay or leave.

384
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,290
It's all up to you.

385
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,080
I just hope

386
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,030
you can make a decision.

387
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,710
Otherwise,

388
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,440
the relationship you've built up all these years

389
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,640
will be ruined by you.

390
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,550
Either you

391
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,700
divorce nicely

392
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,000
or live a life properly with my mom.

393
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,460
It's not that I haven't thought about

394
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,990
living a good life with her.

395
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,800
I'll talk to your mum myself

396
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,180
about the problems between her and me.

397
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,550
OK.

398
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,440
Come on.

399
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,420
When can I meet

400
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,650
my daughter-in-law?

401
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,700
I didn't ask her to come with me today

402
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,900
because of the issue.

403
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,080
But she bought so much food that the car was filled.

404
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,140
I've left half of it

405
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,310
in the garage.

406
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,500
And I'll send the other half

407
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,160
to your current living place.

408
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,700
Xiaoshan's restaurant is really nice.

409
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,580
You can hold

410
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,200
your wedding ceremony here.

411
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,930
Gui Xiao has already discussed this with her.

412
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,970
After we got the marriage certificate,

413
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,700
we took the menu back and let them pick the dishes.

414
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,450
I heard from your elder sister that

415
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,710
Gui Xiao is a good girl.

416
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,890
When you were away,

417
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,650
she looked after your mother

418
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,490
without any complaints.

419
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,250
I will cherish her.

420
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,130
All done.

421
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,730
I've told you a marriage is a happy event.

422
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,020
Your dad won't make an objection.

423
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,940
But you're so nervous

424
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,190
that you even asked Qin Feng

425
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,600
to drink with him in advance.

426
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,090
That was not because of nervousness

427
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,290
but care.

428
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,540
If he really cared,

429
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,440
he shouldn't have broken up with her.

430
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,390
Cut it out.

431
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,960
He's getting married.

432
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,340
Say something nice.

433
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,640
OK, let's talk nicely.

434
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,030
Your banquet is on me.

435
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,550
No way.

436
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,250
Why not?

437
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,630
My wife has said so.

438
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,300
It's a deal.

439
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,580
I also agree with her.

440
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,700
It's my wedding.

441
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,310
What are you agreeing with?

442
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,680
I'm happy for you.

443
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,020
You are my best brother.

444
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,620
And your wife

445
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,860
is my wife's best friend.

446
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,360
Uncle.

447
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,460
Thanks.

448
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,100
The dishes have become tastier.

449
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,970
Thank you.

450
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,560
I'll go find your mom.

451
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,730
Let me give you a ride.

452
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,310
No need.

453
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,370
You've drunk.

454
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,570
Same to you.

455
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,120
I forgot.

456
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,970
OK, I'm leaving.

457
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:47,940
OK.

458
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:48,970
Uncle.

459
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,650
I'll send someone to give you a ride.

460
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,220
No need. I'll walk home.

461
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,380
I'll take my time.

462
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,600
Enjoy your conversation.

463
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,020
I won't bother you.

464
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,080
I haven't been back for a long time.

465
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,060
Take care.

466
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,470
Did you notice that?

467
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,290
Your dad's impression of Gui Xiao

468
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,660
is beyond imagination.

469
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,360
It's really beyond imagination.

470
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,650
[Lu Zheng Automobile Repair]

471
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,020
Are you unoccupied today?

472
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,190
What are you talking about?

473
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,500
What do you mean by unoccupied?

474
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
This is my garage.

475
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,350
I can come whenever I want.

476
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,560
What's wrong? Are you afraid of me?

477
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
Have you met Lu Chen already?

478
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:40,840
Yes.

479
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,130
Did you cook this?

480
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,380
Lu Chen cooked it.

481
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,060
Good kid.

482
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,670
After having a meal with you,

483
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,200
he had another meal with me.

484
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,930
No wonder he didn't eat much

485
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,860
at my place.

486
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,060
He only drank with me.

487
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,710
Have a seat.

488
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,720
Sit.

489
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,260
When our son

490
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,100
asked me to sign the paper,

491
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,230
I had a deep thought.

492
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,300
After we were married,

493
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,660
you suffered a lot

494
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,790
and went through hardships.

495
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,830
I feel…

496
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,740
Anyway, I feel sorry for you.

497
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,740
Don't say that.

498
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,800
In fact, you have not

499
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,180
treated us badly in terms of livelihood.

500
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,990
At least...

501
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:40,890
Yes.

502
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,510
At least when your second husband

503
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,850
passed away,

504
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,010
I remarried you.

505
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,890
I did well on this one, right?

506
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,620
I had to take care of my children,

507
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,530
but I didn't have any income.

508
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,140
You helped me back then.

509
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,480
-I really appreciated that.
-No.

510
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,980
Among those kids,

511
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,620
two of them

512
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,590
were ours.

513
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,190
After divorce,

514
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,120
don't drink too much.

515
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,770
Take care of yourself

516
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,040
even without having someone to tell you to do so.

517
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,580
I would like to discuss something with you.

518
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,700
I won't sign the paper.

519
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,160
And let's not divorce.

520
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,150
From now on,

521
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,930
you will still be in charge of the family.

522
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,860
You're the boss.

523
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,080
I'll also listen to you to control my temper.

524
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,500
You can evaluate my performance.

525
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,400
At this age,

526
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,810
I don't want to deal with divorce anymore.

527
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,430
Keep this.

528
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,830
Don't tell anyone, okay?

529
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:24,420
Well,

530
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,020
today is a good day.

531
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,950
Finish your job earlier

532
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,220
and let's call it a day.

533
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,620
It's been a long time since we gathered.

534
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,220
I'll ask Meng Xiaoshan

535
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,670
to deliver some dishes from her restaurant.

536
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,020
Let's eat together in the garage.

537
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,950
And you guys too.

538
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,840
With me being here, you don't have to order food from the restaurant.

539
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,370
Tong,

540
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,820
buy some groceries.

541
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,610
Tonight,

542
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,930
I will show you my fine cooking skills.

543
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,370
Mom,

544
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,670
something is wrong with you today.

545
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,540
I'm happy.

546
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,360
Did anything happen?

547
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,090
No, of course not.

548
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,860
Forget it. I'll go with you.

549
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,660
I know the people in the market.

550
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,020
OK.

551
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,000
Let's go.

552
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,140
Your smile looks

553
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,180
just like the one you had

554
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,180
when you abandoned my dad back then.

555
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,230
Am I that kind of person?

556
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,820
He just called me.

557
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,780
He was so sad that he couldn't speak.

558
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,310
His words were incoherent.

559
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,280
Look at you.

560
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,480
You're all beaming.

561
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,690
You should at least

562
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,040
look sad.

563
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,210
I'm not sad.

564
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,710
I was sad back then,

565
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,630
but now it's over.

566
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,100
Now you're forcing me to be sad.

567
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,610
What's your motive?

568
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,710
You're too calm.

569
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,550
This is your mom's style.

570
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,810
Too...

571
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,320
Enough.

572
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,190
Come.

573
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,490
Let me have a look at my little grandson

574
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,180
and my little granddaughter.

575
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,240
By the way,

576
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,980
do you like boys or girls?

577
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:03,750
I like both.

578
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,330
It's mine anyway.

579
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,780
Same old place.

580
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,860
You are such a nostalgic.

581
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,860
It's always here.

582
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,180
This place makes me calm.

583
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,400
You look happy.

584
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,820
Happy to see your wife?

585
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:35,840
Of course.

586
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,380
But from your look, it seems that

587
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,980
there's something happier.

588
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,940
My parents aren't making a fuss anymore.

589
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,940
It really

590
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,070
puts my mind at ease.

591
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,140
I won't worry that much when I'm on a mission.

592
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,030
Did your parents get back together?

593
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,680
Sort of.

594
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,760
So you asked me

595
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,880
to watch people fishing with you?

596
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,960
I want you to go to the garage

597
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,580
and keep an eye out for my dad.

598
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,760
He's quite happy today.

599
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,860
He drank at lunch.

600
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,050
I think he will drink more tonight.

601
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,390
Keep an eye on him.

602
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,820
I have to go home to accompany Gui Xiao.

603
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,000
Well...

604
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,150
I can promise you

605
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,050
anything else.

606
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,770
But your dad...

607
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,920
I am afraid of your dad.

608
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,100
I've been traumatized since I was young.

609
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,730
Think about it.

610
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,940
I used to visit others back then.

611
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,670
But I dared not go to your house.

612
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,400
It'll be fine. Don't worry.

613
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,830
I'm going back to Tianwen SWAT tomorrow.

614
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,730
I have to go home now.

615
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,590
Gui Xiao is waiting for me at home.

616
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,900
OK, go ahead.

617
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,360
Leave your dad to me.

618
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,760
You're so rude.

619
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,510
You're leaving just like that?

620
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,100
When Meng Xiaoshan got married,

621
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,230
you drove to my place

622
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,680
and stayed for a month.

623
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,220
Were you polite to me?

624
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:02,530
I...

625
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,620
I will build up my courage

626
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,020
before I go to the garage.

627
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,430
Your dad, right?

628
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,120
Thank you.

629
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,650
Hai Dong is here.

630
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,260
Coming.

631
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,590
Lu Chen asked me to check on you.

632
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,900
He's afraid you and your mom will suffer.

633
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,420
No need.

634
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,620
My dad is so nice today.

635
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,870
He's like a different person.

636
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,600
Really? You're not lying to me?

637
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,290
When have I ever lied to you?

638
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,190
I don't know what happened.

639
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,500
But I'm happy

640
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,480
as long as he doesn't make a scene.

641
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,370
Me too.

642
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,620
The garage manager is here.

643
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,550
Hai Dong is here.

644
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,390
Have a seat.

645
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,030
Here.

646
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,630
It's okay.

647
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,540
You guys talk.

648
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,870
I'll help my mom pack up.

649
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,310
Hai Dong.

650
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,170
Come on, sit next to me.

651
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,290
Here, next to me.

652
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,200
Hai Dong.

653
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,500
How old are you?

654
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,460
I...

655
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,740
He's about Lu Chen's age.

656
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,730
They're from the same grade.

657
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,020
Yes.

658
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,200
When Lu Chen was away,

659
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,040
you helped us a lot.

660
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,429
I have to thank you.

661
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,280
Uncle,

662
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,400
we're neighbors. Besides,

663
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,199
Lu Chen and I are sworn brothers.

664
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,929
It's my duty.

665
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,050
That won't do.

666
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,100
I should thank you officially.

667
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:20,590
Thank you.

668
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,250
What are you waiting for?

669
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,050
Stand up and say you're welcome.

670
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,830
You're welcome, uncle.

671
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,220
Your smile…

672
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,370
Looks like you've solved the problem.

673
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,770
What about your parents?

674
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,850
My dad is still reluctant.

675
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,450
But my mom is very satisfied.

676
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,180
Next, we should

677
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,730
solve our own problem.

678
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,640
What problem?

679
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,410
To live our own lives.

680
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,430
It's a must for me to deal with my family matters.

681
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,650
I know.

682
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,480
I haven't been with you for half a day.

683
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,280
I feel guilty.

684
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,900
For what?

685
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,900
That's also your home.

686
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,790
You don't say it,

687
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,520
but I know you still love your parents.

688
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,750
Now it's all settled,

689
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,750
I feel at ease too.

690
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,030
I'll take care of your mom when she's sick.

691
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,230
That's not a problem.

692
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:47,930
But,

693
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,580
I am not familiar with your dad.

694
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,000
Hai Dong talked about him a few times.

695
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,950
I'm actually a bit nervous.

696
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,340
Hai Dong has been facing him for so many years,

697
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,620
but he is still afraid of him.

698
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,340
It's normal for you to be nervous.

699
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,200
I'm afraid I can't handle it well.

700
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,730
You don't have to handle

701
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,040
our family affairs.

702
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,640
We are a family.

703
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,790
I brought you something.

704
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,170
Did you buy that many?

705
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,470
I bought one at first,

706
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,870
but I thought it was too lonely.

707
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,200
So I bought a few more.

708
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:49,990
But then, I thought

709
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,100
it would be better to make a whole set.

710
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,040
So I bought ten.

711
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,190
I'll buy all the 56 dolls

712
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,030
for you in the future.

713
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,170
So cute.

714
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,010
What did you tell your dad?

715
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,380
Well...

716
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,430
Don't think that Lu Chen wants something from me.

717
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,140
Although I rented this house,

718
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,940
and we've been together

719
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,880
for half a year,

720
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,280
he hasn't even stayed

721
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,410
more than two weeks.

722
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,450
The car is mine.

723
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,040
Lu Chen has just repaired it twice

724
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,690
and hasn't driven it many times.

725
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,650
Lu Chen only desires me.

726
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,310
He's been like that since he was young.

727
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:36,940
What else?

728
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,270
I forgot.

729
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,630
Anyway, they were all compliments to you.

730
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,810
You didn't shave.

731
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,340
I forgot.

757
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:18,630
What's wrong?

758
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,250
♫Can I see you?♫

759
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,620
Just leave the door open.

760
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,670
♫Let the heartbeat continue 110♫

761
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,970
♫It's so troublesome♫

762
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,730
♫You haven't got up yet♫

763
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,970
♫You didn't see my message♫

764
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,070
♫Did anyone tell you♫

765
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,660
Why did you close the glass door?

The water will splash out if I don't close it.

♫You still need to be quiet♫

770
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,400
Just wipe it later.

♫Even the moon is awakened♫

772
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,940
You can't see me even if it's open.

773
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,600
It'll fog up.

774
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,510
♫Even meteors stop♫

775
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,760

♫Love songs are popular♫

777
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,540
It's easier to talk like this.

778
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,880
♫I'll sing for you♫

779
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,390

Go back to your bed.

793

Don't catch a cold.

794
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,400
I'm wrapped in a blanket.

795
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,330
Can you go back now?

796
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,400
The blanket.

797

any old friend today?

800

Hai Dong.

801
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,150
This doesn't count.
