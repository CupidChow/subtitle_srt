00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,650
Call me back when you're free. Lu Chen.

5
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,600
Sir, your noodles.

6
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,300
Lu Chen.

7
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,610
Did you catch a cold?

8
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,220
Probably.

9
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:08,860
Why are you

10
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,370
so late for lunch?

11
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,180
I had some business.

12
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,180
It took me a while.

13
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,560
Have your lunch first.

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,300
We'll talk about it later.

15
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,010
What noodles are you eating?

16
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,550
Lanzhou beef soup noodles.

17
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,910
Make some noise while you're eating.

18
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,700
I can't see.

19
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,730
But I can hear you.

20
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:53,720
Boss.

21
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,990
Long time no see.

22
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,740
Are you back from your honeymoon?

23
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,300
Yes, we went to Chengdu.

24
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,180
I kept half a box of drinks

25
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,980
here when I came last time.

26
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,660
Please get it for me.

27
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,260
Okay. Sure.

28
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,630
Wait.

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,850
I'll take it for you.

30
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,320
You need to see a doctor when you're sick.

31
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,280
I can't take so many pills.

32
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,660
And I don't want to go to the hospital.

33
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,900
It'll be bad

34
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,050
if I get infected with other diseases.

35
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:49,970
Don't worry.

36
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,500
I’ll drink more warm water.

00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,420
Lu Chen.

38
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,930
What are you wearing?

39
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,500
A brown shirt.

40
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,080
Black cargo pants.

41
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,910
Is there any pattern on your shirt?

42
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,540
No.

43
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,460
How long is your hair now?

44
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,580
It's the same length

45
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,840
the last time I met you.

46
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,540
Did you shave?

47
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,620
Do you look handsome?

48
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,060
Not bad.

49
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,340
What do you mean by "not bad?"

50
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,330
I've never seen anyone more handsome than you.

51
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,060
Do I have no other merits

52
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,100
other than

53
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,740
my handsome face?

54
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,260
People with good looks

55
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,920
are naturally advantageous.

56
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,180
When we first met,

57
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,470
I gave you 100 points.

58
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,950
The more we spent time together, the more points you got.

59
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,480
You're good at everything.

60
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,650
Of course I'd be

61
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,620
200 percent in love with you.

62
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,580

63
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,710

64
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,840
your contribution will be great.

65
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,540
I will love you 300 percent.

66
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,400
That works too.

67
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:57,980
I'll try.

68
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,690
Do you know when you're coming back yet?

69
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,580
These two days.

70
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,730
I'll be back

71
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,160
this week.

72
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,100
Get ready.

73
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,740
This week?

74
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,670
Yes.

75
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,380
So suddenly?

76
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,180
Why?

77
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,550
I can't tell you.

78
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,140
Okay.

79
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,100
Okay.

80
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,230
I'll get ready.

81
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,080
Once your plane has landed,

82
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,680
meet me at your convenience.

83
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,380
Bye.

84
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,490
I heard about what had happened

85
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,950
at the construction site.

86
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,940
The people from the Civil Explosion Company

87
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,070
will wrap things up.

88
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,340
Our cooperation mission

89
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:20,890
is over.

90
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,270
Your superior called me this morning

91
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,900
to inform me that the one-month deadline is up

92
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,500
and asked

93
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,130
when I will let you back.

94
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,800
My original plan

95
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,180
was to hold a farewell party for you.

96
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,980
But, look at the situation now...

97
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,620
I’m here for this too.

98
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,280
Mr. Shen had no son.

99
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,040
We were close.

100
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,740
This time,

101
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,320
I want to send him back.

102
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,200
It can be considered as accompanying a hero's last journey.

103
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,280
Let's cancel the farewell party.

104
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,900
We'll meet again someday.

105
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,260
Yes.

106
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,900
Someday.

107
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,310
No need to wipe away your tears.

108
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,820
It's not embarrassing to cry.

109
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,490
I'm fine.

110
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,060
I was just

111
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,490
reminiscing about the old captain.

112
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,700
They were all good people.

113
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,620
Why did everything end up...

114
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,760
Things are unpredictable.

115
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,020
I’ve made a report

116
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,810
to send Mr. Shen back to Beijing.

117
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,290
We should send him back.

118
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,760
We're ought to do so.

119
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,500
He's old.

120
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,310
And he doesn't have anyone to send him off.

121
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,390
He contributed his whole life to the country,

122
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,460
I admire him.

123
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,830
Aren't you going back to the squad?

124
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,510

Don't slack off.

142

I will stay for dinner tonight.

143

144

149
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,610
You came back earlier than I thought.

150

This is my second hometown.

151
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,810
I have to come back.

152
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,580
You have been eating well.

153
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,910
You've gained weight.

154
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,200
I've gained not only weight,

155
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,660
but also about three to four years' worth of experience

156
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,590
with Captain Lu in this past month.

157
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,340
Okay.

158
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,460
I'll be looking forward to your year-end training test results.

159
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,870
Why did you come back suddenly?

160
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,270
Without telling anyone.

161
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,150
Fine, I'll stop asking.

162
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,060

The seedlings in the fields

166
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,060
because of the sunshine...

167
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,060
Alright. Stop looking at me.

168
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,650
I'm happy, okay?

169
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,340
I know.

170
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,940
I'm happy too.

171
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:47,980
Two eggs.

172
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,310
We get one each.

173
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,040
Okay.

174
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,420
How about

175
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,280
I make us tomato braised noodles?

176
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,060
Actually,

177
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,730
we can make do with plain soup noodles.

178
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,710
Think I can't cook?

179
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,740
Uncle Lu said,

180
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,120
"Honesty is the best policy."

181
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,500
Fine.

182
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,670
I admit

183
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,620
my tomato braised noodles don't taste good.

184
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,880
Let's not have it then.

185
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,220
I'll drive you

186
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,950
to Aunt Duan Rou's house later.

187
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,880
Not bad.

188

You got your marriage certificate so soon.

189

Does Gui Yuanshan know?

190
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,360
I didn’t tell him

191
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,420
so that he won’t trouble Lu Chen.

192
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,750
What about his parents?

193
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,970
His mother knows.

194
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,090
His father doesn't know about it yet.

195
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,990
His family is quite complicated.

196
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,820
But based on

197
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,350
your relationship status,

198
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,070
it's inappropriate for both sides' parents

199
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,420
to not meet each other.

200
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,550
He's not in Beijing now anyway.

201
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,860
Hello.

202
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:26,860
Hello.

203
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,660
Hello, I’m Lu Chen’s sister.

204
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,510
I have flexible working hours.

205
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,340
Next time,

206
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,570
you can come to me anytime.

207
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,120
It's mainly because there's no one at home.

208
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,020
My husband is on a business trip.

209
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,260
I need to take care of both of my children.

210
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:43,800
My dad...

211
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,400
He's drunk and sleeping at home.

212
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,260
I have looked for Haidong,

213
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,790
but he's not around either.

214
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,780
We are family.

215
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,240
Lu Chen told me

216
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,270
you are usually busy with work.

217
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,610
But no matter how busy I am,

218
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,270
family always comes first.

219
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:03,960
Don't worry.

220
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,060
Go and keep your children company.

221
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,660
Can you handle it yourself?

222
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,440
My mom came with me.

223
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,480
If I can't handle it,

224
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,920
I will tell you.

225
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:13,570
Okay.

226
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,460
I'll give you my number.

227
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,300
Didn't you call me

228
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,190
just now?

229
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,410
I saved your number.

230
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,180
Look at me.

231
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,100
I'm so muddled.

232
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,980
I'll get going then.

233
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,510
Go ahead.

234
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,340
Thank you.

235
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,290
You're welcome.

236
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,180
Here.

237
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,940
Women should eat more fruits.

238
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,260
I'll go

239
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,850
and buy more for you later.

240
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,040
Let Xiao wash them.

241
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,280
Eat more when you have time.

242
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,580
It's good for your skin.

243
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,240
The fruits are getting more and more expensive.

244
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,950
I can't afford to buy it.

245
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,290
I'll get Xiao to order it weekly.

246
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,600
Order it weekly

247
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,110
and send it to you by courier.

248
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:56,830
No, no, no.

249
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,660
No.

250
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,980
It's okay.

251
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,760
We are a family from now on.

252
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,820
It's her duty

253
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,020
to buy things for you.

254
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,930
It's a waste not to enjoy

255
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,530
when our child can afford it.

256
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,530
Auntie.

257
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,120
Is there anything

258
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,320
you would like to eat?

259
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,540
I'll order for you.

260
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,490
There are meals provided in the hospital.

261
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,410
It's cheaper.

262
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,620
Don't make do with it.

263
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,860
Order what you like.

264
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,710
Here, give me.

265
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,540
Look.

266
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,380
My kids

267
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,960
always order delivery at home.

268
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,860
I-I've never ordered anything before.

269
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
What should we eat?

270
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,530
What kind of cuisine

271
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,930
do you like?

272
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,080
Spicy ones.

273
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,580
I like spicy food.

274
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
My husband doesn't like spicy food.

275
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,570
That's why I've never gotten to

276
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,030
eat any spicy food at home.

277
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,670
You never get to eat spicy food

278
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,680
just because he dislikes it?

279
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,700
Why did you

280
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,830
compromise so much?

281
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,900
Your marriage is so not worth it.

282
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,180
He can't compromise with you.

283
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,460
You are the only one compromising.

284
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,700
Are you looking for a husband

285
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,620
or a son?

286
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,740
Well...

287
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,200
Okay, this one.

288
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,870
I-I-I...

289
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,420
One dish and one rice.

290
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,210
Four dishes and one soup.

291
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:10,610
No.

292
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,290
There are three of us.

293
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,350
Five dishes.

294
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,060
Okay.

295
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,880
I've asked Gui Xiao

296
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,930
on the way here.

297
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,100
Actually,

298
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,500
we are about the same age.

299
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,950
But you look

300
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,340
much younger than me.

301
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,270
I live an easy life.

302
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,340
I mean

303
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,680
I live with ease.

304
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,820
Actually,

305
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,150
you can treat me as your friend.

306
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,380
When you have time,

307
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,110
we can have a call or a nice chat.

308
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,150
Gradually,

309
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,770
we'll become closer.

310
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,800
Given the personalities of Xiao and Lu Chen,

311
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,050
things will never change between them.

312
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,650
Yes.

313
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,350
Lu Chen has always been strong-willed since young.

314
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,540
He will keep liking what he likes.

315
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,770
About the previous engagement,

316
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,500
you...

317
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,720
It's over.

318
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,390
I've ordered.

319
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,880
It'll be delivered soon.

320
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,180
Don't worry.

321
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:17,600
Okay.

322
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,630
Call the nurse if you need anything.

323
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,000
You have to work tomorrow.

324
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,500
Sleep whenever you have time tonight.

325
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:28,980
I know.

326
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,680
Her sister will come tonight.

327
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,080
I don't need to accompany her for the night.

328
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,060
It's better to be a mother-in-law.

329
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,340
I've never enjoyed

330
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,370
your company.

331
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,520
Do you want to get sick?

332
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
I'm just jealous.

333
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,110
Jealous?

334
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,550
You can always move back.

335
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,590
Move back to Beijing.

336
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,740
I have a room for you.

337
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:49,870
No.

338
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,020
You're used to being independent.

339
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,910
Me too.

340
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,660
I'm even afraid you would interfere

341
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,160
in my private life.

342
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,860
All right.

343
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,030
The car is here. You should leave.

344
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,740
You don't want me to accompany you?

345
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,100
No, I can manage.

346
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,000
Okay.

347
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,090
Bye.

348
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,100
Xiao.

349
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,980
Let's talk.

350
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,170
Come.

351
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:39,940
Sit here.

352
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,660
Auntie,

353
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,340
the doctor wants you to rest more.

354
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,500
Why don't you take a nap

355
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,360
to recuperate?

356
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,910
I’ve been lying for most of the day today. I’m not sleepy.

357
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,170
The year when Lu Chen graduated from high school,

358
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,310
there was always a girl

359
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,210
who came to the repair factory to look for him.

360
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,140
It's you, right?

361
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,140
Yes.

362
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,480
Seriously.

363
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,740
It's been years.

364
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:06,740
Looking at you

365
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,780
and your mother's outfits,

366
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,730
you must be from a well-off family.

367
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,380
Not bad.

368
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,210
Do your parents get along well?

369
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,460
They divorced

370
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,859
when I was in university.

371
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Did they remarry?

372
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,540
No.

373
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,140
My mom is quite stubborn.

374
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,930
Since she decided to divorce,

375
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,330
she had never changed her mind.

376
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,840
Although it's my dad's fault,

377
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,380
she was very calm the day she moved out.

378
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,760
She talked about the thinking process of

379
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,310
how she decided to divorce.

380
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,460
From the hesitation

381
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,660
to the frustration,

382
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,980
and finally, they divorced.

383
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,050
It is considered as

384
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,170
an explanation

385
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,530
for this relationship.

386
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,140
She told me afterward.

387
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,540
I think she did a good job.

388
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,820
Isn't she lonely

389
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,220
living alone?

390
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,440
Many people don't feel lonely

391
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,420
even if they don't get married in their whole life.

392
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,470
What's wrong?

393
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,380
Are you sad?

394
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:47,810
Tell me.

395
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,650
What are you doing?

396
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,710
What are you doing?

397
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,060
Hello.

398
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,780
The return time is decided.

399
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,310
I will arrive in the morning the day after tomorrow.

400
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,150
Get ready.

401
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,090
Sure.

402
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,670
What would you like to eat? I'll go grocery shopping.

403
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,550
You can buy

404
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,090
whatever you want.

405
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,160
My car broke down

406
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,420
and you're back at the right time.

407
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,820
You are indeed my savior.

408
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,260
I am

409
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,670
the captain of the SWAT.

410
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,500
But you always make me sound like

411
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,780
I'm still a teenager

412
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,190
who is only capable of repairing cars.

413
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,340
Well,

414
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,060
I have a project and

415
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,610
I need a Russian translator.

416
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,670
Will you come back and help me with it?

417
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,130
You can send it to me now.

418
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,340
I can check on it on the train tonight.

419
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,140
It saves time.

420
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,750
Aren't you going to sleep?

421
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,740
I'll find time

422
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,420
to sleep.

423
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:13,730
No.

424
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,190
I'll find another translator.

425
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,290
Let me try.

426
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,730
I also want to learn from things

427
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,710
that I've never tried before.

428
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,830
Lu Chen, you’re so ambitious now.

429
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,160
Gui Xiao.

430
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,480
Watch your tone.

431
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,980
I have to go.

432
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,160
I have something to do.

433
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,660
Well,

434
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,380
don't worry about your family.

435
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,740
Your sister called me.

436
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,020
She said everything is fine at home.

437
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,630
I'm hanging up. Bye.

438
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,800
Every time I hear you talking to Xiao,

439
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,000
it reminds me of my first love.

440
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,860
You still can't get over your first love?

441
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,390
No.

442
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,750
It's just that feeling.

443
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,020
The feeling of childhood sweethearts.

444
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,940
She is like this.

445
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,020
Still a child.

446
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,340
She always thinks she's mature.

447
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,020
Yet,

448
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,360
she's still innocent.

449
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,040
Since you are going to stay till night,

450
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,860
any plans in the afternoon?

451
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,580
The shooting range.

452
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,260
Sure.

453
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,870
Why don't we arrange a shooting training?

454
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,080
Ask them to join us.

455
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,160
Gather at the shooting range!

456
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,400
Switch!

457
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,180
Forward!

458
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:40,350
Switch!

459
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,630
Why do you bring the dogs to the shooting training?

460
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,580
They've never seen Captain Lu practice shooting.

461
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,980
Let Captain Lu show them.

462
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay.

463
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,480
Switch!

464
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,400
Switch!

465
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,730
You

466
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,740
have never seen this former captain.

467
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,140
Let's have a good look today.

468
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,000
He's the legend

469
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,000
of our shooting range.

470
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,700
His admiration for you

471
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,660
is

472
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,130
incredible.

473
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,300
How enviable.

474
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,710
He's your subordinate after all.

475
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,310
Of course.

476
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,320
I have a strong heart.

477
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:17,890
Yeah.

478
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,380
You’re a captain now.

479
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,070
How about

480
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,540
a game?

481
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,220
What game?

482
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,760
Let's start with a simple one.

483
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,290
Go ahead.

484
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,030
Coins.

485
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,630
Yes.

486
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:05,920
Good shot!

487
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,570
Bravo!

488
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,960
Haven't found your accuracy yet?

489
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,410
I'm a slow starter.

490
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,380
Start slowly then.

491
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,740
Switch to the next one.

492
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,270
Yes, sir.

493
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,120
Good shot!

494
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,180
Nice!

495
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:54,710
Bravo!

496
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,180
Bravo!

497
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:56,970
Captain.

498
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,220
Your engine

499
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,700
hasn't been heated up yet.

500
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,250
Former captain

501
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,450
is already five kilometers ahead of you.

502
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,360
Cut the crap.

503
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:04,800
Have you heard of

504
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,930
the story of the tortoise and the hare?

505
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,500
I prefer leading right from the start.

506
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,110
Running your mouth now.

507
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:15,780
Don't you know

508
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,110
who is your captain?

509
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,300
Captain Qin.

510
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,620
We have the freedom to speak.

511
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,350
This is the old rule of our team.

512
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,340
How come when it's time for you to talk,

513
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:23,940
you have nothing to say?

514
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,960
While there's no need for you to talk,

515
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,060
you have so much to say.

516
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,430
Go.

517
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,180
Good shot!

518
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,820
Bravo! Bravo!

519
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,590
Don't you know that men all make mistakes?

520
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,170
Just now,

521
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,200
I missed the shot because of them.

522
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:57,910
Roger.

523
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,910
All three strikes!

524
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,060
Bravo! Bravo!

525
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,450
Are you taking advantage of the chaos?

526
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,550
You are not calm enough.

527
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,630
Is the match still going on?

528
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,310
Of course.

529
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,870
I'll finish what I started.

530
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,270
Don't disturb me this time.

531
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,270
I can end this match with at least three to two.

532
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:51,910
Captain Lu.

533
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,850
Do you and Officer Qin

534
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,540
have something on your mind?

535
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,840
How did you know?

536
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:00,920
You returned

537
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,170
without telling anyone.

538
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,430
That's not your style.

539
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,550
And I heard

540
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,140
you had an important mission this time.

541
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,320
You even came to borrow Gao Hai.

542
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,440
Time must be tight.

543
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,730
You won't have the free time to shoot here.

544
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,530
This is not what you guys will do.

545
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,410
Good analysis.

546
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:15,720
Go on.

547
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,010
Besides,

548
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,230
you and Officer Qin

549
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,830
seldom have extra training.

550
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,140
As you have said before,

551
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,510
"Balancing work and rest is very important.

552
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,760
We should not only be good cops,

553
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,210
but also live a good life."

554
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,080
In general,

555
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,220
I think you are in a bad mood.

556
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,000
As for Officer Qin,

557
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,180
he's worse at hiding what's on his mind than you are.

558
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,700
He has never been

559
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,900
so impetuous in his shooting training.

560
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,900
Your guesses are correct.

561
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,290
But I can't tell you

562
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:40,950
the reason.

563
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,990
I understand.

564
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,100
I'll go and prepare

565
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,840
the barbecue grills.

566
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,460
Tonight,

567
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,040
dinner at the usual place.

568
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,460
Brat.

569
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:54,770
Relax.

570
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,700
Do what you should do.

571
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,400
I know it all.

572
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,470
Consider this trip

573
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,560
as a visit to your family.

574
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,450
Everyone here

575
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,550
is your family.

576
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,350
Put your mind at ease.

577
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,840
I feel relaxed after coming back here.

578
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,640
But every time something like this happens,

579
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,430
it reminds me of the old captain.

580
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,350
Captain Qin.

581
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,370
You have to hit this shot.

582
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,690
Quiet.

583
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,640
Leave me alone.

584
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,490
Captain Qin. You got it!

585
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,860
Bravo!

586
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,130
What a relief!

587
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,370
Zhong.

588
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,450
Hurry up.

589
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,540
So much food.

590
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,820
A meal now is a meal less.

591
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,810
From now on,

592
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,370
I will think about your cooking every day.

593
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,730
I will come back

594
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,480
every annual holiday.

595
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,340
Forget it.

596
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,270
Even if you agree,

597
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,420
your girlfriend won't agree.

598
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,460
You have only a few holidays.

599
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,350
You'd better stay at home

600
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,010
and keep your family company.

601
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,860
She's my wife now.

602
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:40,680
So soon?

603
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,430
We got the marriage certificate.

604
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,610
But I don't have time to hold a wedding ceremony yet.

605
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,020
Maybe next year.

606
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,540
I have some missions going on

607
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,340
until the next Spring Festival.

608
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,820
We'll celebrate the Spring Festival first.

609
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,280
And after she gives birth,

610
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,580
she needs to recover.

611
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,610
It'll be the year after next year.

612
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,630
It's too cold to get married in winter.

613
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,890
She loves to be pretty.

614
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,810
I don't want her

615
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,200
to wear a wedding dress

616
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,160
in cold weather.

617
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,580
Wait, wait.

618
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,430
What did you say?

619
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,230
You even have a child now?

620
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,580
This is double happiness.

621
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,450
Indeed.

622
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,690
But today,

623
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,430
please don't share the news with them.

624
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,020
I don't want to celebrate today.

625
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,820
I understand.

626
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,720
Everyone has their moment of weakness.

627
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:30,910
Zhong.

628
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,380
Can you do it?

629
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,990
Look how timid you are.

630
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,350
Let me do it.
I can do it.

631
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,460
There's no need for you to help.

632
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,440
Please be seated.

633
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,060
Let me do it.

634
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,940
How can we let you do it?

635
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,740
We're the youngsters.

636
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,320
That's right.

637
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,790
Yeah.

638
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,090
He thinks we're good for nothing.

639
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,050
Let me tell you.

640
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,940
You can have a good meal today.

641
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,940
My cooking skills

642
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,050
are as good as Lu.

643
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,810
Excuse me.

644
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,520
Don't...

645
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,370
Make way.

646
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,610
Seeing Captain Lu reminds me of a lot of things.

647
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,410
What is it?

648
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,460
Only compliments are allowed tonight,

649
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,010
no bad words to each other.

650
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,910
Keep your voice down.

651
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,040
Zhong is asleep.

652
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:15,960
Captain Lu.

653
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:16,840
You definitely

654
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,440
never slept with him before.

655
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,220
Back then,

656
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,130
we played cards

657
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,060
and watched movies.

658
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,100
And he can still sleep.

659
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,760
This volume can't wake him up.

660
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,780
This is not the sensitivity

661
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,840
a SWAT should have.

662
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,160
However,

663
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,880
when the phone rings,

664
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,930
he will wake up immediately.

665
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,890
No delay.

666
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,520
I can testify.

667
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,190
I have seen it before.

668
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,820
He joined late.

669
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,550
I didn't get to lead him.

670
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,010
I have no idea

671
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,690
about his sleeping habits.

672
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,610
However,

673
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,580
I was indeed unqualified previously.

674
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,520
Captain Lu,

675
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,960
you are good at everything.

676
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,220
But there's one single thing that you are not good enough at.

677
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,620
You like to self-reflect

678
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,090
and put blame on yourself.

679
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,770
I agree.

680
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,980
The ancients self-reflect three times a day.

681
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,140
You can reflect on yourself 17 to 18 times a day.

682
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,060
Fine.

683
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,790
I'll change.

684
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,250
Listen.

685
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,590
You have to change.

686
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,470
Loosen up.

687
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,320
You need to relax, Captain Lu.

688
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,340
But

689
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,780
his psychological quality

690
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,710
is his weakness.

691
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,570
He has to face the reality.

692
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,450
Speaking of the past,

693
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,060
let me tell you

694
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,040
Captain Qin’s love story.

695
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,550
Didn’t we just agree

696
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,310
to not say anything bad about each other tonight?

697
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,670
I'm not talking bad about you.

698
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,140
I was going to talk about your first love.

699
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,980
My first love?

700
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:51,780
Who?

701
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,000
You weren't here at that time.

702
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
He just came here.

703
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,330
A few female colleagues were sent by the brigade.

704
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,320
He had a crush on

705
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,220
one of them.

706
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,500
Bullshit!

707
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,910
Are you trying to deny it?

708
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,580
That's not true.

709
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,780
Why should I admit it?

710
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,530
No.

711
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,630
Captain Qin.

712
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,540
Captain Lu

713
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,320
has been talking to me all this while.

714
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,450
Stop interrupting.

715
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,140
In our squad,

716
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,600
you are the most experienced in romance.

717
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,860
Don't pretend to be innocent.

718
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,990
I'm not pretending.

719
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,220
He's talking nonsense.

720
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,150
That's not true.

721
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,540
That female colleague

722
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:22,780
is capable,

723
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,570
beautiful,

724
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,450
and ambitious.

725
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,130
Many people in our squad

726
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:26,860
pursued her.

727
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,680
I didn’t know

728
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,560
Captain Qin would be interested.

729
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,520
There's one time

730
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,510
we're both in the office.

731
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,450
That female colleague

732
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,890
talked to me about work.

733
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,110
No.

734
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,310
When did it happen?

735
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,470
Why don't I remember?

736
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,240
And then?

737
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,900
The story ends here.

738
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,180
He left after that.

739
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,530
How do you know

740
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,190
Captain Qin had a crush on her?

741
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,740
Lu Yanchen, don’t talk nonsense.

742
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,620
After she left,

743
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,300
I went behind Captain Qin

744
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:51,700
to see

745
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,450
the documents on his computer.

746
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,470
I found that

747
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,700
he was holding a bun,

748
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,540
calm and cool,

749
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,620
expressionless,

750
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,310
using it as a mouse.

751
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,580
Lu Yanchen.

752
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,490
What are you talking about?

753
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,580
It's way too obvious.

754
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,460
No, that day,

755
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,200
I wasn't feeling well.

756
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,330
I took the wrong one.

757
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,670
Captain Qin.

758
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,760
It's not shameful to have a crush.

759
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,710
You're a SWAT.

760
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,020
Can't you distinguish a mouse and a bun?

761
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,500
No.

762
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,780
I was on night duty the night before.

763
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,770
I wasn't in a good state.

764
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,390
It seems Captain Qin

765
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,510
wants more evidence and cases.

766
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:32,980
Right?

767
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,360
Fine.

768
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,350
I did like her for a while.

769
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,210
A while?

770
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,110
Quite a while, okay?

771
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:49,990
Tell me more.

772
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,130
You have been pretending to sleep?

773
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:54,710
No, Captain Qin.

774
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,640
I didn't mean to.

775
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,810
Captain Lu rarely comes back.

776
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,510
I thought you two must want to have a chat.

777
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,710
I don't want to sleep.

778
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,310
Wang, it's all your fault.

779
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,600
You insisted that I slept deeply.

780
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,610
How can I open my eyes?

781
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,250
Fine.

782
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,590
Let me tell you one more.

783
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,360
OK. OK.

784
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,060
Lu Yanchen.

785
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,159
You better...

786
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,810
I still remember

787
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,070
when we first moved in,

788
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,620
we had cleaned this floor

789
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,810
for quite some days.

790
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:29,900
Yes.

791
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,010
We painted the walls.

792
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,010
Zhang,

793
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,110
thank you

794
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,219
for solving such a big problem

795
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,500
for our brigade.

796
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,310
My house is empty anyway.

797
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,540
It's better to rent it to our people

798
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,199
than renting it to outsiders.

799
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:49,870
Look.

800
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,540
It's really good

801
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,739
after refurbishing.

802
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,680
It's indeed lively to live together.

803
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,490
However,

804
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,880
everything is good

805
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,540
but the lack of

806
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,000
an independent bathroom.

807
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,630
In the early years, the factory's dorm

808
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,090
shared the same bathroom.

809
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,260
The rent is cheap and

810
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,600
it's close to the police force.

811
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,830
That's more than enough.

812
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,590
Sharing a bathroom is not a big deal.

813
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,080
Yes.

814
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,360
It's quite big inside.

815
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:19,940
Besides,

816
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,940
all the people who rent this house

817
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,660
are all men.

818
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,420
So,

819
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,010
let's change it to a men's toilet.

820
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,150
It'll be spacious enough for us.

821
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,410
And it saves money too.

822
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,630
Our base

823
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,790
is far from the city.

824
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,780
We can take care of each other

825
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,190
by living together.

826
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:31,820
It's good.

827
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,730
When any of us get married,

828
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,950
we'll definitely move to the city and buy a house there.

829
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,550
This place

830
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,140
feels more like an apartment for us single men.

831
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,020
We can have hotpot together

832
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,100
when we're free.

833
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,520
There's a park nearby.

834
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,750
We can get up early to exercise and walk the dog.

835
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,410
No problem.

836
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,870
You have even thought about your retirement life?

837
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,950
I've thought about it anyway.

838
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,090
We can't find a girlfriend

839
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,600
with this work intensity.

840
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,160
Besides, living in

841
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,270
this bachelor pad

842
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,960
is like living in a boy's dorm.

843
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,450
We are destined to grow old together.

844
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,420
I have a son.

845
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,000
Who wants to grow old with you?

846
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,000
Captain Lu.

847
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,800
I won’t be with you too,

848
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,090
Captain Lu, don't touch the wall.

849
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,210
I-I-I just finished painting it.

850
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,560
You don't have to remind me.

851
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,420
Do you think I don't know about it?

852
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,020
Those who moved in

853
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,220
were all single then.

854
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,170
Now,

855
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,910
you're the only one who's still single.

856
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,820
Please focus on the old days.

857
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,620
Transferred-former-captain.

858
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,060
Are you proud?

859
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,420
Of course.

860
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,240
What's wrong?

861
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,830
I heard you were here

862
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,020
before my morning training.

863
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,020
So I came all the way here to meet you.

864
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,360
I have to go now.

865
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,230
Bye.

866
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,000
So early?

867
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,550
I'm not kidding.

868
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,740
He can’t stay for even a minute.

869
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:07,890
Captain Lu.

870
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,510
Bye.

871
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,740
Commissioner.

872
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,980
SWAT Detachment of Tianwen City,

873
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,040
Third Brigade, Lu Yanchen,

874
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
reporting to you.

875
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,270
Lu Yanchen.

876
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,460
You must be tired from travelling all the way here.

877
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,460
It’s my pleasure.

878
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,680
Mr. Shen was picked up

879
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,850
at the station.

880
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,550
Okay.

881
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,300
Your Detachment Leader

882
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,300
has gone to visit Mr. Shen's family.

883
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,590
When will the memorial service

884
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,360
be held?

885
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,290
Saturday.

886
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:45,340
I'll get going then.

887
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:46,650
I'll go with you.

888
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:57,450
Uncle.

889
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,780
Yesterday, I heard from these old classmates of mine

890
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,640
said that a hero

891
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,980
will be sent back today.

892
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,420
The one who sent the hero back

893
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,320
is Captain Lu.

894
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,320
I heard that Captain Lu

895
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,980
has got married recently.

896
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,260
You don't have to say anything.

897
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,270
I already know.

898
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,140
When did you know?

899
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,220
I've already known.

900
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,110
Did Gui Xiao tell you?

901
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,130
When I was transferred to Gonghai,

902
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,260
I have been planning

903
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,460
to pay a formal visit

904
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,820
with Gui Xiao

905
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,790
after completing my mission.

906
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,250
Since you're now married

907
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,670
and have a home to go back to,

908
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,520
please be careful

909
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,260
when you go on a mission.

910
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,360
Okay.

911
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,740
Where are you going?

912
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,140
I'll ask the driver to drive you.

913
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:06,510
Home.

914
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,630
OK.

915
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,830
You're back.

916
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,120
I came back by train.

917
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,780
I'm dirty.

918
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,400
I'll take a shower first.

919
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,730
It's okay. I don't mind.

920
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,330
I do mind.

921
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,550
Are you disgusted by me?

922
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,690
I disgust myself.

923
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:39,870
Alright.

924
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,500
I need to take a shower.

925
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,420
Have you bought the ingredients?

926
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:43,830
Yes.

927
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,370
I bought all my favorite food ingredients.

928
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,860
Why are you following me?

929
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,980
I want to stay with you every second.

930
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,300
Now you don't even care to greet me

931
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,360
when you see me?

932
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,960
It's a misunderstanding.

933
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,920
I'm just trying to leave the time

934
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,980
to Aunt Gui Xiao.

935
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,070
I have something to tell you.

936
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:19,560
What?

937
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,210
Your mother was ill two days ago.

938
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,250
But she has been discharged.

939
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,400
I took care of her the whole time.

940
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,130
Don't worry.

941
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,540
Who called you?

942
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,590
Your sister called me.

943
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:35,890
My sister?

944
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,720
I did give her your number.

945
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,580
Actually, I just want her

946
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,820
to have a chat with you

947
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,320
and take care of you when she's free.

948
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,380
You're worrying too much.

949
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,100
All these years,

950
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,340
I've been taking care of myself.

951
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,140
It's nothing.

952
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,260
You should cook later.

953
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,700
No, not cooking.

954
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,220
I really can't cook.

955
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:57,910
Days without you,

956
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,710
I always order food deliveries.

957
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,630
How many days are you going to stay?

958
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,380
Three days.

959
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,140
Whole day off today.

960
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,420
Tomorrow is Mr. Shen’s memorial service.

961
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,620
I will go back on the day after tomorrow.

962
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,470
Do you want to go back

963
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
to visit your mom?

964
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,310
I should go back.

965
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,420
Together?

966
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:19,860
No.

967
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,470
We had a good chat last time.

968
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,190
I don't want you to meet my dad.

969
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,850
It's the same reason as yours last time.

970
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:31,360
Why don't you

971
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,820
want me to go home with you?

972
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,570
I should at least say hello.

973
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:39,630
Not now.

974
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,720
We're married.

975
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,790
It has nothing

976
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,170
to do with them.

977
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:48,850
I'll handle

978
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,600
my own business.

979
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,830
Stop staring.

980
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,100
I'll cook for you.

981
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,250
My skills are limited.

982
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,210
I bought

983
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,260
vegetables and meat that doesn't need cutting.

984
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,460
You rarely come back.

985
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,010
I've done everything I can

986
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:13,940
to save you time.

987
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,310
It's withered.

988
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,840
Not that withered. I can make do with it.

989
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:22,900
It seems that you are not reliable in

990
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,160
buying groceries too.

991
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,630
I'm being a free labor.

992
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,150
Don't be picky.
