1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,590
Uncle Lu.

3
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,050
Why are you still up?

4
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,350
Will I have to go back to Qining

5
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,800
after your baby comes out?

6
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,850
Qining is too far away.

7
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,780
It's too troublesome to send you back.

8
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,790
Just stay here.

9
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,750
There will be no room for me.

10
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,740
The baby...

11
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,930
Aunt Gui Xiao said

12
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,840
she really likes this house.

13
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,060
It took her a long time to find it.

14
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,190
This is what we adults should think about.

15
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,790
It has nothing to do with you.

16
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,620
You couldn't fall asleep

17
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,610
because of this?

18
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,540
I don't want to leave Aunt Gui Xiao

19
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,540
and Aunt Duan Rou.

20
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,300
It has nothing to do with you.

21
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,100
You forgot me and your dad?

22
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,570
You first looked at the car,

23
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,100
and then looked at the moon.

24
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,380
You're very happy, right?

25
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,480
Yes.

26
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,810
I'm too happy to fall asleep.

27
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,380
Alright, go to bed.

28
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,060
I'm going out.

29
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:25,910
Go.

30
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,660
Walk lightly when you

31
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,980
go up and down the stairs.

32
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,580
Aunt Gui Xiao

33
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,909
needs enough sleep now.

34
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,780
Go.

35
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,130
Bro.

36
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,080
Well,

37
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,540
I had just got my glass

38
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,720
and taken my first sip

39
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,980
when you called me out.

40
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,900
What is it?

41
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,200
Why must you ask me out?

42
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,810
Say something.

43
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,170
Don't.

44
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,620
Don't.

45
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,300
I'll get a fracture.

46
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,140
I'm old now.

47
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,700
Stop it.

48
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,780
I'm sorry.

49
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,540
You're so garrulous.

50
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,200
Can your girlfriend stand it?

51
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,700
I'm single.

52
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,310
I'm afraid of marriage.

53
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,810
I was dumped.

54
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,150
Are you going to be single forever?

55
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,810
Probably.

56
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,390
Now,

57
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:47,590
the word "marriage"

58
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,060
always reminds me

59
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,420
that I kneeled in front of her home

60
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,100
and cried

61
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,380
on her wedding day.

62
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,720
The person I want to marry most

63
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,500
married another man.

64
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,330
Finding another one?

65
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,100
No.

66
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,950
I can't forget her.

67
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,400
I only told you about this.

68
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,210
What happened to you?

69
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,980
On my way here,

70
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,830
I was thinking,

71
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,020
what could make you

72
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,010
lose control?

73
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,390
Are you...

74
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,690
I'm going to be a father.

75
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,030
According to the due date,

76
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,380
the baby will come out before the Spring Festival.

77
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:32,740
What?

78
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,140
You two...

79
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,990
You two took a rocket?

80
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,030
You reunited

81
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,000
and got back together.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,730
Now you're going to be a father.

83
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,170
You're going to be a father!

84
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,270
You...

85
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:46,690
I...

86
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,570
My God.

87
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,710
Wait.

88
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,500
Let me digest it.

89
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,659
You...

90
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,490
I...

91
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:01,580
I...

92
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:05,700
I'm...

93
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,290
jealous.

94
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
I'm happy for you.

95
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
I'm happy for you.

96
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,820
Of the two couples back then,

97
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,490
one finally made it last

98
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,460
and are going to have a child.

99
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,370
Next,

100
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,659
you'll have children and grandchildren

101
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:33,920
and grow old together.

102
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,020
We'll grow old together.

103
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,140
I'm happy for you.

104
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,090
I'm happy for you two.

105
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,440
I've lived in many places.

106
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,620
But I've never had

107
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,600
a real home.

108
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,300
Now I have one.

109
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,740
Gosh, it's you who are going to be a father.

110
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,660
Why am I crying?

111
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,720
It's so embarrassing.

112
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,190
So embarrassing. Let me calm down.

113
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,000
I can't.

114
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:25,850
Enough.

115
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,980
How come you're going to be a father?

116
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,660
I'm going to be an uncle.

117
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,420
Can I be your child's godfather?

118
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,500
Fine, you can.

119
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,220
Let me be your godfather.

120
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,780
Stop it.

121
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,230
Why don't you be my godfather?

122
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,760
Get lost!

123
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,820
I beg you, Lu Chen.

124
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,680
What if…

125
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,680
I mean, what if

126
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,060
the previous doctor got it wrong?

127
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,990
It's nothing.

128
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,760
We'll just keep working on it.

129
00:08:59,390 --> 00:08:59,850
Stop it.

130
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,630
I can't go in with you.

131
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,220
Be careful.

132
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,370
It's just a B-scan.

133
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,760
What's there to be careful about?

134
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,710
Since we were in the car,

135
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,280
you've been absent-minded.

136
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,840
What if you fall down?

137
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,180
I'm not a kid anymore.

138
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,380
Okay.

139
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,330
I'll be careful.

140
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,780
In the next ten months,

141
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,540
I'll walk slowly

142
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,460
and slowly.

143
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,130
I don't know

144
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,300
how long it will take.

145
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:48,960
Be patient.

146
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,620
I took the robot's manual with me.

147
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,370
I'm going to translate it for the students.

148
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,010
Go in.

149
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,680
Take your time.

150
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,220
No hurry.

151
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,380
Come in.

152
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,390
Give me the form.

153
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,720
Lie down here.

154
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,680
Lift up your top.

155
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,820
It's a bit cold.

156
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,900
Doctor, am I pregnant?

157
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,460
Yes.

158
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,930
How is the baby?

159
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,740
Do I have an ectopic pregnancy?

160
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,220
Is its heart beating?

161
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,510
Don't be afraid.

162
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,010
The baby's fine.

163
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,900
Did you search for information

164
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,840
online?

165
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,180
I searched for

166
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,420
all possible

167
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,300
problems.

168
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,570
Don't be nervous.

169
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,590
Relax.

170
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:18,790
Look.

171
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,960
12.6 mm

172
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,360
multiplied by 9.4 mm

173
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,340
multiplied by 14.6 mm.

174
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
It's this little.

175
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,800
It's too early.

176
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,370
I can't tell if there's any problem.

177
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,810
Go to the obstetrics department for detailed tests

178
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,810
when you're three months pregnant.

179
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,560
Aren't obstetrics and gynecology combined in one department?

180
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,080
No.

181
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,670
They're two separate departments.

182
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,660
When you register,

183
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,260
just choose the obstetrics department.

184
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,930
You can

185
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,600
consult the doctor there.

186
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,560
Now the baby

187
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,440
seems fine.

188
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,900
Just take good care of it.

189
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,220
What should I pay attention to?

190
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,700
The most important thing

191
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,420
is to stay in a good mood.

192
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,050
This is your first pregnancy, right?

193
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,580
Go get a birth permit first.

194
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,260
Only with this permit can you build

195
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,810
your medical record in the obstetrics department.

196
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,620
After that,

197
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,150
you'll be asked to do regular prenatal tests.

198
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,480
Okay.

199
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,570
You can get the permit from the neighborhood office

200
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,250
with your marriage certificate.

201
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,340
As for the procedure in your neighborhood,

202
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,480
you can check online

203
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,680
or make a call.

204
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,370
Okay.

205
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,160
Thank you.

206
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,090
You're welcome.

207
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,350
I asked the doctor about its age.

208
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,670
She said it's more than five weeks.

209
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,330
Do you think

210
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,030
we got it in Qining

211
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,700
or after we came back?

212
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,950
It's hard to say.

213
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,730
I don't remember either.

214
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,180
I just want to know it.

215
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,450
Does it matter?

216
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,280
Yes.

217
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,290
Think about it.

218
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,700
I want to tell our baby

219
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,980
where I got pregnant.

220
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,990
It's hard

221
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,220
to figure it out.

222
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,590
I wish it was in Qining.

223
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,950
That's your second hometown.

224
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,150
It's more memorable.

225
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,440
Besides,

226
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,360
that's where

227
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,970
we reconnected.

228
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,410
It should be in Qining.

229
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,830
Really?

230
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:31,950
Really.

231
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,060
I'm sure

232
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,640
it was in Qining.

233
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,880
After we go back,

234
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,690
I'll go find my leader in the SWAT team

235
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,540
and ask about the marriage application.

236
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,540
I'll try to

237
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,000
get our marriage certificate this month.

238
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,900
Give me some advice.

239
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,660
I've never booked a wedding banquet.

240
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,450
Your place hosts wedding banquets every day.

241
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,180
What do people like to eat here?

242
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,860
Pick what you like first.

243
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,750
I'll go through it with you later.

244
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,360
Give me your account number.

245
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,090
I'll transfer the money to you.

246
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,630
You haven't chosen the dishes,

247
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,740
yet you're going to pay the deposit first?

248
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,070
That's not what I meant.

249
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,000
I was talking about the money

250
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,290
Hai Dong borrowed from you and gave to Lu Chen.

251
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,250
Are you kidding me?

252
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,850
You didn't borrow the money.

253
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,310
I feel sorry.

254
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,250
It has nothing to do with Lu Chen

255
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,660
and you.

256
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:40,900
Hai Dong

257
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,420
borrowed the money from me

258
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,070
based on our relationship.

259
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,130
It's between me and Hai Dong.

260
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,750
Listen.

261
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,420
Don't pay the money back

262
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,080
to Hai Dong.

263
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,780
In junior high,

264
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,740
he made trouble with a group of hooligans.

265
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,140
If Lu Chen hadn't stopped him,

266
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,600
he would have been doomed.

267
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,060
Don't get involved in the things

268
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,920
between them.

269
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,500
If Lu Chen wants you

270
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,310
to get involved,

271
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:01,820
he won't be

272
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,900
the Lu Chen I know.

273
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,070
I understand.

274
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,500
I have Lu Chen's salary account

275
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,430
and salary slip.

276
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,880
He earns a good salary.

277
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,390
He'll be able to pay Hai Dong back soon.

278
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,150
Right.

279
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,660
Let him

280
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,100
solve his own problem.

281
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,690
He has his pride.

282
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,390
Put yourself in his shoes.

283
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,970
If you owe a debt,

284
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,480
and he secretly repays it for you,

285
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
will you be happy?

286
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,700
You have

287
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,760
such strong pride.

288
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,490
It's good.

289
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:43,750
What?

290
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,870
Who doesn't want to cherish the one

291
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,900
they fell for when they were in school?

292
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,500
But not everyone is worth it.

293
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,460
Even if it's worth it,

294
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,140
not everyone has the chance.

295
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,370
Isn't Qin Feng good?

296
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,060
What are you talking about?

297
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,860
I'm not thinking about Hai Dong.

298
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,710
I just

299
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,020
suddenly thought of it.

300
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,390
It seems that what happened between Hai Dong and me

301
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,720
was in my previous life.

302
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,520
But you and Lu Chen

303
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,780
are still in this life.

304
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,920
It's great.

305
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,540
I hope we'll both be fine.

306
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,780
Of course.

307
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,620
We are good people.

308
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,900
What God gives us

309
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,020
is the best.

310
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,560
Goodbye

311
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,030
to my previous life.

312
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,060
By the way,

313
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,210
do you want to hold the wedding first

314
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,610
or get registered first?

315
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,300
We haven't discussed it.

316
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,930
I want to get both things done this month.

317
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,030
If you want to hold the ceremony this month,

318
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,090
you probably don't have enough time.

319
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,100
You need to decide

320
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,180
who to invite,

321
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,740
write invitations,

322
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,030
and customize your wedding dress.

323
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,540
You can take

324
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,300
the wedding photos later.

325
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,210
But you need to leave enough time

326
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,890
to make the dress.

327
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,460
It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

328
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,880
You can't be careless.

329
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,589
I know a dress maker.

330
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,329
She can finish the dress on time.

331
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,780
No need.

332
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,730
Lu Chen won't run away.

333
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,540
I'll organize the wedding.

334
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,069
I know the process better than you.

335
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,130
Let me give you a suggestion.

336
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,900
You need to leave more time

337
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,119
for the wedding preparation.

338
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,839
Pay attention to more details

339
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,310
so you won't have any regrets.

340
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,510
If you want to

341
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,839
get registered this month

342
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,060
because Lu Chen's birthday is in this month,

343
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,020
you still need

344
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,940
about two

345
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,270
to three months

346
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,990
to prepare for the wedding.

347
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,510
Okay.

348
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,870
I'll go back and discuss with him.

349
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,780
Here, take it back.

350
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,760
Take your time to make a choice.

351
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,710
You're here.

352
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,110
I don't need to introduce him, right?

353
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,770
Captain Lu.

354
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,550
Mr. Shen.

355
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,860
Have a seat.

356
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,210
Okay.

357
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:51,790
Here.

358
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,020
There's a city called Xinsheng in Qining.

359
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,280
You used to work there.

360
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,590
Everybody wants you, Lu Yanchen.

361
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:01,980
I managed to

362
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,440
get you from the squadron.

363
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,300
You haven't stayed here for long.

364
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,260
Yet he's here to ask me to second you.

365
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,720
The leader there wants you

366
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,340
to work there for a month

367
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,080
to help train EOD technicians

368
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,210
and form a SWAT team.

369
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,230
First, it's because

370
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,700
you are familiar with things there.

371
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,360
Second, you are experienced.

372
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,660
If you work there for a month,

373
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,660
you can do what takes others several months to finish.

374
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,810
I heard about this

375
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,420
from Captain Qin in Qining.

376
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,710
Yes.

377
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,740
He wanted to go himself.

378
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,540
But they're short-handed

379
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,420
in Qining.

380
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,500
So he asked me to send you there.

381
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,070
I have

382
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,260
more men than him.

383
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,090
So I agreed.

384
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,500
When shall I go?

385
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,640
You can come back early

386
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,620
if you leave early.

387
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,620
Set out tomorrow.

388
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,230
You've received the secondment order?

389
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,640
Yes.

390
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,180
It's a special situation.

391
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,580
We got special approval.

392
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,760
Captain Lu.

393
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,980
Your detachment leader and I

394
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,940
are old friends.

395
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,920
I'm going to

396
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,680
the Civil Explosion Company tomorrow.

397
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,280
Let's go together tomorrow.

398
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,530
We can take care of each other on the way.

399
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,730
You are older than me.

400
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,240
I should take care of you.

401
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,520
Alright.

402
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,540
Since it's decided,

403
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,470
I need to go back and pack up.

404
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,030
Could you please

405
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,070
tell the Fourth Brigade about this?

406
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,270
I won't go there then.

407
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,070
Okay.

408
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,580
Go back and pack up.

409
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,520
Master.

410
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,640
Ever since that night,

411
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,910
I haven't seen you.

412
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:50,860
But I haven't forgotten

413
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,740
my skills.

414
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,960
I practice every day.

415
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,420
Hold on.

416
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,580
The people in this garage

417
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,440
are my friends.

418
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,010
Go there and tell them

419
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,870
you're Lu Yanchen's apprentice.

420
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,290
Ask them to teach you when they're free.

421
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,770
The number on it belongs to

422
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,100
someone called Mr. Liu.

423
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,100
Ask him to teach you.

424
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,700
It's free.

425
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,860
That's not appropriate, Master.

426
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,320
Take it.

427
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,910
It's fate that made us meet.

428
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,710
After you learn the skills,

429
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,660
check my wife's car

430
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,720
when you have time.

431
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,520
She's careless.

432
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,180
She doesn't know these.

433
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,160
Thank you, Master. Don't worry.

434
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,380
I'll get back to work.

435
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,150
Walk.

436
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,420
Don't run.

437
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,090
Didn't you say you'd be home tomorrow?

438
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,440
I had a shift change.

439
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,770
So I can come back today.

440
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,410
Now that you have a baby,

441
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,540
you are a family man.

442
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,910
But you can't let this affect your work.

443
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,620
I got approval from my leader.

444
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,260
I'm reading the menu of Meng Xiaoshan's restaurant

445
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,590
for the wedding banquet.

446
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,060
But it's hard for me to choose.

447
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,380
Let's choose together after dinner.

448
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:12,710
Okay.

449
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,180
You may have a miscarriage in the first trimester.

450
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,840
Try not to carry heavy things.

451
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,300
Did he search online secretly?

452
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,880
Are we celebrating the New Year?

453
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,760
Just eat.

454
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:47,750
Thank you.

455
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,240
You're welcome.

456
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,400
Have some meat.

457
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:53,790
Okay.

458
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,650
Did you come back

459
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,780
after having a meal?

460
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,360
I had some food in the afternoon. I'm not hungry.

461
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,220
Qin Xiaonan, finish your food.

462
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:26,930
Okay.

463
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,940
Milk is a good source of calcium.

464
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,380
I feel like I've been

465
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,840
soaked in milk these days.

466
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,340
I never like milk.

467
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,100
You know it.

468
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,140
You've never liked it since childhood.

469
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,700
Yes.

470
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,450
But it's okay.

471
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,070
I'm strong-willed.

472
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,060
It takes 21 days

473
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,950
to form a habit.

474
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,180
I can make myself addicted to milk

475
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,480
in three days.

476
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,910
I'm going on a business trip.

477
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,740
How long?

478
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,510
A month.

479
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,050
That's okay.

480
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,730
Will you miss me?

481
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,320
Who else can I miss?

482
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,030
That's more like it.

483
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,210
Go wash up.

484
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,780
Okay.

485
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,040
Let me hug you for two more minutes.

486
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:27,470

What is it?

490
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:31,860
Don't tell me

491
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,090
you're having a second child.

Please take care of my family for me.

495

Got it.

554
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,720
Just kidding.

555
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,840
I know you're kidding.

556
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,740
Are we doing crosstalk?

557
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,080
What do you want to eat?

558
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,080
I'll cook for you.

559
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,930
The food you cook is not delicious.

560
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,710
So picky.

561
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,650
Go to bed

562
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,490
and go back to sleep.

563
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,040
I'm going down and leaving.

564
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,130
I've lain down, Captain Lu.

565
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,510
You're leaving?

566
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,580
Take care of the home.

567
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,210
Got it.

568
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,470
I've seen many scenes like this.

569
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,880
Leave it to me.

00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,950
Good morning, Captain Lu.

571
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,540
Let me do it.

572
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,270
Okay.

573
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:17,890
Thank you.

574
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,270
Captain Lu.

575
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,970
You must be anxious.

576
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,100
I asked the driver

577
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,710
to make a detour

578
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:29,790
to pick me up first.

579
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,470
Because you are different from me.

580
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,710
You have a family.

581
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,620
I wanted you to spend more time

582
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,020
with your family at home.

583
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,880
Which floor do you live on?

584
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,260
The third room

585
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,060
down from the top.

586
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,830
She's still sleeping.

587
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:40,850
Next time you drink milk,

588
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,250
don't bite the rim of the cup.

589
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,380
This cup is too thin.

590
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,970
Why did you buy such a thin cup?

591
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,450
I've already bought it.

592
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,220
I won't buy it again.

593
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,460
I won't buy it again.

594
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,090
Mr. Shen.

595
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,810
The flight was supposed to take off at 9 am.

596
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:21,670
More than an hour ago,

597
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,930
we were notified that,

598
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,370
due to air traffic control,

599
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,690
the flight would be delayed for two hours.

600
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,950
It's now scheduled to depart at 11:20 am.

601
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,690
Okay, got it.

602
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:30,430
Then

603
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,720
drop me off over there.

604
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,380
I forgot something.

605
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:33,870
Okay.

606
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,080
I'll take your luggage

607
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,320
to the airport.

608
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:36,830
Okay.

609
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,190
See you at the boarding gate.

610
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:38,520
Okay.

611
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,370
Qin Xiaonan, what are you doing?

612
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,640
I'm taking care of this home.

613
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,380
You've grown up unexpectedly.

614
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,060
Being the wife of a policeman

615
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:03,810
is not easy.

616
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,420
I don't need you to teach me.

617
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,300
I'm not talking to you.

618
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,100
I need to work. Don't disturb me.

619
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,410
You arrived so soon?

620
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:20,980
Come down.

621
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,720
Wait... wait for me.

622
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,980
Let me put on my shoes

623
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,340
and clothes.

624
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,130
Bring your ID card

625
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,070
and household register.

626
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,670
Wear your favorite clothes.

627
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,340
The clothes that look good on a red background

628
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,140
will be the best.

629
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,170
♫Hey, what day is it today?♫

630
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,400
♫Can I see you?♫

631

elope with me?

636
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,060
We only have two hours.

637
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,190
♫You didn't see my message♫

638
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,960
I checked it.

639
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,170
The Civil Affairs Bureau opens at 8:30 am.

640
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,050
Let's be the first couple to get registered.

641
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,200
♫Did anyone tell you♫

642
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,620

Get in.

654

You didn't take your ID card?

655
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:45,460
I took it.

656
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,679
You lost your household register?

657
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,620
My aunt works here.

658
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,150
Gui Xiao.

659
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,409
What?

660
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,139
Are you here to ask for help from your aunt?

661
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,330
No, I...

662
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,520
I'm just passing by.

663
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,040
It's my first time. I'm a bit nervous.

664
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,320
Your cousin happens to be here.

665
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,580
Xiao.

666
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,590
I'll leave you to it.

667
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,420
I'm going to work.

668
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:08,750
Okay.

669
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,080
Captain Lu.

670
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,070
Xiao.

671
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,480
Come here. I have something to tell you.

672
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,900
Your dad and mom are here to get divorced.

673
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,020
I've heard about it.

674
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,020
They went to the legal department

675
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,890
to have their divorce agreement reviewed.

676
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,380
I think you should persuade them.

677
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,400
Your dad is well-off now.

678
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,060
Why bother?

679
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,750
I haven't said a word.

680
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,470
You're imagining the ending.

681
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,100
Am I wrong?

682
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,020
Didn't...

683
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,940
Didn't you bring your first love,

684
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,690
who's a SWAT officer,

685
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,090
to stop a possible fight?

686
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,660
Why did you come to

687
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,770
the Civil Affairs Bureau early in the morning?

688
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,280
I brought breakfast to my mom.

689
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,780
My dad wanted

690
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,180
to give my mom a surprise,

691
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,500
so he asked me to come here.

692
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:43,900
Hurry.

693
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,260
My dad is really

694
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,290
a model husband.

695
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:46,870
Alright.

696
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,830
I'll stop talking with you.

697
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,080
I'm going to get married.

698
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,610
Go ahead.

699
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,820
You two...

700
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,690
It's early in the morning.

701
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,180
We need to queue up?

702
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,490
Do we still have time?

703
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,080
Maybe we have to come another day.

704
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,140
Xiao.

705
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,440
Does your family know about you getting married?

706
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,000
Yes.

707
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,970
I don't have time to talk to you now.

708
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,090
Lu Chen is leaving soon.

709
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,420
You know this place best.

710
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,880
How long do we have to wait?

711
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,970
He's in a hurry to leave?

712
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:20,340
Yes.

713
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,580
He's on a mission.

714
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:24,910
Wait for me.

715
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:31,930
Well...

716
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,180
I'm sorry.

717
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:33,880
Um,

718
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,440
my brother-in-law is a SWAT officer.

719
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:35,940
He finally

720
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,700
got round to come here

721
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,480
for marriage registration.

722
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:37,980
After they get registered,

723
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,380
he'll go on a mission right away.

724
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,150
Can we change our numbers?

725
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,480
Sure. No problem.

726
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,430
Of course.

727
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,380
Thank you.

728
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,560
We kind of cut in line.

729
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,020
I'm sorry.

730
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,080
I apologize to you.

731
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,310
I was just about to say

732
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,860
that you could take our number if they didn't agree.

733
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,840
Let them get registered quickly

734
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,530
so he can go on his mission.

735
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,530
Thank you.

736
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,160
Let's change the numbers.

737
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,020
Xiao, Chen, come here.

738
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,720
They agreed to

739
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,380
let you get registered first.

740
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,350
Thank you.

741
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:05,990
Is it appropriate?

742
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,300
You're in a hurry, right?

743
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,260
Don't stand on ceremony.

744
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,640
Here.

745
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:12,980
Sorry about the trouble.

746
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,620
Thank you.

747
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,300
Thank you very much.

748
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:14,900
Thank you.

749
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,410
Well,

750
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,170
why don't you wait here?

751
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:18,880
I'll go to my mom's office

752
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,580
to get some wedding candy

753
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,490
to share with everyone.

754
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,550
Today is a good day.

755
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,590
I'll go first.

756
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,870
Go there to take a photo first.

757
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,990
We have an experienced photographer.

758
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,340
You can also take the photo by yourselves.

759
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,320
But I suggest

760
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,080
you let the photographer do it.

761
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,860
Why?

762
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,610
He has feelings.

763
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,720
He can make you smile more happily.

764
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,460
Thank you.

765
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,480
Let's go.

766
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,350
Actually, I've always dreamed of

767
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,950
taking wedding photos in your police station.

768
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,210
I'll keep it in mind.

769
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,840
As long as my leader agrees,

770
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
I'll let you do it.

771
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,700
But if we take photos in the police station,

772
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,890
I can't wear a wedding dress that's too gorgeous,

773
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:05,500
since it won't

774
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,100
look serious enough, right?

775
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,520
It's up to you.

776
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,590
You can wear whatever you want.

777
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,500
Girl,

778
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,390
let's take the photo first.

779
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,090
Okay.

780
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,160
She talks too much when she's happy.

781
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
Who won't be happy

782
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,920
when they're getting married?

783
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:21,900
Show your happiness

784
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,940
on your faces.

785
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:25,890
Okay.

786
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,270
Hello, do you want to get a premarital checkup?

787
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:38,660
Yes.

788
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,640
He'll get it.

789
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,060
I get a checkup every year.

790
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,010
We're already here.

791
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,090
Just do it.

792
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,250
We still have time.

793
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,500
Where can he get the checkup?

794
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,160
Over there.

795
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:48,970
Thank you.

796
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,220
What tests did you take?

797
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,330
A physical

798
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,500
and a surgical test.

799
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,100
What else?

800
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,310
That's all.

801
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,680
You're lying.

802
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,060
They saw that you're pregnant,

803
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,120
and asked what else I wanted to check.

804
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:02,870
I said my wife

805
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,680
has been curious since childhood.

806
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,740
She made me come in.

807
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,650
I didn't get the checkup.

808
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,910
We just had a few words.

809
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,560
Fill in the form first.

810
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,140
I'll issue

811
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,940
today's first two marriage certificates for you.

812
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,620
You are quite used to

813
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,300
bullying my brother-in-law.

814
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,760
You let him do everything.

815
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,090
His handwriting is better than mine.

816
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,500
Tell your mom that she can't

817
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,210
tell this to my father

818
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,450
in any case.

819
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,070
My mom knows it.

820
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,230
But as for my dad,

821
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,740
I'll think about

822
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,670
what to do later.

823
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,200
Let's share our happiness.

824
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,000
Let's share our happiness.

825
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,640
Thank you.

826
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,360
Thanks.

827
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:00,930
Come on.

828
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,660
Let's share our happiness.

829
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,260
Thank you.

830
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,450
Okay.

831
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,430
I'm leaving.

832
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:02,740
Here.

833
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,190
Congratulations.

834
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,220
Thank you.

835
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,100
Thank you.

836
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,020
I can't send you home.
