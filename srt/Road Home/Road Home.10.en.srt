during this period of time.

98

I was being assigned.

195
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,610
My leader asked me to choose.

196
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,090
I said,

197
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
I'll do as you say.

198
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:34,740
Good boy.

199
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,620
It's been a while since I first started.

200
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,880
I just graduated then.

201
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,640
We had 40 classmates.

202
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,640
One of them had sacrificed.

203
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,400
There are also three who are severely injured and disabled.

204
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,530
Do you have any more?

205
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:55,850
Yes.

206
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,620
Follow me to the meeting room

207
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,740
and write the evaluation report.

208
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,670
I'll make sure you'll have enough.

209
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,460
Rise.

210
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,470
Captain.

211
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,070
Where's Captain Lu?

212
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,170
As usual,

213
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,340
whoever has the highest position will go first.

214
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,590
Who made this bomb?

215
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,590
Me.

216
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,940
I'm good at it.

217
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,700
I heard

218
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,180
you often exchange gifts.

219
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,980
Before I met Captain Lu, I've never met anyone

220
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,010
who was better at making bombs than me.

221
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,240
I finally met a rival.

222
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,450
I can't waste my chance.

223
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,500
We are simulating real cases

224
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,810
that happened both domestically and internationally.

225
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,740
They are not planned scenarios

226
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,900
but actual cases bomb disposal experts

227
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,560
have faced.

228
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,470
This bomb is strong enough

229
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,410
to make sure no one at the scene can survive.

230
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:21,900
Command Center.

231
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,740
The explosive has been triggered.

232
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,010
It can't be moved anymore.

233
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,130
Given the conditions here,

234
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,400
we won't be able to dispose it with machinery.

235
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,200
I will be disposing it manually.

236
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:31,870
Be careful.

237
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,520
Everyone, evacuate from the center.

238
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,090
Before coming to the team,

239
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,590
I thought it was all about cutting wires.

240
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,120
Just guess which one to cut.

241
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,600
It's not that easy.

242
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,260
The bomb you're met with

243
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,920
every time will be different.

244
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,700
The conditions of the scene will be different too.

245
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,960
The only similarity is

246
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,430
you have no chance to fail.

247
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,160
Your first failure

248
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,349
will also be your last.

249
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,200
The explosion device has been disposed successfully.

250
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,110
Zhou Xin.

251
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,140
Now it's your turn

252
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,270
to operate the robot

253
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,180
to move the bomb.

254
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,620
Roger.

255
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,390
The bomb has been disposed.

256
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,020
It's as if it were real.

257
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,360
I'm so nervous that I'm sweating.

258
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,640
It is real.

259
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,060
This is a bomb

260
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,720
Captain Lu has once disposed.

261
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,330
It is a real life simulation.

262
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,230
The only difference is, the bomb today

263
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,810
was made by me.

264
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,700
It's more complex

265
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,150
and dangerous.

266
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,380
Sorry.

267
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,170
I'm late.

268
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,990
Guess what I did yesterday.

269
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:08,810
Drinking.

270
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,350
How did you know?

271
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,090
The finance team came to me just now,

272
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:12,900
asking me why

273
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,170
your recent reimbursements

274
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,700
are all drinking expenses.

275
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,780
I told him

276
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,660
you're going to get

277
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,790
a blind box project.

278
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,030
If this continues,

279
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,540
I'm going to open a blind box store myself.

280
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,630
I didn't expect

281
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,940
blind boxes to become so trendy

282
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,240
over the past two years.

283
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,400
You can't even invest in it even if you have money.

284
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,930
Work hard in the next round.

285
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:33,950
I have another

286
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,140
due diligence I have to do for a education platform.

287
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,510
Education is easy.

288
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,530
It's the easiest to get contacts in.

289
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,190
You seem to be very interested

290
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,420
in things about kids.

291
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,880
I like kids.

292
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,060
You're back.

293
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,530
How's your due diligence?

294
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,840
I just finished talking with my client.

295
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,680
It went well.

296
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,320
I was afraid you wouldn't have time

297
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,720
to have a meeting with us.

298
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,700
I have time.

299
00:20:59,030 --> 00:20:59,850
As long as I'm awake,

300
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:00,910
it's working time.

301
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,750
Go ahead.

302
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,460
It's a call from Qining.

303
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,130
Hello?

304
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,670
Lu,

305
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,230
I saw the note you left.

306
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,190
I just came back.

307
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,450
I'm telling you,

308
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,400
there has been too many missions lately.

309
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,390
My household register is still at home.

310
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,050
I don't have time to pick it up.

311
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,260
The school year is about to start.

312
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,150
Yes, I know.

313
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,690
I’ll discuss it with his mother.

314
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,070
It’s Lu Yanchen's call?

315
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,500
Tell him

316
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,410
his transfer procedure isn't completed yet.

317
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,850
Ask him to come over when he's free.

318
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,180
Okay, I'll tell him now.

319
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,810
Did you hear that?

320
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,390
Come back soon.

321
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,920
When you come back this time,

322
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,890
you might meet

323
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,060
the person you've been wanting to see.

324
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,920
There's a clue?

325
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,180
Fortunately, your transfer procedure is not complete yet.

326
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,030
So you're still considered to be under Qining.

327
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,760
It used to be a case you handled.

328
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,980
You have to complete the handover.

329
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,580
Come back.

330
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,420
It's almost at the end.

331
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,780
I'll arrange it as soon as possible.

332
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,110
Okay.

333
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,550
Captain.

334
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,620
I'm informing you,

335
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,860
Captain Lu is on leave

336
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,620
to make a trip back to Qining.

337
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,800
You'd have to take on more responsibilities for the work here.

338
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,730
I heard about it.

339
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,660
I saw his ex-colleague that day.

340
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,890
He said he never took a day off

341
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,580
since he joined the police force.

342
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,520
I guess something urgent came up

343
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,580
for him to return to Qining this time.

344
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,300
They've found some clues

345
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,530
for an old case.

346
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,060
Thank you for your hard work.

347
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,770
Boss, you saying this

348
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,780
make me feel like I have to work overtime today.

349
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,970
That's up to you.

350
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,180
Mr. Sun.

351
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:08,700
I'm free.

352
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,160
Okay, thank you.

353
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,500
Bye.

354
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,900
I won't have dinner

355
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,960
with you all later.

356
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,820
You're going home, right?

357
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,460
Take me with you.

358
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,660
I didn't drive today.

359
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,020
We're going in the same direction.

360
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,360
Okay.

361
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Bye. Bye.

362
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:40,420
Here.

363
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,210
Eat more.

364
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,660
How long were you

365
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,180
standing alone

366
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,580
by the school gate today?

367
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,630
Not long. I thought about it.

368
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,130
If no one comes by the time night falls,

369
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,500
I'll sleep in the classroom.

370
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,820
What are you talking about?

371
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,210
You should've called me.

372
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,470
Why didn't you call me?

373
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,870
It's fine.

374
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,150
Sorry, Nan.

375
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,660
I'm really sorry.

376
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,310
There was an accident on the road

377
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,710
so I was stuck in traffic.

378
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,600
Your house is far away.

379
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,500
What time

380
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,430
do you normally send him to school?

381
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,180
If I send him,

382
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,250
it's at 5 a.m.

383
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,670
Otherwise, there must be traffic jam.

384
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,470
He'll be late.

385
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,860
But it was

386
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,900
Lu Chen who asked me for this favor.

387
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,960
I have to help my brother.

388
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,940
It doesn't matter.

389
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,950
For him,

390
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,740
I don't even drink alcohol anymore.

391
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,000
I have to be his driver.

392
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,150
Oh right,

393
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,460
look at this screenshot.

394
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,630
Lu Chen sent it to me.

395
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,810
This is the homework left by the teacher.

396
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,360
They get homework assigned online now?

397
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:38,750
Yes.

398
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:39,860
Nowadays,

399
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,180
you can see what homework

400
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:41,940
the teacher has assigned

401
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,860
when you click into an app you download.

402
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,320
Look.

403
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,540
Today's Chinese homework

404
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,580
is reciting.

405
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,910
Math homework is calculation.

406
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:48,910
These are simple.

407
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,250
But I'm really not good at English.

408
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,520
How about this?

409
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,180
Leave Qin Xiaonan to me this week.

410
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,430
He can stay at my place.

411
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,340
I'm not going on a business trip either.

412
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,980
I'll be home from Monday to Friday.

413
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,040
I can even help him with his homework.

414
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,430
Is that appropriate?

415
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,990
Why not?

416
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,740
He stayed at my place

417
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,400
when he first came to Beijing.

418
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,810
Thank you so much then.

419
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,930
Thank you, family.

420
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,490
Eat up. It's on you.

421
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,440
Sure.

422
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,690
Ask me if you have any questions.

423
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,420
At your age,

424
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,350
you should keep asking questions.

425
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,800
Aunt Gui Xiao, what are you reading?

426
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,380
I'm reading a financial report.

427
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,180
I have to monitor the operations

428
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,780
of projects I invested in every month

429
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,580
through this.

430
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,180
What about Aunt Duan Rou?

431
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,700
I'm watching "The Good Dinosaur."

432
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,390
Be serious.

433
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,290
I'm looking at a nursing home's introduction.

434
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,100
My friend's mother

435
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,250
wants to move to a nursing home lately.

436
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,620
I found that this is

437
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,080
a very promising project.

438
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,660
So I'm going to invest.

439
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,270
Have we fed your curiosity yet?

440
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,620
I'll continue with

441
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,820
my Chinese homework.

442
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,990
Take whatever you want.

443
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,020
If you talk about such professional things with a kid,

444
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,750
he won't be able to understand.

445
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,060
This is how my mum

446
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,560
talked to me since I was a kid.

447
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,440
She never glosses over her words.

448
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,100
She answers

449
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,100
whatever I ask.

450
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,870
I think it's good.

451
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,820
It made me feel like this world is amazing

452
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,410
since I was young,

453
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,290
and I have to study hard

454
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,860
so that I can have a good job.

455
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,390
Your mother taught you so well.

456
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,750
Sleep with me tonight.

457
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,150
I'll sleep with Xiaonan.

458
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,640
Qin Xiaonan told me secretly that

459
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,130
every time he stays at your place,

460
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,820
he doesn't dare to go to the toilet at midnight.

461
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,020
Your house is too big.

462
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,250
I promised to sleep with him.

463
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,380
I'll turn the light on for him at night.

464
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,960
He never told me about that.

465
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,590
You are the host,

466
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,610
he's a child. He's too shy to say it.

467
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,290
This kid.

468
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,870
But he's not shy to talk about it with another guest?

469
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,310
Yes.

470
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,100
Fine, it's a double bed anyway.

471
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,360
How are you and your ex-boyfriend?

472
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,020
We're getting along.

473
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,320
We're friends.

474
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,020
Is he single?

475
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,670
Kind of.

476
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,590
What about in the past?

477
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,480
It was a little complicated.

478
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:05,330
Son.

479
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:06,860
Are you up?

480
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,260
Did you do your homework last night?

481
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,240
How is the new campus?

482
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,640
Do you have enough money?

483
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,380
[Dad]

484
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,330
I'm sorry.

485
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,740
Your son went out.

486
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,480
I answered his call in a daze.

487
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,160
You are...

488
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,200
I'm a colleague of Gui Xiao.

489
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,390
I'm helping her take care of your kid.

490
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,010
I'm so grate...

491
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,310
Don't stand on ceremony.

492
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,280
I like him.

493
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,210
Thank you.

494
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,860
You're welcome.

495
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:41,780
Nan.

496
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,220
I'll ask him to call you back later.

497
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,440
Okay.

498
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:50,730
Bye.

499
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,580
Have some hot food.

500
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:56,980
It's too late for lamb soup.

501
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,380
The meeting is starting.

502
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,210
How's your son dealing with his school transfer?

503
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,560
I don't know.

504
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,580
You called him for so long, you didn't ask?

505
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,240
My son didn't answer the call.

506
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,200
It's Captain Lu's

507
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,730
ex-girlfriend's colleague who picked it up.

508
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,380
Hello. It's Lu Yanchen.

509
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,480
Lu.

510
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,500
My son

511
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,030
is still at your ex's house?

512
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,940
I don't think it's appropriate.

513
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,350
My friend's taking care of him.

514
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:32,570
Impossible.

515
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,890
I just called him.

516
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,940
Gui Xiao's colleague picked it up.

517
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,800
You haven't been home these days?

518
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:38,660
Yes.

519
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,520
Turn on your phone.

520
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,050
Buy Gui Xiao a meal for me.

521
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,260
I feel bad.

522
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,720
[Yonghe Palace Street]

523
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,030
Get in the car and wait.

524
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,070
Are you off work?

525
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:13,940
Not yet.

526
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,870
I'm off work.

527
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,710
I'll show Nan around

528
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,720
and wait for you nearby.

529
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,070
But I still have a while to go.

530
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,200
I'm off work.

531
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,820
I'll wait no matter how late it is.

532
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,820
You can't do that.

533
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,350
He has homework to do.

534
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,990
I'll find a place to get a glass of water

535
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,510
and take him to do homework.

536
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,430
No.

537
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,790
He can't focus on his homework this way.

538
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,990
It's not good for him.

539
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:48,860
I didn't realize

540
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,350
that you're quite experienced in taking care of children.

541
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,570
I didn't realize

542
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
you could take care of a child alone.

543
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,670
I'll wait for you.

544
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,660
Nan knows my place better than you do.

545
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,190
Go ahead.

546
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:11,990
By myself?

547
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,990
It's for Xiaonan to do his homework.

548
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,750
It's on the sake of Xiaonan.

549
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,080
Change into these.

550
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,180
What do you want to drink? I'll get it for you.

551
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,710
Get lost.

552
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,460
Is this your home?

553
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,910
Being all hospitable.

554
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,830
I'm going to go do my homework if you don't want anything to drink.

555
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,180
Go.

556
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,460
Don't touch

557
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,790
Aunt Gui Xiao's things.

558
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,060
She doesn't like it.

559
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,480
Go do your homework.

560
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,380
♫You must have secretly collected♫

561
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,810

00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,920
♫Only have the light when it's like a mystery♫

571
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:33,250
♫On a night when no one knows♫

572
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,620
I bought you takeout.

573
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,889
♫The breeze goes everywhere♫

574
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,370
What a waste.

575
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,050
♫The breeze♫

576
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:41,679
No.

577
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:43,969
We'll take it back and eat it at home.

578
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,639
♫You must have been there in secret♫

579
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,219

♫Bringing back the green plants of summer♫

581
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,739
I'll heat it up for you.

♫And the fallen leaves of autumn♫

583
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:54,750
Let me help you.

584
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,550
No need. Just wait.

♫The pathos of youth is sung♫

587
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,660
This is his homework this week.

588
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,660
I've sorted them according

589
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,550
to their subjects.

590
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,800
The post-its on it

591
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,440
also says what he has to do.

592
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,570
I'm a master of self-care？

593
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,780
He needs to

594
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,700
pack his own bag,

595
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,270
bed, and wardrobe.

596
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,220
When he's done packing them,

597
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,350
give him a star

598
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,630
and have him hand it in to the teacher.

599
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,970
The education system nowadays

600
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,030
is indeed different from what we had.

601
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,830
Yes, it's very meticulous.

602
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,390
Bye.

603
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,550
I'm on break this week.

604
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,030
If you're free,

605
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,950
feel free to look for me.

606
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,590
Let's go.

607
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,030
Goodbye, Aunt Gui Xiao.

608
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,830
Do you want to go back with us?

609
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,620
Now?

610
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,470
I can drive back.

611
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,860
What I mean is,

612
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,180
I can take you there,

613
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,420
and you can live

614
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,720
at Meng Xiaoshan's house

615
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,250
and have a catch up with her.

616
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,250
Go pack your things.

617
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,790
Give me ten minutes.

618
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,880
I haven't been back for a long time.

619
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,810
There's no one to clean this place.

620
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,710
It's okay.

621
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,390
You're back.

622
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,990
I'll take you home first.

623
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,040
Who is she? Is she your girlfriend?

624
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,750
Why can't I see her?

625
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:42,980
Why are you running?

626
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,140
That's my dad.

627
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:48,960
I know.

628
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,190
Have you seen him?

629
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:53,790
In the past?

630
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,210
I remember his voice.

631
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,340
Brat,

632
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,980
do you think this is a hotel?

633
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,130
Come out!

634
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,090
Get out!

635
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,920
Get out!

636
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,460
Come out!

637
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,310
I didn't expect you to remember it for so many years.

638
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,380
I wanted to

639
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,040
spend a nice weekend with you.

640
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:21,830
I'm sorry.

641
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,830
We can spend it even without staying here.

642
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,310
You're so boring.

643
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,550
We dated in the garage when we were young.

644
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,210
Do we still date here now?

645
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,550
Let's go.

646
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,560
Where are we going?

647
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,570
We can't stay here anyway.

648
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,250
Let's go.

649
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,900
It's locked.

650
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,800
[Manhei Billiard Club]

651
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,310
This is... A master key?

652
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,520
What are you thinking?

653
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,830
It's just a normal key.

654
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,690
What does a normal key even mean?

655
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,140
Even if this is

656
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,780
Meng Xiaoshan's husband's place,

657
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,300
we can't just go in, right?

658
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,940
Qin Feng gave me the key.

659
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,760
He wants me to check the

660
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,020
surveillance equipment here

661
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,080
since I'm on break.

662
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,740
That's why I have this.

663
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,210
You should have told me earlier.

664
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,240
Do you remember where you sat?

665
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,580
By the window.

666
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,400
You turned in and saw Hai Jianfeng,

667
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,630
and got off the car to talk to him.

668
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,760
I knew you could see me coming.

669
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,330
It's quite comfortable.

670
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,650
Why did you pretend

671
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,910
not to know me that day?

672
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,590
It was crowded that day.

673
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,170
I was afraid that people would make a fuss.

674
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,440
How many times

675
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,540
have we broken up?

676
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,260
Not even once.

677
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,700
Impossible.

678
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,140
There are so many times I remember.

679
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,510
It takes two to break up.

680
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,670
Except for the last time,

681
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,540
it was always you

682
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,380
who announced that

683
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,380
you've dumped me.

684
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,750
So it's not called breaking up.

685
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,400
Fine, fight.

686
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,360
A one-sided fight?

687
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,410
I remember now. The first time was

688
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,870
the day we took graduation photos.

689
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,540
Your classmate made a fuss,

690
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,060
saying your deskmate has a crush on you.

691
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,070
I guess.

692
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,780
Why do I still get jealous thinking about it now?

693
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,260
That's normal.

694
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,590
What do you mean?

695
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,110
What are you doing?

696
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,610
You came

697
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,930
all the way here to date?

698
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:07,930
You even broke in.

699
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,790
Your boss gave me the key.

700
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,000
That's really his key.

701
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,660
Who are you?

702
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,250
Lu Chen.

703
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,500
Are you that bomb disposal expert from Lu family?

704
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:20,900
A SWAT.

705
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,030
I know. I know.

706
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,570
You're a bomb disposal expert.

707
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,900
Why are you here in the middle of the night?

708
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,090
Something happened?

709
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,700
Your boss

710
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,860
asked me to check

711
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,580
the surveillance system here.

712
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,310
He said there were blind spots.

713
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,330
He asked me to adjust

714
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,210
the angle of the camera.
