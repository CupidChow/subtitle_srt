I've never seen it before. I'm curious.

You are curious about everything.

13

00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,070
Come pick him up if you have come back.

193
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,790
If not...

194
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,350
Who should take care of him?

195
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,180
It's usually not a big deal.

196
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,140
But now the Chinese New Year is around the corner.

197
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,000
It's inappropriate to place him at anyone's house.

198
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,160
We'll see.

199
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,850
Speak it out.

200
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,580
What have you been doing recently?

201
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,460
After the class reunion,

202
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
we have had no chance to hang out with you at all.

203
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,130
I'm working.

204
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,130
What else can I do?

205
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,300
I got something to share with you.

206
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,060
I heard that

207
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:15,940
Zhao Minshan,

208
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,800
who had divorced two years ago...

209
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,550
It was hearsay, Gui Xiao.

210
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,260
I heard that

211
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,500
Chen had just returned

212
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,260
two days ago.

213
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,440
They are getting married.

214
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:33,820
Who?

215
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:35,810
Chen.

216
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,200
I remember when Chen came back last time,

217
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,250
you came to call on him.

218
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,780
So I'm telling you the news.

219
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,770
Is Lu Chen back?

220
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,110
♫You gradually feel nothing about my sharing♫

221
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,580
Yes.

222
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,350
He came back yesterday.

223
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,540
I didn't expect

224
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,920
our campus beau to be

225
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,320
obtained by Zhao Minshan.

226
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,050
♫How much indifference do I get for holding on?♫

227
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,690
Also,

228
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,230
the Zhao family is ready for a wedding.

229
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,450
They have booked the restaurant

230
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,920
♫Good night that I can't text to you♫

231
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,010
managed by Meng Xiaoshan.

232
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,380
Aren't you close to Meng Xiaoshan?

233
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:02,970
Ask her.

234
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,300
She must know better than me.

235
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,980
♫I once believed hard work would leave no regrets♫

236
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
I have to go.

237
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:14,530
♫But the situation has come to a head♫

238
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
Let's talk later.

239
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,000
Okay, bye.

240
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:21,940
♫Who will shoulder it for me?♫

241
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,560
Happy New Year in advance.

242
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,210
Happy New Year.

243
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,819
♫We said it would last forever♫

244
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,790
♫But we were separated in the end♫

245
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,010
♫I wait until I give up all resistance♫

246
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,780
♫Let time pass by♫

247
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,770
♫Never thought that love♫

248
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,640
♫Is not about the trials and tribulations♫

249
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,050
♫Not that simple♫

250
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,180
♫Let's wait until there's a twist in the plot♫

251
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,920
♫We still keep our hopes up♫

252
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,820
♫With your absence, I stand in♫

253
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,240
♫The nights when I can't even shed a tear♫

254
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,650
♫Street lights on the corner and the darkness I passed by♫

255
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,510
♫Everything's too late♫

256
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,920
I heard you went back to Beijing.

257
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,890
He just asked me to do him a favour.

258
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,210
I agreed and it's already done.

259
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,260
It should be over.

260
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,710
Don't give it too much thought.

261
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,140
He didn't say anything.

262
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,230
Hello?

263
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,630
Sorry, Gui Xiao.

264
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,300
Something urgent came up at home.

265
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,640
I'm back for two days.

266
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,700
But I had a busy schedule.

267
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,290
It's okay.

268
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,690
I'm leaving Beijing the day after tomorrow.

269
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,820
The Chinese New Year is coming.

270
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,460
It's not suitable

271
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,120
to leave the kid to my friends.

272
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,710
I heard you were back.

273
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,620
So I wanted to ask you when you will be free

274
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,220
to pick up the kid.

275
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,000
The day after tomorrow.

276
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,900
How about I just drive him there?

277
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,730
I'll go tomorrow.

278
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:34,830
It's a deal.

279
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:37,610
Thank you.

280
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,860
No problem.

281
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,310
I can help you.

282
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,090
Lu Chen.

283
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,580
I'm saving money.

284
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,110
I'll visit you when I have enough money.

285
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,020
Can we talk for one more minute, please?

286
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,390
Do you miss me?

287
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,300
Can't you say more?

288
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,020
Don't we

289
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,420
speak the same language?

290
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,100
I'm now living on campus.

291
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,950
I'm so torn.

292
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,270
There are four people in our dorm.

293
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,230
I don't know if I can get used to it.

294
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,610
Oh no.

295
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,510
My mum has known who you are.

296
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,030
Recently,

297
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,540
I can't answer the phone at home.

298
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:32,970
Don't call me.

299
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,590
Wait for my call.

300
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,040
Lu Chen.

301
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,120
Bye.

302
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,480
It's winter.

303
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,160
Why didn't you close the door and block the wind?

304
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,720
Why are your eyes red?

305
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,220
Did you quarrel with your dad?

306
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,620
No.

307
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,540
I recall the past.

308
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,010
The past?

309
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,950
Isn't your past all about Gui Xiao?

310
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,620
What could you recall?

311
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,160
Why did you break up?

312
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,500
I still haven't figured it out yet.

313
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,700
Look, when I broke up with Meng Xiaoshan,

314
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,560
it was my fault.

315
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,170
What about you two?

316
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,400
It was my fault.

317
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,520
At that time,

318
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,060
she was a girl.

319
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,700
Her emotions were all dependent

320
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,240
on the phone calls.

321
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,870
She couldn't see or touch them.

322
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,180
How pitiful.

323
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,640
Actually, during that period,

324
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,970
when I couldn't see her,

325
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,830
I missed her too.

326
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,110
I missed her so much.

327
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,530
Every time I heard her calling me Lu Chen,

328
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,470
and calling my name on the phone,

329
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,470
I would feel that she had the most pleasant voice

330
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,530
in the world.

331
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,380
Every time.

332
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,400
Enough. Stop it.

333
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,900
You're making me sad.

334
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,930
Normally,

335
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,250
she should have gotten married.

336
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,620
Her children should be teens by now.

337
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,480
Where are you going?

338
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,620
Take a shower.

339
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,860
Shower? It's Chinese New Year.

340
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,900
There's no heater in your bathroom.

341
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,700
Do you want to be frozen to death?

342
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,460
I've even taken a shower in the snow in Qining.

343
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,890
I'm not afraid of the cold.

344
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,910
I'll fix the car.

345
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,200
He dismantles the car

346
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,650
every time he feels sad.

347
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,090
It never changes.

348
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,850
I came here with only one bag of stuff.

349
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,920
But I'm leaving with this much.

350
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,050
My dad will scold me.

351
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,070
Not much at all.

352
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,300
These are

353
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,580
for you to wear

354
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,510
in school later.

355
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,610
You're going to see Uncle Lu soon.

356
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,410
Are you happy?

357
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,060
Yes.

358
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,190
I wonder if the garage

359
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,540
is still accommodable.

360
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,280
What a waste.

361
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,810
These slippers are so small.

362
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,320
Who will wear them in the future?

363
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,090
Little nag. Let's go.

364
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:16,940
Here.

365
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,940
Aunt Gui Xiao, is this the place?

366
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,620
We're here.

367
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,840
Here we are.

368
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,830
So spacious!

369
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,450
It's larger than I thought.

370
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,200
Hello, I'm looking for Lu Chen.

371
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,080
Wait, miss.

372
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,280
I'll make a call.

373
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,820
It's cold outside. Come in first.

374
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,970
Come on, kid.

375
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,870
Okay, thank you.

376
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:07,950
Let's go.

377
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,390
Someone is looking for Lu Chen. At the door.

378
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,170
A girl and a kid.

379
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,390
Miss, he'll come out now.

380
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,500
Does this garage all belong to Uncle Lu?

381
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,600
Yes.

382
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,030
Uncle Lu.

383
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,630
Is it new-bought?

384
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,120
He had too much stuff to fit.

385
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,570
So I bought him a new one.

386
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,330
I won't go in further.

387
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,240
Come.

388
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,260
Come inside and have a seat.

389
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,510
Where is the toilet?

390
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,470
At the right side.

391
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,710
It's cold in the garage.

392
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,670
Don't take off your coat first.

393
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,460
I'll leave after a few words.

394
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,940
I've found a private school

395
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,870
for Qin Xiaonan.

396
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,710
I'll be away for a long time.

397
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,650
But I'll ask my cousin

398
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,140
to take you to school.

399
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,760
I bought some clothes for him.

400
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,580
From now on,

401
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,220
you should also buy him some clothes every year.

402
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,150
But not too many.

403
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,800
He can wear school uniforms usually.

404
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,730
That's all.

405
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,060
Do you still love me?

406
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,330
Bai Chao said that

407
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,920
you were getting married.

408
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,390
Lu Chen?

409
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:53,900
Yes.

410
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,820
When?

411
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:05,990
Next month.

412
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,430
♫Could you hear?♫

413
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,550
♫Several years♫

414
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,280
Congratulations.

415
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,250
♫Ask from my soul overall desire♫

416
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,250

♫Wait for your pain, overcome the fear♫

419
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,580
Aunt.

420
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,220
Uncle Lu is getting married.

421
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,670
He'll be quite busy.

422
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,790
Remember

423
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,220
what I told you in the car.

424
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:55,370
Also,

425
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,150
if you are neglected at school,

426
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,820
remember what Aunt Gui Xiao said.

427
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:01,940
All transfer students

428
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,600
will go through this process.

429
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,780
They'll accept you after some time.

430
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,910
Aunt.

431
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,560
Go on with your work. I'm leaving.

432
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:18,700
Wait.

433
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,580
How much is the suitcase?

434
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,600
One hundred.

435
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,640
Here's for Xiaonan's clothes

436
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,740
and his living cost of staying at your house for days.

437
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,540
Thank you.

438
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,360
Lu Chen.

439
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,070
You don't have to be so calculative.

440
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,400
You helped me in Qining.

441
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,430
Lu Chen.

442
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,590
Why are you not coming out? There are guests outside.

443
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,550
You...

444
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,300
You are...

445
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,929
Gui Xiao.

446
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,940
Do you still remember me?

447
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,600
I'm Zhao Minshan from Class 2.

448
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,120
Long time no see. You've become prettier.

449
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,580
I nearly

450
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,000
couldn't recognize you.

451
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:28,940
Are you

452
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,060
the friend Lu Chen's mother mentioned?

453
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,340
I heard from Mrs. Lu that

454
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,699
he had a friend coming today.

455
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,969
Since he has been outside

456
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:35,810
all these years,

457
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:36,670
I've never seen

458
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,870
any of those friends.

459
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,750
So I came out

460
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,580
to have a look.

461
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,739
I didn't expect that it was you.

462
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,870
What a coincidence.

463
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,190
Is this your kid?

464
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,719
It's his comrade's.

465
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,679
He asked me to go through the school procedure for him.

466
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,210
Lu Chen never mentioned it.

467
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,780
I've sent the kid here.

468
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,840
I'm leaving first.

469
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,280
Please don't go.

470
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:57,290
Stay here and have lunch with us.

471
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,540
Oh, Lu Chen.

472
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,840
She traveled a long way here.

473
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,480
How could you not invite her for a meal?

474
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,000
No need.

475
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,060
I have an appointment with Meng Xiaoshan.

476
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,920
Meng Xiaoshan?

477
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,370
Forget it, then.

478
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,250
Girl.

479
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,140
Why are you leaving now?

480
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,610
I knew you were coming.

481
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,140
So I went to buy fish for you.

482
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,700
We'll see.

483
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,890
Thank you.

484
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,860
Girl, you...

485
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,120
Why don't you eat first before you leave?

486
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,100
Enough.

487
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,090
Are you okay?

488
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,350
Are you hurt?

489
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,630
I'm fine.

490
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,260
It's really broken here.

491
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,090
Just repair it here.

492
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,720
Anyone? Come over here.

493
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,550
Take the job.

494
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,530
No need.

495
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,710
I can fix it myself.

496
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,780
You can fix it here.

497
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:51,570
No need.

498
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,120
Excuse me.

499
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,170
I have to reverse out.

500
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:54,770
Thank you.

501
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,180
There's no heater in your room.

502
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,820
Your suitcase is expensive.

503
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:36,700
Your parents are so willing to

504
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,090
spend money on you.

505
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,980
You have no conscience.

506
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,750
Go and do your homework.

507
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,810
Waive the bill for that table.

508
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,010
Apologize properly.

509
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,140
Hello, Gui Xiao.

510
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,660
I'm hungry.

511
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,310
Go to the lobby.

512
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,640
I need to take this call.

513
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,510
Gui Xiao, you sound like something's wrong.

514
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,600
Did something happen at your home?

515
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:25,870
Do you need money?

516
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,080
I'll send it to you.

517
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:29,820
No.

518
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,560
I'm just hungry.

519
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,490
I haven't eaten since morning.

520
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,390
I was just passing by,

521
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,420
and I thought of

522
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
when you mentioned buying me a meal.

523
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,700
Where are you?

524
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:47,840
By the river.

525
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,360
The river?

526
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,030
Which entrance?

527
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,730
The intersection

528
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,620
outside Lu Chen's garage.

529
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,930
Are you here to pick me up?

530
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,030
What are you doing? Put me down.

531
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,690
I have something urgent to do.

532
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,870
How old are you?

533
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,100
Aren't you afraid of hurting your back?

534
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,190
Did you cry?

535
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:04,780
No.

536
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,500
I just feel

537
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,370
a little down.

538
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,560
Because of Lu Chen, right?

539
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,060
You two always came here for dates.

540
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,860
Don't think I've forgotten.

541
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,070
Let me take a guess.

542
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:33,230
You are upset

543
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,790
because of

544
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,220
Lu Chen and Zhao Minshan.

545
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,610
Everyone knows

546
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,180
about Zhao Minshan's divorce.

547
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,180
She was embarrassed and anxious to get married again.

548
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,060
But after years of hard efforts,

549
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,590
none of them impressed her.

550
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,210
Finally,

551
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,980
Lu Chen has fallen into her lap.

552
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,420
So, a few days ago,

553
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,980
since she got engaged to Lu Chen,

554
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,140
and received the betrothal gifts,

555
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,700
she was desperate to hold a grand banquet

556
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,500
immediately.

557
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,740
She has invited all her acquaintances in the neighbourhood.

558
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,810
You. How old are you?

559
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,570
Still crying for your first love after ten years?

560
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,440
Don't blame me for scolding you, Gui Xiao.

561
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,040
Do you think you are still 18?

562
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,360
There are many things you don't know.

563
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,770
When I told Hai Dong to break up,

564
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,280
we made it clean in the end.

565
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,020
You should have cried enough

566
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,580
when you broke up.

567
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,110
Everyone has a first love.

568
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,580
If you keep thinking about your first love,

569
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,310
how are you supposed to move on?

570
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,280
I'm hungry.

571
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,720
Okay, let's eat something delicious.

572
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,050
The most delicious one.

573
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,360
Give me the car key.

574
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,980
What about your car?

575
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,470
We're all acquaintances around here.

576
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,270
I'm not afraid of losing it.

577
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,170
I'll ask my husband

578
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,100
to drive it back.

579
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,230
It feels good.

580
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,450
I can switch with you if you want.

581
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,050
No need.

582
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,050
You're already dying.

583
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,880
How can I profit from your misfortunes?

584
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,970
Who's dying?
