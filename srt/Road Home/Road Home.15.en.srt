[Episode 15]

4
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,360
It's winter. Dry it better.

5
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,620
Why didn't you cut your hair?

6
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,940
I cut it once a month.

7
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,600
It's a rule from my dad.

8
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,460
That's so long.

9
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,880
Men can't take care of children.

10
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,210
They aren't as concise.

11
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,520
But it's not your fault.

12
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,000
I grew up

13
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,890
with my grandparents.

14
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,020
They are not the type

15
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,190
to dote on children.

16
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,620
They just let me do whatever I want.

17
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,800
Then I went to live with my mom.

18
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,560
But I was in boarding school.

19
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,730
So my mom

20
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,829
never taught me how to live.

21
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,930
I didn't even have hard rules

22
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,329
like cutting my nails once a month like this.

23
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,460
I had to explore everything by myself.

24
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,860
When I started on my first job,

25
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,690
a colleague held my hand and said

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,370
"Why are there frostbites on the back of your hand?

27
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,100
It's winter,

28
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,580
you should apply some moisturizer."

29
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,950
That was the first time I knew

30
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,990
how concise life should be.

31
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,410
What?

32
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,250
When I first saw you,

33
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,700
I thought you were delicate.

34
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,060
You dress so well

35
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,579
and know how to present yourself well.

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,160
You're more particular than Aunt Gui Xiao.

37
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,720
So,

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,450
don't judge a person

39
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,430
based on your first impression.

40
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,829
Listen.

41
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,290
When you cut your nails yourself,

42
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,000
the tip on both sides

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
should be cut off.

44
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,030
If not, when it grows,

45
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,150
it will prick into your flesh

46
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,950
and hurt a lot.

47
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,190
I'm going to the office this afternoon.

48
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,050
Do you want to stay at home

49
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,860
and wait for me to pick you up for dinner

50
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,720
or come with me?

51
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,740
I'll go with you?

52
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,020
Take your homework with you.

53
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,380
Okay.

54
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,190
I didn't expect

55
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,820
you

56
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,820
like kids so much.

57
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,050
It's more like

58
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,040
I sympathize with the weak.

59
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,700
I didn't come from a good family.

60
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,410
So when I see

61
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,810
kids from such families,

62
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,450
I can't help but want to lend a helping hand

63
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,650
and take care of them.

64
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,030
Captain Lu.

65
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,210
Thank you.

66
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,420
It's my pleasure.

67
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,730
I'll send the manuscript

68
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,900
to your email once I'm done organizing it.

69
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,250
Sure.

70
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,040
Captain Lu.

71
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,010
Are you married?

72
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,510
Soon.

73
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,020
Good!

74
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,530
Although I've never been married,

75
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,010
I really hope

76
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,870
to see you young people happy.

77
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,990
Someone who can accept your job

78
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,050
must be a good lady.

79
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,070
She is a good lady.

80
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:56,900
Good.

81
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,210
Goodbye, Captain Lu.

82
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,500
See you again.

83
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,040
Okay.

84
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:01,670
Liu,

85
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,210
thank you.

86
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,780
You're welcome.

87
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,180
Food is here.

88
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:26,500
Eat up.

89
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,060
Change your clothes after you're done eating.

90
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,720
I'll take you to meet someone.

91
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,800
A relative of mine.

92
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,460
This is my old captain's house.

93
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,130
Go knock on the door.

94
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:09,530
101.

95
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,570
Coming.

96
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:23,940
Who is it?

97
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,060
Why are you here?

98
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,090
Didn't they say

99
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,550
you were transferred from Qining?

100
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,750
Yes, I returned home.

101
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,740
I came back this time

102
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,570
to finish up the final procedures.

103
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,230
Good, good.

104
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,409
This is...

105
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,010
Your girlfriend?

106
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,360
We're engaged.

107
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,740
Her name is Gui Xiao.

108
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,909
You're engaged?

109
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,770
That's great!

110
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,980
Come in.

111
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,620
Come in and talk.

112
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,280
Don't stand outside. Come in.

113
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,300
You should've called me

114
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,580
before you came.

115
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,130
I'm just eating alone.

116
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,010
I didn't prepare anything at home.

117
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:57,820
How about this?

118
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,950
You two have a seat.

119
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,010
I'll go to the supermarket.

120
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,740
I'll be back soon.

121
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,670
I bought things.

122
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,070
These are all your favourite food.

123
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,170
You just have to bring yourself,

124
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,730
why bring anything else?

125
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,540
Let me tell you.

126
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,620
My husband is his former leader.

127
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,770
Back then,

128
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,090
he tried all he could

129
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,460
to bring him to Qining.

130
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,470
He has told me that.

131
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,420
That's fine.

132
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:27,820
It's okay.

133
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,620
Let him do his thing.

134
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,220
Let's sit.

135
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,420
When he first came,

136
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,560
he was very busy.

137
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,170
He couldn't go home every Chinese New Year.

138
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,610
He spent it at our home.

139
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,800
So,

140
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,040
just take this place as your home.

141
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,570
Make yourself comfortable.

142
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:42,980
Okay.

143
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,190
This is the speciality milk tea here.

144
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,720
Have some if you're hungry.

145
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,659
Food will be ready in half an hour.

146
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,540
Try this.

147
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,030
Drink it while it's hot.

148
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,460
How is it?

149
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,580
It's delicious.

150
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,210
How...

151
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,780
How did you know each other?

152
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,330
Through a blind date?

153
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:19,900
No.

154
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,920
Else...

155
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,370
Oh right, online dating.

156
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,130
Young people nowadays

157
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,570
like to meet new people

158
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,900
on the Internet, right?

159
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,220
Not that either?

160
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,140
Could it be that you two

161
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,179
met each other on the street

162
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,240
and fell in love at first sight, then?

163
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,990
It was... indeed love at first sight.

164
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,600
What's wrong?

165
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,440
Did I say something wrong?

166
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:05,960
No.

167
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,180
This

168
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,530
is the marriage gift

169
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,670
my husband and I prepared

170
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,530
for Lu Yanchen.

171
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,700
What is this for.

172
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,400
Enough.

173
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:21,940
Go

174
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,310
get two bowls of soup from the kitchen.

175
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,580
Gui Xiao.

176
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Let me tell you.

177
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,990
Lu Yanchen’s

178
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,140
family's situation

179
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,010
is not his fault.

180
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,840
He's just unlucky.

181
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,510
If you two get married,

182
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,310
there are some things

183
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,350
you might need to turn a blind eye to.

184
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,910
If something bad

185
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,230
happens,

186
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,500
on the account that

187
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,510
he is

188
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,100
a very good kid,

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,150
don't break up with him easily.

190
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,580
Let me tell you.

191
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,920
When he first came here...

192
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,230
Yes,

193
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,070
he's a top student.

194
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,280
But those days,

195
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,430
his eyes were...

196
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,110
his eyes were wandering, you know?

197
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,340
My husband told me

198
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,460
his family

199
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,200
has a great impact on him.

200
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,220
This child

201
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,250
suffered a lot.

202
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,910
But

203
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,570
he can still be

204
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,980
so upright and kind,

205
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,350
it's not easy for him.

206
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,140
I know everything about his family.

207
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,430
We've known each other for more than a decade.

208
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,760
And he won't hide it from me.

209
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,470
Yes.

210
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,300
You're right.

211
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,490
He is actually someone

212
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,590
who's straightforward,

213
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:50,940
someone who

214
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,380
won't hide anything.

215
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,750
Let me tell you.

216
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,790
In the future, if anything happens,

217
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,700
just call me.

218
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,800
He

219
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,500
is just like my own son.

220
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,040
If he bullies you,

221
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,430
I'll teach him a lesson.

222
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,370
Okay.

223
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,430
It's hot.

224
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,900
No carrots.

225
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,300
Why?

226
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,980
You don't eat carrots?

227
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,670
She's always been a picky eater.

228
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,930
There are a lot of things she doesn't eat.

229
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,060
Here.

230
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,290
Put on this bracelet

231
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,490
for your girlfriend.

232
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,100
No need.

233
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,630
Put it on.

234
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,630
Let me see if it fits.

235
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,360
Hurry up.

236
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,670
You bought it, it must be suitable.

237
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,000
What's wrong with you today?

238
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,400
You...

239
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,980
Why are you so shy?

240
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,930
What's going on?

241
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,980
How is that possible?

242
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,750
Like this.

243
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,860
Put it on.

244
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,380
You should go back in. It's cold.

245
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,830
I want to watch you go.

246
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,730
Call me if anything happens.

247
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,790
There's Qin Mingyu too.

248
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,630
Got it.

249
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:35,980
Get in.

250
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,130
Take care.

251
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,290
She treats you as her son.

252
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,220
The past ten years in Qining,

253
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,360
she and the old captain

254
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,860
took care of me the most.

255
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,050
When you came to Qining last time,

256
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,830
he just passed away.

257
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,600
They don't have children.

258
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,970
Qin Mingyu and I sent him off.

259
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,180
When you

260
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,290
called me then,

261
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,060
I was on my way

262
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,990
to visit the old captain's father.

263
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,700
You don't like it?

264
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,260
No, I like it.

265
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,100
But gold bangles are soft.

266
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,430
It can be deformed if I wear it for too long.

267
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,410
For something as meaningful as this,

268
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,610
I have to keep it well.

269
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,230
It'll be a waste

270
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,740
if I wear it every day.

271
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:06,970
Come here.

272
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,470
Thank you for coming with me.

273
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,500
Captain Lu...

274
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,790
Left just like this?

275
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,830
It didn't hit me last time.

276
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,120
But now that he's done with the procedure,

277
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,760
it finally feels real.

278
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,120
How mushy.

279
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,200
Come give us a hand.

280
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,500
Let me finish being sad.

281
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,020
Didn't I tell you?

282
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,940
Let me suppress my emotions

283
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,780
first.

284
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,350
How embarrassing.

285
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,190
Did you say

286
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,310
you want to see the K9 you've trained?

287
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,110
Yes, Captain Lu.

288
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,890
I’ll let it out for you.

289
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,990
It’s time to say goodbye.

290
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,720
Lu Yanchen.

291
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,140
We are ranked lower than cars?

292
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,170
You should be telling us that.

293
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,970
Your son is still with me.

294
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,310
What farewell?

295
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,030
You reminded me.

296
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,250
Here.

297
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,890
Living expenses, tuition fees.

298
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,060
If this is too much, no need to return the margin.

299
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,480
If this is too little, I'll make it up.

300
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,140
It doesn't cost much to study.

301
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,300
Food,

302
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,020
books and stationeries

303
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,880
all cost money.

304
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,520
I’ll tell you when I use money.

305
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,680
Captain Lu,

306
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,690
do you not have anything to say to me?

307
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,460
You trained me

308
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,650
personally.

309
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,450
It's the organization that trained you.

310
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,710
Just don't embarrass the organization.

311
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,610
You're so bad at words.

312
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,540
How does sister-in-law stand it?

313
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,420
Do I need to

314
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,420
be good at words towards men?

315
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,620
What about brothers?

316
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,910
If we're brothers,

317
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,260
do we have to be so wishy-washy

318
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,320
and talk nonsense?

319
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,940
You're still as good

320
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,400
at talking back to people.

321
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,620
How did you do your check?

322
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,850
The oil tank is leaking.

323
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:39,460
No way.

324
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,710
Be more serious.

325
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,300
Bend down. Squat down.

326
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,230
Look carefully.

327
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,560
Where is it leaking?

328
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,260
It's breaking, it's breaking.

329
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:51,900
My waist is important!

330
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,740
I don’t have a girlfriend,

331
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,330
Captain Lu!

332
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,540
Do you still dare to ramble on?

333
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,230
No, no.

334
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,370
Officer Qin,

335
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,250
don’t you care?

336
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,340
I realized you've

337
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,740
been pretty rude lately.

338
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,150
Just right, he could teach you a lesson.

339
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,750
You two are in cahoots.

340
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,380
It's your first day knowing this?

341
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,020
Officer Qin.

342
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,700
I'll write reports for you.

343
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,819
I will write all your reports for one year.

344
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,660
That sounds good.

345
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,790
I'm wavered.

346
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,550
You're tempted by that?

347
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,180
Bring on more requirements.

348
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,579
Forget it.

349
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,780
It's not easy for him.

350
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,089
Think carefully.

351
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,020
There's no chance after tonight,

352
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,750
Captain Qin.

353
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,220
I need to think about it then.

354
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,839
From now on,

355
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,060
I will never snatch the lamb and leek dumplings

356
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,390
from you in the canteen.

357
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,820
I won't pretend to be unconscious

358
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,970
and let you drive me again.

359
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:33,970
That sounds good.

360
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,380
I won't steal your phone

361
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:36,860
and send texts

362
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,990
begging to reconcile to your ex-wife.

363
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,040
Say that again.

364
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,670
- I’m kidding.
- Captain Lu.

365
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,860
Captain Lu.

366
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,150
I thought

367
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:00,980
you have left

368
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,770
Qining City.

369
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,660
Look at you.

370
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,460
It's been two months since we last met.

371
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,060
Your physique has improved?

372
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,970
I heard you were still here

373
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,230
so I came immediately after my training.

374
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,900
Thank you, Captain Lu.

375
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,760
It’s freezing.

376
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,400
Me too.

377
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,650
Of course.

378
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,060
I have to take care of my brother.

379
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,180
My boyfriend

380
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,500
cried so hard

381
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,140
because Captain Lu is leaving.

382
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,070
He's over there.

383
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,770
He cried?

384
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,190
Yes.

385
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,500
He's so sentimental.

386
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,220
So cute.

387
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,120
When are you two getting married?

388
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,530
We plan to get married next year.

389
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,880
He'll take a long break and go home.

390
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,160
Let's add each other on WeChat.

391
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,830
I'll send you a red packet.

392
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,710
I'll send you one too.

393
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,200
For you and Captain Lu.

394
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,060
We can exchange red packets

395
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,460
so I can borrow your luck.

396
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:05,980
Sure.

397
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,270
Scan my code.

398
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,230
I'm not asleep.

399
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,520
I've been waiting for you.

400
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,090
I told you to sleep first.

401
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,810
I was afraid you would be sad

402
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,380
to leave your second hometown.

403
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,500
So I've been doing my best to stay up,

404
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,540
waiting for you.

405
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,700
Why aren't you saying anything?

406
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,450
Gui Xiao,

407
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,390
I want to marry you.

408
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,850
I want to be with you forever.

409
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,180
Do you know that?

410
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,870
No morning exercise today.

411
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:41,260
It's rare

412
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,970
that we get to slack off like this.

413
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,630
Captain Lu,

414
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,470
don’t take it seriously with us.

415
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,270
I'll wait for you in the car.

416
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,180
I've decided to tell you.

417
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,890
I’m getting married.

418
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,820
Congratulations, Captain Lu.

419
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,130
Congratulations, Captain Lu.

420
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:31,790
Captain Lu.

421
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,500
Finally someone wants you.

422
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,400
Everyone has already guessed it.

423
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,790
You want to trip me, right?

424
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,760
Be careful.

425
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,090
If you're missing a leg,

426
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,990
it'll be hard to find a wife.

427
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,650
Captain Lu,

428
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,990
I only exposed that

429
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,870
you want to meet sister-in-law.

430
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,210
When I get an honorable discharge and return to my hometown,

431
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:49,740
I'll find someone

432
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,340
as pretty as sister-in-law.

433
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,200
What are you talking about?

434
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:54,850
Can you consider my feelings?

435
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,910
I'm a divorced man.

436
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,320
I'm leaving.

437
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,850
See you.

438
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,270
They are here to see you off.

439
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,970
Go down and say a few more words.

440
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,540
Even just one more word would be nice.

441
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,090
The base camp is made out of iron, but soldiers are always changing.

442
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,290
I've said everything

443
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,370
I should when I left

444
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,130
last time.

445
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:08,580
[Road Home]

446
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:08,580
[The rivers and mountains, are protected by me. That's all I want this life, no need for farewell.]

447
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:08,580
[The blood is still hot, still flowing. The heart is still alive, in the chest.]

448
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:34,900
Pick one.

449
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,560
Tell me how to wash them.

450
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,970
Teach me how to use the washing machine.

451
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,460
Pour the detergent here

452
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,390
and press on start here, that's it.

453
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,460
I can do this too.

454
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,490
I've never explored the other functions.

455
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,330
Knowing where the start button is

456
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,930
and where to pour the detergent in

457
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,730
is enough.

458
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,150
Where is the manual?

459
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,710
I'll look for it tomorrow.

460
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,890
The other functions

461
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,210
are quite useless.

462
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,570
This is a habit I've developed over these years.

463
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,200
I want to know every single thing about

464
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
everything I use.

465
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,160
It's best if

466
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,850
I can dismantle them into parts

467
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,990
and put them back.

468
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,460
That makes me feel good.

469
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,980
It's an occupational disease.

470
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,710
These are not cheap.

471
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,470
Don't dismantle it secretly.

472
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,140
Put it down.

473
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,790
The cleaning lady is coming next week.

474
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,590
Hang it up.

475
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,890
Does it look like when we were young?

476
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:58,770
How so?

477
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,870
You working and I watch by the side.

478
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,860
And you will say a few words,

479
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,320
saying you're guilty,

480
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,070
but keep watching me work.

481
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,400
Really?

482
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,810
I peeled onions for you.

483
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,250
Haidong said

484
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,020
that Gui Xiao is fated to be blessed.

485
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,490
Stop struggling.

486
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:22,740
I don't mind.

487
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,300
Why are you unhappy to be blessed?

488
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,850
If you

489
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,170
can make it sound better,

490
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,370
it would feel better.

491
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,490
There's no way then.

492
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
People who do work

493
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,910
are always short-tempered.

494
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,960
I don't want to talk to you.

495
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,420
I'm going to take a shower.

496
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,730
I want soup.

497
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,110
Really.

498
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,490
What soup?

499
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,230
I will eat everything you cook.

500
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,030
I'm not picky.

501
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,340
Alright, Young Lady.

502
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,670
Let me check what's in the fridge.

503
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,730
Go take a shower first.

504
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,610
I have something to tell you later.

505
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,130
Can't you tell me now?

506
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,960
After I finish my work.

507
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,170
Sleep more.

508
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,160
No.

509
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,720
I accidentally fell asleep just now.

510
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,060
I'll get you some soup.

511
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:46,890
No need.

512
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,860
I won't have it anymore.

513
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,480
Didn't you say

514
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,140
you have something to tell me?

515
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,370
At Qining,

516
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,500
after the old captain passed away,

517
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,880
I submitted my resignation report.

518
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,010
After the big disaster that happened,

519
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,650
I planned to take the blame and resign.

520
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,530
But it's not your fault.

521
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,250
At that time,

522
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,510
I couldn't get over it.

523
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,500
Later, my former captain

524
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,360
submitted the application for me without me knowing,

525
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,420
asking me to leave.

526
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,930
To leave Qining

527
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,260
and relax myself back home.

528
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,250
I was thinking

529
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,530
if I

530
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,770
quit being a SWAT,

531
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,370
what else can I do in Beijing?

532
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:52,880
In Qining,

533
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,330
Gao Hai told me

534
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,730
a lot of things about you.

535
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,070
What did he say?

536
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,580
He said

537
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:03,020
Captain Lu is good at many foreign languages.

538
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,600
He also knows how to dispose bombs,

539
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,120
draw,

540
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,690
and draw portraits.

541
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,310
He's an all-rounder.

542
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,970
He rarely says nice things.

543
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:14,960
People like you

544
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,730
are hotblooded.

545
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,010
Your heart is loyal to your motherland.

546
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,990
If your blood is cold,

547
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,620
and you don't have your heart anymore,

548
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,260
you won’t be Lu Yanchen.

549
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,900
Marriage is different from dating.

550
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,960
If we want to build a family,

551
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,890
you have to consider

552
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,140
my occupation.

553
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,090
When I'm on a mission,

554
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,040
we won't be able to contact frequently.

555
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,470
When I get busy, I won't be able to care too much about our family.

556
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,200
And I have to face danger often.

557
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,170
I know.

558
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:58,480
I'm not

559
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,810
a kid who knows nothing.

560
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,080
I wouldn't be able to do it

561
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,260
if I were to go into this line of work.

562
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,430
I am mentally weak.

563
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:05,990
When I was doing my Gaokao,

564
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,990
I was so scared.

565
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,210
In the first exam,

566
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,330
my brain went blank.

567
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,330
I only recovered after half an hour.

568
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:12,810
But

569
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,150
if it's you who's doing it,

570
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,840
I have no objections.

571
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,340
The breakup was different from this time.

572
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,190
It was a special situation

573
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,250
and I was young.

574
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,800
When I think about how

575
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,930
you might not come back even after years, or decades,

576
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,060
I couldn't stand it.

577
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,640
Don't blame me.

578
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,550
I never did.

579
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,520
All right.

580
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,240
This topic is over.

581
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,090
That's it.

582
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,560
We won't discuss it anymore.

583
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,410
I am determined to be a wife of a police officer.

584
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:09,770
Okay.

585
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,449
Let's discuss

586
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,670
about our marriage.

587
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,199
We just got back to Beijing.

588
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:19,690
It...

589
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,870
It's been less than three hours.

590
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,310
Can we not

591
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,170
talk about something so serious?

592
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,489
We must get married.

593
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,290
The sooner, the better.

594
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,989
We can only discuss one serious thing a day.

595
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,520
We've used up the quota for today,

596
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,179
Captain Lu.

597
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,440
Hello?

598
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:53,780
Yes.

599
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,810
I'm here.

600
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,280
In Beijing.

601
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,590
Okay.

602
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,460
I'll go back now.

603
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,120
Where are you going?

604
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,680
Home.

605
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,780
It's not good for you to go in.

606
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,650
Stay here.

607
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,310
Your brother-in-law is here.

608
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,570
My son is back.

609
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,270
What can I do for you?

610
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,190
It's fine.

611
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,950
It's just that the old man is old.

612
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,440
Don't always get drunk and make a fuss outside.

613
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,690
It's not his home.

614
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,140
Also,

615
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,400
the victim said to let him off

616
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,000
on the account that he's old.

617
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,120
But this might not be the case next time.

618
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,380
Sorry for the trouble.

619
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,250
All right.

620
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,210
Let's disperse.

621
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,120
Yes.

622
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,330
It's a family matter. Go home.

623
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,080
Disperse.

624
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,160
Go back with my sister.

625
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,290
Your kid is waiting.

626
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,320
It's okay.

627
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,480
My mom is helping to look after him as he does his homework.

628
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,500
Don't deal with such things in the future.

629
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,800
You are a school principal.

630
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,450
Everyone in the neighborhood knows you.

631
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,310
It doesn't look good.

632
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,350
I would be worried

633
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,970
if your sister comes alone.

634
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,990
You haven't slept

635
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,700
since you came back from Qining, right?

636
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,230
Exactly.

637
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,080
Your sister and I can stay here.

638
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,680
It's okay.

639
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,630
Leave it to me.

640
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,360
You can go.

641
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,570
There are things I need to talk to Dad about.

642
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,410
He's drunk.

643
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,690
Don't argue with him now.

644
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,620
I know what to do.

645
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,440
Luchen is not a kid anymore.

646
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,810
He knows how to deal with it.

647
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,340
Besides,

648
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,970
when you were young,

649
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,080
he was the one who protected you too.

650
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,870
He will be fine now.

651
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,400
Let's go.

652
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,350
When did you come back?

653
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,310
Just now.

654
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,270
Your dad...

655
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,720
I'll leave him to you.

656
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,330
Can you get up?

657
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,770
Who are you looking down on?

658
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:08,950
I...

659
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,620
I'll get...

660
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,330
I'll get up and show you.

661
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,410
I'll get up.

662
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:30,600
My brother-in-law

663
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,330
is a man with a good reputation.

664
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,680
He is the principal of a school.

665
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,320
He has to keep dealing

666
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,680
with your issues.

667
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,730
Don't you feel guilty?

668
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,080
Cut the crap.

669
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,860
I'll get some water first.

670
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,540
I'm so–

671
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:46,820
Drink.

672
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,130
Drink water.

673
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,940
You don't allow me to drink?

674
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,200
Fine.

675
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,920
I won't drink then.

676
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,050
I'll go take a nap.

677
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:56,950
Nap...

678
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,140
I'll take... a nap.

679
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,770
Just listen with your eyes closed.

680
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,890
I'm telling you something.

681
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,090
Don't say it.

682
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,270
Let me tell you first.

683
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,320
I asked you

684
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,500
to marry Miss Zhao

685
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,130
for your own good.

686
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,240
The money you make

687
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,730
is not enough to pay off my debt.

688
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,240
Nowadays,

689
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,570
marrying anyone would be the same for you.

690
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,460
Finding a rich in-law

691
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,470
is what our family needs now.

692
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,490
You're still young.

693
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,180
I'm your father.

694
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,110
You have to think for me.

695
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,820
I'm indeed getting married.

696
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,650
With whom?

697
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,570
That is

698
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,850
not important to you.

699
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,330
What are you talking about?

700
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,140
I just hope

701
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,840
you can stay away from

702
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,690
my family and my life.

703
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,340
I-I won't.

704
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,410
But you have to make it clear

705
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,840
to that partner of yours.

706
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,130
You have to take care of me.

707
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,160
Let me finish.

708
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,990
I'm not listening to you.

709
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,110
I can't control you either.

710
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,710
You're so tough.

711
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,310
Listen carefully.

712
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,010
I can take care of you.

713
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,690
But you have to be good to my mom.

714
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,730
Am I not good to your mom?

715
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,190
You know that yourself.

716
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,150
Just one thing.

717
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,830
My life,

718
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:34,770
and my family,

719
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,980
you're not allowed to come between them.

720
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,170
You're leaving?

721
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,060
It's been so many years.

722
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:05,970
You know

723
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,200
your dad would only be like this when he's drunk.

724
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,670
He has calmed down.

725
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,490
Good.

726
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:14,800
Mom.

727
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:15,940
I have something to do.

728
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,000
I'll make my leave.

729
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,350
[Beijing]

730
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,600
Sit here.

731
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,210
Here.

732
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,090
You came back for that dad of yours?

733
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,440
Same as usual.

734
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,800
Thank you, boss.

735
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,280
You're in a rush?

736
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,570
I wanted to talk to you.

737
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,570
Maybe another day.

738
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,270
My partner wakes up late.

739
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,000
If I eat fast,

740
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,190
I can rush back

741
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,520
and make her breakfast.

742
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,840
The lady from last time?

743
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,750
It has always been her,

744
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,440
all along.

745
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:28,590
Enough talking.

746
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,260
It's getting too late.

747
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,950
Okay.

748
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,780
We'll talk when you're free.

749
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,590
Actually,

750
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,260
I have nothing much to say.

751
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,480
I'm afraid you'll be upset by

752
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,220
what happened yesterday.

753
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,120
I'm used to it.
