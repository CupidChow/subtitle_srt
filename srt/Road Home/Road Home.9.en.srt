00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,390
Give me half a catty

196
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,350
of prawns.

197
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,140
Prawns are expensive

198
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,160
these days.

199
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,120
It's going to be Chinese New Year soon.

200
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,260
It's expensive for me to get them too.

201
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,460
The price has gone up.

202
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,800
I have no choice.

203
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,550
-It’s okay, go ahead.
-I'm not scamming you.

204
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,020
Okay.

205
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,120
Give me another one.

206
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,350
Pick the best one.

207
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:23,810
Auntie.

208
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,250
You're leaving?

209
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,050
I've changed the bedsheets, I should go.

210
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,820
He doesn't want me around.

211
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,030
If it's convenient for you,

212
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,880
come with him to have a meal

213
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,760
at my house.

214
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,220
Let that kid

215
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,410
come too.

216
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
I'll let him know when he comes back.

217
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,060
See you.

218
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,530
Take care.

219
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,520
Why did you come out?

220
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,760
Your mother came just now.

221
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,320
She seemed a little unhappy.

222
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,830
I was afraid I might say something wrong,

223
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,160
so I came out for a while.

224
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Did she bully you?

225
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,820
No.

226
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,340
Your mother is nice.

227
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,900
She even asked Qin Xiaonan and me

228
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,160
to go eat at your house.

229
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,190
Are we going?

230
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,990
Do you want to go?

231
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,060
I bought so many things.

232
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,290
It's a waste if we don't eat them.

233
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:08,750
Go on in.

234
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,650
If I don't go,

235
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,580
shouldn't we explain it to her?

236
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,420
I think

237
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,330
she really wants you to go back.

238
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:16,930
It's okay.

239
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,500
I'll talk to her later.

240
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,660
Chen.

241
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,010
Someone is making trouble inside.

242
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,360
I can't handle it.

243
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,380
Wait here.

244
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,080
Don't touch the bag.

245
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,170
The water on it is dirty.

246
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,030
It's not clean.

247
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,040
You must give us an explanation.

248
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,980
Calm down.

249
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,360
Ask your boss to come out.

250
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,070
Wait here.

251
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,500
I'll go in and take a look.

252
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,260
What are you looking at?

253
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:41,940
Fix it!

254
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,540
Why did you buy two big fish?

255
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,500
Isn't there a small one too?

256
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,600
Uncle Lu said

257
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,040
he was scared you might want to eat a big fish

258
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,300
and we didn't have one.

259
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,020
Here.

260
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,430
Sir.

261
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,860
Can you

262
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,120
get us some warm water?

263
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,880
Okay. You go in first.

264
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,240
I'll get you some water.

265
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,320
Okay, thank you.

266
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,020
Thank you.

267
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,160
You're welcome.

268
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,770
I'm happy that you came to chat with me.

269
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,970
Come here more often.

270
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,640
She will come often.

271
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,280
I'll get going then.

272
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,810
Go ahead.

273
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:30,860
Wash your hands.

274
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,750
Sister-in-law?

275
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,560
Hai Dong?

276
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,070
We've finally met.

277
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,740
Meng Xiaoshan told me about you.

278
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,540
Lu Chen told me about you.

279
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,900
But I didn't get to see you.

280
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,910
When did you get here?

281
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,430
In the morning,

282
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,560
around ten o’clock.

283
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,360
Lu Chen didn't tell me. He's hiding you from me.

284
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,980
If he'd told me,

285
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,510
I'd have come immediately.

286
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,530
Wait a minute.

287
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,670
There are some punks outside

288
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,260
causing trouble.

289
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,300
I'll go take a look.

290
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,820
I'll get rid of the water for you.

291
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,180
Okay.

292
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,240
Take this away too.

293
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,570
Okay.

294
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,260
You're not leaving tonight, right?

295
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,190
Stay for dinner.

296
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,880
I'm staying.

297
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,319
I'll sleep at Meng Xiaoshan's place tonight.

298
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,109
That's good.

299
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,319
The fish jumped out just now.

300
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:24,910
Qin Xiaonan and I got dirty

301
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,390
when we put it back in.

302
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:28,750
Let's go.

303
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,760
Let's go cook.

304
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,920
Is everything okay at the garage?

305
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,800
It's nothing.

306
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,150
Who do you think I am?

307
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,680
I got nervous and forgot.

308
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,250
Go

309
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,950
and do your workbook.

310
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,180
If we don't go,

311
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,900
shouldn't we tell your mother

312
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,980
in person?

313
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,830
There's no need.

314
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,140
I'll tell her myself.

315
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,670
How do you want to eat it?

316
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,340
What kind of fish is this?

317
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,200
Mandarin fish.

318
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,620
It's expensive.

319
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,190
How expensive can a fish be?

320
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,700
How do you want it?

321
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,070
I want squirrel fish.

322
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,770
You're still as picky as when you were young.

323
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,700
Don't you think it's troublesome?

324
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:40,790
Hai Dong.

325
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,880
Let's eat together when you're free.

326
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,520
Hai Dong.

327
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,340
Business has been booming lately.

328
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,550
Don't forget about us.

329
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,440
Go away.

330
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,230
Hurry up.

331
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,820
Don't do anything stupid again.

332
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,350
Hai Dong.

333
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,840
Buy a packet of cornstarch for me!

334
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,070
Okay.

335
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:11,300
[Fortune Garden]

336
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,310
What are you doing in front of my hotel?

337
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,710
You want to borrow money?

338
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,490
No, I'm buying cornstarch.

339
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,500
Who can make you run errands for them?

340
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,020
Chen. Who else could it be?

341
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,750
He's cooking?

342
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,530
Who is he hosting?

343
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,860
Your sister, Gui Xiao.

344
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,980
She's back?

345
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,040
Tell her that

346
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,010
I'll keep the door open for her tonight

347
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,210
at my parents' place.

348
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:40,990
Okay.

349
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,050
I'll go in first.

350
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,710
I'm so busy.

351
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:04,780
Here.

352
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,220
Check if it's too salty.

353
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,030
It's not.

354
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,590
It's really fresh.

355
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,780
Come on.

356
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,510
How did you do it?

357
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,970
It opened just like that?

358
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,250
Take it easy.

359
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,620
Don't hurt yourself.

360
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,780
I have a cousin

361
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,910
who's in a SWAT team.

362
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,630
She even trained to smash bricks

363
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,760
with her bare hands.

364
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,150
Do you know how to do it?

365
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,940
I've never trained for it.

366
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,070
I'm not good at that.

367
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,810
But I once

368
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,700
mentored a team member

369
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,700
who liked to do it.

370
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,820
He had a stack of them lined up.

371
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:23,860
I think he must have smashed

372
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,120
dozens of them in a row.

373
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,270
That's great.

374
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,160
Great.

375
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,900
We were waiting for you.

376
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,140
I've bought the stuff.

377
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,910
I've also prepared

378
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,900
alcohol and my sentimentality.

379
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,710
We're just waiting for your dish.

380
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,910
Let me have a good cry.

381
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,130
I'll go cook.

382
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,730
I saw his mother just now.

383
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,910
Lu Chen’s mom came?

384
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,970
It was most likely that aunt-in-law

385
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,800
from the finance office who asked her to come.

386
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
My mom told me that

387
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,690
when Lu Chen was three,

388
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,550
he was punished and scolded by his dad

389
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,520
during Chinese New Year.

390
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,270
It was just because Lu Chen

391
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,730
had said something wrong.

392
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,170
He stood beside the dining table

393
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,170
for a whole night.

394
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,300
Lu Chen’s mother wanted to see Lu Chen,

395
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
but his aunt-in-law didn't let her.

396
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:21,700
Lu Chen's father

397
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,360
favored sons over daughters.

398
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,510
He used to hit his sister whenever he got drunk.

399
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,110
In the end,

400
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,970
Lu Chen would deliberately provoke his father.

401
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,700
He saved his sister many times.

402
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,210
Now, he's finally grown up.

403
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,730
It wasn't easy.

404
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,660
By the way,

405
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,720
are you two ready to make up?

406
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,260
No.

407
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,310
We're just friends.

408
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,140
Just friends?

409
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,660
Take care.

410
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,830
I'll be happy

411
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,460
if you two are happy.

412
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,270
I've brought him back for you.

413
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,690
Make him drink more water.

414
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,660
Keep an eye on him tonight.

415
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,390
Don't worry.

416
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,680
Sister-in-law.

417
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:35,870
Get in.

418
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,280
Let's meet another day.

419
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,030
Gui Xiao?

420
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,070
I'm Hai Jianfeng.

421
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,130
Do you remember me?

422
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,260
Of course.

423
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,980
Wait.

424
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,300
I was in Dalian a couple of days ago,

425
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,620
when they talked about having a class reunion.

426
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,420
I thought it was a pity that I couldn't see you.

427
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,100
You...

428
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,940
Hai Jianfeng.

429
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,160
You're not allowed to have designs on Gui Xiao anymore.

430
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,200
She's Chen's wife now.

431
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,140
What are you talking about?

432
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,300
I was just excited

433
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,140
to see an old classmate.

434
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,690
Come on.

435
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,940
Let me tell you.

436
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,570
This brother of mine

437
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,200
fell in love with your wife

438
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,290
on the first day of secondary school.

439
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,700
You wouldn't even believe it.

440
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,910
Even now, he still has

441
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,920
a photo of Gui Xiao

442
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,820
by his bedside.

443
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,940
It's been there since graduation!

444
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,300
My brother is talking nonsense.

445
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,370
G- Gui Xiao.

446
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,100
You are Chen look good together.

447
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,110
It wasn't easy for you two.

448
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,080
Y- You look good together.

449
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,680
Hasn't everyone had a crush?

450
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,930
If Lu Chen hadn’t come back,

451
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,070
you might have stood a chance.

452
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:30,850
Brother, you...

453
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,340
Alright.

454
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,470
Let's stop talking.

455
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,540
Why did you drink so much?

456
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:37,850
Mom.

457
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,780
Let me introduce them to you, Gui Xiao.

458
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,780
This is my sister.

459
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,370
This is my mom.

460
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,620
We'll go in first.

461
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,080
-Okay.
-Go back.

462
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,940
♫Easy come, easy go♫

463
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,750
Alright.

464
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,480
Where is the photo?

465
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,360
Let me see.

466
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:55,980
Chen.

467
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,410
My brother is drunk.

468
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,170
He was talking nonsense.

469
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,700
I put it away a long time ago.

470
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,100
I'll get it now.

471
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:05,880
I'll get it for you now.

472
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,680
W- Wait for me.

473
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,740
There's no need!

474
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,020
It's quite pretty.

475
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,640
I don't even have this photo.

476
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,510
Thank you for safekeeping it for me.

477
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,440
You're welcome.

478
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,570
We'll leave now.

479
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,740
Go back in.

480
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,480
I was so young back then.

481
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,440
How did he get your photo?

482
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,390
I don't know.

483
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,220
I remember the teacher

484
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,180
took this photo.

485
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,770
Maybe he asked the teacher for it.

486
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,610
He's quite thoughtful.

487
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,730
If you hadn't come to Qining,

488
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,290
I wouldn't have come back.

489
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,270
The last time I went to Qining,

490
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,110
even if I hadn't lost my car,

491
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,310
I would have gone to find you.

492
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,140
I asked Huang Ting for your phone number

493
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,040
two years ago.

494
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,470
I can even recite it backwards.

495
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,880
Recite it for me.

496
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,310
I've forgotten now.

497
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,220
You forgot it once you saw me?

498
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,320
Call me before going to bed.

499
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,540
Bye.

500
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,930
I was worried that you'll sleep at the garage.

501
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,990
There are too many prying eyes there.

502
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,100
Come to think of it,

503
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,560
Lu Chen is quite sensible.

504
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,960
He really sent you here.

505
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,180
It's no different from when you dated

506
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,310
when you were young.

507
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,620
You still can't bear to part with him.

508
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,480
It's like you earn money

509
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,140
by taking one more look at him.

510
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,100
My parents are not home today.

511
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,360
It's just the two of us.

512
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,620
I saw his mother today.

513
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
She doesn’t look like Lu Chen at all.

514
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,370
I didn’t recognize her.

515
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,770
His parents are hard to get along with.

516
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:08,710
I can't be bothered to deal with them

517
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,130
even though I'm so sociable.

518
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:10,730
You

519
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,710
better not see them often.

520
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,070
Did you talk to him

521
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,720
after sending Hai Dong back?

522
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,270
No.

523
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,390
You've cleared all the obstacles.

524
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,850
Hurry up if you want to do something about it.

525
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,710
I'll take my time.

00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:30,980
right?

571
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,970
♫I'll sing for you♫

572
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,460
I don't know.

573
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,620
Meng Xiaoshan didn't tell me

574
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,430
about her neighbors.

575
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,470
♫We need to cultivate our relationship♫

576
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,840
What about it?

577
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,150
♫I believe you can do it♫

578
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,830
Hold on.

579
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,890
♫Love is in vogue♫

580
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,590
♫You still need to be quiet♫

Do you see it?

00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,110
♫I'll sing for you♫

00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,620

♫I believe you can do it♫

588
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,730
Yes.

589
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,970
Aren't you afraid of being seen?

590
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,280
What's wrong? Did you fall?

591
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,050
Someone is coming.

592
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:22,780
I'm leaving.

593
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:36,900
Sleep early.

594
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,800
Uncle Lu.

595
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,650
I thought you weren't coming back

596
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,889
to sleep tonight.

597
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:24,860
Where else could I go?

598
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,870
Have you gotten used to it here?

599
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,630
Do you miss home?

600
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,880
I've been here for so long.

601
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,449
Why did you only ask me tonight?

602
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,989
Aunt Gui Xiao...

603
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:55,219
Uncle.

604
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,929
What do you want to ask?

605
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,310
Go to sleep.

606
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:07,820
What has Aunt Gui Xiao

607
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,020
been doing recently?

608
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,660
I didn't have time to ask.

609
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,100
Do you know about her job?

610
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,900
Is there anything wrong with her work?

611
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,150
Is it against the rules?

612
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,750
No.

613
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,860
I just want to know.

614
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,350
Just ask Aunt Gui Xiao.

615
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,030
It's 2 a.m.

616
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,930
How do I ask?

617
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,600
Ask her tomorrow.

618
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,200
I'm not sure.

619
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,730
I think she's an investor.

620
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,110
She has money and looks for projects everywhere.

621
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,180
She told her colleagues she was investing in...

622
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,600
in educational...

623
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,290
educational...

624
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:12,890
new energy?

625
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,180
I think so.

626
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,290
Go to sleep.

627
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,370
Your hand.

628
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Get up.

629
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,970
You're going to be late.

630
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,480
Stop it.

631
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,420
I’m sleepy.

632
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,020
Lu Chen is here

633
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,620
to pick you up to go to school.

634
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:52,950
I want...

635
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,500
My flight is at twelve.

636
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,010
Let me sleep until eight.

637
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,220
Why would I lie to you?

638
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,750
Lu Chen brought breakfast.

639
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,290
Morning.

640
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,700
I bought it for you.

641
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,620
The auntie outside the school gate

642
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,820
opened her own store.

643
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,320
It tastes the same.

644
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,470
It's still hot.

645
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,400
Have you eaten?

646
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,350
I ate at the garage.

647
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,810
I didn't have time to eat on the way.

648
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,800
I'm going back to work soon.

649
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,390
There's a secret mission.

650
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,650
I won't be able to use my phone for a while.

651
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,520
The nature of my work is a bit different.

652
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,320
I become uncontactable at times

653
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,500
and cannot explain anything.

654
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,970
I'm telling you in advance

655
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,050
overthink things.

656
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:27,860
Well...

657
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,540
I'll be off now.

658
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,170
You're still here?

659
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,380
It was so busy

660
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,680
this time.

661
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,570
Let's talk properly

662
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,780
when you come back from your business trip.

663
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,440
About what?

664
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,450
Your job.

665
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,660
My job.

666
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,540
My family background.

667
00:38:59,220 --> 00:38:59,860
The situation

668
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,190
after my transfer back.

669
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,180
My salary

670
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,180
and my personal assets.

671
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,630
When we were in school,

672
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,410
I didn't tell you much about these.

673
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,470
I want to make them clear this time.

674
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,460
You're thoughtful.

675
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,070
You should make them clear.

676
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:22,830
Of course,

677
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,620
if you

678
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,650
just want to date,

679
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,320
then it's not necessary.

680
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,440
There's no need to say.

681
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,550
It's good to retain

682
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,690
a bit of the mystery.

683
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:29,530
Go to work.

684
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,140
I'm going too after I eat.

685
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,320
Okay.

686
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,870
We'll talk about it later.

687
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,710
I’m leaving.

688
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,710
Does your dad know Lu Chen is back?

689
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,590
I don’t want to tell him.

690
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:10,420
[Hongrun Chenghua]

691
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:12,780
I thought

692
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,780
you would wait for me at the airport.

693
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,420
I saw that I still had some time,

694
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,820
so I came back to attend the weekly meeting.

695
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,750
You two. Tell me

696
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,380
about your recent projects.

697
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,420
Pass me the agenda.

698
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:34,860
You go first.

699
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,990
I'll tell you one by one.

700
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,320
Okay.

701
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,220
They insist that the shareholders

702
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,620
should have veto rights.

703
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,550
I told them

704
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,800
I can't promise them something like that,

705
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,860
and that the bosses on both sides

706
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,210
need to discuss this directly.

707
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:44,980
Make an appointment

708
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,840
for a teleconference with Mr. Wu.

709
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,230
After the secretary confirms it,

710
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,430
email the other party

711
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,590
and CC Mr. Wu and me.

712
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,210
Also, they think

713
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,920
the minimum of 13% of shares

714
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,500
is too low.

715
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,160
They're requesting a directly proportionate capital increase.

716
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,350
We have been dealing with this

717
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,020
for two weeks.

718
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,300
How about this?

719
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,290
Delete the clause on the contract

720
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,570
that precludes capital increase

721
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,940
and proceed with the negotiations.

722
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,270
Okay.

723
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,200
The bottom line I'm giving you

724
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,680
is that we can add a clause for capital increase

725
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,860
into the contract,

726
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,380
but it cannot stipulate any specific requirements.

727
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:23,890
For instance, terms like

728
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,600
"directly proportionate"

729
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,400
must not appear in the contract.

730
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,050
Remember.

731
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:30,360
We can only

732
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,330
reveal our bottom line

733
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,190
after at least three rounds of negotiation.

734
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:34,520
Okay.

735
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,870
Let me teach you.

736
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,580
Every time the negotiations reach a stalemate,

737
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,350
just say,

738
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,650
"I can't make this decision.

739
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,800
Let me ask my boss."

740
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,910
Then, answer them the next day.

741
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,180
If that doesn't work, tell them,

742
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,620
"My boss is very unaccommodating.

743
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,130
She's very difficult to talk to.

744
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,970
I'll try to persuade her again."

745
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,310
Yes.

746
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,330
Blame it all on me.

747
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,350
I am here

748
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,610
to act as your shield.

749
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,420
Don't worry.

750
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,690
I won't take it to heart

751
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,220
no matter how many bad things you say about me.

752
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,440
Dad.

753
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,330
I'm at the airport.

754
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,570
My dad is here.
