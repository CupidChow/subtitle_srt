4
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,660
It's hard to be the wife of a policeman.

5
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:52,860
What?

6
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,259
Are you having cold feet?

7
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,210
You've already married me.

8
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,740
It's too late for cold feet.

9
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,690
I always keep my word.

10
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,410
Besides,

11
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,140
it's not like you're out philandering.

12
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,140
I'm willing to donate half of my husband

13
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,000
to our country.

14
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,210
It's more than half.

15
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,840
They work a crazy amount of overtime.

16
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,140
It's the truth.

17
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,700
I know it's the truth.

18
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,000
I want one more fried egg.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll have next week's share as well.

20
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,160
Do you want flatbread?

21
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,110
Yes.

22
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,829
Uncle Lu, you know how to make flatbread?

23
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:31,160
He has always known how.

24
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,680
When we were in school,

25
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,940
there was a flatbread stall at the school gate.

26
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,940
Your Aunt Gui Xiao

27
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,570
went there for breakfast everyday.

28
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,660
During the school holidays,

29
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,820
the stall didn't open.

30
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,079
She craved it so badly,

31
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,520
she forced me to learn.

32
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,829
He practiced a few times

33
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,320
and became very skilled.

34
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,060
He was even better

35
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,920
than the stall.

36
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,400
Most importantly,

37
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,910
the stall owner was too stingy to use eggs,

38
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,460
and her fried dough sticks were really thin.

39
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,580
He was generous with the ingredients.

40
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,640
He even made the chili sauce himself.

41
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,340
By the way,

42
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,450
I need to order takeout.

43
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,450
I want fried dough sticks from Yonghe.

44
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,910
I've already gotten some.

45
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,440
When?

46
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,700
I got it on my way back

47
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,829
from my morning jog.

48
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,160

54

55

Can you arrange it for me?

56
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,940
She's very opinionated.

57
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,040
I can't tell her what to do.

58
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,020
Your mom

59
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,760
won't answer my calls.

60
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,860
It's already very generous of her

Can't people make mistakes?

65
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,300
If you make a mistake,

66
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,670
shouldn't you get a chance

67
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,750
to make it right?

68
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,760
You were young

69
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,560
and didn't know about our conflicts.

70
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,060
Your mother and I

71
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,780
were both busy with work.

72
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,130

You're an adult now.

75
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,120
You should understand this feeling.

76
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,560
Since I am an adult,

00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,370
let's talk as equals.

Let me tell you

79
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,980
what I think.

80
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,570
I've never been married,

81
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,000
but I think that

82
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,890
when two people get together

83
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,630
and start a family,

84
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,680
they must accept

85
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,610
each other's strengths and flaws.

86
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,390
Be it domestic trivialities,

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,810
career setbacks,

88
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,330
or even sickness and death,

89
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,420
they must deal with these things together.

90
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,820
And the only bottom line

91
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,780
is faithfulness.

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,900
You are a businessman.

93
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,860
I'll explain it using business terms.

94
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,390
Take, for instance, a business partnership.

95
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,350
It needs you to honor the contract.

96
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,620
In a partnership,

97
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,740
you mustn't

98
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,180
breach the contract,

99
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,740
abandon your partner,

100
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,590
or dissolve the partnership

101
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,300
just because you've

102
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,340
run into some problems.

103
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,070
Where is the integrity in that?

105
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,909
Love is not the same as doing business.

106
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,960
Whether it's in love or doing business,

107
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,500
breaching a contract

108
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,390
and betraying one's partner

109
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,620
can evidence, to a certain extent,

110
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,080
that person's character.

111
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,820
I only offer suggestions

Whether my mom wants to see you

114
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,390
is her choice.

115
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,920
I won't interfere with it.

116
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,400
Bye.

117
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,280
Eat it while it's hot.

118
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,310
It still tastes the same.

119
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,960
Lu Chen’s taste.

120
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,180
You are indeed a businessperson.

121
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,310
You're so eloquent.

122
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,780
I'm sincere when I talk to you.

123
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
Was that your dad?

124
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,910
Is he home?

125
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,130
Let's go back together.

126
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,540
Why?

127
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,570
I never go to his house.

128
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,720
Shouldn't I pay him a visit

129
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,180
to discuss our marriage?

130
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,640
As a courtesy.

131
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,630
There's no need.

132
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,030
I can make my own choices.

133
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,540
I'm leaving soon and I'll be gone for a month.

134
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,670
I'm only free today.

135
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,440
Marriage is a serious matter.

136
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,290
Can't you treat it seriously?

137
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,490
How am I not?

138
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,080
This isn't the first time

139
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,770
I've talked about going home.

140
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,460
You're always evasive about this.

141
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,360
I'm not.

142
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,700
Are you marrying me or my dad?

143
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,440
Why must you see him?

145
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,159
It's my sister.

146
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,180
Answer it first.

147
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,680
Hello, Sister.

Hello?

00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,350
Where are you?

150
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,540
Are you at your workplace?

151
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,940
You're not at the garage.

152
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,850
I'm at Xiao's house.

153
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,710
Come over

154
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,300
to Meng Xiaoshan's hotel.

155
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:08,740
Okay.

156
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:09,820
Got it.

157
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,290
Go now.

158
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,430
Just now, I—

159
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,060
We can argue when you get back.

160
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,320
Attend to more important matters first.

161
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,940
Let's not quarrel in the future.

162
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,060
Who's quarreling with you?

163
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll call you when I get there.

164
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:35,980
Drive safe.

165
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,440
Don't speed no matter how urgent it is.

166
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,960
Qin Xiaonan.

167
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,140
I'm going out.

168
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,870
Okay.

169
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,670
I thought

170
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,740
you had a fight.

171
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,540
Adults don't fight.

172
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,190
If there's a conflict, we solve the problem.

173
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,680
My parents used to fight.

174
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,860
What did they fight about?

175
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
I can't remember.

176
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,880
You don't remember?

177
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,080
That's good too.

178
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,260
The human heart

179
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,350
is a very small place.

180
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,170
If it contains too many bad things,

181
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,430
good things won't fit.

182
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,060
Do you know what

183
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,790
is the most worth remembering,

184
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,650
based on my experience from

185
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,140
living 20 years more than you?

186
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,740
What is it?

187
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,900
Which things are delicious.

188
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,230
You must remember this.

189
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,660
For example,

190
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,790
the fried dough sticks here

191
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,090
are quite delicious.

192
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,820
I'll take you to eat roasted chicken gizzards later.

193
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,000
We'll sprinkle some cumin over them.

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,930
I guarantee you will get addicted.

195
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,590
Why are you unhappy?

196
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,820
Did I make things hard for you?

197
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,330
Uncle.

198
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,220
Don't do this.

199
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,740
Don't do this.

200
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,300
Step aside.

201
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,780
Uncle.

202
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,100
Let me tell you.

203
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,100
I agreed to get back together

204
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,340
for the sake of

205
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,270
our daughter and son.

206
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:23,980
What did you do?

207
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,460
I was fine that you'd gotten remarried,

208
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,520
but you made a fuss.

209
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,460
She has been with me

210
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,290
since we got divorced.

211
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,890
She didn't ask for anything.

212
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:32,960
What?

213
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,550
Can't I have a meal with her?

214
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,560
Besides,

215
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,940
I- I didn't know

216
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,050
you two were coming.

217
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,980
How many times have you promised me

218
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,500
not to contact her anymore?

219
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,220
Seriously.

220
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,860
Nonsense.

221
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,540
If I hadn't said that,

222
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,200
would you have been appeased?

223
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,030
Uncle.

224
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,420
If you're going to talk like this,

225
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,680
you'll be in the wrong.

226
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,740
You begged her to get back together with you.

227
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,060
Otherwise,

228
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,870
where would you have gotten the money to save the garage?

229
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,890
Everyone in the neighborhood knows about this.

230
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,660
Speaking of which,

231
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,540
the money you used

232
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,540
to save the garage

233
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,800
came from her remarriage.

234
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,160
Mind your own business.

235
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,380
What do you know?

236
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:01,750
No.

237
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,910
Of course I know.

238
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,800
My dad made the decision

239
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,100
and signed the guarantee.

240
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,200
You agreed to

241
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:06,940
cut off all ties with her

242
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,400
once Aunty remarried you.

243
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,660
Lu Chen.

244
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,020
I didn’t want to call you,

245
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,090
but Mother only listens to you.

246
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,150
I can't get her to leave no matter how hard I try.

247
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,160
We're afraid there'll be trouble if we stay.

248
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,760
It's okay.

249
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,120
It's family business.

250
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,150
You are so busy with work.

251
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,700
You have so much to handle every day.

252
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,100
As the family members of a policeman,

253
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,540
we shouldn't

254
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,710
saddle you down.

255
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,220
Let's talk inside.

256
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,780
What do you want to do today?

257
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,690
Are you done?

258
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,580
Are you done?

259
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,680
You...

260
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,200
Don't embarrass yourself in public.

261
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,260
Let's talk at home.

262
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,380
Kid, it's none of your business.

263
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:49,970
Listen.

264
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,940
I was eating at a hotel.

265
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,720
I was eating well

266
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,120
when your mom came in and flipped the table.

267
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,500
You can't always

268
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,420
side with her.

269
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,600
What did you do

270
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,070
to make my mom flip the table?

271
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,390
I know what she's like.

272
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,260
Let's not even talk about

273
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,260
you having dinner with that woman.

274
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,010
You can't

275
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,420
insult his uncle behind his back.

276
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,330
What uncle?

277
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,260
He's the man from your remarriage!

278
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:09,900
Kid.

279
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,630
You want to beat up your father?

280
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,370
You're a police officer.

281
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:13,820
I'm telling you,

282
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,060
I'll lodge a complaint against you at your workplace.

283
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,460
I'll get you fired.

284
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,330
Listen carefully.

285
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,490
Your mother isn't only your mother,

286
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,760
she is also my wife.

287
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,380
Don't stick your nose

288
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,440
into our business!

289
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,780
Let me tell you.

290
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,300
If I don't...

291
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:31,970
Dad, let me tell you.

292
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:32,620
Actually...

293
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,820
Who asked you?

294
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,580
Honey.

295
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:37,950
Are you okay?

296
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,320
I'm fine.

297
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,860
Dad.

298
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,660
You are my father-in-law.

299
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,030
Usually, I don't argue with you.

300
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,030
But today, you...

301
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,920
you've gone too far.

302
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,040
Stop it!

303
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,050
I'll get even with you later.

304
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,860
Stop looking.

305
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,990
Get back to work.

306
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,340
Get on with it.

307
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,060
Even though there are fewer customers at noon,

308
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,780
we mustn't neglect them.

309
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,840
Go and do your work.

310
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,370
Does it hurt?

311
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,460
Yes.

312
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,850
You're an adult. Don't act cute.

313
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,130
He used to mention it every now and then.

314
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,700
Now, he brings up my remarriage

315
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,960
all day long.

316
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,590
How can I continue

317
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,530
living with him?

318
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,020
Have you eaten?

319
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,970
No one has eaten.

320
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,430
Let's go to a private room.

321
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,680
I'll order a few dishes.

322
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,610
Let's eat first.

323
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,060
Let's go.

324
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:01,760
Mom.

325
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,590
Let's eat first.

326
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,520
Okay.

327
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,060
Brother-in-law.

328
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,060
Are you off today?

329
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,220
N- No.

330
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,540
I have to return to school

331
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,670
for a meeting later.

332
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,500
Today is Sunday,

333
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,340
but the 12th graders still have classes.

334
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,940
I'll be worried if I don't go.

335
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,290
Hurry up and eat then.

336
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,030
I won't stand on ceremony then.

337
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,250
-You’re in a hurry.
-Let’s eat.

338
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,310
Sister, let's eat.

339
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,350
Slow down.

340
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,450
You can afford to be a bit late.

341
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,250
I'm hungry.

342
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,650
You guys eat.

343
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,130
I

344
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,840
have something to say.

345
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,120
You should eat too.

346
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,770
I'll say what I have to say

347
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,890
before I eat.

348
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,660
Mom.

349
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,370
There's something

350
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,890
I must ask

351
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,920
since Sister is here today as well.

352
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,570
You had no choice but to remarry Dad

353
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,430
because you had three children.

354
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,760
Things are different now.

355
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,350
Do you

356
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,420
still want to be with Dad,

357
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,940
and if so, how?

358
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,180
Have you thought about it?

359
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,100
I know

360
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,940
you suffered a lot with me.

361
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,350
Now, you've grown up

362
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,510
and found jobs.

363
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,660
Good jobs at that.

364
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,750
I'm relieved.

365
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,080
I'm not young anymore.

366
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,610
I don't want to make a fuss.

367
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,310
I can make do.

368
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,140
You're still young.

369
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,480
If you take good care of your health

370
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,180
and live more comfortably,

371
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,300
you still have a long way to go.

372
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,340
Yes, Mom.

373
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,670
You still have a long way to go.

374
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,730
You must live well.

375
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,820
Tao.

376
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,000
Eat.

377
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,820
Didn't you say you had to go to school?

378
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,500
Yes.

379
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,560
Eat up.

380
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:18,740
Remember

381
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,140
to send me the bill later.

382
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,430
I'll pay you back.

383
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,380
It's my treat.

384
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,550
You came in time so he couldn't make a scene.

385
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,920
That saved me a lot of trouble.

386
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,020
That's a different matter.

387
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,180
Remember to send it to me.

388
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,180
Okay, Captain Lu.

389
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,180
Where is your car?

390
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,300
I didn't drive here.

391
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,370
I walked to school

392
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,770
to save some gas money.

393
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,070
Your sister called me just now

394
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,700
so I left in a hurry.

395
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,710
I ran here.

396
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,590
I'll send you to school.

397
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,250
Okay.

398
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:41,860
Go ahead.

399
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,820
The house is near here.

400
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,370
Tong and I will walk home.

401
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,420
Let's go.

402
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,650
Be careful.

403
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,740
I'm leaving.

404
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,550
OK.

405
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,260
Lu Chen.

406
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,010
Actually, your sister

407
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,650
has mentioned divorce many times.

408
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,540
I can't really talk about it.

409
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,099
I'm half an outsider after all.

410
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:27,900
Right?

411
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,750
I can understand that

412
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,490
Mom has her own concerns.

413
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,560
We can't rush something like this.

414
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:34,970
In the future, your sister and I

415
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,810
will deal with this as much as possible

416
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,470
so we don't disrupt your work.

417
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,880
I'm not afraid it'll disrupt my work.

418
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,500
Mom is old.

419
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,020
I don't want her to suffer.

420
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,650
Do you think I really want them to get another divorce?

421
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,650
Not necessarily.

422
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,790
It's just that both of them are unhappy

423
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,030
living like this.

424
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,980
Your girlfriend?

425
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,330
My fiancée.

426
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,430
She is naive about things like this.

427
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,290
She thinks nothing else is important

428
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,620
as long as she's with me.

429
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,700
There are very few girls like her now.

430
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,830
So I can't let her

431
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,160
get involved in this mess.

432
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,420
I can't bear for her

433
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,880
to suffer because of this.

434
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,540
Eat up.

435
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,390
Don't leave leftovers.

436
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,870
Okay.

437
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,160
Is this your child?

438
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,850
No.

439
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,600
My friend's.

440
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,870
He's looking at me

441
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,290
as if he were your son,

442
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,900
surveilling a homewrecker

443
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,230
on behalf of his father.

444
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,500
Glib.

445
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,350
Sit.

446
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,520
Where should I sit?

447
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,980
Just sit next to the kid.

448
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,860
My mom will be here soon.

449
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,060
You two can talk face to face.

450
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,390
Okay.

451
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,710
Let's get to know each other.

452
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,950
I'm Aunt Gui Xiao's classmate

453
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,950
from university.

454
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,340
We were in the same year, but different majors.

455
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,070
I'm Qin Lang.

456
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,320
My wife

457
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,580
is Aunt Gu Xiao's

458
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,440
best friend.

459
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,410
Are you relieved now?

460
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,950
My mom showed my dad

461
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,340
the divorce agreement that you drafted.

462
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,040
My dad wants to show it

463
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,680
to the legal department first.

464
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,410
The agreement is quite simple.

465
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,490
Your mother doesn't want anything

466
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,060
other than her freedom.

467
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,180
It's your dad

468
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,090
who's being defensive.

469
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,700
What kind of man is that?

470
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,500
My dad doesn't want a divorce.

471
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,920
The richer party doesn't want a divorce,

472
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
but the poorer party badly wants it.

473
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,990
Has your mother found you a stepfather?

474
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,480
I'll shut up.

475
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,480
Sorry, Lawyer Qin.

476
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,090
I’m late.

477
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,640
You and Lu Chen had him in secret?

478
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,340
Let me introduce you.

479
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,140
This is my mom,

480
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,670
Shen Jin.

481
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,790
Hello, Grandma.

482
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,420
You only told me about your marriage.

483
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,750
You didn't tell me about

484
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,760
such an important matter.

485
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,690
It's not a big deal.

486
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,310
I didn't give birth to him.

487
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,770
Really?

488
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,820
I was thinking

489
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,100
about how capable my daughter is.

490
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,960
Not only is her career going well,

491
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,200
she even picked up her first love

492
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,670
and had a baby with him.

493
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,870
Watch your mouth.

494
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,590
The child is still here.

495
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,020
Luckily,

496
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,970
I have a habit of carrying red packets around with me.

497
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,130
My ex-classmates

498
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,210
all have multiple grandchildren.

499
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,790
One more.

500
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:08,910
Here.

501
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,050
Take it.

502
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:11,690
Take it.

503
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,980
Say thank you.

504
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:17,630
Thank you.

505
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,590
Good boy.

506
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,440
He really isn't yours?

507
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,320
Lawyer Qin,

508
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,020
let's talk about

509
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,430
the divorce agreement.

510
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,020
Okay.

511
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,390
My phone's battery drains so fast.

512
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,170
I forgot to tell you something.

513
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,390
I'd always wanted to tell you,

514
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,820
but seeing that you'd broken up,

515
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,380
I thought

516
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,090
there was no need for me to mention it.

517
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,670
You're beating around the bush.

518
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,270
What is it?

519
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,360
Your father has met Lu Yanchen before.

520
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:00,960
When?

521
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,560
Many years ago.

522
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,980
It was when Lu Yanchen was studying at the police academy.

523
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,060
Your dad went to see him

524
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,390
during a business trip.

525
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,190
Your dad

526
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,900
graduated from the police academy too.

527
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,380
He has a lot of old friends there.

528
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,640
It wasn't hard for him to find Lu Yanchen.

529
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,700
When he met him,

530
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,140
he made him break up with you.

531
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,010
What did he say?

532
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,580
I don't know.

533
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,480
His former secretary told me.

534
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,380
According to my understanding of him,

535
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,540
he probably thought

536
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,630
Lu Yanchen wasn't good enough for you

537
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,660
because his grades weren't as good as yours

538
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,990
and his family background was more complicated than yours.

539
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:44,920
What's wrong?

540
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,450
I'm looking for the toilet.

541
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,260
The skewers were getting

542
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,060
a little cold.

543
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,500
Since you guys hadn't come back,

544
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,580
I thought to come and remind you that

545
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,220
the skewers won't taste good anymore if you don't eat them soon.

546
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,180
Okay, got it.

547
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,860
Go back first.

548
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,800
We'll be right there.

549
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,230
Okay.

550
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,840
Which friend's child is this?

551
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,980
He's so sensible.

552
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,410
I feel sorry for him.

553
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,100
He's Lu Chen's friend's son.

554
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
He's in Qining.

555
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,380
He's busy with explosive ordnance disposal work,

556
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,510
so he's never around

557
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,740
to take care of the child.

558
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,200
That's why Lu Chen brought him here to study.

559
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,700
We're talking with a lawyer about my divorce.

560
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,380
Why did you

561
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,580
bring the child here?

562
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,950
I have my reasons.

563
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,870
We are adults.

564
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,110
Let's respect each other's opinions.

565
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,350
Okay.

566
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,030
Aunt Gui Xiao,

567
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,580
I have a question.

568
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,360
You haven't talked to Uncle Lu

569
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,700
since he left.

570
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,900
Aren't you going to call him

571
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,460
and ask how things are going on his end?

572
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,320
Isn't he dealing with something?

573
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,140
I'm dealing with something too.

574
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,670
We'll call when we're done.

575
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,980
I wish my parents

576
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,320
were like you.

577
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,670
Maybe they wouldn't have gotten divorced then.

578
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,160
Aunt Gui Xiao,

579
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,650
I have another question.

580
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,490
Go ahead.

581
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,300
Why

582
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,900
are you helping

583
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,660
your mom and dad get a divorce?

584
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,410
I was waiting for you to ask this.

585
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,780
I brought you here today

586
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,780
to show you that

587
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:15,780
people get married

588
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,580
for the sake of their happiness.

589
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,000
Divorce is the same.

590
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,580
So,

591
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,230
you have to empathize with your parents.

592
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,810
Of course,

593
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,540
you might not

594
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,620
understand it now.

595
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,600
It's okay.

596
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,050
I'm just like you.

597
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,220
My parents have been separated since I was a kid.

598
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:32,950
But look.

599
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:33,980
I have always

600
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,060
been very happy.

601
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,790
My grades were good,

602
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,530
and now I have a good job.

603
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:39,720
So,

604
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,460
divorce

605
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,460
is between the adults.

606
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,320
Don't be affected by it.

607
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,250
They have their lives,

608
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,650
you have yours.

609
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:49,900
Understand?

610
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,190
What you want to eat

611
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,900
and whether you get to eat

612
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,500
whatever it is you want to eat

613
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,240
all depends on yourself.

614
00:24:59,260 --> 00:24:59,990
Understand?

615
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,680
Alright.

616
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,240
Let me ask you a question.

617
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,150
Out of all the skewers today,

618
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,450
which one did you like the most?

619
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,310
Which one was the most delicious?

620
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,130
Didn't I tell you

621
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,050
to remember what tastes the best?

622
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,760
That way,

623
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,620
you can order more next time.

624
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,080
Roasted chicken gizzards.

625
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,180
You're really my kid.

626
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,330
You're just like me.

627
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,070
Let's go.

628
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,760
Did you talk to your mom?

629
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,410
When your parents got divorced, you were all alone.

630
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,160
You must have been sad.

631
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,010
For some time, yes.

632
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,160
But I wasn't sad.

633
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,410
It was just that

634
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,140
my dad had an affair,

635
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,900
so I felt humiliated.

636
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,820
I thought he didn't deserve to be my father.

637
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,020
From a moral standpoint, I couldn't accept it.

638
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,400
Why did you forgive him later?

639
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,620
When I came back from abroad,

640
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,000
he fell sick.

641
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,180
I received a notice of critical illness,

642
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,040
so I went there.

643
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,080
He asked me to write his will

644
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,540
together with his lawyer.

645
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,300
It wasn't about the money.

646
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,580
Maybe I was moved

647
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,540
by this gesture.

648
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,210
But that's my business.

649
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,190
My mom's decision has nothing to do with this.

650
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,150
I don't want to drink anymore.

651
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,710
My parents separated

652
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,740
after I graduated from high school.

653
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,940
It didn't affect

654
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,920
my growth.

655
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,080
Duan Rou is pitiful.

656
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,700
She has never really met

657
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,450
her parents.

658
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,260
I have to go on a long-term mission

659
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,590
from tomorrow onwards.

660
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,440
When I come back,

661
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,380
I'll go home with you.

662
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,760
Stand still.

663
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,740
Attention!

664
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,190
Answer me seriously.

665
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,920
Why don’t you want me to go home with you?

666
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,190
I've performed a meritorious service of the second-class,

667
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,590
my character is upright,

668
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,370
and I am reasonably good-looking.

669
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,340
Not only that.

670
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,360
You're a homme fatale.

671
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,620
Answer me seriously.

672
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:42,740
Why?

673
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,470
I don't want you to get bullied.

674
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,190
I don't care if it's me,

675
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,070
but I don't want to see you get bullied.

676
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,000
I can't stand it.

677
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,770
Not even a little.

678
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,560
No one is allowed to bully you.

679
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:03,980
From now on,

680
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,080
only I am allowed to bully you.

681
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,540
If someone else bullies you,

682
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,510
I'll fight them.

683
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,120
I'm not coaxing you.

684
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,060
It's the truth.

685
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,070
I'm sorry.

686
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,380
What did you do

687
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,410
to me?

688
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,830
Back in school, I promised you that

689
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,010
no matter what,

690
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,970
we wouldn't break up.

691
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,110
But we still did.

692
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:46,610
I'm sorry.

693
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,780
You're so tight-lipped.

694
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,090
Getting you to talk

695
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,950
is harder than flying to the moon.

696
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,230
Congratulations.

697
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,250
You've landed on the moon.

698
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,540
Squirrel mandarin fish,

699
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,420
kung pao chicken,

700
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,260
pork and vermicelli stew.

701
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,120
I want them all!

702
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,750
I'm leaving.

703
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,350
Is it dangerous?

704
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,310
No.

705
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,830
I'm going to be teaching.

706
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,190
Are there any new female officers?

707
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,150
Half and half.

708
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,020
I forgot to buy you a ring.

709
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,450
You should wear a ring to ward off admirers.

710
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,120
You know what you should do.

711
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,150
Losing me,

712
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,260
a rich, pretty,

713
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,500
generous, sensible,

714
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,360
and faithful wife

715
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,730
would be debilitating to you,

716
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,650
not me.

717
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,200
Go to sleep.

718
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,400
Coming.

719
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,230
Captain Lu.

720
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,070
Long time no see.

721
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,490
You are still so handsome.

722
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,270
Captain Lu.

723
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:49,930
Captain Lu.

724
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,180
Look at this.

725
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,360
You still have ten minutes.

726
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,290
Memorize it now.

727
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,220
The higher-ups said

728
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,230
you must set an example for the new trainees

729
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,380
and memorize this.

730
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,210
Because of the report,

731
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:05,740
I didn't have time to speak with you

732
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,340
before I returned to Qining.

733
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,480
What do you think?

734
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,760
How is this batch of

735
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,980
new officers?

736
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,920
Not bad.

737
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,690
They haven't made a mess yet.

738
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,010
This batch comprises

739
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:16,940
newly graduated top students

740
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,540
from the various police academies.

741
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,180
Aren't all of our recruits

742
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,220
top students?

743
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,380
Just like you all.

744
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,780
There's no need to be modest.

745
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,540
Back then,

746
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,780
I was always the top student of my class.

747
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,820
Excuse me.

748
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,300
Here is someone

749
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,100
who was always first in his year.

750
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,560
We were in the same batch.

751
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,030
He was always the student representative.

752
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,240
He was so annoying.

753
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:35,880
Stop it.

754
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:36,750
Take a look.

755
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,960
We need to maintain our image.

756
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,390
Right,

757
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,330
Heroes?

758
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,310
Everyone.

759
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,000
The six of us

760
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,640
will be your instructors this semester.

761
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,200
My surname is Lu.

762
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,050
My name is on

763
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,570
your class schedule.

764
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,520
Today

765
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,840
is our first meeting.

766
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,010
I believe

767
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,440
you will get to know me better

768
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,110
in the days to come.

769
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:25,960
Next,

770
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,000
I have something long-winded to say.

771
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,030
These rules and regulations

772
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,430
are written in black and white.

773
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,060
However,

774
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,790
I must memorize every word.

775
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,260
Otherwise,

776
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,150
the six of us

777
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,760
will have our salaries deducted.

778
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,870
This isn't the police academy anymore.

779
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,490
Listen up.

780
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,660
Remember it.

781
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,610
Memorize it.

782
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,220
Firstly,

783
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,440
attire.

784
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,540
You must wear your uniform

785
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,730
during training.

786
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,760
Your uniform must form a set.

787
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,780
You are not allowed to mix uniform components

788
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,180
from different seasons.

789
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,670
You must wear

790
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,980
formal leather shoes while attending class.

791
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,640
The color of the leather shoes

792
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,260
must be black or brown.

793
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,150
The heels of male recruits

794
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,760
should not exceed 3 cm.

795
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,530
The heels of female recruits

796
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,910
should not exceed 4 cm.

797
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,090
You are not allowed to wear

798
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,430
white or colorful socks.

799
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,940
No cloth shoes,

800
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,630
slippers,

801
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,890
or bare feet are allowed.

802
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,290
Keep the surfaces of your shoes shiny.

803
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,570
As for the uniform,

804
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,460
we will allow you to

805
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,900
change clothes during season changes.

806
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,290
Your attire must be coordinated

807
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,750
when taking part in collective activities.

808
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,530
Next are

809
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,480
some small rules.

810
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,350
No eating

811
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,070
while you're walking.

812
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,970
No smoking in public

813
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,429
or smoking-prohibited areas.

814
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,080
You are not allowed

815
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,580
to exhibit the following behaviors

816
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,210
while wearing your uniform:

817
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,639
linking arms,

818
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,460
hugging each other's waists,

819
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,580
placing your arms on each other's shoulders,

820
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,320
putting your hands in your pockets,

821
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,989
covering your hands with your sleeves,

822
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:28,120
holding your hands behind your backs,

823
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,120
sitting on the ground,

824
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,730
horsing around,

825
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,850
and shouting.

826
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,489
Have I made myself clear?

827
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:38,370
Yes!

828
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,080
Do you have any questions?

829
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,590
Sir.

830
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,139
Speak!

831
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,690
Instructor,

832
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,820
how long did you take

833
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,100
to memorize all that?

834
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,080
Ten minutes.

835
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,440
We will begin lining up.

836
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:56,960
At ease!

837
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,480
Attention!

838
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:04,920
Come on.

839
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
Have some fruits.

840
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,250
So many?

841
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,590
It's from the security guard.

842
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,940
Lu Chen taught him how to repair a car.

843
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,540
It’s a gift of appreciation.

844
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,940
Lu Chen

845
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,450
is kind.

846
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,660
Kind people do things

847
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,500
and don't want anything in return.

848
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,320
Of course.

849
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,880
To ascertain someone's character,

850
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,590
you must look at

851
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,790
their attitude towards service staff.

852
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:30,800
In this regard,

853
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,740
he has never disappointed me.

854
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,320
By the way,

855
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,300
for the next few days,

856
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,030
take care of Qin Xiaonan for me.

857
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,100
I don't know why,

858
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,300
but I don't feel well.

859
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,030
I'm afraid he'll get sick.

860
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,130
No problem.

861
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,950
I'll pick him up after school.

862
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:57,980
Is there something wrong

863
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,330
with the explosives you made?

864
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,590
No one can defuse them.

865
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,750
Some of them cannot be defused at all.

866
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,760
They are sure to detonate on time.

867
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,960
How cruel you are!

868
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,000
It depends on

869
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,720
the calibre of this batch of trainees,

870
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,590
as well as their level of familiarity

871
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,520
with circuitry.

872
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,450
Is the amount of gunpowder dangerous?

873
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,640
I replaced the detonator with a buzzer.

874
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,960
And there is only

875
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,240
a matchstick head's worth of gunpowder.

876
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,540
That's okay.

877
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,100
Five people to a group.

878
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,140
Two will be assigned real bombs.

879
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,870
Next team. Attention.

880
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,260
Turn right.

881
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,430
March.

882
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,140
Look.

883
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,540
Aren't they serious now?

884
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,660
If they're not afraid,

885
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,320
they won’t take it seriously.

886
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,240
Captain Lu.

887
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,300
Look.

888
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,570
Only the first team,

889
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,120
which didn't know anything,

890
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,480
performed passably.

891
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,410
The other teams

892
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,550
were obviously under too much pressure.

893
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,630
Some of them didn't dare to engage.

894
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,850
[Training Evaluation for Explosive Ordnance Disposal]

895
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,300
They all got zero points.

896
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,900
The grades of the new female officers are good.

897
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,760
The girls from this batch

898
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,070
are all quite brave.

899
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,290
Publicize the results this time.

900
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:39,890
Next time,

901
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,150
register them.

902
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,230
Tell them

903
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,300
we go by an elimination system.

904
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,870
Those whose scores don't meet the standard

905
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,030
will start again from the beginning.

906
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,510
Okay.

907
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,530
I've heard from my boss that

908
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,770
you are good at making bombs.

909
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:54,860
Today,

910
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,100
I've gotten a taste of it.

911
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,900
The new students with good grades

912
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,620
are all asking

913
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,120
who made the explosives.

914
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,630
They admire you so much.

915
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,670
It took practice.

916
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,570
When I first went to Qining,

917
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,220
I couldn't recognize the explosives.

918
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,620
I got scolded by the previous captain a lot.

919
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,310
Instructor Lu.

920
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,170
Instructor Lu.

921
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,960
What are you reading?

922
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,660
Could we use it as reference?

923
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,970
This is an introduction of the latest explosives.

924
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,900
It's in Russian.

925
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,240
I need to read it

926
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,260
before I can translate it for you.

927
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,910
You know Russian?

928
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,580
When I studied in Qining,

929
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,650
I learned

930
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,890
Mongolian, Japanese, and Russian.

931
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,060
I can

932
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,340
hold a basic conversation

933
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,400
and read technical texts.

934
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,140
Instructor Lu.

935
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,340
Instructor Xu told me

936
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,430
you made the bomb

937
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,340
that we used during training

938
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,740
that day.

939
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,290
Instructor Xu also told me

940
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,280
you are a genius at both

941
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,030
bomb disposal and explosives.

942
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,320
It's not just me.

943
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,140
Many people who work in bomb disposal

944
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,760
are also masters of explosives.

945
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,770
You'll know

946
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,560
when you get to the front line.

947
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,550
153339.

948
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:03,900
Here.

949
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,340
153299.

950
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:05,890
Here.

951
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,780
Next time,

952
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,810
if you ask a question that's already been covered in class,

953
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,070
you'll get demerit points.

954
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,060
Any more questions?

955
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,590
-No.
-No.

956
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,550
The interviewees are here.

957
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,690
Let's go together.

958
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:30,770
I didn't talk

959
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,010
about recruiting interns,

960
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,660
but HR has already arranged it.

961
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,390
I took a look.

962
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,370
They are all either the children of people in our business

963
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:36,940
or

964
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,650
the children of the bosses of various large enterprises.

965
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,920
If they make a mistake,

966
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,040
do we scold them or not?

967
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,170
How do we scold them?

968
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,130
Just do it.

969
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,100
Don't hold back.

970
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,520
It's for their own good.

971
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
They will understand in the future.

972
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,380
Hello.

973
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,400
Let's go

974
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,660
one by one.

975
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,780
The first interviewee can stay.

976
00:39:58,850 --> 00:39:59,420
As for the rest,

977
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,240
wait in the courtyard.

978
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,240
You, make them some tea.

979
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:03,570
Okay.

980
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,710
Please follow me.

981
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,800
I've read your resume

982
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,060
and your report card.

983
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,730
I've also read

984
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,860
all your certificates.

985
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,780
I've gotten

986
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,130
a basic understanding.

987
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,190
During your first interview,

988
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,520
our HR director has already

989
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,150
asked all the necessary questions.

990
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,410
You were highly rated.

991
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,610
We're meeting with you today

992
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:32,940
to learn more about you.

993
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,130
What do you like?

994
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,000
When you're resting,

995
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,770
what do you like to play with?

996
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,060
Do you like the outdoors

997
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,360
or staying at home?

998
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,780
Say whatever comes to mind.

999
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,380
At my last job,

1000
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,560
I worked overtime everyday.

1001
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,770
When I'm on leave,

1002
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,030
I prefer

1003
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,600
watching dramas at home.

1004
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,490
In terms of exercise...

1005
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,180
I don't exercise much.

1006
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,340
Relax.

1007
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,640
We're just chatting.

1008
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,770
You can talk freely.

1009
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,600
The more relaxed you are,

1010
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,790
the more we can get to know the real you.

1011
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,580
You were an auditor

1012
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,280
at your previous workplace.

1013
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,430
Have you ever counted pigs?

1014
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,370
One of my classmates

1015
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,300
became an auditor after graduation.

1016
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:27,810
They went to the ranch

1017
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,410
of a publicly listed company

1018
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,590
specially to count pigs.

1019
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,490
They had to count them one by one.

1020
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,220
They complained about it everyday.

1021
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:33,900
Yes.

1022
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,130
It's in the name of transparency.

1023
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,390
Your classmate's complaints

1024
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,590
were all true.

1025
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,200
I've counted pigs as well.

1026
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,070
Pigs

1027
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,080
are not like cows.

1028
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,870
Cows are big

1029
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,750
and they don't run around.

1030
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,010
They're easy to count.

1031
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,020
That week,

1032
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,890
I counted till I wanted to cry.

1033
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,220
They kept running around while I counted.

1034
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,480
I counted for nothing.

1035
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,900
We have a saying.

1036
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,450
Anything can be counted,

1037
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,390
but the weirdest one is pigs.

1038
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,650
When you get there,

1039
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,760
you must learn to distinguish

1040
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,090
between boars and sows.

1041
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:00,730
They're considered

1042
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:01,970
different assets.

1043
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,660
Oh my god.

1044
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,490
I went there in summer.

1045
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,820
I almost fainted

1046
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,690
from the smell in the pigsty.

1047
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,540
What is the interviewer inside

1048
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,560
like?

1049
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,650
Can you tell us?

1050
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,950
She's quite casual.

1051
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,420
You all passed

1052
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,540
the first and second rounds of interviews.

1053
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,220
She's mostly concerned with

1054
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,990
whether your personalities are compatible with our team.

1055
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,030
My boss said

1056
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,730
interviews depend on fate.

1057
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,320
Everyone who gets shortlisted is talented.

1058
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,220
The only things left to check are

1059
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,100
your values, your way of handling things,

1060
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:35,800
and your bottom line.
