00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,690
Captain Lu.

194
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,520
We saw your ex-girlfriend.

195
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,140
At first, we didn't believe

196
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,110
what Xiaonan told us.

197
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,590
Captain Lu, your subconscious action

198
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,590
has betrayed you.

199
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,630
Get things done!

200
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,510
Captain Lu.

201
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,090
Is your ex-girlfriend married?

202
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,880
I'm just caring about her.

203
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Even if you broke up,

204
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,860
you could still be friends, right?

205
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,420
Yes.

206
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,580
I even went to

207
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,460
my first love's wedding

208
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,060
with the biggest red packet.

209
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,640
Don't tell us

210
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,650
she came to Qining

211
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,710
for her honeymoon.

212
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,650
That's sad.

213
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,590
The one who can subdue Captain Lu

214
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,850
married someone else.

215
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,940
What a pity.

216
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,110
Are you done?

217
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,740
Captain Lu. Please arrange for us to meet her.

218
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,270
We rarely gather together.

219
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,360
We broke up long ago.

220
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,650
How are you supposed to meet her?

221
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,220
Captain Lu, you don't understand.

222
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,880
First love is always the best.

223
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:15,770
At least,

224
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,350
it's different from others.

225
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,020
Anyway, we suggest you

226
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,910
take the privilege as a host to entertain her,

227
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,220
right?

228
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,950
Yeah, you are the host.

229
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,620
Yes, Captain Lu.

230
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,500
We need to show them

231
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,580
our enthusiasm.

232
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,160
[Ma's Fine-quality Beef and Mutton]

233
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,930
The whole thing.

234
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,260
Do you want the sheep...

235
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,190
-Does this...
-we just bought yesterday?

236
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,350
show my sincerity?

237
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,490
Of course.

238
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,060
I want two.

239
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,240
Unfortunately, only one is left.

240
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,500
I'm giving it to you

241
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,530
because you want to thank your savior.

242
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,640
Okay, thank you.

243
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,290
No problem.

244
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,100
Finally, he replied.

245
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,540
I thought

246
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,670
it was a fake number.

247
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,860
There was no reply from that day.

248
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,060
I texted him three days ago,

249
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,460
but he just replied today.

250
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:46,990
Who is it?

251
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,460
Captain Qin.

252
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,350
I asked for his phone number

253
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,680
during dinner that day.

254
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,330
Boss, hurry up.

255
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,740
Today,

256
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,030
they are all having a farewell dinner

257
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,900
nearby.

258
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,440
Let's go over there.

259
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,000
Why should we go

260
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,340
to their gathering?

261
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,180
Do you think I'm so inconsiderate?

262
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,760
Captain Lu asked you to go.

263
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,920
He wants to meet you.

264
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,180
I'm doing this

265
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,220
to repay Captain Lu's kindness.

266
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,570
I have to complete the task.

267
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,430
I can give him the gift in passing.

268
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,680
He asked me to go?

269
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,000
Impossible.

270
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,270
Look.

271
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,380
Captain Lu wants to meet Miss Gui Xiao.

272
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,910
Please invite her over.

273
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,470
I'll treat her to a meal.

274
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,050
I'm not going, really.

275
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,180
Hello.

276
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,690
Aunt Gui Xiao.

277
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,050
My dad and Uncle Lu are drunk.

278
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,250
Please come over quickly.

279
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,310
Everyone has left.

280
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,150
I can't handle them myself.

281
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,470
There are so many people.

282
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:49,910
They can't really

283
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,940
leave them alone.

284
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,780
When I was your age,

285
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,690
I stopped telling such lies.

286
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,380
Is she coming?

287
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,270
Try what I just taught you.

288
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,420
Aunt Gui Xiao.

289
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,460
Are you Uncle Lu's first love?

290
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,310
Uncle Lu is drunk.

291
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,690
Poor him.

292
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,560
His eyes are red.

293
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,620
And he is talking about your past

294
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,060
with my dad.

295
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,060
You...

296
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,160
Keep an eye on them.

297
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,230
It's late, so I won't go over there.

298
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,470
It's not dark yet.

299
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,050
Gui Xiao.

300
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,470
Ask him for an address.

301
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,860
You're such a little smart cookie.

302
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,260
How did you persuade him?

303
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,250
It's just teamwork.

304
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,369
Aunt Cai,

305
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,780
I'll leave the rest to you.

306
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:10,670
Leave it to me!

307
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,380
I'd love to

308
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,630
do matchmaking for my savior.

309
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,160
Send me the address. Hurry.

310
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,020
Boss, hurry up.

311
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,349
Okay.

312
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,470
Here, scan here will do.

313
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,359
It's paid.

314
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:24,980

Captain Lu.

Apologize.

366
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,760
Well...

367
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,420
I'm sorry, Miss Gui Xiao.

Just now,

369
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,550
I pretended to be Captain Lu.

370
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,830
I always like to

371
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,320
imitate people's voices.

372
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,060
I'm just kidding.

373
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,830
For the sake of his mission,

374
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,560
he has been

375
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,860
learning voice imitation for years.

376
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,210
It does sound similar.

377
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,480
How could you make such a joke?

378
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,540
Gui Xiao, I'm sorry.

379
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,670
It's okay.

380
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,750
You imitated it

381
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,080
quite well.

382
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,710
Miss Gui Xiao.

383
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,040
On behalf of my second hometown,

384
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,810
Qining,

385
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,380
on behalf of our brigade, I welcome you.

386
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,520
You will definitely fall in love with Qining.

387
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Just like you do with your hometown.

388
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,120
This is Captain Lu's favorite place.

389
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,800
By the way,

390
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,740
the mutton here is delicious.

391
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,600
Captain Lu is unoccupied now.

392
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,510
Captain Lu, remember to

393
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,050
take them there to eat.

394
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,700
You guys continue.

395
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,930
I'll leave you alone.

396
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,430
They are used to fooling around

397
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,000
without having a sense of propriety.

398
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,640
Have a seat.

399
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,260
Shouldn't you apologize first?

400
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:32,960
Captain Lu.

401
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,870
Please excuse me.

402
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,550
I was rude just now.

403
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,740
I just heard on the phone that

404
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,060
no one could handle you when you were drunk,

405
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,140
and you were talking nonsense

406
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,280
about our past.

407
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,660
Then I heard you call my name.

408
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,730
So I came because I was afraid something would happen.

409
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,530
Since it's a misunderstanding,

410
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,600
I'm leaving now.

411
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,720
Have a seat.

412
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,790
I'll send you back later.

413
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,410
I've been here for days.

414
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,270
You don't have to see me off.

415
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,300
Anyway,

416
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,750
there will be no next time.

417
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,870
Lu Chen, if you dare to hang up on me,

418
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,370
there will be no next time.

419
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,340
You'll never see me again.

420
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,650
So soon?

421
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,040
It hasn't been 10 minutes yet since I entered the house.

422
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,020
My head hurts.

423
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,580
I don't feel well.

424
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,820
Let me see you off.

425
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,780
I've known her for years.

426
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,110
She is really angry now.

427
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,140
Don't worry.

428
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,360
I'll talk to her later.

429
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:57,960
Thank you.

430
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,340
Do you want to drive?

431
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,220
See you, Captain Qin.

432
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,900
Bye.

433
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,750
Let's go.

434
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,600
I'm not defending Captain Lu.

435
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,850
You may not know something.

436
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,580
Qin Mingyu told me

437
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,860
their former captain had perished in the line of duty

438
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,300
last week.

439
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,980
He said the captain had guided

440
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,040
and supported Captain Lu all the way.

441
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,480
But, he died right in front of Captain Lu.

442
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,560
Captain Lu resigned because he blamed himself.

443
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,240
Lu, try to comfort her.

444
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,380
Uncle Lu.

445
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,470
Isn't he cold?

446
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,810
Anything else, Captain Lu?

447
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,790
Do me a favor.

448
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,670
Cai.

449
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,720
Captain Lu.

450
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,970
Please go ahead.

451
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,040
I really need your help.

452
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,340
I want that kid

453
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,470
to study in Beijing.

454
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,690
Can you

455
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,840
find me a prestigious school?

456
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,360
You want to go to Beijing

457
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,310
with that kid?

458
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,510
Gui Xiao.

459
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,780
If it's simply a transfer to another school,

460
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,440
you don't need to ask for help.

461
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,830
You've been in Beijing longer than me.

462
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,490
You're more familiar than me.

463
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,570
Do me a favor.

464
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,300
Gui Xiao.

465
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,580
Think of it as helping me.

466
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,990
This is on my account.

467
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,350
I'm not a kid anymore

468
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,590
to lose my temper.

469
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,830
He apologized.

470
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,200
There's no point in unforgiving.

471
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,060
I'll go back to Beijing the day after tomorrow.

472
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,260
But this is not

473
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,520
as simple as you think.

474
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,420
We need to work out the details.

475
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,620
Take the kid to Beijing

476
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,750
as soon as possible.

477
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,060
It'd be better to get it done during the winter vacation.

478
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,260
Don't delay his class.

479
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,590
Let's discuss this now.

480
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,360
Now?

481
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,300
Do it now.

482
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,780
You've helped me

483
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,820
a lot.

484
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,830
As his father,

485
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,180
I should show my gratitude.

486
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,100
Come in and have a bite.

487
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,400
We won't let Captain Lu drink tonight.

488
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,660
Let him drive you home.

489
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,620
That's right.

490
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,700
I haven't eaten anything yet.

491
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Captain Qin, is there any food inside?

492
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,940
Anything you want.

493
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,470
Help yourself. It's my treat.

494
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,070
No need.

495
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,580
Gui Xiao.

496
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,110
I really didn't know

497
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,380
you were called here.

498
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,340
Forget it.

499
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,950
You know

500
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,320
I buy the apologies.

501
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,430
I'll be fine if you say sorry.

502
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,030
I'm sorry.

00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,140
It's very similar.

571
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,420
The transfer only requires a regular procedure.

572
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,460
♫The past has not been left unattended♫

573
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,840
It doesn't matter who handles it.

574
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,590
But it can be a hassle

575
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,980
♫With ink as a sail♫

576
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,700

♫Tossing and turning between my fingers♫

578
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,910
and go through the process.

579
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,780
It may take a long time.

580
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,610
♫The distance between us is far away♫

581
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,100
So I suggest you

582
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,860
find a private school

583
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,120
♫Even if we don't meet each other♫

584
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,880

♫My longing can overwhelm a thousand mountains♫

586
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,410
After the household registration is done, then transfer him to a public school.

♫It's like it was yesterday♫

588
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,440
Got it.

589
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,240
You can't go back yet, right?

590
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,980
♫Where can we see the full moon?♫

591
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,200
How are you going to find a school for him?

592
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,260
I'll take care of it.

593
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,530
How about this?

594
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,500
I'll recommend the school to you.

595
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,520
I have friends

596
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,230
whose children are in school.

597
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,140
They are familiar with the school.

598
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,770
I'll go through the transfer procedures

599
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,900

601
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,350
After all, I've done it before

602
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,520
and I'm familiar with the process.

603
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,060
♫I saw you off with a song♫

Do you two

639
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,260
want me to go back and persuade her?

640
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,950
Are they really first love?

641
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,260
Kind of.

642
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,510
Did Captain Lu tell you?

643
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,020
My son figured it out.

644
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,580
When he first came to Qining,

645
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,980
he lived with Lu Yanchen.

646
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,100
There's a sketch

647
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,680
in Captain Lu's drawer.

648
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,800
A sketch of Gui Xiao?

649
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,560
He didn't even tell me.

650
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,620
A few days ago, he spilled it out.

651
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,410
But Captain Lu's

652
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,600
sketching skill

653
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,840
is top-notch.

654
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,950
It's almost the same as the photo.

655
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,330
Many brothers are drunk.

656
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,100
I have to watch over them.

657
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,660

♫You're so beautiful♫

676

Have you ever seen me drunk?

677
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,660
I've never seen that.

♫And you're exceedingly adorable♫

679
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,690
But the word "sense of propriety"

680
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,070
is really custom-made for you.

681
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,770
♫Oh, Cinderella♫

You were not here when I first came.

684
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,050
I was so hungry that

685
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,080
I swallowed snake gall and drank goat blood.

686
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,699
I traveled through the deep forest

687
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,880
with a load of 40 kilograms

688
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,170
♫Maybe you didn't♫

689
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,739
and never collapsed.

690
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,040
♫Think my heart would hurt♫

691
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,810

♫If this is a dream♫

693
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,699
I thought of her.

694

♫I'd like to stay drunk and not wake up♫

695
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,580
In a half-man tall field,

696
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,739
I stayed there alone,

697
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,610
drinking all night

698
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,380
until I blacked out.

699
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,310
♫I used to hold back♫

Commissioner Du.

705
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,850
Grandpa Du.

706
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,760
So lively.

707
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,530
I'm just passing by. Go on.

708
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,719
Do what you should.

709
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,900
I heard that Captain Lu

710
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,750
had prepared good wine and dishes.

711
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,780
My wife

712
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,020
doesn't care about my dinner.

713
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,540
She asked me to scrounge a free meal.

714
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,070
So she doesn't have to cook.

715
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,410
Sir,

716
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,900
you're wrong.

717
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,560
He bought the wine.

718
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,990
But I cooked the dishes.

719
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,740
I see.

720
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,730
That's not right.

721
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,610
What's wrong?

722
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,050
This is my restaurant.

723
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,450
What I say is always true.

724
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,590
It's rare for them to gather here.

725
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,650
It's just a dinner.

726
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:25,840
Have a seat.

727
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,600
I'll cook some new dishes.

728
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:28,980
No need.

729
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,430
Give me some peanuts

730
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,230
and two pieces of mutton will do.

731
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
Please, I insist.

732
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,180
Just wait.

733
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:34,970
Okay.

734
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,270
Mingyu.

735
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,510
I heard that you are transferring your kid to another school.

736
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,000
I just talked

737
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,310
with Captain Lu's ex.

738
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,300
She is nice.

739
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,650
She didn't mind anything

740
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,710
and agreed to do it.

741
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,190
Ex-girlfriend?

742
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,840
During college

743
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,970
or later?

744
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,350
During college.

745
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,420
I've only been with her. No one else.

746
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,020
Can you handle it?

747
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,270
I'll help contact others if you can't.

748
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,430
I noticed that

749
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,820
you really care about them.

750
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,660
Of course.

751
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,820
We northeasterners are grateful.

752
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,350
Let's go to bed. You're leaving tomorrow.

753
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,120
♫You must have secretly collected♫

754
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,550
♫So much wind and frost♫

755
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:55,420
♫Waiting to meet someone♫

756
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,770
♫Who can know how to taste♫

757
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:04,830
♫On a night with wine and wind♫

758
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,640
♫Half a moon♫

759
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,700
♫The moon♫

760
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:18,000
♫You must have wiped it silently♫

761
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,310
♫For a long time♫

762
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,780
♫Knowing that life is silent♫

763
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,650
♫Only have the light when it's like a mystery♫

764
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,980
♫On a night when no one knows♫

765
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,480
It's windy here.

766
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,620
♫The breeze goes everywhere♫

767
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,780
♫The breeze♫

768
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,380
♫You must have been there in secret♫

769
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,950
♫To the farthest places♫

770
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,150
♫Bringing back the green plants of summer♫

771
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,390
♫And the fallen leaves of autumn♫

772
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:05,470
♫On a night when you're dating in the garden♫

773
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,180
[Home]

774
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:12,730
♫The pathos of youth is sung♫

775
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,540
Hello?

776
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,260
Mom, it's me.

777
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,680
You call at this hour.

778
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,730
Your dad will be upset.

779
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,550
I have something to discuss with you.

780
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,180
Go ahead.

781
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,730
I can only go back to Beijing after the Chinese New Year.

782
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,820
My friend's child

783
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,700
wants to live in Beijing.

784
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,870
I'll send him back.

785
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,220
Please take care of him for a few days.

786
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,220
A kid?

787
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,700
You know

788
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,770
your dad's temper.

789
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,490
I think we should forget it.

790
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,460
Besides,

791
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,260
children are important

792
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,190
in general families,

793
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,470
like their lifeblood.

794
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,770
Don't simply take care of others' children.

795
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,280
If anything happens,

796
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,220
you can't pass the blame.

797
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,940
Your dad is awake.

798
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,220
I'm hanging up.

799
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,140
See how smart I am.

800
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,730
I named you ZZZ

801
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,860
so that you would be the last one in the phone book.

802
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,920
No one can find you.

803
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,710
Neither can my parents.

804
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:13,980
Are you still up?

805
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,790
Pack up for Qin Xiaonan.

806
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,820
I'll take him back to Beijing first.

807
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,490
The flight is at 4:20 pm

808
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,820
the day after tomorrow.

809
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,970
I'll buy him a ticket later.

810
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,100
Remember to take him to the airport

811
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,100
before 3 o'clock.

812
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,780
Don't miss the flight.

813
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,230
Gui Xiao.

814
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,080
It's late at night.

815
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,650
Aren't you afraid of catching a cold after the shower?

816
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,780
I wasn't showering.

817
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,250
I wanted to wash my face with hot water,

818
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:00,950
but the water

819
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,270
didn't warm up.

820
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:15,700
Bye.

821
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,630
Pack up your son's luggage tomorrow.

822
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,710
Gui Xiao is taking Xiaonan to Beijing

823
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,040
the day after tomorrow.

824
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,400
She's probably afraid that

825
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,720
it would be too late

826
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,450
for us to take him there.

827
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,090
Your first love is really nice.

828
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,270
I've asked already.

829
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,720
She's not married yet.

830
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,870
But she helped me

831
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,470
so much with this matter.

832
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,820
It seems that she still likes you.

833
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,820
Seize the chance.

834
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:26,950
We're not

835
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,150
in our teens anymore.

836
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,520
Once we're together,

837
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,730
what can I provide her with?
