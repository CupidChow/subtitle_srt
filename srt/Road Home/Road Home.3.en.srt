Isn't the flight tomorrow?

called him yesterday.

14

Hello, Aunt Gui Xiao.

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,190
Are you here alone?

16
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,579
Uncle Lu is downstairs.

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,680
Last night, Aunt Cai said

18
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,970
she would take the train

19
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,490
to go abroad for business today.

20
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,020
My dad said he was off today.

21
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,360
So he could send Aunt Cai off.

22
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,410
Yes, I did mention it.

I didn't sleep.

When we are on duty,

33
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,970
it's normal to not sleep for a few days.

34
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,470
I'm used to it already.

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,570
It's not easy for the country to train you guys.

36
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,650
You should take care of your health.

37

he makes the bed up there

107

110
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,520
In our profession,

111
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,860
once there is a mission,

112
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,230
our working hours will be uncertain.

113
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,060
If the kid stays in the dorm,

114
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,270
first, his rest will be disturbed.

115
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,080
Second, seeing his dad often goes out,

116
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
he'll be worried.

117
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,180
Kids nowadays are smart.

118
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,740
He knows his dad's profession.

119
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,250
He'll be worried anyway.

120
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,770
Besides,

121
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,480
there're numerous movies about explosive ordnance disposal nowadays.

122
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,090
Doesn't he

123
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,950
ask you guys after watching them?

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,460
Usually, we would say that

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,850
the movie scenes are all made-up.

126
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,250
It's not that dangerous.

127
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,500
So it's all true.

128
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,870
It's dangerous, isn't it?

129
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,200
Can't you even tell your friends?

130
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,890
Every profession has its difficulty.

131
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,220
There's nothing to say.

132
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,669
Is this all?

133
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,510
Doesn't his father

134
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,059
buy him clothes?

135
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,289
Also, why didn't

136
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:43,929
he rent

137
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,190
a more spacious house?

138
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,370
Isn't it too small

139
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,730
for them to live here?

140
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,630
Are they your parents?

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,030
It's Uncle Lu and...

144
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,140
Why can't I understand

145
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,450
what you said?

146
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,280
Captain Lu is here.

147
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,680
I have to say hello to him.

148
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,940
They're developing feelings for each other.

149
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,930
Are they helping you pack

150
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,740
and move?

151
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,450
Thank you

152
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,120
for taking care of me all this time.

153
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,520
Why did you close the door?

154
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,380
The kid outside will get it wrong.

155
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,690
We can talk conveniently if the door is closed.

156
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,750
His parents are divorced.

157
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,490
Qin Mingyu got his son.

158
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,720
But deep down,

159
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,250
he felt that he had dragged on Xiaonan's mother,

160
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,780
so he paid her a lot of money.

161
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,170
I see.

162
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,640
Now he has to take care of his parents

163
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
and raise his son.

164
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,710
So he doesn't dare to spend money freely.

165
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,060
I've done packing the clothes.

166
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,530
I'll leave the books for you to pack since you're more familiar with them.

167
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,530
I'll go out first.

My dad said that

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,890
he was not coming back for dinner tonight.

177
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,350

It's okay.

180
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,210
I'll go out first.

181
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,410
Otherwise, the kid will misunderstand.

182
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:52,870
Get out.

183
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,150
This is even more misunderstanding.

184
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,320
Remember to take

185
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,400
Qin Xiaonan's household registration permit

186
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,730
for boarding purposes.

187

I need to talk to your aunt.

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,240
has been with his mother.

193
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,330
After the divorce,

194
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,150
his mother always hopes

195
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,610
Xiaonan can live with her.

196
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,810
Although the court has made a judgment,

197
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,580
these two

198
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,130
have been dilly-dallying regarding household registration.

199
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,450
Qin Mingyu is also so busy

200
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,910
that he had no time to do it.

201
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,780
Then, what should we do?

202
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,000
Does he have a passport?

203
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,470
Yes.

204
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,370
Give me his passport first.

205
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,050
We'll discuss it after flying to Beijing.

206
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:11,850
But we need

207
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,850
both the original and photocopy

208
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,930
of his household registration permit.

209
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,930
The school will need to verify them.

210
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,840
We'll figure this out this month.

211
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,290
Poor kid.

212
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,570
[No self-heating food in hand-carry or check-in luggage is allowed]

213
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,610
Passport.

214
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,690
I'll go back to Beijing after the Chinese New Year.

215
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,930
It's almost time.

216
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,180
You may go in.

217
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,030
Goodbye, Uncle Lu.

218
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,500
Alright.

219
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,770
It's not like we'll never see each other again.

220
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,210
We'll get going then.

221
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,250
Why didn't your dad come to see you off?

222
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,810
He hasn't been home for two days.

223
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,930
He only called once.

224
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,450
It's okay.

225
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,310
You can visit him during the summer break.

226
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,570
I may not able to see him

227
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,120
even if I go back.

228
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,790
Last year when I just arrived at Qining,

229
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,360
my dad was on a mission,

230
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,820
a confidential one.

231
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,510
I couldn't see him for days.

232
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,970
Then,

233
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:04,950
what about you?

234
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,890
Was there no one who took care of you?

235
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:07,450
Yes.

236
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,000
The family of other team members took turns taking care of me.

237
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,670
But I cried every night.

238
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,360
I thought my dad had abandoned me.

239
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:22,910
Let me tell you.

240
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,850
I even cried

241
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,250
when I was in high school.

242
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,410
My parents were divorcing at that time.

243
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,270
So I cried a lot.

244
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,170
You are so melodramatic.

245
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,650
What's wrong with you?

246
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,180
I was trying to comfort you.

247
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,150
My dad said that I couldn't lie,

248
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,830
especially to you.

249
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,530
So I was being honest with you.

250
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,910
I won't argue with you.

251
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,870
I'll take you hanging out tomorrow.

252
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,030
Where do you want to go?

253
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,170
The Palace Museum, the Temple of Heaven,

254
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,210
or the Great Wall?

255
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,350
How about this?

256
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:03,960
I'll take you

257
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,130
to visit

258
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,560
all the famous tourist spots

259
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,290
before we go to the local spots.

260
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,110
I don't want to go anywhere.

261
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,980
We won't spend your dad's money.

262
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,890
Your money is also money.

263
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,690
That's Xinhe Hospital.

264
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,920
Do you know it?

265
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,150
I know.

266
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,080
I used to go there when I was young.

267
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,200
And there's also a 341 Hospital.

268
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,770
Is it nearby?

269
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,220
I know it too.

270
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,430
You know a lot.

271
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,250
Uncle Lu told me.

272
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,370
He said

273
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,840
he went to 341 Hospital

274
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,030
to visit a friend.

275
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,520
A hospitalized friend.

276
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,330
Was it you?

277
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,560
Maybe.

278
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,430
What do you mean by maybe?

279
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,810
I can't remember.

280
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,310
We are arriving at my home.

281
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,650
That is the place you are going to stay

282
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,710
for the next month.

283
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:36,870
Come in.

284
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,530
This is the house I rent.

285
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,990
You can look around later.

286
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,970
Come and change your shoes.

287
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,630
Put them on.

288
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,570
I can't help you manage the suitcase today.

289
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,730
Take out your pyjamas.

290
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,590
I'll take you upstairs to take a shower and go to bed.

291
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,150
I usually

292
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,420
sleep naked.

293
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,780
You have to wear clothes here.

294
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,730
I'm a girl.

295
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,710
We should respect each other.

296
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,410
Okay.

297
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,990
I'm not familiar with this place.

298
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,700
Can you buy it for me tomorrow?

299
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,740
Okay, leave it to me.

300
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,260
[Hongrun Chenghua]

301
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,490
Thanks.

302
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,750
You finally came back.

303
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,170
Not tied down

304
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,370
by the beautiful mountains and rivers of our motherland?

305
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,410
Did anything happen in our company

306
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,010
before the Chinese New Year?

307
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,820
No.

308
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,080
It's almost New Year. Everyone is lazy.

309
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,810
That's good.

310
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:30,930
By the way,

311
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,460
there's a kid at my house.

312
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,770
He's the child of my friend.

313
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,250
So I won't work overtime.

314
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,290
If there are any needs,

315
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,420
I'll work from home.

316
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,020
I'm fine with it.

317
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,180
I'm not the boss.

318
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,010
The boss is coming.

319
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,270
You're back.

320
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,690
Tomorrow is Laba.

321
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,930
I was worried

322
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,890
you wouldn't be able to catch up with the congee from Yonghe Palace.

323
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,420
Perfect.

324
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:55,820
Oh yeah.

325
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,970
I almost forgot.

326
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,530
Are we going together tomorrow

327
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,090
or should I queue up for you first?

328
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:03,690
No need.

329
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,310
I'll take someone there.

330
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,540
Her friend's kid

331
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,330
will stay at her house until the Chinese New Year.

332
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,200
Okay.

333
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,130
Qin Xiaonan.

334
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
-Qin...
-Coming.

335
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,050
Slow down. Be careful not to fall.

336
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,300
You've underestimated me.

337
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,310
These stairs

338
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,530
won't hurt me.

339
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,890
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

340
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:37,890
It was dark when I came in.

341
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,490
You scared me.

342
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,130
I thought something happened to you.

343
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,750
It's on.

344
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,210
I've turned on the desk lamp.

345
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,130
Your lights are too bright.

346
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,180
They must consume a lot of electricity.

347
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,670
I was not in the living room,

348
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,340
so I switched off all of them.

349
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:53,690
Come here.

350
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,260

These are all for you.

352
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,680
Heartless boy.

353
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,540
I don't have that much money for you.

354
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,770
They are at a 90% discount.

355
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,850
All are on sale.

356
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,330
I spent all the money

357
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,770
you gave me to buy these.

358
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,540
And I have points

359
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,240
to redeem the gifts for free.

360
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,010
Points?

361
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,490
You can redeem so many things?

362
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,270
Of course.

363
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,730
I bought a lot in the past.

364
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,940
So I got many points.

365
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,260

00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,380

You still have your wallet with you.

368
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,170
What do you want for dinner?

369
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,300

than planned.

Are you anxious to return home?

It's better than with you.

378
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,450
Give this to Gui Xiao.

379
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,550

00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,150
Where did you get the money?

381
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:23,950
It's my bonus.

382
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,750
Gui Xiao bought not only clothes

383
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,280
but also books for Xiaonan.

384
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,730
Right? She provides food and accommodation too.

Also,

00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,170
most importantly,

388
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,830
she introduced me to a school.

389
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,970
A school!

390
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,610
This helped me a lot.

391
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,690
She has done me a huge favour.

392
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,410
Favour is the most valuable, do you know that?

393
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:43,870
Take it.

394
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,680
I will pay her.

by paying for my son?

398
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,490
It's on your account.

399

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,710
It's an exceptional case.

569
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,130
Are you coming to celebrate Meng Xiaoshan's birthday,

570
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,000
who has just graduated?

571
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,450
Yes.

572
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,140
Turn right. The innermost one.

573
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,830
Thank you.

574
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:20,930
What are you laughing at?

575
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,310
Believe it or not, I'll pocket all in the next round.

576
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,240
I don't think so.

577
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,520
We have made a bet.

578
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,580
Whoever wins will buy the beverages.

579
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,050
Won't he get a heat stroke

580
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,060
wearing so much?

581
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:43,690
Chen.

582
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,410
Chen, this is Meng Xiaoshan's sister

583
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,210
and my sister-in-law, Gui Xiao.

584
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,110
Game.

585
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,250
Let me play in the next game.

586
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,920
You're even shorter than the cue stick.

587
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,470
You'd better just watch them playing.

588
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,500
Didn't you make a block booking?

589
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,300
There are no outsiders here. I'm just playing for fun.

590
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,890
Yes.

591
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,210
You've booked for a whole afternoon anyway.

592
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,100
Just let her play.

593
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,360
I'll go get some water.

594
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,410
Brother, where are you going?

595
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,650
I'll play with you for one game.

596
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,680
You've been sitting here all afternoon.

597
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,810
You finally have the mood to exercise.

598
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,690
I am no match for you.

599
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,890
I'll use my left hand.

600
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,780
The rule is who clears the table first, who wins.

601
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,400
In this way, the chances of winning are high.

602
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,340
I'll start the move.

603
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,179

something happened to Lu Chen's family

668
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:50,250
[Summer 2008]

669
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,820
one day before the Gaokao.

670
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,250
He didn't settle it until the next afternoon

671
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:51,800
and missed

672
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,460
the first exam in the morning.

673
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,450
No one knew

674
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,250
whether he was going to repeat his final year

675
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,650
or work at the repair factory of his family.

676
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,170
Since then,

00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,260

694
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,960
My brother didn't take the Gaokao that day

695
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,230
because he applied for the police academy

696
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,630
without telling his dad.

697
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,250
His dad made a scene before the exam

698
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,370
and locked him up in the garage

699
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,030
for two days and three nights.

700
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,690
The first exam was finished by then.

701
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,320
He was released in secret

702
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,520
by my aunt after that.

703
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,770
But it was too late.

704
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:44,510
Why?

705
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,490
He applied for the police academy. So what?

706
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,520
My aunt had divorced my uncle before.

707
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,250
She married a cop after that.

708
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,440
That cop was very nice.

709
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,730
He treated my cousins well.

710
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,950
But later he got sick and died.

711
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,690
My aunt had no income.

712
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,660
She couldn't afford to raise two children.

713
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,630
So she remarried my uncle.

714
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,140
Probably because of jealousy.

715
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,810
I heard it from my mum.

716
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:17,890
When my uncle

717
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,690
knew my cousin had applied for the police academy,

718
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,800
he went crazy.

719
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,290
He must have recalled

720
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,820

721
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,850

This is my younger brother, Hai Jianfeng.

753
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,430
They are our own people.

754
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,930
Lu Chen's room is too cold.

755
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:36,530
Put it on.

756
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,730
You guys are still in high school.

757
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,660
You can't drink.

758
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,570
Don't worry. I won't let them drink.

759
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,230
This should be where he lives.

760
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,130
Is this

761
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,700
Hai Jianfeng's best friend?

762
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,600
No, no.

763
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,210
No.

764
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,240
This is my sister.

765
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,570
This is my sister.

766
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,480
He's no match for Gui Xiao.

767
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,990
I'm serious.

768
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,210
My sister not only has good grades

769
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,210
but is also talented in sports

770
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,210
and is a member of the school choir.

771
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:04,930
She is definitely

772
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,660
the favourite of all teachers.

773
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,890
A straight-A student? Not bad.

774
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,570
Are there enough dishes?

775
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,110
No.

776
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,720
I want to eat pickled cabbage with vinegar sauce.

777
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,250
One more.

778
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:42,630
Coming.

779
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,280
Good.

780
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:50,780
Try it.

781
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:51,840
Try it.

782
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:56,610
Chen.

783
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,970
Your cooking is so good.

784
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,110
Of course.

785
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,940
You don't have to rush back, right?

786
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,720
It's my birthday today.

787
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,650
We finally get to gather like this.

788
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,130
Otherwise,

789
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,190
I don't dare to waste your study time.

790
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:07,990
No hurry.

791
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:08,860
It's Friday.

792
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,280
Okay, that's good.

793
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,340
Try it. Lu Chen is good at cooking.
