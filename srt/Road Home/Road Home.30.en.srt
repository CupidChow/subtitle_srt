00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,760
What? You didn't do well in the exam too?

191
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,770
Not bad.

192
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,670
Take it.

193
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,620
Thank you, Chen.

194
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,890
Why are you being so polite with me?

195
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,100
My cousin bought one more. Drink it.

196
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,590
He didn't say it's for me.

197
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,450
What if he just put it here for now

198
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,400
and will come back for it later?

199
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,880
He put it here for you.

200
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,940
Don't stand on ceremony with him. Drink it.

201
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:04,700
These days,

202
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,160
the food in the canteen tastes terrible.

203
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,580
Gui Xiao and I ate in the restaurants

204
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,940
near the school gate for several days.

205
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,300
The food made by some of the restaurants

206
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,980
is not clean.

207
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:13,790
Don't eat there too often.

208
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,750
I'm not like you. You cook and bring your lunch.

209
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,520
I envy you.

210
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,340
I'll cook a few dishes for you.

211
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,860
Take it to school for lunch tomorrow.

212
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:24,690
Sure.

213
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:27,960
But my mom

214
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,650
doesn't want me to disturb you.

215
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,630
She said the college entrance exam is coming.

216
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,180
If she finds out

217
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,810
you cook for me,

218
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,630
she'll scold me.

219
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,420
I don't do this very often.

220
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,310
You can eat it for lunch tomorrow.

221
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,750
You're so nice to me.

222
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,110
Go get a lunchbox.

223
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,810
If I had your cooking skills,

224
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,980
I would bring my own food every day.

225
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:58,800
Do you want some?

226
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,550
No.

227
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,830
My cousin made it yesterday.

228
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,590
Try it.

229
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,970
Your cousin made it?

230
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:21,710
Yes.

231
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,050
He wanted me to eat something different.

232
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,220
No wonder you asked me

233
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,060
to bring my lunch today.

234
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,840
Delicious?

235
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,400
Great.

236
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,810
Unfortunately,

237
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,540
the Police Academy he chose is not in Beijing.

238
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,960
We may not be able to see him in the future.

239
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,260
He didn't choose universities in Beijing?

240
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,870
He didn't.

241
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,980
He may come back for summer and winter vacations.

242
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,540
But if he has a girlfriend,

243
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,750
he probably won't be back during vacations.

244
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,530
His future girlfriend will be lucky.

245
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,460
He's nice and he cooks well.

246
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,890
Did your class teacher tell you

247
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,030
our school is going to be an exam venue,

248
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,900
and Grade 10 and Grade 11 will take the days off?

249
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,329
Yes.

250
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:28,810
Nice.

251
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:57,410
Sir.

252
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,860
It's the college entrance exam today.

253
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,870
You can't enter the school, right?

254
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,460
I just passed by.

255
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,820
So strange. Why isn't his name on the list?

256
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,350
Look.

257
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,690
The top 50 students

258
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,650
are all going to famous universities.

259
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,170
This year's seniors are awesome.

260
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,360
Yes.

261
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,880
I don't know how they did it.

262
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,620
Let's go buy something to eat

263
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,450
after class tomorrow.

264
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,030
Sure.

265
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,150
There's no study hall in the evening yet.

266
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,390
Grade 12.

267
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,890
It's finally our turn.

268
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,170
How did your cousin do?

269
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,520
Did he get enrolled?

270
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,760
I don't know.

271
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,880
You didn't ask?

272
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,380
Before the exam, my mom told me

273
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,240
not to ask him.

274
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,240
She doesn't want to put him under pressure.

275
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,630
Waiting for the admission letter

276
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,610
after the exam must be stressful.

277
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,760
[Lu Zheng Automobile Repair]

278
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,260
Lu Chen.

279
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,320
Come on, let's talk.

280
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm okay.

281
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,360
Talk to me

282
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,030
and you'll be relieved.

283
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,500
You bad boy.

284
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,690
What should I say about you?

285
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,220
I told you not to choose the Police Academy, but you didn't listen.

286
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,900
In your mind,

287
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,780
there's only your stepfather

288
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,060
but not me, right?

289
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,180
Enough, bro.

290
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,960
He is upset.

291
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,820
Can't you just stop talking?

292
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,040
What is he sad about?

293
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,620
He should know

294
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,750
who his real father is.

295
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,640
He didn't listen to me.

296
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,820
Fine, don't take the exam this year.

297
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,930
Wait for next year.

298
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,970
I'll transfer you to another school.

299
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,560
Maybe you can do better in the exam.

300
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,800
You live here every day.

301
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,150
You have your own home.

302
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,200
I missed the college entrance exam that year.

303
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,020
If I hadn't retaken my senior year

304
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,460
or if I'd transferred to another school,

305
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,360
would I have

306
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,440
lost contact with you?

307
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:39,690
Chen,

308
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,810
you can go out now?

309
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,950
It's okay to waste one year.

310
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,770
You'll do better in the exam next year.

311
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,730
Your way of comforting him

312
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,820
seems strange.

313
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,470
I mean well.

314
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,440
Don't you want to play?

315
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,280
I'm not in the mood. Enjoy yourselves.

316
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,400
Leave me alone.

317
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,050
Gui Xiao.

318
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:11,980
You're here.

319
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,650
Have you finished your summer homework?

320
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,510
You just came out to play.

321
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,720
So did you.

322
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,640
We're celebrating Meng Xiaoshan's graduation.

323
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,200
It's a special situation.

324
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,380
I'll introduce her to you later.

325
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,590
She's your junior.

326
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,550
Chen, where are you going?

327
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,460
I'll play with you.

328
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,470
You've been sitting all afternoon.

329
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,200
You finally want to get some exercise.

330
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,220
I'm no match for you.

331
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,240
I'll use my left hand.

332
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,730
Lu Chen came back to retake his senior year?

333
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,070
Really?

334
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,070
Don't you know him?

335
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,390
He didn't tell you?

336
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,660
I met him this morning. I didn't ask him too much.

337
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,950
Next time you meet him,

338
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:57,670
ask him.

339
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,780
I think it's better

340
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,920
to solve the problem this way.

341
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:10,930
I see.

342
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,690
Slow down.

343
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,500
[2009]

344
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,560
Why are you drunk?

345
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,510
Slowly.

346
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,170
Where?

347
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,450
Here.

348
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,250
Uncle, I'm going to be late.

349
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,060
I'll leave my dad to you.

350
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,230
Don't worry, son.

351
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:37,760
Go.

352
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,630
Lu Chen.

353
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,910
The study hall is almost over,

354
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,970
yet you just arrived.

355
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,420
Where is your uniform?

356
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,050
Someone in my family stained it.

357
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,140
I didn't have time to wash it.

358
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,230
Go to my office.

359
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:26,980
Stand there and read your book.

360
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,310
If you're not punished for breaking the rules,

361
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,520
everyone will learn from you.

362
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,480
It's better for you to live in the school.

363
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,360
My dad refused to pay my accommodation fees.

364
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,790
You were late?

365
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:56,970
I was made to stand here.

366
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,930
Wear this.

367
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:05,850
It'll make the teacher happy.

368
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:13,970
Sir,

369
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,400
I put our class's assignments there.

370
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,660
Thank you.

371
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:17,440
You're welcome.

372
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,000
Look at you.

373
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,850
You are not wearing your uniform and badge.

374
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,590
I brought this.

375
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,290
That's more like it.

376
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,070
Go.

00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,070
Shall we meet tomorrow?

566
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,250
You have something to do at home

567
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,250
or you're going back tomorrow?

568
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,140
I got cut off?

569
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,030
No.

570
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,290
I did it on purpose.

571
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,340
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

572
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,440
Call me

573
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,300
before you leave home tomorrow.

574
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,210
I'll wait for you at home.

575
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,160
Go to bed early.

576
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,470
♫You must have secretly collected♫

577
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,010
♫So much wind and frost♫

578
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,780
♫Waiting to meet someone♫

579
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,230
♫Who can know how to savor♫

580
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:19,190
♫On a night with wine and wind♫

581
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,970
My cousin, Lu Chen.

582
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,440
Lu Yanchen.

583
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:24,140
♫Half a moon♫

584
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,440
♫The moon♫

585
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:32,470
♫You must have wiped it silently♫

586
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,680
♫For a long time♫

587
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,180
♫Knowing that life is silent♫

588
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,990
♫Only have the light when it's like a mystery♫

589
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,230
♫On a night when no one knows♫

590
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,170
♫The breeze goes everywhere♫

591
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,250
♫The breeze♫

592
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:02,780
♫You must have been there in secret♫

593
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,430
♫To the farthest places♫

594
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,530
♫Bringing back the green plants of summer♫

595
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,850
♫And the fallen leaves of autumn♫

596
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:19,940
♫On a night when you're dating in the garden♫

597
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:27,070
♫The pathos of youth is sung♫

598
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,400
♫You must have wiped it silently♫

599
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,010
♫For a long time♫

600
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,480
She left.

601
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,600
And you began to feel upset?

602
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,100
♫Knowing that life is silent♫

603
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,170
♫Only have the light when it's like a mystery♫

604
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,830
Did you tell her

605
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:57,920
about your transferring back?

606
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,580
♫On a night when no one knows♫

607
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,030
I'm still hesitating.

608
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,140
The order has been issued. Why are you hesitating?

609
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,340
♫The breeze goes everywhere♫

610
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,190
There are things you don't know.

611
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,110
♫The breeze♫

612
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,080
There are things

613
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:13,740
you don't understand.

614
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,190
♫You must have looked quietly♫

615
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,630
♫Towards where dreams begin♫

616
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,540
♫The sweet spring light♫

617
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,760
♫And the first snow's brightness♫

618
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:35,170
♫On an unexpected night♫

619
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,550
It's good to go back.

620
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,590
I'll go back.

621
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:42,060
♫A dim light shines bright♫

622
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,910
♫You must have sailed through♫

623
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,490
♫The sea of destiny♫

624
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,700
♫Kissing the proud waves♫

625
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:59,130
♫Embracing the crying starlight♫

626
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,610
♫On an uneventful night♫

627
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,160
♫A bowl of nothingness♫
