00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,520
I'll wait for you outside.

195
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,180
Every time I see your dad,

196
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,060
I can't control myself but stand at attention.

197
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,690
I have to go.

198
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,290
Call me if you need anything.

199
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,870
Is Secretary Liu not here today?

200
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,870
It's our family affair.

201
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,730
We shouldn't involve others.

202
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,370
Your mother came back

203
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,010
to get a divorce from me.

204
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,400
I had done her wrong before.

205
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,670
But these years,

206
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,420
I've been waiting for her

207
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,340
to forgive me

208
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,960
and start over.

209
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,730
Mom.

210
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,030
Why are you here?

211
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,500
Did he bring you here?

212
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,780
It's rare for us to gather together.

213
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,590
I have booked the restaurant.

214
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,720
It's your favorite.

215
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,700
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,250
I have a lunch meeting with my lawyer.

217
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,460
To deal with the legal department

218
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,460
of a big company like yours,

219
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,220
I need at least

220
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,420
a professional lawyer,

221
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,290
not me.

222
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,650
I won't agree to divorce you.

223
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,560
Mom.

224
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,400
You just traveled a long way by flight.

225
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,940
I'll help you with the check-in first.

226
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,210
Dad.

227
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,190
You're busy. Go back first.

228
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:34,940
Mom is already back.

229
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,470
You can eat together later.

230
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,430
Your daughter has given you an out.

231
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,720
Do you want me to make you look bad?

232
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,780
Let's go to check in at the hotel.

233
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,020
Where are you going to have the lunch meeting?

234
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,950
I'll call a taxi.

235
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:10,670
No hurry.

236
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,730
I haven't been back for years.

237
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,340
As usual,

238
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,940
let's go to the Sichuan restaurant we often go to.

239
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
Just the two of us.

240
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,180
Then...

241
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,490
You lied to my dad.

242
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,960
How could I eat freely if I didn't lie to him?

243
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,940
You know

244
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,820
his temper.

245
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,150
He won't give up until he achieves his goal.

246
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,420
Also, he thought only what he said

247
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,320
is the truth.

248
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,780
Eat more.

249
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,580
Your first love, Lu Chen.

250
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,510
Do you still remember his name?

251
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,690
Why not?

252
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,520
When you broke up back then,

253
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,900
your eyes were red

254
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,430
every morning you went out.

255
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,410
Your teacher even asked me what had happened.

256
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,810
And I covered for you.

257
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,700
The boy

258
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,280
is really nice.

259
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,050
It's not like you have seen him before.

260
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,500
I've seen his handwriting

261
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
and what he wrote.

262
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,790
When?

263
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,430
After Gaokao,

264
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,830
I helped you to pack up your notebooks.

265
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,260
The words behind

266
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,970
were written by him, right?

267
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,330
"Life is tough.

268
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,890
We should support each other during hardships."

269
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,250
A boy who could write these words

270
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,500
must be broad-minded and have good foresight.

271
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,140
How did you know he wrote it?

272
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,530
You were so proud back then.

273
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,660
If it weren't for the person you like,

274
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,500
you wouldn't have let him

275
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,430
write something in your notebook.

276
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,780
By the way,

277
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,360
haven't you gone through

278
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,020
the divorce procedure with my dad?

279
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,480
I didn't know until today.

280
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,070
He didn't agree.

281
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,790
But, I came back this time

282
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,660
to

283
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,390
solve this matter completely.

284
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,900
But, it's different now.

285
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,820
If he wants a divorce,

286
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,190
he will have to deal with the legal department.

287
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,940
Perhaps the PR department will also get involved.

288
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,970
He's now in charge of a listed company.

289
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,670
It's too hard to get a divorce.

290
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,300
I don't want anything from what he owns now.

291
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,060
The year I decided to divorce

292
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,620
will act as a dividing line.

293
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:52,800
If so, you'll need

294
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,660
a defensible divorce agreement.

295
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,560
I'll get you a lawyer.

296
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,770
Dig in.

297
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,980
Wrap it up if you can't finish it.

298
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,109
You are going to help your mom to find a divorce lawyer

299
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,940
and divorce your dad?

300
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,500
She hasn't come back for years.

301
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,060
She can't find a reliable lawyer

302
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,220
in a short while.

303
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:12,900
We've worked together

304
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,109
with so many law firms.

305
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,569
Just recommend some to me.

306
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,400
No, sister.

307
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,740
The point is

308
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,859
you're helping your mom and your dad

309
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,170
to divorce.

310
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,020
They should have ended it long ago.

311
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,630
Although my parents divorced when I was young,

312
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,030
and no one cared about me,

313
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,470
I still think

314
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,540
it's not easy to build a family.

315
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,900
They're not young anymore.

316
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,140
But, they still want a divorce.

317
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,900
For what?

318
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,330
You too.

319
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,900
It's fine if you don't want to be the peacemaker.

320
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,820
But, you can't help them

321
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,220
to find a divorce lawyer.

322
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:53,780
What?

323
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,290
Is there a hidden story?

324
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,090
Not really.

325
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,010
It's the most vulgar one.

326
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,190
Back then, my dad wanted to divorce my mom

327
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,940
because he had an affair.

328
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,470
Does your dad regret it now?

329
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,740
Kind of.

330
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,460
But, my mom

331
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,950
is dedicated to love.

332
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,320
Once loyalty is broken,

333
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,980
she can't forgive the other no matter what.

334
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,620
This is indeed the foundation of marriage.

335
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,970
Actually, the reason I broke up with Lu Chen

336
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,780
was somehow related to this.

337
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,160
My parents fought every day.

338
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,270
One time, they almost hit each other.

339
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,100
This was not

340
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,300
something glorious.

341
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,770
So, I didn't tell others.

342
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,820
I wanted to talk to him.

343
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,030
But, I couldn't find him.

344
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,120
[Winter 2011]

345
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,340
That year, outside the school,

346
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,270
there was a China Unicom's office.

347
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,820
The office had provided payphones.

348
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,020
I often made long-distance calls there.

349
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,980
But even if I phoned him 10 times,

350
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,510
I would only reach him once.

351
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,100
Every time it reached the time we appointed to call,

352
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,100
he didn't answer.

353
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,400
Hey, babe.

354
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,780
I was playing video games just now.

355
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,360
Yes, just a few friends.

356
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
You know them all.

357
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,720
Don't think too much, okay?

358
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:22,950
Let me tell you.

359
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,480
A long-distance relationship

360
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,140
doesn't allow overthinking.

361
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,490
Stop thinking about it.

362
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,550
I'm eating.

363
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,130
I just bought KFC.

364
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:32,580
And I came here right away

365
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,490
to phone you.

366
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,500
By the way,

367
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,900
I forgot something.

368
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,340
I have class tonight.

369
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,450
I'm hanging up.

370
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,370
I'm hanging up.

371
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,190
I love you. I really love you.

372
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,720
Sorry. Miss.

373
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,780
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,540
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,220
It's okay.

376
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,340
I still have class later.

377
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,470
I have to go to class.

378
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,900
It's okay. Go ahead.

379
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,690
Tell me when you're free.

380
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,630
I'll call you.

Have you lost your soul?

00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,580
Why are you pacing back and forth here?

00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,970
I forgot something.

00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,550
Good.

600
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,650
Go back and pack up.

601
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,650
It's an emergency muster

602
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,980
for physical training.

603
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,180
We're going out to practice today.

604
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,060
It happened to be snowing.

605
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,920
Let's go to the mountainous area.

606
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,670
Yes.

607
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,360
In the future,

608
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,210
you'll probably be assigned anywhere.

609
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,270
It's common to run on mountain roads.

In the past, in order to arrest the culprits,

611
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,740
I went over several mountains.

612
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,200
Even the police dogs couldn't run anymore.

613
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,440
But, we were still chasing them.

614
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,420
Don't dawdle when you run.

615
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,660

00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:14,950
Go.

634
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,340
break up.

637
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,050
When I was young,

638
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:13,900
I thought breaking up

639
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,980
was super easy.

640
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,200
So I kept mentioning it.

641
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,690
I had mentioned it many times.

642
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:19,740
But that time,

643
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:20,950
he agreed.

644
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,500
Maybe he couldn't stand it anymore.

645
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,840
You were indeed asking for it.

646
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,740
It's common that you don't know how to love the other in your first love.

647
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,790
It feels like

648
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,380
you wanted to use a break-up as a test

649
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,060
to prove that

650
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,240
the other liked you very much.
