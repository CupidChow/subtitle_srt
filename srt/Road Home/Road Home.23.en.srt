[Episode 23]

4
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,950
When I go somehwere,

5
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,910
I like to go to their train station.

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,039
Every province and county's

7
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,110
train stations are different.

8
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,070
Each has its own characteristics.

9
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,700
The tourists are different.

10
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,300
It's also a way

11
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,960
to understand the place more.

12
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,360
It's curiosity.

13
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,250
Do you get it?

14
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,550
People are different to start with.

15
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,550
Curiosity doesn't matter.

16
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,860
If you want to go,

17
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,020
I'll take you there.

18
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,130
No wonder we get along well.

19
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,740
What?

20
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,710
Captain Qin.

21
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,950
Long time no see.

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
What do you mean?

23
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,420
I saw you here when I was

24
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,290
going home two days ago.

25
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,140
That was before Chinese New Year.

26
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,340
But for us,

27
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,060
time flies faster than normal people.

28
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,660
There are too many missions.

29
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,470
Yes.

30
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,890
In a blink of an eye, it's half a year.

31
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,820
Another blink, another half a year.

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,079
You brought your friend along?

33
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,079
Going somewhere?

34
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,720
Where's your luggage?

35
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,900
We are just walking around.

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,620
What's there's to see

37
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,700
in this train station?

38
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,970
I come here every other day.

39
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,350
All right.

40
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,480
Go back to your work.

41
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,520
Okay, let me know if you need anything.

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:39,850
Okay.

43
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,910
You want this?

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,880
I'll buy it for you.

45
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,870
I'll get it myself.

46
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,860
Don't mention it.

47
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,460
Just this?

48
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,040
Yes, I'm feeling snacky.

49
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,260
Hello.

50
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:05,980
Hello.

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,330
Are you thirsty?

52
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,110
What would you like to drink?

53
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,530
Anything.

54
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,420
How about this one?

55
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,360
This tastes good.

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,760
Okay.

57
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:29,890
Five yuan.

58
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,020
I've paid.

59
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,200
Here.

60
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,340
Can we go to the platform?

61
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,050
I want to see the platform.

62
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,010
Yes.

63
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,140
Tell the ticket inspector that you're

64
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,020
sending someone off and he will let you in.

65
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,350
They aren't too strict.

66
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,140
How long will it take

67
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,529
to get to another country from here?

68
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,060
Four hours.

69
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,490
Over there?

70
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,800
Is there SWAT

71
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,820
on the border?

72
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:31,880
Yes.

73
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,270
We'd sometimes

74
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,420
have combined missions.

75
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,280
Captain Lu and I

76
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,120
went there to help before.

77
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,960
I'm not a kid.

78
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,600
You're not that old either.

79
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,510
I'm about the same age as your ex-wife, right?

80
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,400
More or less.

81
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,409
Don't you find it weird saying what you just said?

82
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,340
I'm not that old?

83
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,860
I can be Xiaonan's mother.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,260
I'm talking about age.

85
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,140
Yes.

86
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,650
That's right.

87
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,220
Did you finish it?

88
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,020
Should I get you another bottle?

89
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,640
There's still over half a bottle left.

90
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,020
Oh right,

91
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,730
there was once,

92
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,640
someone reported that

93
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,670
there are suspected explosives here.

94
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,630
It is a travel bag.

95
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,980
Zhong brought

96
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,020
the police dog to sniff it

97
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,990
to confirm our suspicions

98
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,060
and evacuate the crowd

99
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,180
for me to go over to do checks.

100
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,030
And then...

101
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,050
Eliminate the danger.

102
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,540
Go on.

103
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,140
That's all.

104
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,430
When the train has passed,

105
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,830
can we walk on this track?

106
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,980
Of course not.

107
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,350
It's against the rules.

108
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,680
Besides, it's not safe.

109
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,350
I know.

110
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,490
I asked that on purpose.

111
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,110
You're quite humorous.

112
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,070
You're the one who lacks a sense of humor.

113
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,020
Slowly.

114
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,210
It can be slippery.

115
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,560
Lu Chen!

116
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,160
Shout something too.

117
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,040
What do I shout?

118
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,630
"Lu Chen"?

119
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,360
My name, of course.

120
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:07,810
Childish.

121
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,130
This place is nice.

122
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,670
Let's camp here tonight.

123
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,400
Not here.

124
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,260
This is not the camping area.

125
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,870
There are few people and many wild animals

126
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,530
at night. It's too dangerous.

127
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,610
Are you afraid of that?

128
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,710
I'm not.

129
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:34,990
You are.

130
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,420
I'm not.

131
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,909
I wonder where

132
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,470
Duan Rou and Mingyu are now.

133
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,340
That direction

134
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,140
should be going back to the town.

135
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,090
Let me ask.

136
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,240
Where are you guys?

137
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,060
At Qining's train station.

138
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,080
Qin Mingyu brought me here.

139
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:06,970
I knew it.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,040
You train fan.

141
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,830
Don't go too far.

142
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,900
We'll go find you.

143
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,630
We're driving there?

144
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,680
Is Qining Train Station far from here?

145
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,390
Is there a train we can take?

146
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,320
You want to take the train?

147
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:25,980
Sure.

148
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,940
Let's find a place

149
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,020
to park the car in a bit.

150
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,420
We'll take the train over

151
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,470
and drive back on Qin Mingyu's car.

152
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:44,800
ID card.

153
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,960
Two tickets, please.

154
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,090
To the next station.

155
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,510
Taking a car would be faster than taking a train.

156
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,460
Are you sure you want to buy it?

157
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:57,900
Yes.

158
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,330
It's 15 yuan for two tickets.

159
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Thank you.

160
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:11,940
Your ticket.

161
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:49,860
Let's go.

162
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,940
Old man, do you want some oranges?

163
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,980
No, I'll eat later.

164
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,540
Okay.

165
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,160
Let's sit here.

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,870
Since we got together,

167
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,730
we've never taken a train before.

168
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,280
Indeed.

169
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,550
Sir,

170
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,370
would you like to buy something?

171
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,200
These two, please.

172
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:20,600
Sure.

173
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,870
These two would be 15 yuan.

174
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,230
Okay, just right.

175
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:27,760
Enjoy.

176
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,670
Your taste hasn't changed, has it?

177
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,110
No.

178
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,900
But I haven't drunk this too much

179
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,960
since graduation.

195
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,930
At that time,

196
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,640
I drew up a detailed plan.

197
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,370
♫Only have the light when it's like a mystery♫

198
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,040
Which hostel are there

199
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,520
near your police school?

200
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,610
♫On a night when no one knows♫

201
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,030
Which eatery is cheap and delicious?

202
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,600
I wrote all these

203
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,430
on my notebook.

204
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,550
♫The breeze goes everywhere♫

205
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,190
I locked it in a drawer.

206
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,630
♫The breeze♫

207
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,950
The drawer in my aunt's study.

208
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,160
♫You must have been there in secret♫

209
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,730
Why didn't you go?

210
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,810
♫To the farthest places♫

211
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,790
I don't know.

212
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,180
Probably because I was young.

213
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,910
♫Bringing back the green plants of summer♫

214
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,230
♫And the fallen leaves of autumn♫

215
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:32,320
♫On a night when you're dating in the garden♫

216
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,690
You should have told me

217
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,490
when you came back to look for me.

218
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,890
Why didn't you tell me?

219
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,450
♫The pathos of youth is sung♫

220
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,350
I don't know.

221
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,940
Probably because I was young.

222
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,270
Why are you copying me?

223
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,260
Old man,

224
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,090
have some bread.

225
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,050
Okay.

226
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,780
♫You must have looked quietly♫

227
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,390
♫Towards where dreams begin♫

228
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,470
♫The sweet spring light♫

229
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,550
♫And the first snow's brightness♫

230
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,600
Have some too.

231
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,270
Okay.

232
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,960
♫On a night when no one knows♫

233
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,130
Ladies and gentlemen,

234
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,190
we are approaching Qining Station.

235
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,670
- Please get ready to get off.
- We're here.

236
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,720
♫The breeze goes everywhere♫

237
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,010
I see them.

238
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,490
♫The breeze♫

239
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:27,870
Let's go.

240
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,460
Over there.

241
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,330
Slowly.

242
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,670
It's just walking.

243
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,630
You have more ideas than I do.

244
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,540
Taking the train?

245
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,000
Why didn't I think of that?

246
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,060
If you want to take it,

247
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,460
just take it another day.

248
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,910
You guys are returning in the day

249
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,510
and we'd have no car at night.

250
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,740
What's there to take?

251
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,450
Next time, then.

252
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,110
When you come again next time.

253
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,660
Yes, yes.

254
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,810
Let's take it together next time.

255
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,080
Isn't it pretty?

256
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,360
So beautiful.

257
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,880
These clouds.

258
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,610
You have been to quite a few places.

259
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,420
We split ways at down,

260
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,240
and you only came back at 10.

261
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,010
How was this first

262
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,490
individual interaction?

263
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,010
Not bad.

264
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,830
This is one of the few

265
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,460
leaves Captain Qin has.

266
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,690
He gave it all to you,

267
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,380
and it's only "not bad"?

268
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,770
I'm very happy.

269
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:55,830
Is that enough?

270
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,970
You're lovesick?

271
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,180
Do you want to hear the truth?

272
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,140
Go ahead.

273
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,240
Before we met,

274
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,390
I thought of being concious.

275
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,840
After meeting her,

276
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,450
I found this girl

277
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,950
is really good.

278
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,850
I don't think I deserve her.

279
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,350
You've said this many times.

280
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,780
It's easy to

281
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,900
lose confidence

282
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,820
in front of such a nice girl.

283
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,980
You should be happy

284
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,830
that such a nice girl likes you.

285
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,940
What does being liked by

286
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,870
a nice girl mean?

287
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,420
What?

288
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,380
It means you're worth it.

289
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,630
Indeed.

290
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,970
I deserve it.

291
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,050
You're still quite composed.

292
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,310
Your hands are steady.

293
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,620
Even if I'm not composed, my hands would still be steady.

294
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,480
It's a quality in our profession.

295
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,380
By the way,

296
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,410
they came all the way here.

297
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,290
I feel bad for only

298
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,500
accompanying them for such a short time.

299
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,560
There's no choice.

300
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,310
You're the captain of SWAT.

301
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,900
How much leave can you have?

302
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,730
Do you know where they're

303
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,660
going tomorrow?

304
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,820
Gui Xiao doesn't like it if I control her too much.

305
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,680
It's up to them.

306
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,780
They're guests.

307
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,260
This is wrong of you.

308
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,420
Write up a plan for them

309
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,710
and print it out.

310
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,160
Okay.

311
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:50,730
Stop it.

312
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,050
I'm working.

313
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,380
I have to go back to Qining later too.

314
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,820
I won't dare to disturb you.

315
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,490
This place's surroundings are nice.

316
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,820
Let's take a look over there later.

317
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,370
Sure.

318
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,450
Hello.

319
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
This is left by the sir

320
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,170
from this morning.

321
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,099
You weren't up

322
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,579
so he didn't pass it to you at your room.

323
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,180
Thank you.

324
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,420
This is yours.

325
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,180
This is obviously mine.

326
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,180
Qin Mingyu made this?

327
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,500
He's afraid

328
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,410
we wouldn't know where to go here

329
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,740
so he made a travel plan.

330
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,710
Thank you.

331
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,510
We're almost at the next place.

332
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,600
Don't open it too much.

333
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,260
Do you feel better now?

334
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,730
That place looks good.

335
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,390
Over there.

336
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,090
Let's find a place to park.

337
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,090
Let's go down for a walk.

338
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,420
Okay.

339
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,420
Slowly.

340
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,380
It's pretty.

341
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,980
It’s late

342
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,020
yet you haven't gone home yet.

343
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,090
It's been tough on you.

344
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,820
Home is home.

345
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,820
Work is work.

346
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,100
Okay, rest early.

347
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,510
Okay.

348
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:13,870
Captain Lu.

349
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,060
Are you going out?

350
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,250
I'm so forgetful.

351
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,100
Your wife is

352
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,630
in Gonghai this week, right?

353
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,960
You're going to see her.

354
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,440
I brought you some delicious food.

355
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,930
When she goes home tomorrow night,

356
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,970
I'll have dinner with you.

357
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,060
That's a deal, then.

358
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,540
Okay.

359
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,160
Go now.

360
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:40,950
Sit down.

361
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,070
Command me.

362
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,340
Let me do it.

363
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,450
Hubby.

364
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,210
I'm leaving tomorrow.

365
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,380
Lu Chen...

366
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,330
Do you have something to say?

367
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,950
You have something you want to do?

368
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,270
If there's nothing,

369
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,360
then take a nap.

370
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,530
It'd be too late when I'm done packing.

371
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,010
You know it’d be late too?

372
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,700
Lu Chen!

373
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,020
Your coffee.

374
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,340
Enjoy.

375
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:48,970
Thank you.

376
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,330
Thank you.

377
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,500
You must've used up

378
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,300
all your annual leaves to come here this time, right?

379
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,500
I used all my annual leaves on this trip.

380
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,020
How many annual leaves do you have?

381
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:14,910
It's not fixed.

382
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,570
Next time,

383
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,320
you're probably going somewhere else, right?

384
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,580
You probably won't come to Qining again.

385
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,930
Not necessarily.

386
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,020
Qining...

387
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:28,980
is quite pretty.

388
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,780
I might come again

389
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,460
next time.

390
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,090
♫You must have secretly collected♫

391
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,630
♫So much wind and frost♫

392
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,400
♫Waiting to meet someone♫

393
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,850
♫Who can know how to savor♫

394
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,810
♫On a night with wine and wind♫

395
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,770
♫Half a moon♫

396
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,060
♫The moon♫

397
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,090
♫You must have wiped it silently♫

398
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,300
♫For a long time♫

399
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:21,690
Thank you.

400
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,800
♫Knowing that life is silent♫

401
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,610
♫Only have the light when it's like a mystery♫

402
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,850
♫On a night when no one knows♫

403
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,790
♫The breeze goes everywhere♫

404
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,870
♫The breeze♫

405
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,770
Let's talk in my room.

406
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,170
A man and a woman sleeping in the same room?

407
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,000
There's a sofa.

408
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,770
A small sofa.

409
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,040
Qin Mingyu is a gentleman.

410
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,010
Even if you

411
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,410
let him stand for a night,

412
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,720
he won't do anything.

413
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,190
Don't worry.

414
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,860
I don't suspect him.

415
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,450
I'm just afraid Captain Qin

416
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,210
would really stand there all night?

417
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:15,940
It's tiring.

418
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,570
It's too late to go back now, right?

419
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,880
There's only a small sofa here.

420
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,010
The sofa

421
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,190
is fine.

422
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,820
The sofa is comfortable.

423
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,820
Can you stand

424
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,120
sitting on it for the whole night?

425
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,690
If I were to sit here all night,

426
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,890
I wouldn't be able to even bend my waist.

427
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,560
Your waist is not good?

428
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,230
I sit too much at my office.

429
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,740
It's not too good.

430
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:46,900
I have a teammate

431
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,230
who knows how to massage

432
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
and had taught me.

433
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,370
You want to give me a massage?

434
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,430
No.

435
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,820
I just wanted to give you a simple massage.

436
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,540
I didn't say it's not simple.

437
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:00,810
Try it.

438
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,890
Our team members all

439
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,720
more or less have some injuries.

440
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,570
After learning this,

441
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,800
I've given many people a massage.

442
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,530
It's useful.

443
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,190
How is it?

444
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,630
Is it comfortable?

445
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,770
It is quite nice.

446
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,240
Why are you laughing?

447
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,610
It's just that

448
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,100
you're helping me take care of Xiaonan.

449
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,010
And I don't know

450
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,470
what I can do for you.

451
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:00,890
But now,

452
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,170
I think I can pay you back a little like this.

453
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,820
This again?

454
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,030
Qin Mingyu, let me tell you.

455
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,650
We're friends.

456
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,710
There's no need to thank me.

457
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,800
Xiaonan likes me.

458
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,430
I like him too.

459
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,300
This is the fate

460
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,370
between us.

461
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,080
Don't worry about it.

462
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,860
It has nothing to do with you.

463
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,900
If anything,

464
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,860
when Xiaonan grows up,

465
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,520
he will remember my kindness,

466
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,100
and can thank me himself.

467
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,510
Are you asleep?

468
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,180
I won't mess around anymore. I'm going to sleep.

469
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,420
You're leaving tomorrow.

470
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,090
I can't sleep.

471
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,090
Qin Mingyu.

472
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,810
This bed is quite big.

473
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,210
You can sleep over there.

474
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,100
Cover yourself with your clothes.

475
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,300
I'll use the blanket.

476
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,140
I'm too sleepy.

477
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,870
I won't care about you anymore.

478
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:15,810
Duan Rou.

479
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,180
Duan Rou?

480
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,000
Are you going to go buy something?

481
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,400
Over there.

482
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,730
The convenience store

483
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,320
over at that intersection is still open.

484
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,230
No, I'm not.

485
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,910
There's no need.

486
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,720
Take a rest.

487
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,460
Thank you.

488
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,380
I don't want to leave.

489
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:02,550
Who is it?

490
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,150
So early?

491
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,600
No idea.

492
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,440
I'll go take a look.

493
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,290
Bro, is it convenient?

494
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,090
For what?

495
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:15,860
To let me in.

496
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,920
Is your wife awake?

497
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,840
Yes, I'm awake.

498
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,140
Why come in so early in the morning?

499
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,870
You should at least tell me why.

500
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,300
To wash up.

501
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,380
Let me go in and wash up.

502
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,300
I'll explain to you after I'm done.

503
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,580
Let him in.

504
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,780
Look at your wife.

505
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,580
She's way more generous.

506
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,620
I'll use this.

507
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,320
Go ahead.

508
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,010
Gui Xiao brought her own.

509
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,730
I thought

510
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,660
you were joking.

511
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:45,300
I didn't expect

512
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,960
you're really here to wash up.

513
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,280
Qin Mingyu,

514
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,500
do you think

515
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,740
this is a group dorm?

516
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,460
One you can come as you like?

517
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,300
Otherwise I'd have to go

518
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,060
borrow a bucket from downstairs.

519
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,190
It's embarrassing.

520
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,700
Where did you sleep last night?

521
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,480
In the car.

522
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,810
In the car?

523
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,000
Did Duan Rou kick you out?

524
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,730
No.

525
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,660
She's not that kind of person.

526
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,360
Why would she chase you out

527
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,960
and make you sleep in the car?

528
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,330
No, no, no.

529
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,810
It's me.

530
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,650
I

531
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,980
wanted to just spend the night on the sofa.

532
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:15,410
But

533
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,140
I move around a lot when I sleep.

534
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,360
So

535
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,050
it's inappropriate for me

536
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:20,850
to disturb her sleep.

537
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,250
Right?

538
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,250
Qin Mingyu is missing.

539
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,980
When I woke up in the morning...

540
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,910
I'm here.

541
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,980
What are you doing here?

542
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,360
I'm washing up.

543
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,850
Can't you wash up

544
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,500
in my room?

545
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,540
There is everything you need there.

546
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,140
It's not convenient.

547
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,660
You slept all night.

548
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,450
It's inconvenient for you to brush your teeth and wash up?

549
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,600
Did I...

550
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,290
Did I say anything wrong?

551
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,000
We didn't sleep on the same bed.

552
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,810
Ask him if you don't believe me.

553
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,090
No. We really didn't sleep on the same bed.

554
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,780
Last night,

555
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,780
he spent the whole night on the sofa.

556
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,730
We were innocent.

557
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,170
W-we're innocent.

558
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,230
Qin Mingyu slept in the car all night.

559
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,460
You don't know?

560
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,780
Call me when you have time.

561
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,230
I don't use my phone often.

562
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,950
If you have anything to say,

563
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,860
just send it to me.

564
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,920
As many as you want.

565
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:57,620
Then if you turn it on,

566
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,080
you'll see many messages.

567
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,810
I'll take it as reading.

568
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,810
It makes me happy.

569
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,740
Goodbye, hubby.

570
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:20,770
Keep in touch.

571
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,540
Contact me anytime.

572
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,700
♫I want to watch the sunrise with you♫

573
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,600
♫I close my eyes and make a wish♫

574
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:57,670
♫Your shadow becomes further with the long road♫

575
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,800
♫It becomes the truth of my empty dream♫

576
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,300
Get in.

577
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,460
Let's wait until they leave.

578
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,050
We're not short of this half an hour.

579
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:11,180
♫Love is the gentle looks of a youth♫

580
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,480
Quick!

581
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:17,880
♫Be bolder, come closer♫

582
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,750
♫You are the curtain call speech for my youth♫

583
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:30,180
♫You are everything on my tiny planet♫

584
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,870
♫I sometimes think♫

585
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,400
♫The wind will blow towards the snowfield♫

586
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,480
What are you doing?

587
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,010
Seeing you off for a bit more.

588
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,420
There's no need. Go back now.

589
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:44,640
♫Your light drives away all cold nights♫

590
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:42,840
10 more minutes.

591
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,760
Your husband

592
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,210
♫I'm willing to♫

593
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,410
is quite creative

00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,610
♫Miss you all the time♫

595
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,840
when he gets romantic.

596
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,210
He's not romantic.

597
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:58,010
♫All my dreams are about you♫

598
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,600
He just wants to look at me more.

599
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:58,930
Take your time.

600
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,640
♫Because it's you♫

601
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,220
There's still a long time to go for this red light.

602
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,030
♫The invincible you♫

603
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,080
♫You give me the courage♫

604
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,409
Wait for me to return.

♫To travel afar and pursue my love♫

606
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,429
Got it.

607
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,300
Captain Lu.

608
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,920
♫Because it's you♫

609
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,949

618
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,610
♫Maybe I've been living my whole life♫

00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:55,780
♫Waiting for the dawn to meet you♫

620
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,159
How are you?

621
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,110
Fine, thank you.

622
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,700
Young man.

623
00:34:58,810 --> 00:34:59,210
Young man

624
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,740
means someone young right?

625
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,350
Come in.

626
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:02,900
Mr. Shen.

627
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,380
Captain Lu.

628
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:04,820
Come on.

629
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,500
Have a seat.

630
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,740
Just call me Lu.

631
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,170
You want to see me?

632
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:08,780
Yes.

633
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,380
Lu.

634
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,300
Good, good.

635
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,040
Lu,

636
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,820
do you think

637
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,450
we are considered old friends?

638
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,050
Of course.

639
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,290
Look what I've prepared for you.

640
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,600
Stewed lamb just made in the canteen.

641
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,020
Try it.

642
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,520
Have you eaten?

643
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,690
I don't have the luck to have this.

644
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,130
The doctor told me my health is not great,

645
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,660
and told me to eat less meat.

646
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,810
You're interested in quite a wide variety of things.

647
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,070
Don't misunderstand.

648
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,850
I'm just learning speaking.

649
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,730
Recently, I've been contacting foreign experts

650
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,880
on the phone a lot.

651
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,380
You know what?

652
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,440
When we were young,

653
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,770
we dealt with

654
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:53,980
Soviet experts.

655
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,020
We learned Russian.

656
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,970
But who knew,

657
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,050
we don't need Russian anymore.

658
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,180
They speak English.

659
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,260
I'm getting old.

660
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,120
I have to keep pace with the times.

661
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,860
I heard

662
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,590
you are good at foreign languages.

663
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,750
I learned those languages

664
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,410
in the police academy.

665
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,930
I didn't want to be not able to say anything

666
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,170
when we have foreign guests.

667
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,780
It'd be embarrassing for us.

668
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,500
Well said.

669
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,660
By the way,

670
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,810
Lu,

671
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,260
you are young,

672
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,210
I have a question

673
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,670
I want to discuss with you.

674
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,570
The young people in this drama

675
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,780
change boyfriends and girlfriends

676
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,620
every few episodes.

677
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,260
What kind of love is this?

678
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,060
Do you think

679
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,750
it's because I'm getting old?

680
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:38,700
I'm old so

681
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,630
I don't understand?

682
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,540
I also think

683
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,340
a one-on-one relationship is better.

684
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,530
See?

685
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,700
I like

686
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,900
young people like you

687
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,950
who are responsible for your love.

688
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,140
This was sent

689
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:53,930
by my granddaughter.

690
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,450
I think there's something wrong with her.

691
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,650
But I don't have time now.

692
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,770
When I go back to Beijing,

693
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,290
I have to criticize her.

694
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,210
She needs to learn from you.

695
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,100
Right?

696
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,560
Look how good your wife is.

697
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,260
I always thought

698
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,770
you were not interested in love.

699
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,290
I heard you're celibate.

700
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,670
And are firm about it.

701
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,530
These are all rumors.

702
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,130
You know what?

703
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,910
When I was young,

704
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,420
my superior introduced

705
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,620
a girlfriend to me.

706
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,730
She's pretty.

707
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,880
But I don't have a way with words.

708
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,140
Besides,

709
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,770
she despises my profession.

710
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,490
Unlike you.

711
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,620
You found such a good wife

712
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,620
who supports you.

713
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,180
All right.

714
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:35,950
I

715
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,910
shan't bother you anymore.

716
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,650
I'll get back to work.

717
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,510
Take your time.

718
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,070
I'll be right there.

719
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:40,730
10 minutes.

720
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,760
Don't hurry.

721
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,260
Take your time.

722
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,340
Young man, you're not like me

723
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,730
who's an old bachelor.

724
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,810
You have a wife.

725
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,870
And you love your wife so much.

726
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,130
Don't forget,

727
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,300
half of your body

728
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,970
is yours,

729
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,420
and the other half belongs to the country.

730
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,680
You should cherish it.

731
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,620
Wait for me.

732
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,820
When I come back tonight,

733
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,180
I'll treat you to a big meal.

734
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:03,890
Okay.

735
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,680
I'm off.

736
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,190
I'm looking for you.

737
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,780
They just loaded a batch of bombs

738
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,860
and are about to leave.

739
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,570
But the weather is changing.

740
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,490
How about

741
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,580
sending these bombs away on another day?

742
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,040
No, let's just do it today.

743
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,530
Recently,

744
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,510
the weather here has been changing abnormally.

745
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,690
If we delay a few days,

746
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,700
it's dangerous to pile up the bombs here.

747
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,430
Don't worry.

748
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,880
I'll go escort them.

749
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,130
Go in.

750
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,500
There are delicious food inside.

751
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,230
- Okay.
- Bye.

752
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
See you, Mr. Shen.

753
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,330
My name is Mr. Shen.

754
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,150
It smells so good, Captain Lu.

755
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,470
Give me some.

756
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,110
I’ll go back to the team to have a look.

757
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,450
Do you need me to go back with you?

758
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:56,900
No.

759
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,040
Officer Qin is very good at managing it now.

760
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,370
It’s not yours anymore.

761
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,590
I'm afraid it's going to rain again.

762
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,030
Help! Help!

763
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,300
Hurry up!

764
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,620
Step back! Step back!

765
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,590
Mr. Shen!

766
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,280
Hurry, inform the police and firefighters.

767
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,350
Hurry up!

768
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,530
Mr. Shen is gone! Save him!

769
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,660
Mr. Shen is gone!

770
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,100
Save Mr. Shen!

771
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,400
Mr. Shen is gone!

772
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,540
I’ll go to town.

773
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,120
Do you want me to accompany you?

774
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:15,600
No.

775
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,860
I'm going to make a call.

776
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,730
Captain Lu.

777
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,760
Mr. Shen has...

778
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,380
passed away.

779
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,760
Thank you.

780
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,350
I've seen this before.

781
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,190
I caught a cold.

782
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,270
I can't take medicine now.

783
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:50,910
What can I do

784
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,250
to recover soon?

785
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,280
Cook garlic and steam a dessert soup with it.

786
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,100
Only thing is it tastes bad.

787
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,760
I don't know if you can take it.

788
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:00,730
As long as it works,

789
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:01,520
I can take it.

790
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,510
All right, I'll hang up now.

791
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,640
I'm going to go cook.

792
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,950
Call me back when you're free. Lu Chen.

793
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,910
Sir, your noodles.

794
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,610
Lu Chen?

795
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,340
You caught a cold?
