It's done.

194
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,130
Okay. Thank you.

195
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,600
Captain Lu.

196
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,460
Gui Xiao came to the hospital

197
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,580
for so many prenatal checkups.

198
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,510
It's rare to have someone with her.

199
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,360
What? Are you bullying my husband?

200
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,210
I'm telling the truth.

201
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,270
I didn't bully him.

202
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,330
Have you told him the details

203
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,050
of your checkup?

204
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,850
A little.

205
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,780
Go to your outpatient department now,

206
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,360
Dr. Xu.

207
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:26,830
Okay.

208
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,180
What's going on?

209
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,300
Listen.

210
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,200
Be serious.

211
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,060
I'm anemia.

212
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,720
I have anemia since I was a kid.

213
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,270
The doctor gave me some tonic.

214
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,200
I'm taking it.

215
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,830
Didn't I tell you?

216
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,260
If you really care about me,

217
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,870
stir-fry pork liver for me when we get back.

218
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,470
Stir-fry.

219
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,690
Go on. You're not finished.

220
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,660
Underactive thyroid.

221
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,370
I've told you about this too.

222
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,470
When people are pregnant,

223
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,820
this is a common situation.

224
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,500
I'm taking medicine too.

225
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,740
And every time

226
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,020
the doctor does the blood test,

227
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,550
they're monitoring it too.

228
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,410
Lu Chen.

229
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,710
You yelled at your child’s mother.

230
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,500
We just got married

231
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,050
yet you've learned to tell only good news and not bad ones.

232
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,980
What more will you do in the future?

233
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,280
I can handle it myself.

234
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,540
I can solve it.

235
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,420
But I like to see you angry.

236
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,880
It proves that you care about me.

237
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,160
There's no need to prove.

238
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,060
What?

239
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,160
You think you’re tall?

240
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,030
[Seven months later]

241
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,090
Lu Yanchen.

242
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,030
It's a confidential mission.

243
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,090
You know the rules.

244
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,900
What you need to do now

245
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,900
is to return to Qining in a low profile,

246
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,000
and train in Qining SWAT

247
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,150
as per normal

248
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,250
for a few days.

249
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,500
And then depart from Qining

250
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,410
to the destination.

251
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,610
A car will pick you up.

252
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,420
I'll arrange the mission

253
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,700
and new identity for you on the car.

254
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,430
Understood.

255
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,120
The mission's length is not fixed

256
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,860
and is dependent on your progress.

257
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,920
If there's anything going on at home,

258
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,460
make earlier arrangements.

259
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:29,860
I will.

260
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,090
Captain Lu.

261
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,800
Captain Qin.

262
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,000
You just got off work?

263
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:38,890
You are...

264
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,700
I have a mission. I'm staying for a few days.

265
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,360
Let me do it.

266
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,620
Let me.

267
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,580
This one

268
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,050
looked like they were picking their nose.

269
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,360
Don't think they're ugly.

270
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,390
The doctor said they have good features

271
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,650
and are good-looking.

272
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,140
I just don't know if they're a boy

273
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,870
or a girl.

274
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,890
I've been a father before.

275
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,859
But why wasn't I as excited as you were.

276
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,300
When the kid

277
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,380
was born,

278
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,880
I thought it was quite fun.

279
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,550
But before he was born,

280
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,780
I dare not touch my wife's belly.

281
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,610
It moves around inside it from time to time.

282
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,090
Where are you going?

283
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,020
Making a call.

284
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,020
While I still can.

285
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,580
You know what? This is funny.

286
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:46,790
Duan Rou told me

287
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,670
actually,

288
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,680
when they met,

289
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,250
she asked Qin Mingyu.

290
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,230
She said,

291
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,100
"I think

292
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,140
we can try to get along.

293
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,370
Do you agree?"

294
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,780
She said

295
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,020
Qin Mingyu's face

296
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
turned red.

297
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,920
Just like a lady would.

298
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,720
Captain Lu.

299
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,360
Captain Lu.

300
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,120
I have to go.

301
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,580
You have something to do at noon?

302
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,320
Before you get busy,

303
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,200
eat something.

304
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:19,910
Go.

305
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,000
Okay.

306
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,280
Text me.

307
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,600
The prenatal examination report.

308
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,830
Someone called the police at the recycling station.

309
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,830
It's an iron slag.

310
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,570
Let's go.

311
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,220
The owner of the recycling station reported

312
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,570
that in the waste he received this morning,

313
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,130
there was a suspected explosive among it.

314
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:39,900
The owner took a look

315
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,410
and found that it looks similar to the one we found last time.

316
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,900
So he called the police immediately.

317
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,500
The boss is experienced now.

318
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,580
It's good to be experienced.

319
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,110
It saves him a lot of danger.

320
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,460
Take some men to guard outside.

321
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:48,810
Yes.

322
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,230
How is it?

323
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,580
I've already inspected

324
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,510
before you came.

325
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,300
There's something wrong with the wire.

326
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,630
It won't be done soon.

327
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,360
I think it'll take all the way till night.

328
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,580
Be careful.

329
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,870
It'd be hard to deal with if the wiring goes wrong.

330
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:11,890
This guy

331
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,460
is bigger than

332
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,790
the one we met last time.

333
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,450
The owner of waste collectors

334
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,280
are so bold.

335
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,430
They dare to accept it.

336
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:22,820
Let’s begin.

337
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,800
Captain Lu.

338
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,660
Something happened here.

339
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,580
I'll go immediately.

340
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,230
Calm down.

341
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,030
What's going on?

342
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,140
There were a lot of people here.

343
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,270
We came to stop them.

344
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,250
But someone sneaked in.

345
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,730
They ran in through the back door.

346
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,300
While it was chaotic,

347
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,700
he wanted to follow us in.

348
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,840
He said his truck is still inside.

349
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,340
Isn't it too dangerous?

350
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,060
Prepare the Explosive Suit.

351
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,320
Yes.

352
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,480
Can you let me in?

353
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,040
I have to bring my car out.

354
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:21,680
Not now.

355
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,680
I need to ensure your safety.

356
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,530
I understand.

357
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,100
But my car is also important.

358
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,940
I'll go in for a while.

359
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,260
I'll come out after I get the car.

360
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,010
I won't interfere with

361
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:29,970
your work.

362
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,200
Okay?

363
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,150
I'll drive it out quickly.

364
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,590
Please help me.

365
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,060
Please let me in.

366
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,180
Please help me.

367
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,060
I can't do without my car.

368
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,100
Please wait a moment.

369
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,400
Control the scene.

370
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,580
Don't let anyone in.

371
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,860
Step back, okay? Calm down.

372
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,620
Let us in.

373
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,700
Back off! Back off!

374
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,500
-Calm down.
-It's all right.

375
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,780
I've been a police officer for so many years.

376
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,420
It's not like we haven't met things like this before.

377
00:20:59,420 --> 00:20:59,890
Calm down.

378
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,080
We can't give up

379
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,100
the oath we made in front of our country's flag

380
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,220
just because a few people don't agree with us.

381
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,690
Qin Mingyu is still dismantling the bomb inside.

382
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,140
Let's go in and find the person.

383
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,270
Safety comes first.

384
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,230
Yes.

385
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,450
Go over there. Let's split up.

386
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:21,710
Yes.

387
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,690
Hello?

388
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,520
Is anyone there?

389
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,630
Is anyone there?

390
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,580
Yes.

391
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,970
Over here.

392
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,220
We came in to look for something.

393
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,980
Yes, we're looking for something.

394
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,340
We dropped something here

395
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,740
when we came traveling a few days ago.

396
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,600
Come out first.

397
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:53,650
Okay.

398
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,850
It's dangerous here.

399
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,800
There are explosives.

400
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,380
If there's anything important,

401
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,380
let's deal with it after the danger is lifted.

402
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,260
Okay.

403
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,180
Slow down.

404
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,300
We got past the security line,

405
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,570
will we be okay?

406
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,900
What do you think?

407
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,780
Don't do this again.

408
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:17,920
Also,

409
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,130
when you go out,

410
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,160
go explain to the people outside.

411
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,590
There is a bomb here.

412
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,830
It's dangerous.

413
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
We cordoned it off

414
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,140
for

415
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,160
your safety.

416
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,940
My colleagues and I

417
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
stopped everyone

418
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,340
because we were worried about you too.

419
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,580
Okay.

420
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,460
Come with me.

421
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:38,870
Okay.

422
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:39,700
Hurry.

423
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,130
Take them out.

424
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,110
Officer Qin.

425
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,920
Qin Mingyu.

426
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,230
Qin Mingyu!

427
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,420
Qin Mingyu!

428
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:03,810
Qin Mingyu!

429
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,880
I'm alive.

430
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,020
It's too explosive.

431
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,010
I put a detonator.

432
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,130
It exploded before I got there.

433
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,360
Take him out. Take him out.

434
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,280
One, two, three.

435
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,620
Zhong.

436
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,010
Gao Hai is going out with Qin Mingyu.

437
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,060
You guys wait at the door.

438
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,860
Don't come in.

439
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,590
Prepare to detonate robots.

440
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,050
I need to check the residue of the explosion.

441
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,880
Captain Lu.

442
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,540
Gao Hai went to the hospital with him.

443
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,870
The troublemakers apologized.

444
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,200
Lieutenant let them go.

445
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,010
[Inpatient Building]

446
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,750
[Operation Room]

447
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,750
I'm awake. I need to go for prenatal examination.

448
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,140
This time, my TSH

449
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,400
will definitely drop.

450
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,380
I'll call you.

451
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:25,610
Hello.

452
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:38,980
Why did you

453
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,420
call me so early today?

454
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,220
Are you off today?

455
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,340
I just came out.

456
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,040
Are you eating?

457
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,390
Dog ears.

458
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:04,900
You are the dog.

459
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,990
Okay, I am.

460
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:09,740
No.

461
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,180
I don’t want you to be a puppy.

462
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,740
Lu Chen,

463
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,070
I’m going to give birth next month.

464
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,660
Can you come back then?

465
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:27,600
I can't.

466
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,450
It's okay.

467
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:33,900
By then,

468
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,300
I'll ask my sister-in-law to accompany me.

469
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,200
I'll ask my sister

470
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,820
to accompany you.

471
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,980
No need.

472
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,700
My sister-in-law can handle it alone.

473
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,350
And Xu Yao is here too.

474
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,320
Did you change a Gynae doctor?

475
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,370
No.

476
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,020
He said he wouldn't dare

477
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,680
to be my attending physician.

478
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,980
He said you're already

479
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,220
jealous of him.

480
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,500
He was afraid you would be so jealous

481
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,260
you'd refuse him

482
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,280
at the wedding.

483
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,140
He's too sensitive.

484
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,220
I do prefer to admit that you're jealous.

485
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,260
No, that's impossible.

486
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,140
Stubborn.

487
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,870
It's done. He's going back to the ward.

488
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,570
Text me if you need anything.

489
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,930
I'll check it when I'm free.

490
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,620
I'll get back to work.

491
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,250
Go ahead.

492
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,470
He needs general anaesthesia before the surgery.

493
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,000
He doesn't want it himself.

494
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,400
No need.

495
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,360
It's just putting a steel plate in my leg.

496
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,780
I'm good with just anaesthesia waist down.

497
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,950
When I had general anaesthesia last time,

498
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,010
I couldn't wake up.

499
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,680
I should just bear with it.

500
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,380
How is his situation?

501
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,390
It was a close call.

502
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,700
I put a steel plate into his calf with a broken bone.

503
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,980
He'd be no different from ordinary people

504
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,220
if he works out after surgery.

505
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,110
But Captain Qin's hand

506
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,140
must recover.

507
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,410
This steel plate

508
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,980
will be a memento for me.

509
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,060
I'm not the only one who has

510
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,660
metal in our body in our team.

511
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,320
I just wonder if it'd be

512
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,690
troublesome during security checks.

513
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,910
Talk less, and recuperate.

514
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,720
By the way, doctor,

515
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,330
I must have

516
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,870
some fragments of bombs in my hand.

517
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,220
Give it to me. I want to keep it for memory sake.

518
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:50,570
Okay.

519
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,620
It's okay.

520
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,820
Do you know

521
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,220
for my mission this time,

522
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,390
the higher-ups

523
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,990
wants us to cooperate.

524
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,020
The criteria of choosing people are very consistent.

525
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,420
They have to be handsome.

526
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,070
You dodged it.

527
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,100
I was injured with honor.

528
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,680
I'm not dodging it.

529
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,960
Be careful.

530
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,140
Don't worry.

531
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,820
Is something bothering you?

532
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,100
Come on, tell me.

533
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,940
See if I can help you.

534
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,110
No.

535
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,020
Qin Mingyu is suddenly very free these days.

536
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,120
He often calls Qin Xiaonan

537
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,300
or text me asking me

538
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,960
about the situation what not.

539
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,850
Why are you unhappy?

540
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,900
I have nothing to do with him.

541
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,100
Don't think too much.

542
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,920
Did I say anything?

543
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,930
You're being guilty.

544
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,620
We're just friends.

545
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,280
Okay, just friends.

546
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,190
Aren't you happy

547
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,750
when an ordinary friend

548
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,050
contacts you when they're free?

549
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:34,970
It's unusual.

550
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,160
He's usually so busy.

551
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,620
Now he suddenly has time

552
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,580
to chat with me.

553
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,870
It worries me.

554
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,090
Maybe he didn’t have much work.

555
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,580
Lu Yanchen is with him.

556
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,420
How's his workload?

557
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,260
Quite a bit.

558
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,020
He just texted me

559
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,020
talking about what happened today.

560
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:56,900
But they

561
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,430
don't work together often.

562
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,140
Don't think too much.

563
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,100
It's okay.

564
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:36,240
Nurse,

565
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,990
I want to call a friend.

566
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,920
But she doesn't know I was hurt.

567
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,010
I don't want her to worry.

568
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,210
Please dial it for me.

569
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,200
Okay, I'll call it for you.

570
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,110
Call me when you're done.

571
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,170
I'll ask the doctor to check the ward.

572
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,480
Which one is it?

573
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,590
Yes, the first one.

574
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,540
Yes.

575
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,110
Thank you.

576
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:05,440
Hello.

577
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,850
Did my son cause trouble again?

578
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,290
No.

579
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,140
I just want to check on you.

580
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,010
I'm fine. There's nothing to check on.

581
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,290
I just finished a meeting

582
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,150
to arrange for today's training.

583
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,550
That's good.

584
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,620
I'm fine.

585
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,420
Don't worry.

586
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,060
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

587
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,470
Okay.

588
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,650
Nurse, I'm done.

589
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,280
You look good.

590
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,580
I touched my foot just now.

591
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,220
Take a look.

592
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,610
Okay.

593
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,420
I heard from a captain

594
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,940
he's training the soldiers.

595
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,420
Come.

596
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,820
Come down for a walk.

597
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,420
Let me see.

598
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,010
No.

599
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,620
Don't you have better things to say?

600
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,820
You're full of nonsense

601
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,950
on a call with a girl,

602
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,470
and you still want to hear me say good things?

603
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,020
Of course.

604
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,860
Can I let her know that I'm injured?

605
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,660
If it were you,

606
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,540
you'd do the same too.

607
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,180
It's not easy to be in your line of work.

608
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,100
You're injured

609
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,110
yet you can't tell your family.

610
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,840
If I don't say, I have to recuperate for a week.

611
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,590
If I say, I still have to recuperate for a week.

612
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,720
What's there to say?

613
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,860
It'll only make my family worry.

614
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,260
Captain Qin,

615
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,340
you are really good at

616
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,400
talking nonsense.

617
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,740
I learned it from him.

618
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:29,690
Doctor,

619
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,870
I have to go back to my team in a bit.

620
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,200
I have a lot of work to do.

621
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,110
I can't visit him anymore.

622
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,910
I think

623
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,820
it should be fine, right?

624
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,240
The surgery went well.

625
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,180
If it goes well,

626
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,780
he can be discharged in a week.

627
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,120
Okay.

628
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,110
Okay.

629
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,090
I'm leaving.

630
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,500
Don't miss me.

631
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,840
I can't call you today.

632
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,390
Remember to text me as usual.

633
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,380
I will read it when I have time.

634
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:05,950
Okay.

635
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,540
If I don't reply for a few days,

636
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,270
don't worry,

637
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,550
I'm on a mission.

638
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,210
Okay, be careful.

639
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,250
You'll be late for the prenatal examination.

640
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,980
I changed my appointment time.

641
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,130
The doctor

642
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,980
was sick

643
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,020
and is undergoing surgery.

644
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,350
They changed my doctor.

645
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,260
An old friend.

646
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,740
That's good. You can rest assured.

647
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:56,780
Oh right,

648
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,060
my due date is coming.

649
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,140
The projects I need to handover

650
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,270
are all placed here.

651
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:00,900
Call me

652
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,900
if there's anything at any time.

653
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,760
I can answer it.

654
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,740
I’m here. Don’t be afraid.

655
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,550
Is Lu Chen back?

656
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,010
No.

657
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,860
It's a secret mission,

658
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,590
I can't ask.

659
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,690
Did the baby kick you?

660
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,350
I guess she's hungry.

661
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,500
I need to do a blood test today

662
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,020
so I didn't have breakfast.

663
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,220
I feel a little dizzy.

664
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,860
I'll drive you there.

665
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,610
Let's go.

666
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,220
The police dog should go in first.

667
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:05,510
Yes.

668
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,800
It's weekend these days.

669
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,460
The train station is crowded.

670
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,350
When we go in,

671
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,440
pair up

672
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,900
and take it as your daily patrol mission.

673
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,100
Don't cause panic.

674
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,100
Yes.

675
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,930
[Qining Station]

676
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:25,580
Hello.

677
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,220
Here you are.

678
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,540
Thank you.

679
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:07,980
Hello.

680
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,510
I want to ask you something.

681
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,510
May I know the way to Car No. 7?

682
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,800
Thank you.

683
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,950
No. 112, Gui Xiao.

684
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,500
Please go to the blood test room.

685
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,430
You're afraid of pain?

686
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,600
No.

687
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,340
I don't know why

688
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,400
I jolted suddenly.

689
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
Maybe I'm hungry.

690
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,180
You should come in early for blood tests

691
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,150
so you can still have breakfast.

692
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,490
It's past nine o'clock. Of course you're hungry.

693
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:07,820
Here.

694
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,680
Thank you.

695
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,980
The THS

696
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,950
is still too high.

697
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,810
It's over 100.

698
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:55,980
But T3

699
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,300
and T4

700
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,630
are still quite normal.

701
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,490
I guess after you give birth,

702
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,820
the numbers will lower.

703
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,500
After the postpartum period,

704
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,430
do another rest.

705
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,270
I'll do one for the baby too.

706
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,260
Will the baby...

707
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,540
Don't be too nervous.

708
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,970
You're not the only one

709
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,230
who has such symptoms.

710
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,730
Just take it step by step first

711
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,930
and give birth first.

712
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:18,930
I said

713
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,590
I wouldn't be your attending physician.

714
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,260
I didn't expect

715
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,990
you got transferred over to me.

716
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,240
How's Dr. Zhao's surgery?

717
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,820
It's fine. It went well.

718
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,780
That's good.

719
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,060
After having checkups with him for a few months,

720
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,860
I'm quite worried about him too.

721
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,200
Send my regards to him.

722
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,290
There's only one kid in your family.

723
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,210
I'm worried.

724
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:39,780
How about this?

725
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,060
I'll give you a hospital bill.

726
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,110
You can move in this afternoon.

727
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,060
It's time to give birth.

728
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,080
This afternoon?

729
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,500
What about my kid at my place?

730
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
I'll call my wife

731
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,830
and bring him to my home.

732
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,490
Don't.

733
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,200
Don't bother your wife.

734
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,660
She's not feeling well.

735
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,500
I... I'll make the necessary arrangements.

736
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:58,740
Okay.

737
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,730
I'm nervous.

738
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,810
Why are you nervous? Let it be.

739
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,740
I have three C-section surgeries in the afternoon.

740
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,700
I'll give you the bill first.

741
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,620
Then you go home

742
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,860
and prepare the things you need to bring for delivery.

743
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,050
Make necessary arrangements

744
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:15,720
for that kid

745
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:16,910
and

746
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,170
pass this to the nurse.

747
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,640
Okay.

748
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,240
You're here.

749
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,060
I'll take you to the hospital first.

750
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,300
Xiaonan will come with me.

751
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,760
Is there anything you want to tell me?

752
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,110
Send him to and from school on time.

753
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,780
You can't drink for these two weeks.

754
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,940
You have to drive anytime to pick up the kid.

755
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,570
Don't worry. I won't drink.

756
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,380
It's not just because of Xiaonan.

757
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,640
You are going to give birth soon.

758
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,700
Lu Chen is not here.

759
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,460
I’m going to

760
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,120
go take care of you at any time.

761
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:49,760
Okay.

762
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,670
This is your bed.

763
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,580
Dr. Xu,

764
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,260
will be here after the surgery.

765
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,230
Okay, thank you.

766
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,320
You're welcome.

767
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:03,950
Hello.

768
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,240
When are you giving birth?

769
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,480
My due date is next Monday.

770
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,050
Mine was last Monday.

771
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,070
I guess the baby

772
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,180
in my tummy is too comfortable

773
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,620
and refuses to come out.

774
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,320
I hope I'll give birth before you.

775
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,970
Did you prepare chocolate?

776
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,930
I prepared a lot.

777
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:31,840
Longans too.
