[Episode 28]

4
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:39,420
No way.

5
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,600
Why is everyone asking me to be sensible?

6
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:51,990
Bye.

7
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,050
I'll contact you after the training.

8
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,979
Lu Chen, if you dare to hang up on me,

9
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,510
there will be no next time.

10
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,510
You will never see me again.

11
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,430
[Year 2018]

12
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,960
Do you... remember who I am?

13
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,329
Yes.

14
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,640
I'll remember you even if you turn into ashes.

15
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,420
This year,

16
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,770
I managed to get back to Lu Chen.

17
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,160
We've got a legal marriage certificate.

18
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,020
Although we haven't had the ceremony,

19
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,220
we've had a daughter.

20
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,480
She was born in Qining.

21
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,700
It's thousands of miles away from Beijing.

22
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,900
Stay still.

23
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,260
Thank you for your effort.

24
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,620
He's your son-in-law.

25
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,620
Do you have to be that polite?

26
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,320
We should always be polite

27
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,680
to a hero.

28
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,840
This is my profession.

29
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,660
It's my duty.

30
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,590
He's Dr. Xu.

31
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,300
We've met a few times before.

32
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,659
The first time was at the airport.

33
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,390
Yes.

34
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,380
When we first met,

35
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,290
did you regard me as your rival in love?

36
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,100
It's rare to see her

37
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,630
smile like that to someone.

38
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,200
There's a reason for that.

39
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,710
Gui Xiao and I are friends in need.

40
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,650
Do you want to hear it?

41
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,270
I'd like to hear the details.

42
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,100
It's rare for Captain Lu

43
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,960
to have time to listen to stories.

44
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,530
I'd been lying in the hospital bed before this.

45
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,530
Now I can finally get some fresh air.

46
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,710
Enjoy your conversation.

47
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,770
I'll check on Xiao.

48
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,270
Okay.

49
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
If you don't mind,

50
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,790
please send him back to the ward later.

51
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,310
What do you want to know?

52
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,460
How did you suffer?

53
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,860
On the year

54
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,659
Gui Xiao's parents divorced...

55
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,409
To be exact,

56
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
the year they decided to live apart,

57
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,810
I was an intern.

58
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,040
[Year 2011]

59
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,830
Thank you.

60
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,180
Are you upset because of your family?

61
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,510
Is it a serious illness?

62
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,650
No.

63
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,030
I had a fight with my boyfriend.

64
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,990
That's a good reason.

65
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,720
It's best if you are crying about that

66
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,670
in the hospital.

67
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,570
It's much better

68
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,340
than crying for other reasons.

69
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:36,659
That makes sense.

70
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,690
It's not worth fighting over trivialities.

71
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,820
My girlfriend is about your age.

72
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,870
She's my childhood friend.

73
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,570
Since she was young, she has had a disease

74
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,700
that can't be cured.

75
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,010
The older she grows, the more serious her illness is.

76
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,180
But she seldom cries.

77
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,790
She's very optimistic.

78
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,140
But every time we talked about how

79
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,940
she might leave earlier than me,

80
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,300
she would cry.

81
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,620
When I saw

82
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,660
Gui Xiao cry,

83
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,190
I thought of my girlfriend.

84
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,180
When my girlfriend cries,

85
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,000
she's just like her.

86
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,460
She's also used to weeping

87
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,030
without saying a word.

88
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,120
Be careful.

89
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,020
Thank you.

90
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,640
After that, her mother was hospitalized.

91
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,850
And she asked me for help.

92
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,520
We've become close since then.

93
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,210
And eventually, we've become

94
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,610
bosom friends for years.

95
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,409
She and my wife are very close.

96
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:51,470
They keep no secrets from each other.

97
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,780
You married your childhood sweetheart?

98
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,790
What'd you expect?

99
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,920
Who else could it be?

100
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,100
Before we got married,

101
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,780
my mom had once asked me

102
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,020
to go to her room.

103
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,450
I thought

104
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,160
she had regretted

105
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,350
and wanted to stop me from getting married.

106
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,860
But later, she took out a bank card,

107
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,860
saying it was her savings for years.

108
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,530
She advised me to be nice to my wife.

109
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,590
She said, “If you dare to cheat on her,

110
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,110
I will be the first to turn against you.”

111
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,270
What happened after that? How is she feeling now?

112
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,020
Same as usual.

113
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,640
The last time I met

114
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,440
with Gui Xiao,

115
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,710
I borrowed money from her

116
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,870
to buy medicine.

117
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,789
My wife chose this. What do you think?

118
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,640
I have one too.

119
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,380
But because of work,

120
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,059
I can't wear it all the time.

121
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,600
Cherish your love.

122
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,790
I mean it.

123
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Gui Xiao loves you wholeheartedly.

124
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,540
I will.

125
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,700
Good luck to you, too.

126
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,140
Sure.

127
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,700
Are you talking about something serious?

128
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,360
You may continue.

129
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,490
We'll wait outside.

130
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,430
It's okay. We're done talking.

131
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,780
I'm going back to Beijing soon.

132
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,620
I have a lot of work to do in the hospital.

133
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,020
There is a limited workforce.

134
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,080
See you in Beijing.

135
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,460
Okay.

136
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,850
Take your wife along with you next time.

137
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,360
You still have a friend

138
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,020
who we don't know

139
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,030
in Qining?

140
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,660
You sound like my wife.

141
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,020
I think so too.

142
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,400
Go away.

143
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,420
He's Gui Xiao's friend,

144
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,380
a gynecologist.

145
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,140
This time,

146
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,600
he specially came here with Gui Xiao.

147
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,030
Her friend?

148
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,480
They came here together.

149
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,010
Aren't you jealous of that?

150
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,160
They're just ordinary friends.

151
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,650
Why should I be jealous?

152
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,790
As a married man,

153
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,980
let me analyze

154
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,910
his psychology.

155
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,850
He must be jealous, without any doubt.

156
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,090
What does being jealous mean?

157
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,090
It means you care.

158
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,010
A little jealousy is enjoyable.

159
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,880
Right, Zhong?

160
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,160
I think so.

161
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,930
What do you mean?

162
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,380
I mean, I'm always late catching on

163
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,380
and seldom jealous.

164
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,620
My wife and I went to college together.

165
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,460
We have a lot of friends in common.

166
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,010
Okay, let me summarize.

167
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,710
Our deputy captain is always jealous,

168
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,910
while Zhong is generous.

169
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,360
No.

170
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,120
I'm analyzing Captain Lu.

171
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,830
I don't need your analysis.

172
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,220
That's right.

173
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,340
You were near death once again.

174
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,060
I was almost scared to death.

175
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,580
I thought a lot

176
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,430
when you were in operation.

177
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,460
Forget it. I'll stop saying those ominous words.

178
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,340
It's good that you've survived.

179
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,780
Every day is a good day starting from that.

180
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,160
Yes.

181
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,060
One is bound for good fortune after surviving a catastrophe.

182
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,050
You have had good fortune.

183
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,980
You had a daughter when you woke up.

184
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,590
By the way, how is your wife?

185
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,430
She's fine.

186
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,020
Her life was at stake too.

187
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,140
The baby was just born.

188
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,640
And she's lying alone in the ward.

189
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,910
It's not appropriate for us to go there.

190
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,480
We've asked the nurse to pass on some supplements to her.

191
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,880
How about this?

192
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,850
When the child gets older,

193
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,590
take her back here to visit us.

194
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,940
Sounds great.

195
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,780
Take her back to us.

196
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,510
When I go back to Tianwen after being discharged,

197
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,380
it will be another farewell.

198
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,300
We've been discussing this.

199
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,820
When you are discharged,

200
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,980
we may not have time.

201
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,700
That's why we're all here today

202
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,430
to visit you.

203
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,980
After saying goodbye,

204
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,150
again and again,

205
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,340
everyone feels upset.

206
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,540
Yes, Captain Lu.

207
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,140
Indeed.

208
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,040
Captain Lu.

209
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,700
When I have a long vacation,

210
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,920
I'll take my wife to visit you.

211
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,340
OK.

212
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,760
I suggest

213
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,340
if we have another mission next time,

214
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,050
we all

215
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,750
apply for a transfer of Captain Lu.

216
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,150
That's not good.

217
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,780
You're talking about important missions.

218
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,600
Captain Lu has a wife and a daughter.

219
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,550
We can't let him go on a mission every time.

220
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,880
I'll do it when he comes.

221
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,310
If so, who will take the credit?

222
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,320
I'm okay with that.

223
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,190
I'm alone.

224
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,430
My only son is with him.

225
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,370
He is in charge.

226
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,710
Give me your phone.

227
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,350
Do you want to call your wife?

228
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,260
I'm calling someone

229
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,890
who really

230
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,090
takes care of his son.

231
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,140
Who is it?

232
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,900
I know, it's Duan Rou.

233
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,020
Shut up!

234
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,670
Don't be shy, captain.

235
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,330
Show respect to our captain.

236
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,530
Come at me if you want.

237
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,980
I don't need you to cover for me.

238
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,470
Even if I'm in a relationship, so what?

239
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:13,940
What?

240
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,880
How much worse am I than Captain Lu?

241
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,900
I had a son before he did.

242
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,020
Fine.

243
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,010
Hold on a second.

244
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,620
Did she agree?

245
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,120
No, we are already adults.

246
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,950
J-Just once will do.

247
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,530
What?

248
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,220
You haven't confessed to her yet?

249
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,940
Confess what?

250
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,290
Say you like her.

251
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,380
How can I

252
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,260
say that out of my mouth?

253
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,220
You're so childish.

254
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,580
Love is in your heart.

255
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,580
Deputy Captain,

256
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,990
write a report next year

257
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,180
to replace Captain Qin.

258
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,050
He's such a coward.

259
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,380
Really, Captain Qin.

260
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,830
I'm looking down on you for the first time.

261
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,990
You don't confess to her

262
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,360
but expect her to say it?

263
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,230
Qin Mingyu?

264
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,830
I'm Lu Yanchen.

265
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,240
Captain Lu?

266
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,550
How is Gui Xiao?

267
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:08,920
She's fine.

268
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,740
She gave birth to a daughter.

269
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,470
Both of them are safe and sound.

270
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,910
That's good.

271
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,020
You called me all of a sudden,

272
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,080
so I thought something had happened.

273
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,960
There is one thing.

274
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,590
My l-leg.

275
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,080
I'm still injured.

276
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,750
Lu Yanchen.

277
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,720
What is it?

278
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,650
As long as I can do it,

279
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,810
tell me,

280
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,460
and I'll get it done for you.

281
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,780
I'm glad to hear that.

282
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,720
We're a family.

283
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,410
I'm close to Gui Xiao.

284
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,940
I treat her family as my own.

285
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,520
Qin Mingyu has something urgent to tell you.

286
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,230
He?

287
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,190
Get lost!

288
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,320
This...

289
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,100
Duan Rou.

290
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,300
I was talking about Lu Yanchen, not you.

291
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,330
You scared me.

292
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,710
What's up?

293
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:58,940
I...

294
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,520
I wanted to ask

295
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,060
how Xiaonan is

296
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,320
doing recently.

297
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,670
Is he still obedient...

298
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,790
Duan Rou.

299
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,070
Are you injured?

300
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,690
Is it a fracture?

301
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,700
No.

302
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,420
Don't worry.

303
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,150
Don't worry about me, Duan Rou.

304
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,430
Why would I worry about you?

305
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,720
Is there no signal?

306
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,020
The signal is good.

307
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,130
You're so nagging today.

308
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,210
Is your salary not enough?

309
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:39,990
It's okay.

310
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,500
I have money.

311
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,730
I can pay for it first.

312
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,580
The school has announced

313
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,340
the elective courses for the next semester.

314
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,760
There're lessons for the cello.

315
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,360
I want to sign up for Xiaonan.

316
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,910
But it's a bit expensive.

317
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,570
You may think about it and tell me your decision.

318
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,500
I-I don't need to think about it.

319
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,300
It's up to you.

320
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,300
It's really expensive.

321
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,830
He has to buy a cello and a cello stand.

322
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,340
There are many

323
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,670
other accessories too.

324
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,140
And once he starts to learn the cello,

325
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,300
he has to stick to it.

326
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,320
No problem.

327
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,940
Your voice sounds weird.

328
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,710
It's quite unclear.

329
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,940
Forget it if you don't want to.

330
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,700
It's okay.

331
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,700
After all,

332
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,900
you're the child's biological father.

333
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,860
Duan Rou.

334
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,860
You have the final say in our family.

335
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,760
The wording is likely to

336
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,270
lead to ambiguity.

337
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,720
Qin Mingyu.

338
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,100
Can you do it?

339
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,560
Are you a man or not?

340
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,160
Duan Rou.

341
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,040
Do you want to marry me?

342
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,270
What's wrong with you?

343
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,260
No.

344
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,540
I-I'm serious.

345
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,250
I've never been this serious.

346
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,330
Here.

347
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,600
Don't disturb me. It's one of the most important events in my life.

348
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,150
I live in the SWAT team.

349
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,720
I don't spend much on living expenses.

350
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,510
Five hundred yuan is enough for me.

351
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,710
You can have the rest.

352
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,540
Of course.

353
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,800
You earn more than me.

354
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,180
But don't worry.

355
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,060
I'm not a playboy.

356
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,430
After marrying you,

357
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,900
I'll treat other women

358
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,670
as aliens.

359
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,980
And you can be in charge of my son.

360
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,180
Xiaonan likes you.

361
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,700
If you want to have another child,

362
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,960
we have no objections.

363
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,010
I'll visit you

364
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,300
when I have a vacation.

365
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,380
Let me think about it.

366
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,780
Don't think about it. Let's decide now.

367
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,910
Duan Rou.

368
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,580
I've liked you for a long time.

369
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,780
Since the first time

370
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,860
we called,

371
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,480
I've had a crush on you.

372
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,260
D-Do you like me?

373
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,380
If you do,

374
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,619
let's get married right away.

375
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,099
I'm indeed

376
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,030
not a playboy.

377
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,260
If I marry you,

378
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,520
I'll be yours forever.

379
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,339
Even if you don't feel the same way,

380
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,579
I won't

381
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,339
like someone else

382
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,270
and let you down.

383
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,339
You...

384
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,930
have suddenly learned how to talk sweetly.

385
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,460
I do know... about that all this while.

386
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,290
But to you...

387
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,730
Enough.

388
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:35,830
I get it.

389
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,270
Okay.

390
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,280
I do.

391
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,110
I-I'm not in Beijing usually

392
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,010
but in Qining.

393
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,180
I'll go back to see you when there's a vacation.

394
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,890
Got it.

395
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,540
My profession is actually quite risky.

396
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,920
Are you trying to break up or propose?

397
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,280
Cut the crap.

398
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,680
I'm proposing.

399
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,540
I've told you the result.

400
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,790
Stop nagging.

401
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,870
My vacation...

402
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,590
I'll visit you at Qining when I'm free.

403
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,280
Anything else?

404
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,030
I have a meeting.

405
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,590
Nothing else.

406
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,750
I'll call you tonight.

407
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,220
Bye.

408
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,550
Bye.

409
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,730
What's wrong? Did you get scolded by a client?

410
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,380
It was a friend.

411
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,850
Did you have a fight?

412
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,350
You don't look well.

413
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,220
He proposed to me.

414
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,430
And I agreed.

415
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,360
Was I too impulsive?

416
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,890
I have no experience.

417
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,440
Is he your boyfriend?

418
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,320
We had a crush on each other but haven't confessed yet.

419
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,060
He just proposed to me.

420
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,170
He was so brave.

421
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,430
Did you agree?

422
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,000
Have you known him well?

423
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,110
He's your crush,

424
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,680
not your boyfriend,

425
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,940
but you agreed with his proposal?

426
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,950
Have you held his hand yet?

427
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,180
Or some more intimate interactions?

428
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,390
I held it once when climbing the mountain.

429
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,320
There are no more intimate ones.

430
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,300
Oh my god!

431
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,660
Boss, have you thought carefully and clearly?

432
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,460
I don't know. I'm confused.

433
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,510
Are we still having a meeting?

434
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,750
Give me one minute.

435
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,680
Get ready first.

436
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,560
I need to calm myself.

437
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,440
Okay.

438
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,210
Did you get rejected?

439
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,720
It's expected.

440
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,260
We asked you to confess.

441
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,020
But you

442
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,950
proposed to her.

443
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,630
Now you scared her away.

444
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,780
She agreed.

445
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,470
She did?

446
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,320
Not bad.

447
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,340
You're indeed charming.

448
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,620
Could it be

449
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,990
she was joking with me?

450
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,540
She's not that kind of person.

451
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,000
I know she's not like that.

452
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,860
I'm not questioning her character.

453
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,820
I'm talking about myself.

454
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,660
If it were me,

455
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,660
I wouldn't agree.

456
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,610
He was overwhelmed by surprise.

457
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,340
Give him some time to calm down.

458
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,100
Yes.

459
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,060
It's a happy event.

460
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,060
You should enjoy the excitement.

461
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,520
Shut up.

462
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,620
Well, Captain Qin.

463
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,380
If you are afraid that

464
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,540
she'll turn back on her word,

465
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,420
call her again

466
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,550
to confirm her will.

467
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,660
That makes sense.

468
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,540
But she's in a meeting.

469
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,120
I'll disturb her work if I do so.

470
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,920
You're so distant from her,

471
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,320
like an ordinary friend.

472
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,870
I can't believe you've proposed successfully.

473
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,730
Your future wife must be a savage.

474
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,660
She is really viciously cool.

475
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,820
Her decisiveness

476
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,040
is not vague at all.

477
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,830
Well...

478
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,550
Congratulations on your wedding!

479
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,160
Should I buy a ring?

480
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,710
Or a pair?

481
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,980
That's enough.

482
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,710
My waist.

483
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,020
Little brats.

484
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,190
Zhong.

485
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,140
Yes.

486
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,770
Get me some red packets

487
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,700
in the supermarket downstairs.

488
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,430
Red packets?

489
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,140
It's a red-letter day.

490
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,940
Of course I should give them red packets.

491
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,600
Captain Lu.

492
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,660
Nowadays, we all transfer money on WeChat.

493
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,790
How could you transfer a wedding gift?

494
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,830
That's rude.

495
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,130
Enough.

496
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,740
Don't put on airs at my place.

497
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,520
Gao Hai.

498
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,120
Go.

499
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,580
Buy the red packet with the biggest volume

500
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,790
for Captain Qin.

501
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:04,760
Yes.

502
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:09,940
Even if he buys the red packet,

503
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,300
d-do you have cash?

504
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,620
You'll know after he buys it.

505
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,610
Isn't this still a transfer?

506
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,180
Look at the number.

507
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,270
Eight thousand seven hundred and twenty six.

508
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,560
You're even specific to single digits.

509
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,820
This is the duration

510
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,720
Captain Qin has worked

511
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,760
in Qining SWAT.

512
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,140
Eight years, seven months, and 26 days.

513
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,830
It's also the time we've known each other.

514
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,680
Why do you remember it so clearly?

515
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
I'm your captain.

516
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,390
I want to see my wife.

517
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,780
I'll send you there with a wheelchair.

518
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,780
Oh no.

519
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,620
It's been out of the line.

520
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,420
Are you able to get out of bed already?

521
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,900
Can you drink milk tea during your postpartum confinement?

522
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,540
Sure.

523
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,040
Drinking this can increase breast milk supply.

524
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,980
The doctor said

525
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,250
babies' first smiles always

526
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,340
appear after one-month-old.

527
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,380
While our child

528
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,140
has started to smile since yesterday.

529
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,670
She has a nice personality, and she's so cute.

530
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,760
She's like you.

531
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,320
Why isn't she smiling today?

532
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,090
Are you hungry?

533
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,070
What's wrong?

534
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,180
Are you hungry?

535
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,400
Yes.

536
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,680
What are you looking at? Turn around.

537
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,780
Turn around.

538
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,380
Xu Yao has told me

539
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,720
how you met each other.

540
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,660
Fate has brought you together.

541
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,070
Are you jealous?

542
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,500
When we first met at the airport,

543
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,160
I thought you were relatives.

544
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,550
You were just being jealous.

545
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,080
The day I met with him,

546
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,010
you and I just had a fight.

547
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,010
I was crying there.

548
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,790
Later, my mom got sick.

549
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,800
So I asked him for help.

550
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,590
His father operated on my mother.

551
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,300
Back then, his father was top-notch

552
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,380
in the industry.

553
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,470
Unfortunately, he passed away early.

554
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,700
Otherwise, his family's financial situation

555
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,100
could be better than now.

556
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,380
It'll also be beneficial for his wife's illness.

557
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,340
I see.

558
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:58,730
No wonder.

559
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,060
No wonder what?

560
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,900
No wonder you are so close.

561
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,140
We should always return more than we received.

562
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,060
Although all these years,

563
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,740
we haven't contacted

564
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,990
each other much,

565
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,280
I always do my best

566
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,390
when he borrows money from me.

567
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,250
Oh yeah.

568
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,300
My mom

569
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,410
called me today.

570
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,460
She said the elder shouldn't

571
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,970
make the first call to the young ones.

572
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,040
You have to call her back.

573
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,310
Browse through it.

574
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,970
The first one of the call logs is my mom's number.

575
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,070
My mom is

576
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,640
very stern and rigorous.

577
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,420
She's much more excellent than my dad.

578
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,880
You'd better work up to it.

579
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,530
She's a serious person?

580
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,350
Yes.

581
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,790
You'll know when you call her.

582
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,660
Hello, Xiao.

583
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:17,930
Mom.

584
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,800
Hello, I'm Lu Yanchen.

585
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,720
I'm sorry

586
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,550
for calling you so late.

587
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,300
I-I'm sorry.

588
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,300
I'm not used to it.

589
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,390
I was a bit shocked.

590
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,470
I heard your voice

591
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,470
sound unnatural.

592
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,570
If you're not used to calling me mom,

593
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,810
just call me auntie.

594
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,990
Except for Xiao.

595
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,120
I'd love to be addressed with that

596
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,500
by others.

597
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,310
Okay.

598
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:51,870
Auntie.

599
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,060
This sounds good.

600
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,320
It makes me feel young.

601
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,650
Lu.

602
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,220
Actually, in the past,

603
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,540
I had different opinions

604
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,470
from Xiao's dad.

605
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,420
I've never opposed you being together.

606
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,180
Back then, Xiao did

607
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,020
show me

608
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,180
your test papers in high school.

609
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,930
She praised your excellence in literature.

610
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,980
Your essays were always the model essays.

611
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,780
She wanted me to praise you more.

612
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,260
I read them carefully.

613
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,030
And they were really well written.

614
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,790
I think

615
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,800
you are indeed determined

616
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:25,990
and ambitious.

617
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,540
Later, I found out

618
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,800
you broke up with Xiao.

619
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,340
I felt sorry for you two.

620
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,670
Were you aware of this from the beginning?

621
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,140
No.

622
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,380
I knew a bit earlier

623
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,310
than her father.

624
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,380
Xiao showed me

625
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,510
many of your essays.

626
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,310
She'd been praising you like presenting a treasure.

627
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,900
I also think each of your essays

628
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,170
is very inspiring.

629
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,670
I like them all.

630
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:56,890
Hello.

631
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,880
Lu.

632
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,600
Why aren't you talking?

633
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,450
The test papers during my teens

634
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,910
were suddenly mentioned.

635
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,280
I don't know what to say.

636
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,820
It's okay. Just talk freely.

637
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:12,600
Don't be shy.

638
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,660
Why did you

639
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,050
talk so long with my mom?

640
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,310
What did you say?

641
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:32,100
She mentioned my test papers during high school.

642
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,590
I didn't know how to answer her.

643
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,390
It was weird.

644
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,090
I thought you kept them to yourself.

645
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,540
But you showed them to her.

646
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,500
She asked me

647
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,770
what my boyfriend looked like.

648
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,380
I felt embarrassed

649
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,620
to show her your photo

650
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,020
but I wanted her to know more about you.

651
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,220
And it's not convincing

652
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,420
to say without proof.

653
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,140
What could you tell from the test papers?

654
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,870
She likes your saying.

655
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,690
Which one?

656
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,100
It's the one

657
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,300
you wrote on the third trial test paper.

658
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,380
I also wrote it in my essay in Gaokao.

659
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,980
"Life is tough. We should support each other during hardships."

660
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,860
It's this one.

661
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,350
She said the saying

662
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,120
showed your generosity.

663
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,220
You're here.

664
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,150
Is he awake?

665
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,500
Yes, he's reading the documents.

666
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,380
Did he eat well?

667
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,020
Yes.

668
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,070
Where's your daughter?

669
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,220
She's fine. She fell asleep after drinking milk.

670
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,680
Okay.

671
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,010
That's too much.

672
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,820
Where's our daughter?

673
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,630
She's asleep already.

674
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,270
The nurse is keeping an eye on her.

675
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,740
I saw her sleeping soundly,

676
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,970
so I came to see you.

677
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,430
You'll be discharged tomorrow.

678
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,110
You don't have to come here.

679
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,700
We are in the same hospital.

680
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,760
Why can't I come?

681
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,510
I miss you.

682
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,880
Get up.

683
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:28,980
No.

684
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,090
Why?

685
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,700
If you can't be apart,

686
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,750
just sleep here.

687
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,260
No such thing.

688
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:45,980
Sleep here?

689
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,130
If that's the case,

690
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,270
I have to take the baby here.

691
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,620
I won't rest assured

692
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,640
to let the nurse take care of her all night.

693
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,740
Why?

694
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,830
The nurses of the Obstetrical Department

695
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,290
are specialized in taking care of children.

696
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,130
Lu Chen.

697
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,320
You don't look like

698
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,730
a father at all.

699
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,220
It's been a long time

700
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,020
since we stayed in the same room.

701
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,080
Alright.

702
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,930
Say something nice.

703
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,830
Don't push your luck.

704
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,830
To you.

705
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,180
Of course I should do that.

706
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,020
Good girl.

707
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,040
We're going to say goodbye.

708
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,260
She can't talk yet,

709
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,780
but I can tell that she likes you a lot.

710
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
Let me cuddle her.

711
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,400
Good girl.

712
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,440
We're going home.

713
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,740
Name her when we get back to Beijing.

714
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,270
Chuyang.

715
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,260
Chuyang?

716
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,770
Sounds good. It matches with "Chenxiao."

717
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,420
How long did you take to come up with that?

718
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:25,940
No need.

719
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,500
It just popped out of my head.

720
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,580
Come on. Hurry up.

721
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,490
One more.

722
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,440
Come on.

723
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:44,760
Harder.

724
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,740
Don't stop. Hurry.

725
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,540
One more group.

726
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,860
Next group.

727
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,210
Come on! Come on!

728
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,020
Hurry up.

729
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
Keep up.

730
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,160
OK.

731
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,440
Captain Lu.

732
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,330
Hurry up.

733
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,380
Qining Team finally

734
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,460
gives us back our captain.

735
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,540
But they are not helpful enough.

736
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,760
What did they do to you?

737
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,159
It's good that he's back.

738
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:16,909
Captain Lu.

739
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:17,949
You're back.

740
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,150
Look. Do you still remember it?

741
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,020
Long time no see. You've grown up again.

742
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,540
Yes.

743
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,760
Captain Lu.

744
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,820
Since you're injured,

745
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,760
you should spend more time with your wife and child.

746
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,719
Don't worry about

747
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,560
the team.

748
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:30,830
Same as usual.

749
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,699
I was so busy

750
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,580
that I forgot to find a wife.

751
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,690
Did you get his unspoken words?

752
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,989
There are many single ladies

753
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:40,090
in my wife's unit.

754
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,960
I'll make arrangements for you if I have time.

755
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,040
I didn't mean that.

756
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,719
Don't be so polite to the captain.

757
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,780
-We mean it.
-Yeah.

758
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,880
Captain Lu is back. Captain Lu.

759
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,210
Captain Lu! Captain Lu!

760
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,179
Captain Lu.

761
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:52,980
He's wounded!

762
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,550
Captain Lu!

763
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,389
Take it easy.

764
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,540
Calm down.

765
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,219
Qining Team finally

766
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,390
gives us back our captain.

767
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,430
Yes, we've been waiting for a long time.

768
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,000
What's so good about me coming back?

769
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,250
You'll get double training.

770
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,190
We'd love to do so.

771
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,060
You would?

772
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
But I wouldn't.

773
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,870
Our hero just came back.

774
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,630
The titan

775
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,800
is now recuperating.

776
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,640
But you are

777
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,860
messing around here.

778
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
It's ridiculous.

779
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,950
But, he returned with honor.

780
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,980
He needs some merry.

781
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,380
Give him some warmth.

782
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,020
Well,

783
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,880
I support too.

784
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,280
Welcome, Captain Lu.

785
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,770
[Two and a half years later]

786
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,890
You're here.

787
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:03,820
Come in.

788
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,460
It's suitable for nostalgia today.

789
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:06,990
Let's go.

790
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,760
Kitty.

791
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,540
Your hand.

792
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,680
Let's get back to teenhood today.

793
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:27,950
Come on.

794
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,740
Let's play a game.

795
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,490
Is your husband's billiard hall

796
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,380
still open?

797
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,170
Yes.

798
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,290
He thinks it's nostalgic.

799
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,600
He didn't make much money on that.

800
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,900
And he insisted on not changing the furnishings.

801
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,700
It's up to him.

802
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,540
I'm so lucky.

803
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,540
These days are your good days.

804
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,590
Let me ask you.

805
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,030
Have you ever thought about Hai Dong

806
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,030
when you got married?

807
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,580
Why do you ask about this

808
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,550
all of a sudden?

809
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:16,820
Because I have only

810
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,740
been in a relationship with Lu Chen.

811
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,340
I don't have such an experience,

812
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,470
so I'm a bit curious.

813
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,420
I have thought about him.

814
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,740
I thought about him even before I walked down the aisle.

815
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,620
But when the door opened,

816
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,020
I saw Qin Feng

817
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,590
standing on the other side.

818
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,080
At that moment, he was the only one I can see in the world.

819
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,950
Tomorrow, you will experience

820
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,970
the most unforgettable day in your life.

821
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,540
Come and have a wedding candy

822
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,070
of Chen and your first love.

823
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,940
No such thing.

824
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,020
What are you talking about?

825
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,540
Chen, my brother likes to joke.

826
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,700
Don't bother with him

827
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,760
or take it to heart.

828
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:04,810
About what?

829
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,600
Did something happen?

830
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,450
Eat.

831
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,140
Chen doesn't care about that.

832
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,790
That happened when you were in your teenage years.

833
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,590
By the way,

834
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,430
the guests at your wedding tomorrow

835
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,290
are your colleagues and leaders.

836
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,620
I'm a little nervous.

837
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,000
Why are you nervous?

838
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,110
Tomorrow is the wedding.

839
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,020
Suddenly,

840
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,820
I'm going to meet a group of people

841
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,900
who protects the country and the people, I feel awe.

842
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,470
Can't I?

843
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,860
But you don't

844
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,260
talk to me with awe at all.

845
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,580
We are different.

846
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,630
We've known each other since childhood.

847
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,890
They are similar to me.

848
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,250
Your wife is already yours.

849
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,820
Why do you look uneasy?

850
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,590
I can't explain.

851
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,830
I want to see her.

852
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,640
No way.

853
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,140
You can't see her until the wedding.

854
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,440
Meng Xiaoshan told me.

855
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,870
You are so obedient to her.

856
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,340
Of course I have to listen to her.

857
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,340
I didn't listen to her before,

858
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,820
and I suffered a lot in the end.

859
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,700
Now, she's passed on a task

860
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,540
to me.

861
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,270
No, you can't see her.

862
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:02,940
I'm here to see you.

863
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,070
Brother Qin is here.

864
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,490
Your wife has arrived at my home.

865
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:14,960
Has she?

866
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,540
You can't meet today.

867
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,300
What?

868
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,500
I'm not missing him.

869
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,620
What else do you want to do today?

870
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,750
I'll accompany you.

871
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,860
How about we go to the river

872
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,720
and have a walk?

873
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,130
Let's get some air.

874
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,140
Sure.

875
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,510
Where are you going?

876
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,780
To take a walk by the river

877
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,480
and get some fresh air.

878
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,340
The groom really can't sit still.

879
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,700
Let's keep him company. Let's go.

880
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,230
Let's go.

881
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,120
What a coincidence.

882
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,660
Qin Feng.

883
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,710
Why are you following us?

884
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,280
It's because you look pretty.

885
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,890
He's so indecent. How old are you?

886
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,050
Let's make a bet.

887
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,140
My wife must be laughing.

888
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,070
Your wife always laughs when she sees you.

889
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,460
What's the point of showing off?

890
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,660
You're showing off that you have a wife.

891
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,550
Men should wear uniforms

892
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,550
to improve their temperament.

893
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,080
Miss,

894
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,390
this is your husband.

895
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,250
If you want to praise him,

896
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,310
you can praise him after the wedding.

897
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,200
Go back. We're leaving.

898
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:40,770
Let's go.

899
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,580
Did Lu Chen copy all of these by himself?

900
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,980
The dawn shines on the return road.

901
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:19,160
[You are sincerely invited, The dawn shines on the return road.]

902
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,220
It looks like your writing.

903
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,220
I added them one by one.

904
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,670
I wrote them yesterday.

905
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,900
Dreams of the mountains and rivers

906
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,200
reveal my true heart.

907
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,180
My husband likes your saying very much.

908
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,440
He even said that to me.

909
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,690
He said you know Lu Chen well.

910
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,740
But I don't.
