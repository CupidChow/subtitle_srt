00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,630
[Episode 22]

4
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,530
You normally

5
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,780
talk quite a lot

6
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,270
with Lu Yanchen.

7
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,150
We've known each other for so long.

8
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,860
When men come together,

9
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,789
we talk more.

10
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,100
I don't know

11
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,289
what to talk about with a girl.

12
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,200
Are you tired?

13
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:55,780
No.

14
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,750
Show me around.

15
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,870
Sure.

16
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,300
Where do you want to go? I'll take you there.

17
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,660
Is Qining close?

18
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,660
Yes, very close, it's just half an hour away.

19
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,060
Great.

20
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,530
If we go further down, we'll enter Qining.

21
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,630
When I first came here

22
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,980
to report,

23
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,620
I stood on the prairie and watched for a long time.

24
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,440
It's indeed a scenery

25
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,840
you can't see in Beijing.

26
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,350
Yes.

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,880
When we get to a place with a broader view,

28
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,010
let's go down and I'll show you around.

29
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,710
As for things like malls,

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,560
since you're here,

31
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,530
I don't think you'd be interested to see them, right?

32
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,590
No shopping malls.

33
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,840
I just want to see the scenery of our country.

34
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,430
Okay, I'll show them to you.

35
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,120
Do you want to ride a camel?

36
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:19,200
Is there?

37
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,960
There are some nearby.

38
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,470
Tourists would rent them.

39
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,650
I'll go get two.

40
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,340
I will ride one by myself?

41
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,490
I don't know how.

42
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,579
Well...

43
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,150
It's not too good

44
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,380
for the two of us to ride one.

45
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,410
I'm not saying I'd ride one with you,

46
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,870
but that

47
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,090
I'd learn, and would need you to help hold the camel.

48
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,090
Sure, no problem.

49
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,260
Wait here.

50
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,320
I'll go get one.

51
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,090
He's just like his son.

52
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,580
Captain Qin.

53
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,520
Will you help me or not?

54
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,720
Of course.

55
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,300
Well,

56
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,360
I'm afraid I might cross the line.

57
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,980
Captain Qin,

58
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,400
you don't look like someone who had married before.

59
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,810
A wife is a wife.

60
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,230
You are a girl,

61
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,180
of course I should be more careful as to how I treat you.

62
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,839
How feudal.

63
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,060
Come here.

64
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,140
Sit tight.

65
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,860
You look better

66
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:36,990
on the camel.

67
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,820
I'll hold it

68
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,780
and let it walk.

69
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,280
Okay.

70
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,140
Before I came to Qining,

71
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,870
I've never rode a camel before.

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,460
I learned even horseriding

73
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,720
only after I came here.

74
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,710
After I have stayed here

75
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,659
for a long time,

76
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,110
I gradually became like Captain Lu,

77
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,850
and now take this

78
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,110
as my second hometown.

79
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,140
Anywhere on our great

80
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,890
motherland is our hometown.

81
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,710
It's the same everywhere.

82
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,350
I didn't expect

83
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,350
you to have such a broad outlook in life.

84
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,280
What do you mean?

85
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,690
When I was young,

86
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,970
there was a flood.

87
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,790
There were many people

88
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,280
who came to help from everywhere.

89
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,780
So when it comes to crucial times,

90
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,780
it's all the same.

91
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,850
Every province is the same.

92
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,890
The only difference is

93
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,790
the difference in scenery.

94
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,380
They are indeed here.

95
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:50,870
Qin Mingyu

96
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,530
knows nothing but work,

97
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,780
and has no life.

98
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,400
If I get him to bring a girl around,

99
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,930
good chance he'd bring them

100
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,580
here.

101
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,330
Qin Mingyu.

102
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:05,930
You're here.

103
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,740
Do you want to ride a camel?

104
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,470
You go ahead.

105
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,040
Don't worry about us.

106
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,710
You can't ride it now.

107
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,540
Next time.

108
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,850
Got it.

109
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,040
You really don't treat me as an outsider?

110
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm just...

111
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,710
What are you doing?

112
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,270
Business has not been good these days.

113
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,710
I have to drink with

114
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,940
those bosses at night.

115
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,970
He's a child.

116
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,700
It's not convenient.

117
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,700
All right.

118
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,920
Leave the kid with me.

119
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,300
You're the best in the world.

120
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,730
Stop.

121
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,370
I'm married.

122
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,760
I know, I know.

123
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,100
I wouldn't dare to mess with Qin.

124
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,330
Qin.

125
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,880
I'm leaving then.

126
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,260
Bye.

127
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,510
Xiaonan.

128
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,850
Call me if anything happens.

129
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,650
Keep in touch.

130
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,390
Did you notice that

131
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,970
he's afraid of you?

132
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,510
He's not.

133
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,950
He's a good person.

134
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,950
He's avoiding suspicion.

135
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,620
You're still defending him?

136
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,410
It's rare.

137
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,840
I quite like him.

138
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,380
In the past few days,

139
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,760
some old friends

140
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,290
asked me

141
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,280
if he's reliable to work with.

142
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,390
I said of course.

143
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,540
Stop talking about adult things.

144
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,740
There's a child here.

145
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,610
We don't have children either.

146
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,610
Why don't you try taking care of him?

147
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,260
I'll try?

148
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,560
Hello, I'm Qin Feng.

149
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,130
Hello, Uncle.

150
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,390
My name is Qin Xiaonan.

151
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,210
Good.

152
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,420
We are all

153
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,900
Aunt Gui Xiao,

154
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,790
and Uncle Lu Chen's good friends.

155
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,620
When you are in Beijing,

156
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:56,780
it's inevitable that we might take turns to take care of you.

157
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,200
You see, with more parents

158
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,110
taking care of you,

159
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,800
and bringing you out to play,

160
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,420
it is quite a good deal too.

161
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:00,860
Right?

162
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,470
He's so tough.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,490
Duan Rou was not sleepy.

164
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,970
I have nowhere to take her.

165
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:13,660
Yes.

166
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,470
I was the one who wanted to come here.

167
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,110
Are there

168
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,670
better places suitable for

169
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,000
Lu Chen and I to strengthen our relationship?

170
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,590
Of course.

171
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,630
Take us there.

172
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,760
Yes, take us there.

173
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,180
But it's a bit far.

174
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,990
Take your time to drive.

175
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,580
Okay.

176
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,210
All right.

177
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,470
You can't even talk.

178
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,840
We'll take the same car.

179
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,100
You talked to me about her before she came.

180
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,230
Now that she's here,

181
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,370
you're all so timid.

182
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,870
I'm not.

183
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,180
I'm just afraid that

184
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,110
I will be a bad host to Gui Xiao's friend.

185
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,070
She's been taking care of Xiaonan for you

186
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,730
for so long.

187
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,140
She's just Gui Xiao's friend to you?

188
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,180
Of course.

189
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,520
Where's your conscience?

190
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,020
Fine.

191
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,370
I kind of like her, but

192
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,970

You're usually all cool.

194
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,430
Why are you so quiet now?

195
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,880
What?

196
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,930
Actually,

197
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,500
I’m here

I want you to formally

he's not too interested

in me.

When I was riding the camel,

208
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,550
he didn't want to help me get on it.

209
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,400
But I don't think that way.

210
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,420
I think he's

211
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,840
quite interested in you.

212
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,620
Really?

213
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,170
Lu Chen thinks so too.

Why did he say this is your first time here?

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:42,890
Sit.

385
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,360
Sister-in-law,

386
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,160
we meet again.

387
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,410
I think

388
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,500
sister-in-law has gotten prettier.

389
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:51,980
Yes.

390
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,270
I don't need

391
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,000
you to say my wife is pretty.

392
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,600
It's a praise. You don't like hearing it?

393
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,260
Captain Lu,

394
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,830
you've really changed.

395
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,030
You're overprotective of your family.

396
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,940
It's smokey here.

397
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,420
Just sit down and wait to eat.

398
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,140
I'm just pregnant.

399
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,030
I'm not so delicate

400
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,160
I can't do anything.

401
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,020
And I've never camped before.

402
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,460
I just want to experience it.

403
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,660
Okay, experience it.

404
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,180
Have a seat first.

405
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,640
As long as I'm here,

406
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,120
you can experience it.

407
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,520
Just have a big appetite.

408
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,990
That's good.

409
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,870
The doctor told me to eat normally.

410
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,390
Eat as much as I can.

411
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,420
It's nutritious for the child.

412
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,590
Gain some weight.

413
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,290
You don't mind?

414
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,000
No.

415
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,940
Zhong.

416
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,780
I've been looking at

417
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,770
that little guy for a long time.

418
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,690
Let me carry it.

419
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:52,420
Okay.

420
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,370
You haven't eaten anything yet.

421
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,260
You just washed your hands.

422
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,590
It's okay. I'll wash it again later.

423
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,790
Let me carry it first.

424
00:20:59,650 --> 00:20:59,980
Here.

425
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,630
Hey there.

426
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,390
Is it also a police dog?

427
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,070
No.

428
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,810
My wife's dog gave birth to it.

429
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,410
So cute.

430
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,540
Didn't you also use to raise a police dog?

431
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,120
The one that was

432
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,740
buried with the old captain.

433
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,130
Tianwen's police team gave me

434
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,500
a small dog afterwards.

435
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,060
But Lin Nan

436
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,760
is taking care of it for me now.

437
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,590
It's probably all grown up.

438
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,140
I remember when we were studying,

439
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,860
there was a big dog in the garage.

440
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,260
I didn't dare to touch it.

441
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,290
Only you dared to.

442
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,620
They're actually timid.

443
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,130
If you treat them fiercely,

444
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,260
they will be scared.

445
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,970
But I guess the ones that

446
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,860
Lin Nan is taking care of at Tianwen are all grown up.

447
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,970
I don't think they'll recognize me when I go back.

448
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,810
They will.

449
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,910
I heard that dogs

450
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,170
are very intelligent.

451
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,190
Right?

452
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,620
It's rare to have someone do this for me.

453
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,110
No one has done this for me.

454
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,220
I thought you were asleep

455
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,270
since I didn't hear anything coming from here.

456
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,200
Being able to sleep while sitting

457
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,100
is also a skill of mine.

458
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,370
If you're sleepy,

459
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,220
I'll leave now.

460
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,080
I'm not sleepy.

461
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,650
About Xiaonan...

462
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,690
We can

463
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,090
talk about something else.

464
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:00,890
Okay.

465
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,540
You start.

466
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,960
What about stories from when you were in school?

467
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,840
Things that can be called stories

468
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:18,890
are exciting.

469
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,590
Mine are

470
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,830
very ordinary.

471
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,820
I'm not full of

472
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,020
ups and downs either.

473
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,230
Most people's lives

474
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,190
are all similar.

475
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,900
But the details are different.

476
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,860
My grades were just average.

477
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,880
The teacher didn't care too much either.

478
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,620
But before the college entrance exam,

479
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:46,950
just a year ago,

480
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,190
I worked hard,

481
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,180
and my grades went up.

482
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,010
It means you are talented.

483
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,290
You can improve a lot

484
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,490
in just a year.

485
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,350
I'm not exactly talented either.

486
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,910
Anyway, it's something you got from hard work.

487
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,720
Working hard means you have perseverance.

488
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,640
It's senior year.

489
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,020
Who dares to not have perseverance?

490
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,310
Me.

491
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,530
You're being humble.

492
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,650
You must be a straight-A student.

493
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,990
That year,

494
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,780
I suddenly didn't want to learn anymore.

495
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,110
I wasted my senior year.

496
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:25,710
Why?

497
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,030
Since when I was young,

498
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,610
I worked too hard.

499
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,660
I had always been very tense.

500
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,070
I dared not slack off.

501
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,860
I knew I couldn't slack off.

502
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,120
When I was in senior year,

503
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,650
I suddenly felt it was meaningless.

504
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,020
I ate and slept for a whole year.

505
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,260
I got the same grade for the first test

506
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:47,780
of the first semester that year

507
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,750
as my Gaokao.

508
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,870
Basically, I didn't study.

509
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,070
You have a personality.

510
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,920
But there's a good thing about it too.

511
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,340
When you relax

512
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,660
when you should be the tensest

513
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,390
in your life,

514
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,260
you will find that

515
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,460
many things in life

516
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,820
are not that important.

517
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,690
It'd be easier to face it.

518
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,070
I don't know if

519
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,300
what you're saying is of bad influence,

520
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,710
but I learned a lot.

521
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,970
Life experiences are very important.

522
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,250
When I was in senior year,

523
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,440
others chose to get high grades,

524
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,840
yet I chose to relax.

525
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:30,560
Later,

526
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,390
after I got my marriage registered,

527
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,500
I got a divorce

528
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,520
before I could hold a wedding.

529
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,040
Even that was not a big deal to me.

530
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,750
During the English exam in my senior year,

531
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,900
I handed in the paper half an hour earlier.

532
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,760
When I went out,

533
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,430
all parents were waiting at the gate

534
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,170
waiting to pick up their children.

535
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,100
When they saw me,

536
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,300
they'd just think that

537
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,830
I didn't do well in the exam.

538
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,480
But in fact, I did well.

539
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,230
Thinking about it now,

540
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,770
it's all just experiences.

541
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,210
Yes.

542
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,140
Senior year

543
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,320
is a fortune in life.

544
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,580
After starting work,

545
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,110
I don't remember

546
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,060
many things

547
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,390
as clearly as I did from my schooling days.

548
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,610
That's why

549
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,020
my ability to work under pressure

550
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
was trained during my time

551
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,800
in school.

552
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,810
Duan Rou.

553
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,850
You're so hotblooded.

554
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,140
That's a nice thing for you to say.

555
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:29,700
Here.

556
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,260
A toast to you.

557
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,660
I will take it as a praise.

558
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,730
Go ahead.

559
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,240
Duan Rou and Qin Mingyu,

560
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,840
what are they talking about?

561
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:51,950
When I came in,

562
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,330
I saw them talking and laughing

563
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,010
so happily.

564
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,350
I have no idea.

565
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,180
You have nothing to say to me?

566
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,160
When we were young, you were always the one who talked more.

567
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,220
I didn't talk much.

568
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,140
I came all the way here.

569
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:15,990
Can't you just talk

570
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,240
a little more?

571
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,410
Don't we call

572
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,640
when we're free?

573
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,870
I read the dozens

574
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,250
of messages you send me

575
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,780
every day too.

576
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Can you recite it?

577
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,760
I'm asking you.

578
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,320
When will you grow up?

579
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,630
You're even asking

580
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,830
the same question as when we were young.

581
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,170
You're sick of me?

582
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,240
I dare not.

583
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,340
Give me a kiss.

584
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,590
That didn't come from your heart.

585
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,550
We're in a tent.

586
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,540
They have sharp ears.

587
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,350
We are legally wedded.

588
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,340
It's late.

589
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,910
You're still up?

590
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,400
I came out to train the solders.

591
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,690
Okay.

592
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,360
You train the soldiers.

593
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,020
I'll watch.

594
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,520
They are soldiers you've taught before.

595
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,840
I can't do it anymore.

596
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,530
You do it.

597
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,540
You're not sleepy?

598
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,780
It's because it's rare that

599
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,640
everyone could relax for a night.

600
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,370
I'm going to go walk the dog.

601
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,460
I'm a little hungry.

602
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,120
I'll go find something to eat.

603
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,240
I-I'm going to go admire the moon.

604
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,390
Take me with you.

605
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,110
Watch the time you spend

606
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,390
in a girl's tent.

607
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,200
No, I...

608
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:45,840
Well...

609
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,110
I was just chatting.

610
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,250
They went back.

611
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,910
They went back.

612
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,440
Go on.

613
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,530
I still can't sleep.

614
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,660
The wind here sounds so nice.

615
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,410
It's not noisy.

616
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,170
And it's not unsafe.

617
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,450
Your work is quite effective.

618
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,160
Peace and prosperity.

619
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,180
Thank you for your affirmation.

620
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,800
You're welcome.

621
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,690
Duan Rou.

622
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,140
I won't go in.

623
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,610
Sleep soon.

624
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,580
See you tomorrow.

625
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,580
See you tomorrow.

626
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,760
I thought you were asleep.

627
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,480
The air is fresh here.

628
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,240
Come get some fresh air.

629
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,840
It's good.

630
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,100
Thank you.

631
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,710
Look.

632
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,560
I can't find a topic to talk about again.

633
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,850
No need to talk.

634
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,890
This is good too.

635
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,900
But talking to you

636
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,090
makes me relaxed.

637
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:11,120
Same.

638
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,920
Why are you smiling so weird?

639
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,139
The night is nice.

640
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,159
The night is beautiful.

641
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,380
What?

642
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,010
Don't disturb them.

643
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,630
I'm curious.

644
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,750
What's there to be curious about?

645
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,950
You've never been in a relationship?

646
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,260
Lie down.

647
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,400
Go to sleep.

648
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,450
If you want to watch the show,

649
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,310
go watch it outside if you have the guts.

650
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,970
Why come and cram this place up?

651
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,300
I dare not go out.

652
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,540
You can hear some things from here.

653
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:30,540
Come on.

654
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,100
Pair of jokers.

655
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,830
No.

656
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,360
I want to listen carefully.

657
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,100
Focus.

658
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:42,810
Me too.

659
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,570
What do you think Captain Qin is talking about

660
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,370
with Duan Rou?

661
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:48,710
Don't talk.

662
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,570
What are you doing?

663
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,850
Practicing my skills.

664
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:20,860
Let's sleep.

665
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,240
Come.

666
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,250
Me too.

667
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,670
I'm not leaving. Let's squeeze a little.

668
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,510
Wait, you...

669
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,780
Captain Qin’s ears

670
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,680
are particularly good.

671
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,820
He's shy

672
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,760
dating a girl.

673
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,070
Keep your voice down.

674
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,420
Aren’t you afraid Captain Qin will hear you?

675
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,420
So what if he does.

676
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,750
He can't always hit us

677
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,480
with stones.

678
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:49,680
Captain Qin.

679
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,490
We've already laid down.

680
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,390
Go on.

681
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,280
We can't hear you.

682
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,400
Good idea.

683
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:58,860
Captain Qin.

684
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,720
All the best.

685
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
Should I say something too?

686
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,180
Captain Qin–

687
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,940
Go to sleep.

688
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,110
You're awake.

689
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,350
Good morning.

690
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,170
Good morning.

691
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,180
To be honest,

692
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,930
I understand your work.

693
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,150
But I still think about it when I should.

694
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,300
To be honest,

695
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,410
most of the time,

696
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,970
I think I'm doing a good job.

697
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,320
But when I think of you,

698
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,440
I feel guilty.

699
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,140
I'm a little touched.

700
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,300
They went back.

701
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,760
They had a mission last night

702
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,560
and went back.

703
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,970
I've heard

704
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,230
about your line of work.

705
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,640
Now that I've seen it with my own eyes,

706
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,440
I understand that it's not easy.

707
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,110
There are hardships in every industry.

708
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:51,970
Let me help you.

709
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:52,730
No need.

710
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,740
I can do it myself.

711
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,340
I'll help you as much as I can.

712
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,310
But there's no trash left.

713
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,250
They took it with them.

714
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,330
They packed up last night

715
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,390
and took them away.

716
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,810
You're all men

717
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,570
but are quite considerate.

718
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,290
I'll help them pack up.

719
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,710
Pack up?

720
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,600
They're cultivating their relationship too.

721
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,550
So we're not going out?

722
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,990
I want to wash up.

723
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:39,930
Wait a little.

724
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,330
They'll leave soon.

725
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,140
They are not awake yet.

726
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,550
What are we going to do?

727
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,960
Let's have breakfast.

728
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:58,900
Okay.

729
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,270
What do you want to eat?

730
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,050
Let's just drive out first.

731
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,180
Eat whatever we see.

732
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:07,920
Okay.

733
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,860
You're right.

734
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,080
I know him.

735
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,240
Let's go.

736
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,810
Where did they go?

737
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,410
No need to ask.

738
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,660
Should we look for them?

739
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:46,470
No.

740
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,500
If Qin Mingyu wants us

741
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,220
to find him,

742
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,360
he will let us know.

743
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,940
You two

744
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,340
are such a perfect match.

745
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,110
You can finally tell that we're in sync.

746
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,440
Yes.

747
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,160
We've cooperated

748
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,180
on many missions.

749
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,440
We've been through

750
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,660
life and death.

751
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,550
If we don't have any tacit understanding,

752
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,210
we wouldn't dare to give our lives to each other.

753
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,830
A life-or-death friendship.

754
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,490
Those in our business,

755
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,350
it's really...

756
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,800
Captain Lu and I

757
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,140
used to come here often

758
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,010
to buy some delicious food

759
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,860
and bring them to everyone.

760
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,170
There is no delicious food

761
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,430
at where you all are at?

762
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,140
Of course there is. Our team's

763
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,470
benefits are very good.

764
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,150
It's just, sometimes,

765
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,700
I want to eat something special

766
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,160
so I'd come out to buy some.

767
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,170
At the same time.

768
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,120
also get some fresh air.

769
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,030
What's wrong?

770
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,330
I want to go to the train station.

771
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,190
Train station?

772
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:51,780
Yes.

773
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,030
I've never seen the train station here.

774
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,460
When I go somewhere,

775
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,410
I like to go to their train station.

776
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,530
Every province and county's

777
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,630
train stations are all different.

778
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,560
Each has its own characteristics.

779
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,170
The tourists are different.

780
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:10,870
It's also a way

781
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,930
of understanding the local culture.

782
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,910
It's curiosity.

783
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,980
Do you understand?

784
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,280
People are different.

785
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,950
Curiosity doesn't matter.

786
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,240
If you want to go,

787
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,370
I'll take you there.

788
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,310
No wonder we get along well.

789
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:27,930
What?
