[Episode 17]

4
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,970
When I was young, I thought

5
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,780
breaking up

6
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,930
was super easy.

7
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,700
So, I kept mentioning it.

8
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,990
I had mentioned it many times.

9
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,700
But that time,

10
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,860
he agreed.

11
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,620
Maybe he couldn't stand it anymore.

12
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,030
You were indeed asking for it.

13
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,390
It's common that you don't know how to love the other in your first love.

14
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,740
It feels like

15
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,690
you wanted to use a break-up as a test

16
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,940
to prove that

17
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,120
the other liked you very much.

18
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,759
I was also pretentious.

19
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,220
Back then, when I had pimples on my face,

20
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,009
I refused to see him.

21
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,500
That was pure love.

22
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,880
You liked him.

23
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,350
And you didn't expect to get anything else.

24
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,410
You didn't know what else you could expect either.

25
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,860
Actually,

26
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,700
if I hadn't met Lu Chen once again,

27
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,300
I would have thought that

28
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,060
my life

29
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,130
was perfect.

30
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,610
It was pretty good.

31
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,140
If I hadn't met him again,

32
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,140
I might have resigned myself

33
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,810
to living a bachelor's life.

34
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,900
I've never thought of living a bachelor's life.

35
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,720
I still hold expectations.

36
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,430
I'll find someone as excellent as me.

37
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,300
So that one plus one is greater than two.

38
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,760
I'll leave it to fate.

39
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,020
Anyhow, we should value quality over quantity.

40
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,700
I'll cook some dumplings.

41
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,650
You go upstairs first.

42

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,680
No matter how awesome Lu Chen's cooking skill is,

46
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,130
we can't eat dumplings all the time.

You don't have to come home if you're busy.

It's tasty.

What did you have for lunch?

132
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,730
Food in the canteen.

133
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,280
Two meat dishes and three veggies.

Don't you get bored with that?

138

that I was not in the mood to think of what to eat.

140
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,750
So I just ate whatever was available at home.

You haven't changed at all.

145
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:04,900
Fine.

146

I won't disturb you anymore.

149
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,340

150
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,060
I forgot to say goodbye.

151
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,110
She didn't even say goodbye.

152
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,460
Don't you like cold drinks?

153
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,640
It won't taste good if you don't drink it now.

154
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,409
Thank you.

155
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,500
You've been avoiding me since you came back from your vacation.

156
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,100
There's no such thing.

157
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,110
By the way,

158
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:41,980
do you know

159
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,780
which ring brand is the best?

160
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,180
It's for an engagement.

161
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,350
An engagement ring?

162
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,260
I would like to go shopping.

163
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,420
This should be prepared by a man.

164
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,860
I can also buy it if I want.

165
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:57,700
Or else,

166
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
he can buy another pair.

167
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,540
Then, we can wear the rings in turns.

168
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:04,620
Thank you.

169
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,710
Actually, if it weren't for Lu Chen,

170
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,250
you and he would be a good match.

171
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,580
You've known each other well since you studied overseas together.

172
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,660
You've also been supporting each other

173
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,660
overseas.

174
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,740
Do you think it is not messy enough?

175
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,600
Tell me secretly.

176
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,070
You've been his crush for so long.

177
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,700
Have you ever thought about it?

178
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:37,940
No.

179
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,750
Humans are not like mating animals.

180
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,420
They fall in love once they meet the suitable ones.

181
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,940
I was on the phone with Lu Chen just now.

182
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,700
Before I hung up,

183
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,500
I didn't say goodbye.

184
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,340
Will he overthink?

185
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,310
He's the captain of a SWAT brigade.

186
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,820
Would he overthink

187
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,580
just because his girlfriend didn't say goodbye?

188
00:09:59,300 --> 00:09:59,930
Do you think you are having puppy love?

189
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,080
How old are you?

190
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,100
The concern will cause confusion.

191
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,010
What's wrong?

192
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,500
I haven't talked to a girl for years.

193
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,860
Now I don't even know how to make a phone call.

194
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,130
Did you quarrel with your girlfriend?

195
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,810
She...

196
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,100
didn't say goodbye when she hung up.

197
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,410
Then, she must be angry.

198
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,750
Do you think the same way?

199
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,860
With my limited experience

200
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,120
in a relationship,

201
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,460
I can make a 100% guarantee.

202
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,250
What's wrong?

203
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,510
Anything else?

204
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,100
No.

205
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,740
Then, you are calling me for...

206
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,740
It's about our marriage.

207
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,820
Right now?

208
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,530
I'm going to have a meeting soon.

209
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,900
I've already reported orally

210
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,820
to the leader.

211
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,220
This weekend,

212
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,860
I'll visit your parents' house.

213
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,300
This weekend?

214
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,410
We'll see.

215
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,780
Is it inconvenient?

216
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,500
No, I just want to see

217
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,810
if I have work this weekend.

218
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,350
We'll see.

219
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,130
Okay. Bye.

220
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,220
Okay, I'm hanging up.

221
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,140
I have to prepare for the meeting.

222
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:01,940
Okay.

223
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:03,730
Bye.

224
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:06,840
Bye.

225
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,500
Can you enlighten

226
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,350
a bachelor like me?

227
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,020
Tell me about

228
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,180
a time you failed.

229
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,410
Why did you break up

230
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,110
back then?

231
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,080
We were parted at that time.

232
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,340
There was a time

233
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,400
she was very emotional.

234
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,620
She was always unhappy.

235
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,950
I didn't know why.

236
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,180
I was so busy

237
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,490
that I didn't have time to look into it.

238
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,360
She wanted to break up.

239
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,710
I agreed in a fit of anger.

240
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,430
Later, I found out from my cousin

241
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,530
that her parents were divorcing

242
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,420
during that period.

243
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,570
It was too scary.

244
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,970
It was a misunderstanding.

245
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,060
It was all because of a misunderstanding.

246
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,300
It was not a misunderstanding.

247
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,260
We were young

248
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,000
and we didn't know how to give in.

249
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,660
Neither of us knew.

250
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,240
Actually, if we talked it out,

251
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,730
and I admitted my mistake,

252
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,220
it would be nothing.

253
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,700
It was all because of pride.

254
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,220
Now that I think about it,

255
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
when two people are together,

256
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,340
it's just taking turns to give in

257
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,510
and coax each other.

258
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,920
Yes, that's right.

259
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,580
That's right.

260
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,120
Pride

261
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,950
is for your opponents,

262
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,500
not for your family.

263
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,260
You know a lot.

264
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,690
My mom said this.

265
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,670
She's living her life wisely.

266
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,050
Of course.

267
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,780
She always has control over my dad.

268
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,190
I can have a perfect childhood

269
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,440
and a harmonious family

270
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,380
only because my mom has high EQ.

271
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,450
What else did she say?

272
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,890
She said a lot.

273
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,540
Have a meal with my mom if you have a chance.

274
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,130
She'll make you blissful in your marriage.

275
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,080
Didn't I tell you to be careful?

276
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,510
You got pregnant immediately after you went to Qining?

277
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,090
No.

278
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,040
Then, why are you getting married?

279
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,330
Isn't it enough to date each other?

280
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,340
Lu Chen treats you well.

281
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,470
But, you always hold him back.

282
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,820
It's not appropriate.

283
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:43,980
Do you want some?

284
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,680
I was also busy

285
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,140
involving my parents

286
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,580
to break off the engagement

287
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,430
for him last time.

288
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,240
What do you mean by holding him back?

289
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,090
He is a good young man.

290
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:55,990
He wants to get married

291
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,040
and have children.

292
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:57,980
Is that wrong?

293
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,120
Besides,

294
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,580
they are so close

295
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,540
that they want to get married.

296
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,780
But, you're always nagging.

297
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,960
An orange or an apple?

298
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,270
Both.

299
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,970
Okay.

300
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,260
Since you went to Qining,

301
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,380
I've told you to be careful.

302
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,340
Don't get pregnant.

303
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,340
That's because I have something else to tell you.

304
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,480
Lu Chen's family

305
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,770
is not as simple

306
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,580
as you think.

307
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,720
To be precise,

308
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,400
it's more complicated than what you have seen before.

309
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,140
We're already engaged.

310
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,460
I'm not hesitating.

311
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,510
I'm just afraid of my dad.

312
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,700
When we were in Qining,

313
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,020
he called Lu Chen

314
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,890
with

315
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,490
a bad attitude.

316
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,190
I'm just worried that

317
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,450
he will be upset if he visits our house.

318
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,760
We'll talk about your father's attitude later.

319
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,370
Let me finish my words first.

320
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,740
Other than him and his sister,

321
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,880
he also has a younger brother and sister.

322
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,710
But, they were not born by the same mother.

323
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,190
When his parents divorced,

324
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,740
his father didn't get married

325
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,500
but had his younger brother

326
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,490
with someone who was living together with him.

327
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,300
His mother remarried

328
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,450
and had a daughter

329
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,500
with her second husband.

330
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,630
After her second husband had passed away,

331
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,590
she remarried his father

332
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,490
and brought her youngest daughter back.

333
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,620
It's so complicated.

334
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,180
Why are you looking at me?

335
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,990
Am I telling the truth?

336
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,320
-Yes.
-Here.

337
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,820
Back in school,

338
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,660
Lu Chen was the most rebellious at home.

339
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,220
He just wanted

340
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,910
to attract his father's attention.

341
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,380
So that his father

342
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,750
would focus on punishing him

343
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,000
and would not bother his sisters.

344
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,290
He never said this before.

345
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,820
That's his temper.

346
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,540
He wouldn't tell anyone but keep it bottled up.

347
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,350
But, it's all in the past.

348
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,650
Now, all four of them

349
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,280
are living their own lives.

350
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,350
Xiaoshan just thinks too much.

351
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,980
But, she's worried about you.

352
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,410
I think that

353
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,080
you don't have to overthink.

354
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,580
No.

355
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,140
Your three sisters and brother-in-law

356
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,490
have been close to you since you were little.

357
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,380
When it relates to a family affair,

358
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,450
my head would also ache.

359
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,480
Their family is even more difficult.

360
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,720
Understand?

361
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,180
You have to think twice.

362
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,980
Be careful.

363
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,369
Is his younger sister

364
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,490
doing well now?

365
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,990
She also studied in the police academy.

366
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,770
She's now a prison guard in Hebei.

367
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:23,540
She rarely comes back.

368
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:25,990
She and Lu Chen...

369
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,060
I guess

370
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,290
both of them want to escape from their family.

371
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,570
He has suffered so much since he was young.

372
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,470
Therefore, I want to marry him as soon as possible

373
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,560
and give him a normal home.

374
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,340
Silly girl.

375
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,690
Honey, I want to eat hot pot.

376
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:51,710
Okay.

377
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,920
I'll get it for you.

378
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:54,660
Is Lu Chen coming?

379
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,040
He's in the police station this week.

380
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,370
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

381
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,700
Today...

382
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,960
is Saturday?

383
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:04,910
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

384
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,270
He's back today.

385
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,240
Take this.

386
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,620
You just remembered?

387
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,880
I was muddleheaded.

388
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,540
See you.

389
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,700
I thought today was Friday.

390
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,220
Bye.

391
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,090
-Okay.
-Take care.

392
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,670
Goodbye.

393
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,850
They look good together.

394
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:19,920
They are both workaholics.

395
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,110
If so, why did you stop her from getting married?

396
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,040
She has never been married yet, so she doesn't know.

397
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,620
As her friend,

398
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,540
I have to help her.

399
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,180
Whether she likes it or not,

400
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,200
I have to remind her.

401
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,180
This is my responsibility

402
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,570
as a friend.

403
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,580
Understand?

404
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,760
When I married you back then,

405
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,260
none of your friends

406
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,680
supported you either.

407
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,940
You're wrong.

408
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,090
Gui Xiao supported me.

409
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,520
I really don't know about this.

410
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,420
When she just went abroad to study,

411
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,540
she told me on the phone,

412
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,640
"Do what makes you happy.

413
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,510
As long as you are happy,

414
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,950
nothing else matters."

415
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,270
Lu Yanchen.

416
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,470
Well.

417
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,890
Let me introduce them to you.

418
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,420
These are my old classmates.

419
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,650
We went to the police academy together.

420
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:21,940
Lu Chen.

421
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,110
Hello, uncle.

422
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:24,450
Lu Yanchen.

423
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:27,610
Gui Yuanshan.

424
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,560
Do you

425
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,400
know each other?

426
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,150
He was my daughter's classmate.

427
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,630
Not really.

428
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:35,990
We were in different grades.

429
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,580
Then, you were her senior.

430
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,220
What a coincidence.

431
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,480
I was about to send them out.

432
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,660
Let's go together.

433
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,250
Let's go.

434
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:52,650
Detachment Leader,

435
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,170
I need to talk with Lu Chen somewhere else.

436
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,340
I want to know

437
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,420
about my daughter's work.

438
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,030
They are good friends.

439
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:01,920
Go ahead.

440
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,170
It's been 11 years.

441
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:15,730
Yes.

442
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,620
You're better than I thought.

443
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:21,680
Thank you.

444
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,700
This profession

445
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,830
is good in all aspects.

446
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,380
But, it's not suitable to get married.

447
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,480
Since you have a better choice,

448
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,100
you should

449
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,990
consider more for your family.

450
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,590
It's not easy for the country

451
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,890
to cultivate someone who can go to the frontline.

452
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,100
I'll work as much as possible.

453
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,740
If I don't work hard,

454
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,580
how can I live up to my brothers

455
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,750
and the old captain

456
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:48,950
who died in advance?

457
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,810
I'm still holding the same opinion.

458
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,140
You two are not suitable for each other.

459
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,020
Then, I can only prove it with time.

460
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:01,880
Prove what?

461
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,070
To prove that we will go to the end.

462
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,000
When he was on a mission in the police academy,

463
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,000
he was injured

464
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,210
and couldn't go to the frontline anymore.

465
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,060
So, he changed his profession.

466
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,720
Today, he came here to give us

467
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,980
the bomb-dismantling devices.

468
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,040
Their enterprise always purchases

469
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,500
the most advanced devices.

470
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,320
By the way,

471
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,490
I have something to discuss with you.

472
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,230
If it's about work,

473
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,500
just give me the order.

474
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,600
There's nothing to discuss.

475
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,110
I'm concerned because

476
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,900
you just told me you're getting married.

477
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,530
Is it a mission going out?

478
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,990
Not really.

479
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,740
The Fourth Brigade

480
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,960
asked us for an instructor.

481
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,070
Previously, we assigned you to take the position.

482
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,300
But, you were somewhere else.

483
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,030
So, we arranged for Miss Gu to replace you.

484
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,490
But,

485
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,980
Miss Gu went to the hospital earlier than expected

486
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,710
to give birth to her child.

487
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,630
It seems that you are destined to go for it.

488
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,350
What's there to discuss?

489
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,420
I'll go there tomorrow.

490
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,960
It doesn't have to be tomorrow.

491
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,420
Take a rest this weekend

492
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:24,970
and go on Monday.

493
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,020
But,

494
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,650
the Fourth Brigade has recruited numerous freshmen recently.

495
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,200
Half of them are new here.

496
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,730
They just graduated.

497
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,780
I want these rookies to take a closed training

498
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,940
for a month.

499
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,200
You'll be very busy.

500
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,540
You can't leave Tianwen for at least a month.

501
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,740
Go back

502
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,410
and discuss it with your girlfriend.

503
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,040
She is just about to be a police officer's wife.

504
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,300
She doesn't know clearly

505
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,870
about the situation here.

506
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,290
At least, she should be mentally prepared in advance.

507
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,570
She can understand.

508
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,130
But, I will also

509
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,030
explain to her.

510
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,920
In the past,

511
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,470
I always thought she could understand me.

512
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,060
So, I didn't explain anything,

513
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:58,890
and it caused a lot of misunderstandings.

514
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,510
That's what I mean.

515
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,900
Even if she has an acute consciousness,

516
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,980
that's her business.

517
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,940
You still have to explain

518
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,430
everything to her.

519
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,720
I've been waiting for you for half an hour.

520
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:31,810
Here.

521
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm going to do my homework.

522
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,080
I'll take a shower with you.

523
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,940
What has stimulated you?

524
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,800
I just want to accompany you.

525
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,760
I can stay longer in the shower with you.

526
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,670
I'll be there on weekends.

527
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,240
It's already

528
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,730
4 p.m. on Saturday.

529
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,440
Captain Lu.

530
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,200
Please understand that.

531
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,400
I understand.

532
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,810
That's why we need to cherish the time

533
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,290
and get along with each other.

534
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,650
What do you mean by getting along with?

535
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,440
I'm talking properly.

536
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,390
Don't get the wrong idea.

537
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,940
The bathroom is not well ventilated.

538
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:15,820
I'm afraid you'll be suffocated.

539
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,820
It's fine.

540
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,320
I'll come out myself if I'm suffocated.

541
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,390
Hurry.

542
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,040
Let me check if you've lost weight.

543
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:44,710
Go on.

544
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,400
Lazybones.

545
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,500
Take it off yourself.

546
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,060
You look smart wearing the clothes.

547
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,210
You're also muscular after taking off the clothes.

548
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,030
Good figure, Captain Lu.

549
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,020
Thank you.

550
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,380
Why don't you take it off?

551
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,690
How many days we haven't seen each other?

552
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,090
Can't you count?

553
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,780

666
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,810

667
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,500

00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,230
Yes.

750
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,370
Kiss.

751
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,130
Shameless.

752
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,179
What should I be afraid of?

753
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,159
I'm not a star.

754
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,090
No one knows me.

755
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,640
Let's talk at home.

756
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:36,890
Lu Chen.

757
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,260
When we first met,

758
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,310
how old were we?

759
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:49,660
You were in Grade 11.

760
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,340
While I was in Grade 12.

761
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,830
I feel so sorry for you.

762
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,190
I thought I had no chance

763
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,450
to say sorry to you.

764
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,370
Although I wanted to break up back then,

765
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,720
I really loved you.

766
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,900
Since I met you,

767
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,050
I have had the same taste for men.

768
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,690
I like people

769
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,890
with beautiful eyes like you.

770
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,340
I like people who don't talk much like you.

771
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,800
I'll get annoyed if I meet someone who talks too much.

772
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,680
I like people like you

773
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,200
who kiss gently

774
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,040
and know how to fix cars.

775
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,560
Although your grades were not as good as mine,

776
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,470
you played billiards well.

777
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,860
Even a hooligan would be afraid of you.

778
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,570
Gui Xiao.

779
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,560
I'm really regretful.

780
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,870
I regret breaking up with you.

781
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,350
I regret it whenever I think about it.

782
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:21,750
I regret it even if I don't think about it.

783
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,230
I'll marry you this month.

784
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,160
Give me some time to arrange it.

785
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,030
We'll book

786
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:32,880
Meng Xiaoshan's restaurant.

787
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,050
Qin Feng will be our witness.

788
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,010
Let's get married.

789
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,530
Let's get married this month.

790
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,130
If so, I'll buy you a big house

791
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,150
to compensate for dumping you.

792
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,610
I'll buy it.

793
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,210
I have money.

794
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,680
Buy it before you get married.

795
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,930
So that it'll be your personal assets.

796
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,210
I can't share it with you.

797
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,120
You know the marriage law too?

798
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,670
I've heard from others before.

799
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,870
You do know what the important one is.

800
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,400
Go to sleep.

801
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,910
I'll go home after you fall asleep.

802
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,030
I'm going to get some water.

803
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,480
Fixing cars again in the middle of the night?

804
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,790
Can I interview you?

805
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,060
Why do you repair the cars

806
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:18,960
every time?

807
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,260
There are usually two reasons.

808
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:23,530
I'm happy,

809
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:24,680
and I'm not.

810
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,730
You can only be either happy

811
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,830
or unhappy.

812
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,710
Not necessarily.

813
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:33,890
Life can be ordinary

814
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,080
and dull.

815
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,780
Or live your life by goofing around.

816
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,700
So, today, you are...

817
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:43,480
Happy.

818
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,200
You're better at repairing cars than others.

819
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,440
Can you teach me?

820
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,820
I've always wanted to learn.

821
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,900
But to be an apprentice,

822
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,260
I won't get paid at first.

823
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,390
I also don't dare to resign from my job here

824
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,930
as I am the breadwinner.

825
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,190
How old are you?

826
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,710
23 years old.

827
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:12,970
You're still young.

828
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,250
With one more skill,

829
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,460
you'll have one more way to go.

830
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,440
Alright.

831
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,200
Call me Master.

832
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,530
You're willing to teach me?

833
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,980
I'll teach you when I'm free.

834
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:26,340
I'm usually too busy.

835
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:26,920
Sure.

836
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:27,620
Thank you, Master.

837
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,010
Master, here.

838
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,760
The chef is here so early.

839
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,290
I want a double-sided fried egg.

840
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,550
Don't make the yolk too dry.

841
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,080
What about you?

842
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,060
I have no requirements.

843
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,280
It's rare that the chef is at home.

844
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,490
If you don't make a request today, you'll have to wait until next week.

845
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,530
Not just next week.

846
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,990
I have a female colleague

847
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,720
who was going to be an instructor in the Fourth Brigade.

848
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,780
But, the expected date of delivery is ahead of schedule.

849
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,230
She's going to the hospital to give birth to her child.

850
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:12,930
I have to replace her

851
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,540
for a month.

852
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,520
It's so hard to be a police officer's wife.

853
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,330
What?

854
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,980
Do you want to break off the engagement?

855
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,590
You've already married me.

856
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,690
No way I can go back on my word.

857
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,210
I'm a man of my word.

858
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:33,920
Besides,

859
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,160
you're not fooling around.

860
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,350
I'm willing to donate half of my husband

861
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,580
for the country.
