[Episode 6]

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,830
It feels good.

5
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,110
I can switch with you if you want.

6
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,740
No need.

7
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,750
You're already dying.

8
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,570
How can I profit from your misfortunes?

9
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,600
Who's dying?

10
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,340
Where are you going?

11
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,070
Should I leave the door unlocked for you tonight?

12
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,079
Look how anxious he is.

13
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,430
Hello?

14
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,380
I saw a car parked

15
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,640
outside the car garage.

16
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,700
It looks familiar.

17
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,130
Tell me the car plate number.

18
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,760
Beijing Z52968.

19
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,820
Isn't this Meng Xiaoshan's car?

20
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,540
Was it stolen?

21
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,110
Or she just parked it randomly?

22
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,250
Let me call her.

23
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,320
Give me Meng Xiaoshan's phone number.

24
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,120
I'll call her.

25
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,660
Okay.

26
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,850
Gui Xiao, do you still care about him?

27
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,590
I mean it.

28
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,780
Let's say

29
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,780
without Zhao Minshan,

30
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
what would you do?

31
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,070
I don't want to talk about him.

32
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,390
Stubborn.

33
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,630
Did you renovate this place?

34
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,579
Yes.

35
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,430
Owning a restaurant means you need to renovate it frequently.

36
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,620
Otherwise, if it's too run-down,

37
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,560
it's not suitable for a banquet

38
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,690
or a wedding dinner.

39
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,500
What do you want to eat?

40
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,100
Tell me.

41
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,750
Lamb spine.

42
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,340
Fine.

43
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,540
It's just that you will have a bad smell after eating.

44
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,100
I'll take a shower at your place.

45
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,140
Sure.

46
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:37,980
Liu.

47
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,860
Prepare the lamb spine with high-quality ingredients.

48
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,720
Extreme spicy.

49
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,190
Okay.

50
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,360
Let's go.

51
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,340
Do you want to eat or play?

52
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,900
If you want to play,

53
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,800
I'll turn off the fire for you.

54
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,659
Take your time.

55
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,690
I feel like I'm possessed.

56
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,560
In Qining,

57
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,910
my friend's car was stolen.

58
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,670
I asked him for help.

59
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,140
Later, those thieves

60
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,340
came to take revenge.

61
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,210
He taught them a lesson.

62
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,250
So we got in touch.

63
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,430
Did you make up?

64
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,530
No.

65
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,260
He asked me to deal with

66
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,520
the school transfer procedure for a kid.

67
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,940
You know Lu Chen.

68
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,610
He's always unbowed.

69
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,590
He asked me for help.

70
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,390
I thought he gave in

71
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,140
and wanted to give us

72
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,500
a chance to start over.

73
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,180
I found out recently

74
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,280
he's getting married.

75
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,210
Liu.

76
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,980
Serve a bottle of white liquor later.

77
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,640
Wuliangye.

78
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,650
Okay, boss.

79
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,030
Where is my husband?

80
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,220
He's still in the gathering.

81
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,140
Ask him to come over

82
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,860
after dinner.

83
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,270
Okay.

84
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,640
You're here.

85
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,840
The car is parked by the river.

86
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,620
After dinner,

87
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,820
help me drive it back.

88
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,970
Why is it stopped by the river?

89
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,810
Gui Xiao is not feeling well.

90
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,240
I helped her drive back.

91
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,580
What happened?

92
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,210
Was your sister

93
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,600
bullied by others?

94
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,820
Lu Chen.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,940
Lu Chen?

96
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,440
They had a deep affection, didn't they?

97
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,740
I just took her back

98
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,340
by the river.

99
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,020
I've been persuading her for a long time.

100
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,860
I thought

101
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,690
she was upset

102
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,740
because she suddenly found out

103
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,420
her first love was getting married

104
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,750
with our old classmate.

105
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,260
I didn't expect that

106
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,120
they had met each other in Qining.

107
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,400
It's really complicated.

108
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,930
I can't make up my mind now.

109
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,700
What mind?

110
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,390
Just say what you should.

111
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,340
Gui Xiao.

112
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,390
You are almost 30 years old.

113
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,560
In ancient times,

114
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,180
you're considered to have been through half of your life.

115
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,860
She's an adult.

116
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,860
Yet you still treat her like a child.

117
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:21,930
Fine.

118
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,150
I won't be a parent anymore.

119
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:25,580
Gui Xiao.

120
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,780
I didn't tell you just now

121
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,540
because I didn't want you to

122
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,740
get involved in this.

123
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,380
A few days ago,

124
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,810
Hai Dong borrowed hundreds of thousands from me.

125
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,140
Do you know who it is for?

126
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,150
It's for Lu Chen.

127
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,890
About two years ago,

128
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,900
the car garage of Lu Chen's father

129
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,100
was not doing well.

130
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,260
So he borrowed some money

131
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,980
from Zhao Minshan's family

132
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,500
to lubricate the relationships

133
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,440
with the nearby car retail shops

134
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,770
and insurance companies

135
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,370
and expanded the car garage.

136
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,540
Only with that, the business was rejuvenated.

137
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,420
At that time, Zhao Minshan's family

138
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,340
wanted to become a shareholder and share the bonus.

139
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,730
Lu Chen's father disagreed.

140
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,190
Then, Zhao Minshan's family took the IOU

141
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,320
and asked him to pay.

142
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,980
Pay them both the principal and interest.

143
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,940
This old man

144
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,930
did nothing good in his life.

145
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,160
Since he has borrowed the money,

146
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,290
it's reasonable to pay back the money.

147
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,590
But it's not sensible or even legal

148
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,390
to accept them as shareholders.

149
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,910
Whether it's borrowing money or becoming a shareholder,

150
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,060
it turns out to be a stalemate between them.

151
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,060
It took a long time

152
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,920
before

153
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,900
Zhao Minshan's parents

154
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,390
came up with an idea.

155
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,780
They suggested two families could be in-laws.

156
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,360
As long as Lu Yanchen's father

157
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,909
agreed,

158
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,860
he didn't have to pay back the money.

159
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,059
He could also spare the betrothal gift.

160
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,330
Zhao Minshan agreed immediately

161
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,370
after she heard the name of Lu Chen.

162
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,179
That's how the marriage is formed.

163
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:46,420
Did Lu Chen agree too?

164
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,280
He didn't know it at all.

165
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,140
He had been kept in the dark.

166
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,930
His dad is indeed a dressed-up beast.

167
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,300
Not only didn't he repay the loan, but he also didn't pay the bonus.

168
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,580
He just mortgaged his own son

169
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,280
to the lenders.

170
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,020
After Lu Chen had known about this,

171
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,100
he borrowed money

172
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,580
from others immediately

173
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,620
and asked a favour

174
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,280
from many people to persuade the other

175
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,610
to cancel the marriage.

176
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,620
Honey, you continue.

177
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,370
I'm thirsty.

178
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,450
Lu Chen asked me to be the peacemaker.

179
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,180
In my early years,

180
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,590
I had some interactions

181
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,450
with Zhao Minshan's family.

182
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,310
We did a lot of business together.

183
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,170
So I avoided Lu Chen's family

184
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,460
and talked to

185
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,030
Zhao Minshan's family.

186
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,810
They agreed.

187
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,300
With two conditions.

188
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,700
First,

189
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,580
pay the one million yuan back.

190
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,210
Second, Lu Chen has to find an excuse

191
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,780
so that the Zhao family

192
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,730
will not be embarrassed.

193
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,990
Lu Chen

194
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,280
didn't bargain at all.

195
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,140
He said

196
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,840
he didn't want the betrothal gift back

197
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,300
but he would pay another 100,000 yuan to the Zhao family.

198
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,910
Lu Chen, Zhao Minshan's parents

199
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,760
and I

200
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,220
discussed this matter together.

201
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,220
I didn't involve Lu Chen's family

202
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,700
and Zhao Minshan.

203
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,620
Lu Chen and I also

204
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,480
had a close relationship before.

205
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,730
But this time,

206
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,420
I'll be by your side.

207
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,830
I've asked Hai Dong indirectly.

208
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,290
If he clears the loan,

209
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,380
his savings

210
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,430
will be all gone.

211
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,800
Moreover, 400,000 of the external debt is left.

212
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,300
Gui Xiao.

213
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,940
This time, the initiative

214
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,870
is in your hands.

215
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,180
Don't act impulsively.

216
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,510
You have to think twice.

217
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,740
Look at you.

218
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,540
What are you doing?

219
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,000
Who are you talking about?

220
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,950
Forget it. Fine.

221
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,950
I won't blame you.

222
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,440
Lu Chen is a nice person.

223
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,380
All these years,

224
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,570
among these kids,

225
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,900
I only favour him.

226
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,440
How high a person will reach? It depends on opportunities.

227
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,240
How far he will go? It depends on his moral quality.

228
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,390
Don't throw Gui Xiao

229
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,760
under the bus, okay?

230
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,660
I don't even want to

231
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,520
talk about the mess of his family.

232
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,520
Be fair.

233
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,630
Gui Xiao is perfect.

234
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,990
Every Jack has his Jill.

235
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,790
Who does Lu Chen think he is?

236
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,910
He devoted himself

237
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,620
and spent ten years

238
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,130
protecting the country.

239
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,330
Who do you think he is?

240
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,170
Fine, I'll stop.

241
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,420
But don't just compliment him.

242
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,380
Let's be fair.

243
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,200
If I don't say something,

244
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,930
it'll be really unfair to him.

245
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,780
Fine. By the way,

246
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,280
marriage is a big deal.

247
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,230
It's easy for girls to suffer losses.

248
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,460
You should have deep consideration.

249
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,460
That's all I said.

250
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,860
I won't get involved.

251
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,310
Gui Xiao.

252
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,500
Never mind.

253
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,220
I just

254
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,100
suddenly thought of

255
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,300
when I was in college,

256
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,160
I only ate two buns every day.

257
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,330
Apart from him,

258
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,370
I haven't fallen in love with others.

259
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,270
Not a single one.

260
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,230
If we miss each other this time,

261
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,980
I don't want to get married anymore.

262
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,540
I can live as usual.

263
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,730
Marriage is not a necessity.

264
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,540
Isn't that

265
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,790
how you've been through?

266
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,050
That's why I advise you

267
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,420
to be careful.

268
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,300
Hello, who is this?

269
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,190
I'm Lu Chen.

270
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,140
Hold on.

271
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,590
I'll go somewhere quiet.

272
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,050
Hold on.

273
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,260
What's up?

274
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,930
Gui Xiao had a fight with me just now.

275
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,950
She drove away from the car garage.

276
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,120
I was worried about her

277
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,650
and I wanted to find her.

278
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,730
I saw your car

279
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,030
parked by the river.

280
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,540
Is she at your place?

281
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,430
Yes, she is.

282
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,530
What did you do to her?

283
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
Why is she crying?

284
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,470
Don't play dumb.

285
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:56,860
I thought...

286
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,180
What did you think?

287
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,900
You thought she didn't love you.

288
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,100
If she doesn't love you,

289
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,730
why would she

290
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,060
travel so far to Qining?

291
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,880
Yes, Qining has a beautiful view.

292
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,100
Gui Xiao went there

293
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,250
to enjoy the scenery

294
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,580
and visit

295
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,710
you, her first love.

296
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,700
Where is she now?

297
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,760
She's in my restaurant.

298
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,550
Don't come over just yet.

299
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,760
Think carefully about

300
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,660
whether you want to start again.

301
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,880
Think about your situation.

302
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,070
And your parents.

303
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,710
You are not teens anymore.

304
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,470
You need to think about your family.

305
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,460
Have a deep consideration before you come to her.

306
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,740
She's not going home today anyway.

307
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,420
She's either in my restaurant

308
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,260
or at my home.

309
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,290
I'm hanging up.

310
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,260
You scared me.

311
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,600
They love each other.

312
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,180
Can you not interfere

313
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,140
in their affair?

314
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,340
I know.

315
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,940
You don't know.

316
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,500
When they broke up,

317
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,120
both of them had a breakdown,

318
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,640
just like they were dying.

319
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,020
I'm afraid they would repeat the same mistake.

320
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,480
Did you come to Beijing

321
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,730
for the winter break?

322
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,640
No.

323
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,600
I transferred here to study

324
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,060
and stay with Uncle Lu.

325
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:52,980
Why?

326
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,790
Because my dad

327
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,230
is Uncle Lu's comrade.

328
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,660
But he can't leave his son

329
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,390
to stay here.

330
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,860
Lu Chen.

331
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:08,950
Lu Chen!

332
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,340
I'm calling you. Didn't you hear me?

333
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:15,980
What is it?

334
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,630
That kid.

335
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,660
He said he wanted to study in Beijing

336
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,920
and stay at your house.

337
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,460
Yes.

338
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,200
I disagree.

339
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,150
That's my own business.

340
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,140
These are my cousin's clothes.

341
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,540
You both wear the extra small size.

342
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,600
It fits perfectly.

343
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,220
I noticed you had renovated the outside.

344
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:48,930
Yes.

345
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,790
My parents thought the house was too run-down.

346
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,500
They also thought I kept bothering them.

347
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,980
So I asked my friend to make a design for

348
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,240
the house and the yard.

349
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,240
But it's not much different

350
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,220
from the past.

351
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,260
I really like the layout of your house-

352
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,720
it's detached with a yard.

353
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:13,780
Are you jealous?

354
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,420
This is the benefit of living outside the Fifth Ring.

355
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,060
People like you,

356
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,460
who rent a house in the city centre,

357
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,660
can't live so freely.

358
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,500
Do you still keep the pool table?

359
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,260
Of course.

360
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,060
This is the first gift

361
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,920
my dad sent to me

362
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,590
when I got into high school.

363
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,780
Your dad was afraid that

364
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,580
you would hang out with Hai Dong.

365
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:36,690
Yes.

366
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,260
My dad is really good at scheming.

367
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,820
Unfortunately, he didn't expect that

368
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,750
I was the one who wanted to break up.

369
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,180
I'll get some water.

370
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,110
Set up the balls.

371
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,670
Meng Xiaoshan.

372
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,750
Why did you come here?

373
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,590
I want to see her.

374
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,750
It depends on whether she's willing or not.

375
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,190
Ask her for me.

376
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,360
OK. Wait here.

377
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,160
Lu Chen is here.

378
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,020
Do you want to see him?

379
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,270
There are many eyes out there.

380
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,860
After cancelling the marriage,

381
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,190
it must be troublesome.

382
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,340
If you want to talk,

383
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,670
you can talk at my house.

384
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:48,740
I let him in.

385
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,460
What should I say?

386
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,310
We were quite unhappy just now.

387
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,300
It's so awkward to meet him.

388
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,340
Listen, Gui Xiao.

389
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,620
I didn't tell him.

390
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,770
But he was smart.

391
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,810
He saw an empty car

392
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,940
at the intersection by the river.

393
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,060
Then he asked who has that car plate number.

394
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,520
Then he knew you were here.

395
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,520
So you don't have to say anything.

396
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,760
Just listen to him.

397
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,070
I'll get him in.

398
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,390
Go in.

399
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,100
You two have a good talk.

400
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,240
Thank you.

401
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:37,810
Lu Chen.

402
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,740
Be gentle with her.

403
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,370
I'll only help you this time.

404
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,570
Thank you.

405
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,960
If you weren't handsome,

406
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,360
and it's not for the sake of Gui Xiao,

407
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,760
I wouldn't help you once.

408
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,820
Kitty.

409
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,060
Sit.

410
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,360
Sit.

411
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,880
Shake hands.

412
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:15,740
Kitty.

413
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,540
Kitty.

414
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,960
Do you still remember him?

415
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,140
The last time he saw you,

416
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,800
you were only a few months old.

417
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,890
But you still remember him.

♫When I first saw you, my heart lost its defenses♫

419
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,870
Things between Zhao Minshan and me are complicated.

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,540
But it's not what you think.

421

♫I thought about the future♫

422

♫I've been wandering alone for a long time♫

427

What did he say to you?

454
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,420
He said

455
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,600
the problem would be solved soon.

456
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,410
That's all?

457
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,110
What is his feeling for you?

458
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,640
Does he want to make up?

459
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,270
He didn't say.

460
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,820
But now,

461
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,080
he can't say that.

462
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,910
Anyway, he's going to get married.

463
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,460
Make it up if you break it.

464
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,450
Fine.

465
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,640

Did Gui Xiao

469
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,920
drug you with ecstasy?

470
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,740
We've known each other for years.

471
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,940
She only accompanied you for a few days.

472
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:57,700
I like her.

473
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,940
I like her!

474

I want to cry when I see her cry.

475
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,850
Aunt Gui Xiao treats me well.

476
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,940
She even helped me find a school.

477
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:11,740
Uncle Lu,

478
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,830
there's really something wrong with you.

479
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,210
Let's not talk about

480
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,490
my personality first.

481
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,830
We can discuss it later.

482
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,790
But

483
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,140
you liking my wife

484
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,770
is a very serious crime.

485
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,730
If you do it again,

486
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,790
I'll kick you back.

487
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,660
Do you hear me?

488
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,480
Did Aunt Gui Xiao buy it for you?

489
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,750
It's a gift for the Spring Festival.

490
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,010
You just said

491
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,840
you went to find Aunt Gui Xiao this afternoon.

492
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,590
Is that true?

493
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,880
Mind your own business.

494
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,510
Where are you going?

495
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:57,970
To cook.

496
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
You're so frugal.

497
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,980
We're only two people.

498
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,300
How much more do you want?

499
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,200
I'm also here.

500
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,560
I came here hungry.

501
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,140
Who asked you to come?

502
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,820
You called me and inquire about Meng Xiaoshan.

503
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,700
How could I not come?

504
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,960
That was my first love.

505
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,380
Whose child is this?

506
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,190
Is it yours?

507
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,220
My dad is Uncle Lu's

508
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,060
comrade.

509
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,940
Uncle Lu

510
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,470
can only have one comrade.

511
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,460
That's me.

512
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Behave yourself.

513
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,760
I'm glad to see you.

514
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,660
When are you going to report yourself to the new unit?

515
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,330
Tomorrow.

516
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,330
Then you can't drink, right?

517
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:44,540
Okay.

518
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,210
Have some food.

519
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:49,690
Here.

520
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,580
Ask Uncle Liu

521
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,440
to bring a bowl of peanuts here.

522
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,910
How was the talk with Gui Xiao?

523
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,640
Did you explain clearly to her?

524
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,690
Almost.

525
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,040
What do you mean by almost?

526
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,420

Meng Xiaoshan's 400,000 yuan

530

has been transferred to my account.

531
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,710
I bought you an investment product.

532
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,460
When you

533
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,220
have made an agreement with them,

534
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,950
I'll transfer the money to you.

535
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,770
What is an investment product?

536
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,300
If you deposit the money,

537
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,340
you will gain interest.

538
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,910
Haven't you bought it before?

539
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,380
No.

540
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,120
I always save with a fixed deposit.

the brand of this suitcase?

544
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,730
It must be expensive.

545
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,020
Yes.

546
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,350
It's expensive.

547
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,660

552
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,100
Don't bother the people in the garage

553

If he vomits,

557
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,080
get him a basin.

558
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,420
Otherwise, leave him alone.

559
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,180

561
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,130
It takes some time to come back and forth.

562
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,400
I'll visit you during the holidays.

563
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,660
Take care of yourself.

564
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,470
Got it.

for me being a SWAT's family member.

567
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,940
You don't need to remind me.

568

If someone

00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,420
If you have any trouble,

572
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,350
find that person

573
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,580
or Grandpa Qian and Grandpa Liu

574
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,380
in the garage.

575
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,100
Don't look for Aunt Gui Xiao.

576
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,190
Got it.

577
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:23,940
Take this.

578
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,920
When I get my salary this month,

579
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,120
I'll buy you a new one.

580
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,540
No need. This is good enough.

581
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,110
I'm leaving.

582
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,640
Eat up.

583
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:37,910
Take care.

584
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:43,830
[SWAT Detachment of Tianwen City Public Security Bureau]

585
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,180
Captain Lu.

586
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,940
Lu Yanchen, from the Third Brigade

587
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,210
of SWAT Detachment of Tianwen City Public Security Bureau,

588
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,210
is here to report.

589
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,910
Welcome, Lu.

590
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,380
We met before.

591
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,820
Do you remember?

592
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,860
Last time when you went to Beijing for a report,

593
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,860
I was an audience.

594
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,380
I remember.

595
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,190
Let's go. I'll show you the base.

596
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,330
Let's go.

597
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:30,940
Smell it.

598
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:31,900
Lie down.

599
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,250
Go. Come down.

600
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:36,720
Hurry.

601
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,680
Okay, sit down.

602
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,570
Come on.

603
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,670
OK. Go.

604
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,770
Okay, let's go.

605
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,910
Hurry up.

606
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,470
This is the police dog squadron.

607
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,950
By the way,

608
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,870
I heard the sniffer dog you trained

609
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,790
in Qining

610
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,280
had done a great job.

611
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,900
That's right.

612
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,540
It's more famous than me.

613
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,280
It is a legend in Qining.

614
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,010
You...

615
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,420
Chief of the Brigade.

616
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,350
You're here.

617
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,570
Let me introduce him.

618
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,340
This is Lin Nan,

619
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,890
the Deputy Captain of the Third Brigade.

620
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,320
This is your new captain,

621
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,200
Lu Yanchen.

622
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,780
He is an EOD hero,

623
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,690
and I spent great efforts recruiting him.

624
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,350
Captain Lu.

625
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,470
I've heard a lot about you.

626
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,130
Same to you.

627
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,070
Alright.

628
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,590
You two may

629
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,980
express your admiration after work.

630
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,920
Are the new members here?

631
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,250
Yes.

632
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,420
What a coincidence.

633
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,650
They arrived the same day as Captain Lu.

634
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,140
Our brigade

635
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,200
has 12 new members.

636
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:37,830
Perfect.

637
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,660
Take Captain Lu to meet them.

638
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,380
Yes.

639
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,610
Let's go.

640
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,900
There are 48 members in the Third Brigade,

641
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,280
grouped by three squadrons.

642
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,160
The First Squadron and Second Squadron

643
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,210
are now training separately at the base.

644
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,740
I'll introduce them later.

645
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,610
The 12 new members

646
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,150
are newly assigned.

647
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,710
Normally, how many people

648
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,840
are there in a group?

649
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,310
Usually, five or six people are in a group.

650
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,020
That's how they group

651
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,300
in the First Squadron and Second Squadron.

652
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,620
One, two, one.

653
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,820
One, two, one.

654
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,500
One, two, one.

655
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,080
Salute.

656
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,780
Everyone,

657
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,830
I'm the captain of the Third Brigade,

658
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,720
Lu Yanchen.

659
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,300
Where is Mr Wu?

660
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,500
I have no idea.

661
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,860
Didn't we make an appointment at this time?

662
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,390
The flight is at 12:00 p.m..

663
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,540
It's still early.

664
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:39,630
Sorry.

665
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,390
I'm late for buying breakfast.

666
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,820
Boss, you're too greedy.

667
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,300
No, I've eaten.

668
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,160
This is for you.

669
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,540
Thank you.

670
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,210
Let's go.

671
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,070
You are new members.

672
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,790
I'm the new captain.

673
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,420
As the saying goes,

674
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,980
ring out the old, ring in the new.

675
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,180
It's a fate

676
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,240
for us to report here

677
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,100
in the last week

678
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,390
before the Spring Festival.

679
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,050
That means we can celebrate the Spring Festival together.

680
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,470
It's our first meeting.

681
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,260
You don't have to be so serious.

682
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,900
You are allowed to talk.

683
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,560
Captain Lu.

684
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,660
Will you treat us to dinner during the Spring Festival?

685
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:15,990
Sure.

686
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,350
Let's have dinner together on New Year's Eve.

687
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,610
Thank you, Captain Lu.

688
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:21,990
After the introduction,

689
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,610
and also being exploited by you,

690
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,340
now let's get back to business.

691
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,300
Stand at ease.

692
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,560
Attention!

693
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,520
Before you came,

694
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,090
you were all top-grade students in the police academy.

695
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,260
The EOD

696
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,140
requires practical

697
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,270
and professional skills.

698
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,530
In the police academy,

699
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,820
you don't learn in a specialized way.

700
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,520
Just like what you are now.

701
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,900
But as you reach here,

702
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,900
the instructor

703
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,160
will teach you by hand.

704
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,110
Those with good qualifications

705
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,620
can become junior EOD technicians

706
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,280
after a three-year training.

707
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,650
In three to five years of practice,

708
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,740
they can become senior EOD technicians.

709
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,020
That is, an EOD expert.

710
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,140
The biggest difference

711
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,510
between EOD and other professions

712
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,100
is that we can only succeed

713
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,400
and not fail.

714
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,700
Not even a single mistake

715
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,840
is allowed.

716
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,000
Although we have EOD suits,

717
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,860
it can only block

718
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,800
the TNT explosion

719
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,260
in less than one kilogram.

720
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,590
And it has to be three meters away.

721
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,600
In other words,

722
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,260
if the dosage is a little,

723
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,020
you are lucky to have your dead body left.

724
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,350
If it is a large dose,

725
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,310
there's nothing left.

726
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,330
Are you scared?

727
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,580
It's our first meeting.

728
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,910
You are allowed to talk.

729
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,130
Of course not.

730
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,270
This is our profession.

731
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,470
Yes, Captain Lu.

732
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,750
This is what we do.

733
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,790
Alright.

734
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,830
I'm done with the nagging.

735
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:57,780
One more.

736
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,920
I want to tell you personally.

737
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,540
When I joined the team,

738
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,240
the old captain

739
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,650
gave us a motto.

740
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,260
Hope you can find

741
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,920
the sentence you want to write

742
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,090
at the end of your last letters.

743
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,050
It's very motivating.

744
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,940
What did Captain Lu say?

745
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,139
Thousands of firecrackers and thousands of blood.

746
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,270
Every inch of land is valuable as gold.

747
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,949
I'll take this line.

748
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,620
Is there anything new, Captain Lu?

749
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,080
Yes.

750
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,880
Tell us more.

751
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,219
There are so many of us.

752
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,540
We don't have enough last words.

753
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,070
It's hard to lead a team now.

754
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:33,350
I even have to provide them with multiple choices for their last words.

755
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,150
Stand at ease.

756
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:35,840
Attention!

757
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,940
Two sentences.

758
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,219
But same meaning.

759
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,989
I hope you will never use them.

760
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,560
I shall dedicate myself to the interests of the country in life and death

761
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,760
irrespective of personal weal and woe.

762
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:47,780
Or

763
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,980
I'll sacrifice my life for the nation

764
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,580
and regard death as a return.

765
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:55,690
Form the EOD groups

766
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,730
with three members in each

767
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,990
in alphabetical order by initials.

768
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,780
See you in the field in three minutes.

769
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,080
Yes.

770
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,740
Leader Xu.

771
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,070
This is the list.

772
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,260
You are responsible for grouping quickly.

773
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,320
Go to the field now.

774
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,610
Descend quickly.

775
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,510
Change into the EOD suit

776
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,770
and practice going up the stairs quickly.

777
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:17,830
And come back to me.

778
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:18,570
Sir.

779
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,180
Isn't there a time limit?

780
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:21,780
Not today.

781
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,580
I want to

782
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,310
examine your physical fitness

783
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,000
and record them.

784
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,660
It would be the first stroke

785
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,060
you leave at the training base today.

786
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,660
This is stricter than the usual requirements.

787
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,840
The last place

788
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,300
will clean all the EOD suits worn today.

789
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:43,640
Action!

790
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,230
The suits are heavy.

791
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,210
EOD suits

792
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,300
are more than 35 kilograms.

793
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,360
Just get used to it.

794
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,310
Cut it.

795
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,340
No way.

796
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,060
My hands are trembling.

797
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,550
In critical moments,

798
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,700
you will be exhausted and sweated all over.

799
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,660
You will even face

800
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,720
attack, shooting,

801
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,530
and gunfire.

802
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,700
But your fingers

803
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,500
must be the steadiest.

804
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,930
This is the first time

805
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:40,930
you wear EOD suits

806
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,860
and go upstairs quickly.

807
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,800
From now on,

808
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:44,900
you have training

809
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,730
wearing EOD suits whilst overcoming obstacles,

810
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,940
passing stairs, short walls,

811
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,220
holes, narrow passages,

812
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,550
dark rooms, and others.

813
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,540
You have to overcome all obstacles

814
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,600
and get to the bomb.

815
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,040
And your hands

816
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,030
still have to be steady.

817
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,060
This is your class schedule.

818
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,100
The morning session is the basic training

819
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,210
for the SWAT detachment,

820
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,140
including physical and shooting.

821
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,580
During the afternoon, you will have EOD training.

822
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,260
Although I'm your instructor,

823
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,540
I have to work on missions

824
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,230
and be on duty.

825
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,160
I have my own job.

826
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,290
I can't be at the base at any time.

827
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,160
Now we have

828
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,900
five EOD instructors.

829
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,970
I'm mainly responsible

830
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,650
for the combat exercises with robots

831
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,310
and making and dismantling explosive devices.

832
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,860
Not only do we have to learn about dismantling,

833
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,630
but we also have to learn about making?

834
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,690
All the explosives devices in the base

835
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,850
are basically made by the former trainee

836
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,000
and instructors.

837
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,930
If you don't know how to make it

838
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,260
and also the principle,

839
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,460
how could you know how to dismantle it?

840
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,180
Are you not going home this weekend?

841
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,270
Bye.

842
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,600
Captain Lu.

843
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,710
Captain Lu.

844
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,970
You forgot something.

845
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:07,770
I just made it

846
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,250
for you to dismantle.

847
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,240
No explosives.

848
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,180
Don't worry.

849
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,180
Lu Chen is back.

850
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,460
You came back

851
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,830
to get married after New Year, didn't you?

852
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:40,370
No.

853
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,970
It's a normal work transfer.

854
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,250
That's all.

855
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,460
Chinese New Year is around the corner. That's too little.

856
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,520
You will need those when you visit your father-in-law.

857
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,280
Two more boxes of this.

858
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:01,930
Okay.

859
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,380
Why do you buy so many

860
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,650
for just yourself and a kid?

861
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,850
I bought them for you.

862
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,500
Why are you wasting money?

863
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,690
I have food at home.

864
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,600
It's New Year.

865
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,860
It's reasonable

866
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,050
for a brother to buy something for his sister.

867
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:18,580
Besides,

868
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,240
our parents don't care about you.

869
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,170
As your brother,

870
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,420
if I don't do anything,

871
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,550
people will gossip.

872
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,540
The password is your birthday.

873
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,670
It's just that I don't have much money.

874
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,300
I've only saved 20,000 after I got married.

875
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:37,710
No need.

876
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,170
Your brother-in-law knows about it.

877
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,180
And the money is not for you.

878
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,770
You have to give it back to me

879
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:45,900
when you get better.

880
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:46,980
No need.

881
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,230
As long as you live a good life,

882
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,720
I can solve my own problem.

883
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,380
You are my brother...

884
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,460
Come and eat.

885
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,720
Let's eat.

886
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,210
Mum said Zhao Minshan came over to our house

887
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,210
and cried loudly.

888
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,190
Dad was so angry.

889
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,980
Did dad come to you?

890
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,800
I have an appointment

891
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,460
with them.

892
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,700
Why didn't you tell me?

893
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,370
Drive back. I'll accompany you.

894
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,140
Dad treats you not better than treating me,

895
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:31,870
even worse.

896
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,100
If you go,

897
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,260
do you still want to go home?

898
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,460
But what if you go there, and dad hit you?

899
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:37,860
He won't.
