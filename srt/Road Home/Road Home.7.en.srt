00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:37,700
[Episode 7]

4
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,740
Mom said Zhao Minshan came to our house

5
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,570
and cried.

6
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,710
Dad was so angry.

7
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,580
Did dad come to you?

8
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,460
I told mom and dad I want to

9
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,660
have a talk with them.

10
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,320
Why didn't you tell me?

11
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,729
Drive back. I'll go with you.

12
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,390
Dad won't treat you any better.

13
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,490
Or even worse.

14
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,110
If you go with me,

15
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,940
I suppose he won't let you go home ever after.

16
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,660
But what if he hits you again?

17
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,710
No, he won't.

18
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,780
I'm not a kid anymore.

19
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,020
Besides, he's old.

20
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,870
He can't hit me anymore.

21
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,290
You protected me when I was young.

22
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,490
You are still the one protecting me when I'm grown up.

23
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,220
As your older sister,

24
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,350
I'm really useless.

25
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,550
Alright.

26
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,180
Don't cry.

27
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,579
Or my brother-in-law would think I treated you badly

28
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,940
when we go back home.

29
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,270
He won't.

30
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,760
Sister.

31
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,350
We're almost there.

32
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,500
I'll find a place

33
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,360
to drop you off.

34
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,990
I'm afraid it'll be too late when I get back.

35
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:40,640
Got it, Captain Lu.

36
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,060
We know your dad well.

37
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,520
Just tell us honestly.

38
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,040
We're all here.

39
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,330
We can handle it.

40
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,820
Who will you celebrate the New Year with?

41
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,600
Who else?

42
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,550
Just myself.

43
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,000
What?

44
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,260
You alone?

45
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,540
I'm not going home this year.

46
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,960
Shall I stay at your place?

47
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,940
Sure.

48
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,820
You really mean it?

49
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,710
Come straight to the point.

50
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,170
What are you trying to say?

51
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,280
I remember someone's first love

52
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,340
is back to Beijing.

53
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,620
You aren't going to see each other during the New Year break?

54
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,940
What a rare holiday!

55
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,620
Hello, sir.

56
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,540
What would you like to drink?

57
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,300
Pu'er tea, thank you.

58
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,660
OK.

59
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,260
What's up?

60
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,820
Didn't you have enough for lunch?

61
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,980
No, I was busy talking about business.

62
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,180
So I just had a little.

63
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,750
You can't just eat this.

64
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,940
Waiter, please bring me the menu.

65
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,540
No, no, no.

66
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,090
Don't bother.

67
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,930
I'm hungry too. Let's eat together.

68
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,700
Lobster pasta.

69
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,560
Your favorite.

70
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,390
Get out.

71
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,220
Who let you in?

72
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,409
You can't even serve the dishes properly.

73
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,980
He's too drunk to recognize anyone.

74
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,580
I didn't dare to tell your dad

75
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,659
that you don't want to get married.

76
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:57,850
Zhao.

77
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,670
Let's drink.

78
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,920
In business,

79
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,310
taste matters the most.

80
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,740
When I was young,

81
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,470
my taste was well-recognized.

82
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,480
Am I right?

83
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,540
Yes.

84
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,220
After the renovation,

85
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,130
the business will be here soon.

86
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,660
I am aware that

87
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,300
the older I am,

88
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,780
the luckier I am.

89
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,930
We haven't fully reached an agreement with Qin Feng.

90
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,260
We can still negotiate.

91
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,640
Maybe

92
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,550
Lu Chen is unhappy

93
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,440
to be arranged.

94
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,790
You two

95
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,060
get to know each other more.

96
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,840
You used to be classmates.

97
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,700
it's much easier to cultivate a relationship.

98
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,050
My son is here.

99
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,760
I thought

100
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,460
no one could invite you to come.

101
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,060
This kid

102
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,190
has never been home since he was transferred back.

103
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,720
I don't know where he lives.

104
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,780
His temper has improved.

105
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,140
With two rats hanging around his waist,

106
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,000
others would think he is a hunter.

107
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,670
Well, you're now thoughtful enough

108
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,330
to make a toast to your in-law.

109
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,560
Say something.

110
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

111
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,260
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,500
I must break off the engagement.

113
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,420
You dare to repeat

114
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,480
what you just said?

115
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,460
I must break off the engagement.

116
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,780
How dare you!

117
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,940
Do you think I dare not beat you?

118
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,420
Kid

119
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,350
-I… -Uncle Sanxing, what are you doing?

120
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,420
-Calm down. -You…

121
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,740
How can you pour wine on your son?

122
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,470
Go away.

123
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,110
I...

124
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,100
Uncle Sanxing

125
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,590
Calm down.

126
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,340
Lu Chen is my brother.

127
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,780
If you don't give him face,

128
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,060
you have to save me some face.

129
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,580
Right?

130
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,420
Uncle Sanxing,

131
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:57,940
you and my dad

132
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,860
are old friends.

133
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,780
You can't

134
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,710
destroy my shop.

135
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,930
Ignore Lu Chen.

136
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,780
Later I'll have Qin Feng

137
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,260
open the best standard room for you.

138
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,340
I'm not running business today.

139
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,340
I'll serve you instead

140
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,620
with the best wine.

141
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,650
Ask Qin Feng to drink with you.

142
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,940
Drink as much as you like.

143
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,740
It's not about drinking.

144
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,090
That's right.

145
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,300
I'll drink with you.

146
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,020
Uncle Sanxing.

147
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,750
Listen to me.

148
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,140
You need to

149
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,460
save face for your son.

150
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,260
Otherwise,

151
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,340
it will have a negative impact.

152
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,740
Right?

153
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,980
No matter what,

154
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,500
Lu Chen

155
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,300
is a hero now.

156
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,700
Right?

157
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,140
Hero?

158
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,800
I don't need your protection.

159
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,500
Let me teach you how to be a son

160
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,980
and how to talk to your elders first.

161
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,460
Fine.

162
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:29,860
OK.

163
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,900
I'm educating my son.

164
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,540
It has nothing to do with you.

165
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,700
Wait and see.

166
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,520
Wait and see.

167
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,210
Uncle Sanxing, this way.

168
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,230
Uncle, aunt,

169
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,620
let's go next door.

170
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,300
After all,

171
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,920
marriage is their business.

172
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,190
Let them have a talk.

173
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,000
What else do you want me to say?

174
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,680
We can't talk if you act like this.

175
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,680
Lu Chen,

176
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,340
I know your family well.

177
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,980
And you also

178
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,060
know my family well.

179
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,980
Our families

180
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,860
know each other well.

181
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,140
It's not about who is not good enough for another.

182
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,620
You're already 30.

183
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,740
It is impossible for you to

184
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,780
give all your savings

185
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,620
to my family.

186
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,070
What will you do?

187
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,419
Your dad

188
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,820
will not give you a penny.

189
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,580
In the end,

190
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,380
you still have to get married

191
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,520
and have kids.

192
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,110
How can you get married without money?

193
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,600
You've never been married.

194
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,380
Let me tell you.

195
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,740
Once you get married,

196
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,470
you'll know.

197
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,850
No matter who you marry,

198
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,850
you'll live your own life in the end.

199
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:05,980
Lu Chen,

200
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,600
this time

201
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,580
I really want to get married.

202
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,740
We've known each other since school.

203
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,540
Marrying me

204
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,700
is better than

205
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,900
marrying a stranger.

206
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:16,760
Besides,

207
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,240
you have to borrow money

208
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,990
if you want to pay off your dad's debts.

209
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,910
You don't need to ask.

210
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,860
Everyone knows

211
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,420
you're in debt.

212
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,350
Who dares to marry you at that time?

213
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,400
Do you...

214
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,020
Do you really look down on me?

215
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,780
What's wrong with me?

216
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,450
Yes.

217
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,300
We got engaged without telling you.

218
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,000
But it is your dad

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,330
who owes us money first.

220
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,220
If you break off the engagement,

221
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,020
you are really embarrassing me.

222
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,190
Your parents are planning a banquet.

223
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,980
The kid you saw that day

224
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,980
will still live with me

225
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,640
for at least five to six years.

226
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,140
It's not your child.

227
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,270
Why are you in such a hurry to raise him.

228
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,580
Just say

229
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,770
there's something wrong with Lu Yanchen.

230
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,820
He insists

231
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,250
on raising his brother's kid.

232
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,380
You can't marry him.

233
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,340
Qin Feng called his father over.

234
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,140
They are drinking with your dad.

235
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,260
It seems that

236
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,540
they won't finish until noon tomorrow.

237
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,740
You can go back first.

238
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,900
Today we've got everything open on the table

239
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,800
face to face.

240
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,050
It is a big step.

241
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,900
But we still have to clean up the mess,

242
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,380
recharge and store up energy.

243
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,180
We can't rush.

244
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,110
Thank you.

245
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,790
And especially thank Qin Feng.

246
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,660
Without my relationship with Guixiao,

247
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
Qin Feng is also willing to help you.

248
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,900
All right, you should leave now.

249
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,300
Otherwise,

250
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,580
it would be awkward if you ran into Zhao Minshan's parents

251
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,640
when they came out.

252
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,050
Lu Chen.

253
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,230
If we can be together again,

254
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,840
I will treat her well.

255
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,820
Look.

256
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,300
Lu Chen

257
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,620
is determined not to get married.

258
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,840
Minshan,

259
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,220
Lu Chen didn't tell me about it.

260
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,580
So I have no idea

261
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,070
what he said today.

262
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,040
Look.

263
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,020
His dad is so angry.

264
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,140
I understand him.

265
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,870
But I like him.

266
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,080
I want to marry him.

267
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,240
Lu Chen just came back.

268
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,850
He is very busy these days.

269
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,810
Now he's mad at me and his dad again.

270
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,390
Well,

271
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,580
I'll talk to him again.

272
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,710
Come to our factory

273
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,420
for lunch or dinner

274
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,220
this weekend.

275
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,650
Get familiar with each other.

276
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,180
you'll get along well soon.

277
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,810
Your dad called me.

278
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,600
My dad?

279
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,220
Why did he call you?

280
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,330
He wants you to go home for the Spring Festival.

281
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,580
Why would he call you if

282
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,110
he wants me to go home for the Spring Festival.

283
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,710
You told him,

284
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,420
you're busy during the Spring Festival.

285
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,880
You have to work overtime.

286
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,070
As your boss,

287
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,110
shouldn't I be held accountable?

288
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,510
I'm sorry.

289
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,020
Because of my family matter,

290
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,550
you are disturbed by my dad.

291
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,410
Not at all.

292
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,440
Your dad is my dad's leader,

293
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,020
and my beloved Uncle Gui.

294
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,300
It's never a disturbance

295
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,380
if he calls me.

296
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,090
Would you like some dessert?

297
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:10,610
No.

298
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,670
I came back after a call

299
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,490
and heard you two talking about your dad.

300
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,560
Did I hear it right?

301
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,620
You and Wu Chengye

302
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,020
talk about your parents?

303
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,390
His father used to work for my dad.

304
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,700
But there are several layers apart.

305
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,560
I only found out

306
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,380
after graduation.

307
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,790
He wants to court the daughter of an old leader.

308
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,810
Are you asleep?

309
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,780
Not yet.

310
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,800
Things are starting to settle down.

311
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:39,780
I...

312
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,230
Sleep early.

313
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,450
What's the good news?

314
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,350
Why are you smiling so happily?

315
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,220
A friend of mine

316
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,820
asked me if I was asleep.

317
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,970
I said I wasn't.

318
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,540
He said

319
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,220
then sleep early.

320
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,790
Try to make a conversation.

321
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,750
Something's up.

322
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,380
Keep sleeping.

323
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,390
Do you want to hear about Aunt Guixiao?

324
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,260
Sleep.

325
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,180
I'll draw you

326
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,580
a floor plan of her house.

327
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,580
This is the entrance.

328
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,830
Come in here.

329
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,620
There's a big living room.

330
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,370
And there are

331
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,270
two floors.

332
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,580
There's a bookshelf here

333
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,770
with many books on it.

334
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,490
There is a kitchen here.

335
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,320
Lu Chen, well...

336
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:25,820
Mom.

337
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,630
I know what you want to say.

338
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,110
Impossible.

339
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,090
At least try it.

340
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,800
Looking for me?

341
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,140
All right, go in first.

342
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,230
Do me a favor.

343
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,300
OK.

344
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:49,790
Tell me.

345
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,400
You know Zhao Minshan well.

346
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,950
Send a message to her for me.

347
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,350
No, I...

348
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,450
Zhao Min...

349
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,340
Who knows her?

350
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,470
We haven't been in touch for 800 years.

351
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,530
For Lu Chen.

352
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,540
You go talk to her for Lu Chen.

353
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,020
Tell her

354
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,460
Lu Chen is going to delay it.

355
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,220
But she's a woman.

356
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,880
She can't afford it.

357
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,280
Let her think it through.

358
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,160
Let her wait for two or three years.

359
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,020
Can she take it?

360
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,800
I don't want to see her.

361
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,140
You were quite happy to meet her

362
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,540
when I didn't allow you to.

363
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,330
Why are you gabbling nonsense

364
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,930
when I ask you to meet her now?

365
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,380
For Lu Chen.

366
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,630
For Lu Chen.

367
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,430
Long time no see.

368
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,530
Haven't we met at the hospital that day?

369
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,260
What do you want to see me about?

370
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,260
For Lu Chen?

371
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,140
Of course.

372
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,780
Personally,

373
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,710
I have nothing to talk to you about.

374
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,960
Let me be frank.

375
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,820
Zhao Minshan,

376
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,130
I know Lu Chen better than you do.

377
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,550
And I know you better than Lu Chen does.

378
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,880
It's impossible for him

379
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,790
to marry you.

380
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,040
We're adults.

381
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,500
You're still so childish.

382
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:24,780
Tell me then.

383
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
How am I childish?

384
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,740
I know Lu Chen.

385
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,520
He is proud

386
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,480
and doesn't want to marry me like this.

387
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,280
I understand.

388
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,590
Then let's take our time

389
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,620
and get to know each other.

390
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,580
From dating.

391
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,530
Funny.

392
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,180
Listen to me.

393
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,810
I know you well.

394
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,860
That's why I came to you.

395
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,740
I know

396
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,860
Lu Chen's temper.

397
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,740
Since he has refused,

398
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,810
there's no turning back.

399
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,690
It's not good for you to delay like this.

400
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,420
Delay for months,

401
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,550
or for years.

402
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,280
Can you take it?

403
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,700
No need.

404
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,590
We're not kids anymore.

405
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,780
Zhao Minshan,

406
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,310
with your family

407
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,660
and your conditions,

408
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,500
it's easy for you to remarry.

409
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,000
I can tell that you like Lu Chen.

410
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,890
But he doesn't like you.

411
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,220
And you can't afford to delay it.

412
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,870
That's it.

413
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,300
Happy New Year in advance.

414
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,090
You want to see me?

415
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,250
I told my dad everything.

416
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,940
I guess after he sobers up,

417
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,200
he would be very angry.

418
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,760
I'll leave the kid to you before school starts.

419
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,940
He'll go home with you.

420
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,360
OK.

421
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,590
What about you?

422
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,910
I'm going back to the SWAT team.

423
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,670
Where will you have dinner for the New Year's Eve?

424
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,270
At my home？

425
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,130
You're celebrating the New Year.

426
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:09,930
We're on duty.

427
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,130
You don't even come back for Chinese New Year.

428
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,590
I'll be back on the eighth day of the New Year.

429
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,210
What's this for?

430
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,310
A gift in return.

431
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,240
Countdown.

432
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,740
Three minutes.

433
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
You even sewed it?

434
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,680
Just for practice.

435
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,140
It's been a long time.

436
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,540
You did a pretty good job.

437
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,340
Have you ever raised a police dog?

438
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:28,790
No.

439
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,300
Since I came here,

440
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,300
there's a police dog squadron here.

441
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,130
Right?

442
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,740
It's always been there.

443
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,140
Did you raise one before?

444
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,790
At first,

445
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,940
Qining had no police dog squadron.

446
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,000
My old captain and I

447
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,270
kept some police dogs.

448
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,250
When I was in charge of security,

449
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,250
I had a search dog.

450
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,230
Another one was

451
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,620
an explosive ordnance search dog.

452
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,660
Really?

453
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,550
I want to keep one after hearing what you said.

454
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,610
I heard you applied for

455
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,650
the single dormitory in front of the team gate.

456
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:56,990
Yes.

457
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,660
I thought you had a partner.

458
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,850
So you're just like me.

459
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:05,820
Captain Lin.

460
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,710
Captain Lin.

461
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:07,820
You two

462
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,860
came here together.

463
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,860
Let me introduce,

464
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,860
Captain Lu.

465
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,740
I'm Zhou Xin, the Captain of the Second Squadron.

466
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,800
My name is Du Yiwen,

467
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,470
the Captain of the First Squadron.

468
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,870
You two look quite happy.

469
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,560
What were you talking about?

470
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,200
Just now,

471
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,900
I got a call from an insurance salesman.

472
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,380
When I said I was an EOD technician,

473
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,380
he immediately said

474
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:25,910
I'm sorry

475
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:26,910
for disturbing you...

476
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:27,720
and hung up.

477
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,500
What a high-risk occupation.

478
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,430
Heartbreaking.

479
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,460
One, two, one.

480
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,500
One, two, three, four.

481
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,620
Halt.

482
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,760
[Xiao Xiao]

483
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:23,980
Hello.

484
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,070
Are you available now?

485
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,620
Yes.

486
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,840
Go ahead.

487
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,690
I made an appointment with Qin Xiaonan's class teacher.

488
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,440
We'll meet after the Chinese New Year.

489
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,060
He is going to

490
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,120
teach Qin Xiaonan.

491
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,780
And he wants to meet his parents.

492
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,580
His parents won't be available,

493
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,230
especially his dad Qin Mingyu.

494
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,090
He'll be on duty during the Chinese New Year.

495
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:42,820
Well,

496
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,110
let's go instead.

497
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,070
Us?

498
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,100
Yes.

499
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,730
Uncle and Aunt

500
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,510
also count.

501
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,230
OK.

502
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,170
Alright.

503
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:01,950
Bye.

504
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,370
Gui Xiao.

505
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,740
When...

506
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,530
When is your flight?

507
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,170
The return flight.

508
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,250
Tomorrow.

509
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,700
Tomorrow afternoon.

510
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:19,940
Good.

511
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,270
I have something to do in Beijing tomorrow.

512
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,330
I'll take you back.

513
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,580
Are you coming to pick me up?

514
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,550
Just right on my way.

515
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,920
Remember to send me the flight number,

516
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,520
so I can get there in advance.

517
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:34,410
OK.

518
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,630
Alright.

519
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,160
I have to go.

520
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,760
Remember to send me the flight number.

521
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,160
Bye.

522
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,660
Bye.

523
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,580
Captain knows you like dogs.

524
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,120
This is your Spring Festival gift.

525
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,580
Is it a gift

526
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,260
or a new training task?

527
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,680
Anyway, Captain said

528
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,510
you'll live right next to the police force.

529
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,730
You have plenty of time

530
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,450
and also rich experience in training dogs.

531
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,510
Most importantly,

532
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,910
the number of people and dogs

533
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:14,510
are fixed.

534
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,080
A team member has transferred to another team,

535
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,700
so no one can take care of this puppy

536
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,300
before the Spring Festival.

537
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:19,500
Alright.

538
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,550
Leave it with me.

539
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,090
When it has a new owner,

540
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,740
I will then return it safe and sound.

541
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,000
Thank you, Captain Lu.

542
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,430
Anything else?

543
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,300
No.

544
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,710
There are many cars going out.

545
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,970
Go earlier if you need to pick someone up.

546
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,780
Happy wedding!

547
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,470
Doctor Xu.

548
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,580
Thank you.

549
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,460
Miss Gui Xiao.

550
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,630
What time does your flight take off?

551
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,690
Still an hour left.

552
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,110
To be honest,

553
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,660
thank you so much

554
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,230
for making time for me.

555
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,020
Lu Chen is on his way.

556
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,620
He asked me to meet you first.

557
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,790
I'll introduce him to you later.

558
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,160
OK.

559
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,430
Wait a minute.

560
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,430
I'm here.

561
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,400
I'm afraid he can't find me.

562
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,540
Are you meeting

563
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,670
a ten-year-old kid?

564
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,070
He has never been to this terminal.

565
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,380
I guess he doesn't fly much

566
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,140
on ordinary planes either.

567
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,660
He's afraid of flying?

568
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,950
He was in Beijing when he was a student.

569
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,270
At that time,

570
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,940
not many people traveled by plane.

571
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,700
Then he went to Qining

572
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,940
for more than ten years.

573
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,030
He just came back this year.

574
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,850
Let's talk about you first.

575
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,980
This is my bank of deposit

576
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,190
and my bank account.

577
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,440
I need to save some money recently.

578
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,180
So,

579
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,310
I can only lend you two thirds of it.

580
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:29,890
Next month,

581
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,350
one of my saving plans will reach maturity.

582
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,450
I'll make it up to you.

583
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,430
Will it be too late?

584
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,170
No problem.

585
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,300
When I saw you

586
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,300
walking over there just now,

587
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,940
I remembered

588
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,220
the first time we met.

589
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,950
I was thinking that

590
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,740
the little girl who was crying

591
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,020
at that time

592
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,660
had grown up well.

593
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,180
And you're doing well enough

594
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,110
to lent me money.

595
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,180
I was afraid you couldn't find it

596
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,580
and wanted to pick you up.

597
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,340
I have something else to do.

598
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,710
Take your time.

599
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,280
Don't you want a drink?

600
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,760
No.

601
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,490
I haven't introduced him to you.

602
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,280
There are plenty of opportunities.

603
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:37,740
See you.

604
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,720
Do you want some coffee?

605
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,540
You guys don't drink coffee?

606
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,870
I drink black coffee.

607
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,660
You do drink coffee.

608
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,180
Do you have any misunderstanding

609
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,280
about our work?

610
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,180
I just have no idea.

611
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,420
I'm curious.

612
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,090
[2009]

613
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,160
♫Hey, what day is it today?♫

614
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,800

615

♫Can I see you?♫

616
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,610
It's too eye-catching.

♫Let the heartbeat continue 110♫

618
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,150

♫Love is in vogue♫

624
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,650
Is he gone?

625
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,320
Yes, he's gone.

626
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,240
♫You still need to be quiet♫

633

♫We need to cultivate our relationship♫

635
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,340
No.

00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,000
There's nothing to be afraid of.

637
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,210
♫I believe you can do it♫

638
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,980

Will it be too late?

640
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,790
I can call a taxi.

641
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,800
It's done.

642
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,950
Let's go after I finish this.

643
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,680
It's my day off.

644
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:22,900
No hurry.

645
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,520
Take your time.

646
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,610
Are you free on the second day of the New Year?

647
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,840
For the meeting with Qin Xiaonan's class teacher.

648
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,350
How about the eighth day?

649
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:11,550
OK.

650
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:13,989
I'm leaving.

651
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,170
Gui Xiao.

652
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,219
Happy New Year.

653
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,989
I'm on duty during the Spring Festival.

654
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,520
It's not easy to contact me.

655
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,929
So I'm telling you in advance.

656
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,770
Happy Spring Festival in advance.

657
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:41,830
Bye.

658
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,810
Take care when you work overtime.

659
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:17,900
OK.

660
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,380
After the Spring Festival,

661
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,340
we will practice

662
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,270
how to catch the suspicious object

663
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,590
and put it in the EOD tank.

664
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,650
The imaging device

665
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,230
can help us determine

666
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:46,850
if the explosives

667
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,480
can be removed manually.

668
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,770
As a professional EOD technician,

669
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:54,610
observing

670
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,070
is a compulsory course.

671
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,740
Normally,

672
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,940
each team is in charge of

673
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,200
different equipment.

674
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,990
We not only need to know how to use it,

675
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,690
but also

676
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,520
how to maintain your equipment,

677
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,950
including EOD robots.

678
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,200
The condition is much better now.

679
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,860
In the past,

680
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,750
the tools used by

681
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,980
our first generation of EOD technicians

682
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,310
were the same as those used to repair cars.

683
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,430
Without these,

684
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,730
what can we rely on?

685
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
We learn and study

686
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,230
by ourselves.

687
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,980
But in the field of EOD,

688
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,900
no matter how advanced the equipment is,

689
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,090
people are irreplaceable.

690
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,030
For example,

691
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,590
robots can't work for

692
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,460
the bomb disposal we met at height.

693
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,080
We have to do it ourselves.

694
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,330
Do you understand?

695
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,180
Yes.

696
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,130
OK.

697
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,650
There's an extra meal

698
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,550
in the canteen tonight.

699
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,250
Happy Chinese New Year, everyone.

700
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,270
Happy Chinese New Year, Captain Lu.

701
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,060
Everyone works overtime during the Spring Festival?

702
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,790
Yes.

703
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,220
We are SWAT police.

704
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,220
It's very memorable

705
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,300
to work overtime during the Spring Festival.

706
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,500
Remember what I said.

707
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,780
Don't close your eyes for 36 hours.

708
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,160
You'll be so tired, you knock out immediately after work.

709
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,820
So that you'll remember this experience later.

710
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,760
OK, let's go and eat.

711
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,200
Happy New Year, everyone.

712
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,560
The physical examination report is out.

713
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,820
All of you have passed.

714
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,510
Since I'm here this year,

715
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,970
you can take turns to take a break.

716
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,990
I'll keep an eye on things

717
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,590
during the Spring Festival.

718
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,390
But on the eighth day,

719
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,560
I need someone

720
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,260
to keep an eye here for me.

721
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,930
I need to go to school

722
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,590
to meet the class teacher.

723
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,250
What's the problem?

724
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,030
Captain Lu,

725
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,810
I remember you are unmarried

726
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,720
on the file.

727
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:58,970
A friend's child.

728
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,290
I help take care of him.

729
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,200
What a brotherly love!

730
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,730
Aren't you afraid that your future partner

731
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,060
will complain about it?

732
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,470
Alright.

733
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,020
It's time for some of you to eat

734
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,300
and the others to go on duty.

735
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:09,960
Dismissed.

736
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:11,680
This is

737
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:14,040
the physical examination report of the new team members.

738
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,630
Pretty good.

739
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,360
All passed.

740
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,990
Are there any tricks?

741
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,050
Share some with us.

742
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,860
Do you pay tuition fees?

743
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,110
So stingy.

744
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:23,650
Keep it.

745
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,340
You still don't treat us

746
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,400
as your own people.

747
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,320
You're quite suitable for crosstalk.

748
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:30,980
I just want to see

749
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,200
if there is anyone

750
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,130
with good psychological quality.

751
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,680
This one has excellent physical condition.

752
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,480
He's born to be a EOD technician.

753
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,380
His heart rate is

754
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,950
around 60 per minute. So low.

755
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,710
These are good too.

756
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,730
They all look steady.

757
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,650
They are born to do this.

758
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,670
OK.

759
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,750
I'll go to the command center downstairs

760
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,430
and have a look.

761
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,240
See you downstairs in ten minutes.

762
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,590
Yes.

763
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:17,990
Routine patrol.

764
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,380
Everyone,

765
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,140
pause for a moment.

766
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,220
We're having a routine check.

767
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,550
Please rehearse later.

768
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,100
You lead inspections of key areas.

769
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,460
Yes.

770
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,960
The rest of you, follow me.

771
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,560
Yes.

772
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,670
Check carefully.

773
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,490
Yes.

774
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,530
You come here now.

775
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,260
When will you leave?

776
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:35,830
No, we won't leave.

777
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:36,690
Fully stand by.

778
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:44,640
Go.

779
00:39:59,310 --> 00:39:59,970
Captain Lu.

780
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:08,850
OK.

781
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,900
Open the trunk.

782
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,210
Yes.

783
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,500
Not a big problem.

784
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Nothing unusual.

785
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,300
Prepare the detector.

786
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:29,610
Yes.

787
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,680
Attention.

788
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,000
Check every car.

789
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:32,780
Yes.

790
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,070
Stand up.

791
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,020
Relax.

792
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:50,780
Sit.

793
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:51,820
Yes.

794
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,910
Everyone is tired.

795
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,660
First time listening to a party backstage?

796
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,230
Yes.

797
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,380
Take a ten-minute break.

798
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,670
We'll have the second round later.

799
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,750
Check the garage.

800
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,430
Yes.

801
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,730
We can enjoy the crosstalk.

802
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,730
Are you ready?

803
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,870
Let's welcome

804
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,820
this beautiful spring.

805
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,680
Here we go. Countdown.

806
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,220
Ten, nine, eight,

807
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,340
seven, six, five...

808
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,570
Captain Lu just came here and it's the Spring Festival.

809
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,500
There are many duties for security check during the Festival.

810
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,160
Every year

811
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,410
is so busy.

812
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,540
Isn't every year the same

813
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,400
for SWAT police like us?

814
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,770
It went quite well this year.

815
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,430
One year, before the Spring Festival,

816
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,670
I caught up with a bomb disposal.

817
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,680
My first love happened to be there.

818
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,490
Qining?

819
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,380
Not Qining.

820
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:22,480
In a city.

821
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,430
I just became the Captain.

822
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,650
For the sake of safety,

823
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:28,860
I also borrowed

824
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,060
SWAT police force from other stations.

825
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,000
[2016]

826
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,010
The New Year's party will start after the meeting.

827
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:38,580
It looks like

828
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,520
we're going to celebrate the New Year together.

829
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,050
Yeah.
