00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,300
One year before the Spring Festival,

5
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,740
I participated in the bomb disposal,

6
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,660

It's the New Year's Gala after the meeting.

9
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:53,900
It looks like

10
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,820
we're gonna celebrate the New Year together.

11
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,300
Yeah.

12
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,270
Captain Lu,

13
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,020
we found something suspicious

14
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,300
by the trash can in the backyard.

15
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,840
We've checked it with a detector,

16
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,900
and there's something wrong.

17
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,920
Evacuate the crowd first.

Yes, sir.

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,640
What happened?

20
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,140
They said nothing about it.

21
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,200
Let's go out first.

22
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,950
It might be a fire drill.

23
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,960
A bomb that explodes as the pressure on it is gone.

24
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,420
It has a simple structure.

The crowd has been evacuated.

32

Nothing.

36
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,950
Just a routine check.

Why don't we take a walk around?

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,870
It seems that...

40
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,740
According to my earlier search,

41
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,740
there's a rice noodle restaurant nearby

42
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,000

It's meaningless to talk about it again.

00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,390
I'll get even with you from that year.

190
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,540

So I'm wearing Hai Dong's suit.

193
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,980
Is it okay for me to meet the class adviser like this?

194
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,600
Sure.

195
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,300
It's my first time

196
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,430
seeing you in a suit.

197
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,510
I feel kind of weird.

198
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,490
I'm not used to it, too.

199
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,460
This place is still the same as before,

200
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,750
without any change.

201
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,300
Nothing has changed.

202
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,580
Captain Lu.

203
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,350
Hello, I've heard a lot about you...

204
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:44,750
Hello.

205
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,910
To get to know you,

206
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,710
I've searched all over the Internet for your interviews.

207
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,920
What a pity that there's only one article.

208
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,490
A great hero like you

209
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,410
should be promoted more.

210
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,250
Enough.

211
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,850
Sorry, Captain Lu.

212
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,850
My husband

213
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,940
just pretends to be passionate.

214
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,190
He's excited in front of others.

215
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,550
How can you say I pretend to be passionate?

216
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,280
This is my sister's first love.

217
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,319
Let's get down to business first.

218
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:06,660
Okay.

219
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,859
This class adviser

220
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,859
is an old teacher,

221
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,050
who's very responsible.

222
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,220
She specifically asked to meet

223
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,970
the Xiaonan's parents first

224
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,810
just to know the kid's

225
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,270
study and life conditions

226
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,089
and other things like personality.

227
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,000
I already called her

228
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,800
in advance,

229
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,940
and told her the kid's parents

230
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,040
were not in Beijing.

231
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,710
Just go upstairs and feel free to talk to her.

232
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,589
Anyway, it's all for Xiaonan

233
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,300
to get used to the new school life

234
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,430
as soon as possible.

235
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,330
Okay, thank you.

236
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,030
It's all my husband's fault.

237
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,540
I forgot to introduce myself.

238
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,450
My name is Xia Xia,

239
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,630
and I'm Gui Xiao's sister-in-law.

240
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,310
He is Wen Cheng,

241
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,370
Gui Xiao's cousin.

242
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,390
Let's go upstairs.

243
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,790
Okay.

244
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,870
Gui Xiao's first love

245
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,390
is so handsome

246
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,450
with a good figure.

247
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,300
That's enough...

248
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,010
Do you think they still have a chance?

249
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,450
I think so.

250
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,230
Coming.

251
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,110
Hello.

252
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,510
Mom!

253
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,060
Mom, we have some guests.

254
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,700
Sister, brother-in-law, come here.

255
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,230
Come in, please. No need to change your shoes.

256
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,410
Do you know her?

257
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,740
Hello, Mrs. Sun.

258
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:25,790
Hello.

259
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,190
Hello.

260
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,710
This is Qin Xiaonan's uncle,

261
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,430
Lu Yanchen,

262
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,590
the one I mentioned to you

263
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,430
on the phone.

264
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,930
He just came back from Qining.

265
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,340
Come in, please.

266
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,940
Feel free to take your seats.

267
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,510
Sister,

268
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,470
he was the SWAT officer I talked about back then.

269
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,700
Excuse me.

270
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,890
Were you a SWAT officer before?

271
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:56,620
Yes.

272
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,270
And so am I now.

273
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,450
We thought you changed your job

274
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,780
when we saw you in a suit.

275
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,280
Do I look familiar to you?

276
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,480
It's normal that he doesn't know you.

277
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,110
Just a few years ago,

278
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,220
my sister and her classmate

279
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,610
went on a graduation trip

280
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,230
and encountered bad weather,

281
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,830
when we were trapped on the mountain, unable to get down.

282
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,070
Quite a lot of SWAT officers went to help us

283
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,270
go down the mountain.

284
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,510
Do you remember that?

285
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,850
My classmate had straight hair,

286
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,620
which was so long

287
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,400
to the waist.

288
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,780
I had curly hair,

289
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,380
long brown and curly hair.

290
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
I don't remember.

291
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,150
He carries out tasks every day.

292
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,230
Who knows how many people

293
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,280
he has helped and saved?

294
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,960
You are just one of them.

295
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,530
I just feel it's so rare.

296
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,390
Thank you.

297
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,170
Seriously.

298
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,170
Thank you so much.

299
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,230
This is my duty,

300
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,950
so don't mention it.

301
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,070
Mom, here you are.

302
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,320
Here.

303
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,400
This is the winter vacation homework.

304
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,200
Bring it back.

305
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,870
Xiaonan doesn't have to finish it all.

306
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,670
I just want him to get used to

307
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,230
the mode

308
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,490
of our winter vacation homework.

309
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,290
Just help him assimilate first.

310
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,040
We'll leave Xiaonan to you

311
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:25,830
from now on.

312
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,830
To quote your lines,

313
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,110
this is my duty,

314
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,260
so don't mention it.

315
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,030
Thank you.

316
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,970
Do you really have no memory of it?

317
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,870
I remember the mission and the time,

318
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,090
but not the people.

319
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,670
That mission came all of a sudden,

320
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,400
and our entire team went there.

321
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,060
The squadron of police dogs

322
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,510
was also searching for people everywhere on the mountain.

323
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,750
There were hundreds of tourists

324
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,080
in the scenic back then,

325
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,000
some of whom went really deep.

326
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,690
After several hours of search and rescue,

327
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,620
we searched all over the mountain.

328
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,620
So I couldn't remember those faces at all.

329
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,830
High winds, hypothermia, the narrow mountain roads,

330
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,140
and a large number of tourists.

331
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,020
In this case,

332
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,660
we had no time

333
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,360
to care about

334
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,570
different people's faces,

335
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,510
or whether it was the long hair or the curly hair.

336
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,310
You're right.

337
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,090
When I was in high school,

338
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,620
I often went shopping here.

339
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,850
In addition to this place,

340
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,070
I also went to the clothing wholesale market

341
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,040
next to the zoo.

342
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,720
One of my cousins was really good at bargaining.

343
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,990
Every time when I brought her out,

344
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,450
I could save a lot of money.

345
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,950
The cousin you met today

346
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,080
was a follower when he was little.

347
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,880
We didn't want to play with him.

348
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,310
So he just cried and complained to others.

349
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,060
Are these things

350
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,170
unfamiliar to you

351
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,870
now?

352
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,110
I haven't come back

353
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,800
since high school.

354
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,560
During the years in Qining,

355
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,150
I've been back

356
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,900
less than five times.

357
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,800
Actually, I don't know much

358
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,170
about today's Beijing

359
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,940
just like Qin Xiaonan.

360
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,840
Welcome home.

361
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,590
My brother's car is missing.

362
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,220
The traffic is too congested.

363
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,480
We can't find them now.

364
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,150
Let's contact them when we get there.

365
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,250
Actually, out of the only five times,

366
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,640
I did it twice to see you.

367
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,870
Why was it only once in my memory?

368
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,170
You came back

369
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,960
when I just went to college.

370
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,530
And when you asked to break up with me.

371
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,220
Did you come back at that time?

372
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,810
I'm calling my brother

373
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,380
to see if they've arrived.

374
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,600
Call them in five minutes.

375
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,300
OK.

376
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,400
The thing concerning Zhao Minshan

377
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,350
is over.

378
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,660
You look so happy.

379
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,140
Of course.

380
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

381
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,550
I had something serious to do with you this afternoon.

382
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,040
So it was improper to talk about it.

383
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,700
This is also a serious matter.

384
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,430
Gui Xiao.

385
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,090
They've arrived.

386
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:39,890
Let's get off.

387
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,850
Are you out of your mind again?

388
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,880
I just subconsciously...

389
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,740
My sinful hand...

390
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,150
Sister, I didn't recognize

391
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:12,950
Chen's car just now.

392
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,370
That's why I honked.

393
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,790
Never mind, but why are you so nervous?

394
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,310
Let's go up from here.

395
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,300
Sister,

396
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,780
are you going to

397
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,240
spend a lot of money today.

398
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,070
Order whatever you want today.

399
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,750
It's on me.

400
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,010
Is there a budget limit?

401
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,660
A month's salary.

402
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,450
Is it enough?

403
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,490
I'll take a good look then.

404
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,440
Hello.

405
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,720
Hello.

406
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,080
We'd like to order this.

407
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,480
OK.

408
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,410
How much of this

409
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,410
do you have today?

410
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,370
There's only one kilogram left.

411
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,220
That should be enough for four people.

412
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,780
I'll go check it with you later.

413
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,110
Okay.

414
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
And this one, too.

415
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,040
Okay.

416
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,780
The dishes here

417
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,510
are all offered

418
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,480
at the day's supply price,

419
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,810
just to keep them fresh.

420
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,130
Table 13.

421
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,350
Check, please.

422
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,000
Just a minute, sir.

423
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,290
Waiter, may I have the bill, please?

424
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,420
The gentleman who just left

425
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,580
has paid the bill.

426
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,570
Could you please show me the bill?

427
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,230
Okay, please hold on a moment.

428
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,080
Hello, madam.

429
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,950
Captain Lu is quite generous!

430
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,500
Sister,

431
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,080
your first love

432
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,760
is from a rich family, right?

433
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:17,730
Waiter,

434
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,390
please pack

435
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,850
the rest of the food for me.

436
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,370
Okay.

437
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,360
Thank you.

438
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,720
Get down to work.

439
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:42,640
This is the winter vacation homework

440
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,240
assigned by your new school.

441
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,750
Although the teacher didn't ask you

442
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,680
to finish it all,

443
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,550
you still should do it all

444
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,130
since you're free recently.

445
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,060
Don't slack off.

446
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,570
I'm going to dismantle some cars.

447
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,800
Go to bed if you're sleepy.

448
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,000
I'll sleep next door.

449
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,430
Some cars?

450
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
I can only see him tomorrow morning indeed.

451
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,110
Luckily, your family

452
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,130
run a garage.

453
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,360
There you are.

454
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,180
The barbecue I ate was quite good.

455
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,910
So I've packed some for the kid.

456
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,190
You don't look like you're in trouble.

457
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,400
You look good!

458
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,390
Why are you dismantling the cars?

459
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,720
I see.

460
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,910
You disassemble cars whether you're happy

461
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,120
or sad, right?

462
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:01,800
Chen.

463
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,710
I just came back from a business trip,

464
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,450
and my brother told me you were transferred to Beijing.

465
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,580
So I followed him to see you right away.

466
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,230
Good.

467
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,130
You haven't changed a bit over the years.

468
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,730
You haven't changed either.

469
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,030
I just finished my homework.

470
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,960
I'm going to bed.

471
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,050
Go ahead.

472
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,270
Is he your kid, Chen?

473
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:33,820
No.

474
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,190
It's my friend's.

475
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,750
I thought you got married

476
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,630
in Qining.

477
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,550
Nah.

478
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,560
He's waiting for Gui Xiao.

479
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,890
Stop talking nonsense.

480
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,110
Other people may have no idea about it,

481
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,870
but I know.

482
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,110
Gui Xiao in our class?

483
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,830
Of course. Who else can it be?

484
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,190
Chen and Gui Xiao were once in a relationship?

485
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,210
They

486
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,370
fell in love after graduation.

487
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,970
Many people don't know that.

488
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,900
Why didn't you tell me?

489
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,310
Why should I tell you?

490
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:02,830
What are you looking at?

491
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,830
Pour Chen a drink.

492
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,760
No.

493
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,840
It's my shift tomorrow afternoon, so I can't drink.

494
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,680
Don't drink directly with the bottle.

495
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,700
How can I drink it in this case?

496
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,960
Pour it into the glass.

497
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,030
Help yourself.

498
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,850
I'm so happy to see Chen.

499
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,330
Here you are, Chen.

500
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,830
I won't drink.

501
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,370
He already said that.

502
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:40,940
Thank you.

503
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,500
I'm fine.

504
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:55,590
I'm fine.

505
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,210
Thank you.

506
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,230
Go continue to talk to my brother.

507
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,830
I'm fine.

508
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,470
Thank you, Chen.

509
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,190
Leave him alone.

510
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,150
Just let him throw up.

511
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,430
He'll be fine after that.

512
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,210
Come back and sit.

513
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:03,500
Sit.

514
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,560
His condition

515
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,840
reminds me of my past.

516
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,370
When Meng Xiaoshan got married,

517
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:15,760
I almost

518
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,920
drank to death in front of their house.

519
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,370
And in the next half a year,

520
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,330
I shed all my tears

521
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,220
of half my life.

522
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,410
Have you ever cried

523
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,000
for Gui Xiao?

524
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,390
It also counts if you cried secretly.

525
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,010
Have you cried for her?

526
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,880
What are you doing?

527
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,090
Since you already said it,

528
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,370
just finish the story.

529
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,730
She wanted to break up with me.

530
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,250
I called her over and over again.

531
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,030
She hung up every time.

532
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,020
She didn't even let me

533
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,820
say anything.

534
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,850
Then I didn't dare to call her.

535
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:06,110
I was afraid she would be scolded by her family if I called too many times.

536
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:10,440
Half a year after our breakup,

537
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,150
[2012]

538
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,600
I finally had a chance to return to Beijing.

539
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,880
And I had to leave the next day.

540
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,250
That night,

541
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,540
she still refused to meet me.

542
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,090
I didn't go home.

543
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,030
I stayed at the train station until dawn,

544
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,550
and then left directly.

545
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:57,670
I'm in Beijing.

546
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,050
Let's go out to meet.

00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,870
But I didn't expect

570
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,270
you to have such deep feelings for Gui Xiao.

571
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,430
I should go back.

572
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:52,870
Wake up.

573
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:54,640
Let's go.

574
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:56,820
Let's go.

575
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,460
I'll pick up Qin Xiaonan tomorrow.

576
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,900
I have to send Hai Jianfeng back first.

577
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,460
His mom really loves him.

578
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,860
If he doesn't return in the middle of the night,

579
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,720
she'll scold either him or me.

580
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,290
See you.

581
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,310
Go ahead.

582
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:13,900
Chen,

583
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,990
wish you two all the best.

584
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:28,810
Did you buy it?

585
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,670
Who else could it be other than me?

586
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,920
Aunt Gui Xiao, of course!

587
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,740
You're not related to her.

588
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,220
Dare you take it at will?

589
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,060
No.

590
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,360
So,

591
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,680
I'm writing it down.

592
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,200
When I make money,

593
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,750
I'll take inflation into account

594
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,230
and pay her back together.

595
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,110
Good.

596
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,330
But remember,

597
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,720
you need skills to pay her back.

598
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,050
Don't break her heart.

599
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:57,890
Of course.

600
00:37:59,350 --> 00:37:59,950
Let me see.

601
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,460
You're about to be as handsome as me.

602
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,520
What a narcissist.

603
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,790
I can't buy you clothes of really good brands

604
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,120
since I've been saving money these years.

605
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,150
But,

606
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,580
new clothes for Chinese New Year.

607
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,640
This is the custom.

608
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,480
I know.

609
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,190
Let's go and eat.

610
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,840
[Xie's Special Beef Noodles]

611
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,420
This is your Aunt Gui Xiao's

612
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,460
favorite restaurant

613
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,720
when she was a student.

614
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,440
I want to eat what she likes.

615
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,780
Is this your son?

616
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:50,240
No.

617
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:50,940
My nephew.

618
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,160
I thought you got married

619
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,890
with that girl and had this kid.

620
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,330
Which girl?

621
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,870
You know what?

622
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,260
Your uncle

623
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,040
always brought that girl

624
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,110
to eat noodles here before.

625
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,310
She looked so pretty,

626
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,290
and was really good at eating spicy food.

627
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,420
She ate one bowl of noodles

628
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,280
with half a bottle of spicy sauce.

629
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,270
It was summer,

630
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,810
and even I was sweating when I saw her eating.

631
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,210
Same as usual.

632
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,110
Two bowls.

633
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:16,980
Okay.

634
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,800
Just a moment.

635
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:48,750
What?

636
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,500
Don't you want to take the chance

637
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,030
of the Spring Festival

638
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,960
to invite Aunt Gui Xiao to hang out?

639
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,840
Mind your own business

640
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,800
instead of ours.

641
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:58,720
Were it not for

642
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,910
Aunt Gui Xiao,

643
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,850
I wouldn't care about you.

644
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,060
Here are your noodles.

645
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:10,950
Enjoy your meal.

646
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,550
Thank you.

647
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,960
Are you busy?

648
00:40:59,170 --> 00:40:59,970
I'm off today.

649
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,390
Are you...

650
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,160
How is Qin Xiaonan doing?

651
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:31,730
He said

652
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,030
he missed you.

653
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,210
Me too.

654
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,080
I'll take him to see you.

655
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,630
Don't bother.

656
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,280
I'll go to meet him,

657
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,950
and visit Meng Xiaoshan by the way.

658
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:31,600
Your reward.
