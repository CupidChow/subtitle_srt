00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,280
I wear the same uniform everyday.

190
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,630
I don't have anything to spend on.

191
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,620
You don't have to save any for me.

192
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,780
You're right.

193
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,040
All my assets and me,

194
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,470
will be yours tomorrow.

195
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,540
Why aren't you saying anything?

196
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,860
No wonder.

197
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,400
You want to hold a wedding

198
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,150
after the child is one year old.

199
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,830
So that's your plan.

200
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,430
You've been working for two years.

201
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,760
Cleared your debt.

202
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,500
And saved enough for a wedding.

203
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,690
All right.

204
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,010
I've finished talking. I'm leaving.

205
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,190
Where are you going?

206
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,990
I'm going out for a drive.

207
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,200
Go sleep soon,

208
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,920
my bride tomorrow.

209
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,990
I never really thought,

210
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,320
I'd get to marry you one day.

211
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,940
I'm going. I’ll pick you up tomorrow.

212
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,290
I always heard from Xiaoshan that

213
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,620
when you were in school,

214
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,460
there were many girls

215
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,310
wandering in front of your classroom

216
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,380
just to see you.

217
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,220
I used to doubt it.

218
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,290
Now I totally believe it.

219
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,960
You also used to have a reputation,

220
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,090
I often heard it from everyone at home.

221
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,100
I've gotten old.

222
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,470
I still got married to Xiaoshan.

223
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,690
Not bad.

224
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,030
Let's go.

225
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,350
Let's go.

226
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:13,910
Go.

227
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,620
Captain Lu.

228
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:20,970
Good.

229
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,550
You look good. Dress like this more often.

230
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,150
When will I get the chance to?

231
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,700
All right, let's go.

232
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,130
Don't keep the bride waiting for too long.

233
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,410
Do you have any wedding customs

234
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,400
in this area?

235
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,580
I don't know.

236
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,660
I've never been married.

237
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,480
No one would dare to

238
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,560
make a scene at my wedding.

239
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,260
There's no one here.

240
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Where is your dog?

241
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,660
There's no barking.

242
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,880
Aren't we picking up the bride today?

243
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,660
My dad picked it up

244
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,940
last night.

245
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,600
No one is here.

246
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,800
Yes.

247
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,870
Is Xiaoshan hiding

248
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,010
Gui Xiao?

249
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,730
For example,

250
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,710
next door?

251
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,620
Let's go in first.

252
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,780
Two captains clearing the way for you

253
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,060
to pick up your bride,

254
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,800
is such an extraordinary experience.

255
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,430
Let's go.

256
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,700
Wait, wait.

257
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,900
My wife left the first door

258
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,630
open.

259
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,410
I think it's a trap.

260
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,770
Qin Feng,

261
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,180
this is special treatment for Lu Chen.

262
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,110
It’s not easy for him to marry Xiao.

263
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,330
Thank you, sister-in-law.

264
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,060
Lu Chen has made many meritorious achievements.

265
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,990
Because of this,

266
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,860
no one will stop him from getting married today.

267
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,810
Don't worry.

268
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,130
Come in.

269
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,300
My wife is a woman of her word.

270
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,760
Come in.

271
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:22,960
Hold on.

272
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,400
What does this mean?

273
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,990
You broke your promise.

274
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,940
The bedroom is small.

275
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,220
It can't hold all of you at once.

276
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,150
Go up in batches.

277
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,560
Let the groom go first.

278
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,000
Here.

279
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,790
Your own wife. Go.

280
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,020
Did my beauty

281
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,040
surprise you?

282
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:37,890
Yes.

283
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,110
Wh-what else

284
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,200
do you need me to do?

285
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,650
I don't know.

286
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,360
We've let you off the hook.

287
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,610
We only kept one requirement.

288
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,820
Just carry her downstairs.

289
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,680
That's easy. He's done it before.

290
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,860
But we've never seen it before.

291
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,050
That's right.

292
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,230
So handsome!

293
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,590
Be careful.

294
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,940
So handsome.

295
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,260
Groom,

296
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,420
you can't skip this one.

297
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,220
Red envelope.

298
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,700
Yes, Captain Lu.

299
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,030
Yes, the red envelopes.

300
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,700
Of course not.

301
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,260
There's enough for everyone.

302
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,010
Hurry up.

303
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,580
Haidong.

304
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,430
Pass them out sparingly.

305
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,670
What's his is mine.

306
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,550
You're not even married yet,

307
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,120
and you're starting to save up for him.

308
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,810
Nonsense. I married him a long time ago.

309
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,720
It's all my money that he's giving out now.

310
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,770
His money is mine.

311
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,540
They should get it.

312
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,700
They've been waiting with you since morning.

313
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,760
I'm not saying not to give them at all.

314
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,870
I've already prepared my share.

315
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,700
Come on.

316
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,490
Me too.

317
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,900
Me too.

318
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,340
Thank you.

319
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:54,980
Thank you.

320
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,700
Thank you.

321
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,300
Thank you.

322
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,600
When will you get married?

323
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,600
They look great together.

324
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,420
Okay, let's go to the restaurant.

325
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,460
♫I want to watch the sunrise with you♫

326
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,360
♫I close my eyes and make a wish♫

327
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,430
♫Your shadow becomes further with the long road♫

00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,560
♫It becomes the truth of my empty dream♫

00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,430

♫The wind will blow towards the snowfield♫

331

♫I'm willing to♫

♫You're at the end of my dream♫

349

Chen.

350
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,540
Can't take it anymore?

351
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,180
♫Maybe I've been living my whole life♫

352
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,820
Look at you untying your tie and ready to go to the bridal chamber.

353
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:26,340
♫Waiting for the dawn to meet you♫

354
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,130
You don't want to go back, do you?

355
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,220
No, I dare not.

356
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,280
I wouldn't dare to.

357
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,640
♫You are all my desire♫

358
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,960
OK, the last part of the ceremony.

359
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,680
Let the groom give his speech.

360
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:39,300
♫I just want to hold you tight♫

361
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,540
After that,

362
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,140
we should enjoy ourselves.

363
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,990
There's a room upstairs all ready.

364
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,380
Feel free to sleep there.

365
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,710
Here.

366
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:40,780
Thank you

367
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,060
for taking care of my wife all these years.

368
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,390
We are friends forever.

369
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,390
The year I met my wife,

370
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,630
I met my wife under the tree

371
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,210
at the north side of our high school's sports field.

372
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,780
When I saw her,

373
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,570
I had this thought.

374
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,950
Where did such a beautiful girl

375
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,650
come from?

376
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,540
Before I met her,

377
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,620
I've never heard of

378
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,660
the name Gui Xiao.

379
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,050
It was like

380
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,820
we were in

381
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,020
two parallel worlds.

382
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,500
Until that day,

383
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,740
my cousin brought her to me.

384
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,850
At the school's sports field.

385
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,280
That one time,

386
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,000
made me remember her name.

387
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,180
Gui Xiao.

388
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,910
"Gui" meaning "the way back home".

389
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,750
"Xiao" meaning "the dawn of the morning".

390
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,100
I told you.

391
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,300
You fell in love with her at first sight.

392
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,220
Kiss her. Stop being sentimental.

393
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:28,820
Just kiss.

394
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,620
Yes.

395
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,580
Yes, kiss her.

396
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,380
Kiss! Kiss!

397
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,900
Kiss! Kiss!

398
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,560
Captain Lu,

399
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,140
today is not the time to be reserved.

400
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,400
Come on, give her a kiss.

401
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,610
Yes, kiss her.

402
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,500
Kiss! Kiss!

403
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,060
Don't do it for real.

404
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,120
There are so many people here.

405
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,520
Just give me a token kiss.

406
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:38,960
Uncle.

407
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,020
-Uncle. -Uncle.

408
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,140
-Nice to meet you. -Good.

409
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,800
Good. Good.

410
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,260
Are you Lu Chen’s colleagues?

411
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,050
Yes. Yes.

412
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,350
Uncle, I'm not.

413
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,270
No one's talking about you.

414
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,130
You're treating us differently.

415
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,950
Hurry up.

416
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,380
Help your brother drink.

417
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,370
OK.

418
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,290
Sit down.

419
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,670
Have a smoke.

420
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,230
Thank you, uncle. I don't smoke.

421
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:05,830
OK. OK.

422
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,260
Thank you for teaching our Captain Lu well.

423
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,000
I didn't teach him well.

424
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,360
But another elder of his.

425
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,860
His uncle did.

426
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,270
He taught him well.

427
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,110
He's an upright person.

428
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,670
He's in the same profession as you.

429
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,650
But he got sick and passed on.

430
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,390
Although Lu Chen is my biological son,

431
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,100
his temperament and character

432
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,300
is all like his uncle.

433
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,690
His uncle is a good man.

434
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:51,460
Gui Xiao.

435
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,460
Eat more.

436
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,180
Soon it'll be time to propose the toasts with our guests.

437
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,580
How many tables are left?

438
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,000
More than half.

439
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,000
Take your time.

440
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,860
No need to toast everyone.

441
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,220
When you pass every table later,

442
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,460
just greet the elders.

443
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,660
I'll drink with them.

444
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,220
Tell me which one you want to eat.

445
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,150
Shall we have...

446
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,360
Fish, how about fish?

447
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:13,890
This one.

448
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,330
That one?

449
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,620
Have some fish first,

450
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,820
and then eat that, ok?

451
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,420
No.

452
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,880
You don't want to eat this?

453
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,860
No.

454
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,480
Come on.

455
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,620
It’s almost time, Lu Chen.

456
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,860
It’s time to propose a toast.

457
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,190
Okay.

458
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,250
The liquor in the hands of the groomsmen and bridesmaids

459
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,450
are mixed with water.

460
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,460
We are all in the same boat.

461
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,550
Don't drink too much later.

462
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,700
You'll feel uncomfortable

463
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,980
even if it's mixed with water.

464
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,840
Just let them drink with Haidong.

465
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,450
Does Haidong have a grudge against you?

466
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,180
No.

467
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,460
Isn’t he Lu Chen’s best friend?

468
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,900
It's his time to shine now.

469
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,630
Mom.

470
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,780
Is the one sitting next to him

471
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,710
his girlfriend?

472
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:56,830
Yes.

473
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,390
She's pretty.

474
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,350
I think so too.

475
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:00,990
Chu Yang.

476
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:03,900
Chu Yang.

477
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:04,940
Today

478
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,630
is your parents' big event.

479
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,290
I'll eat with you, okay?

480
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,340
What about mommy?

481
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,600
I'll accompany you, okay?

482
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,870
Let me carry you.

483
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,270
Come, let daddy carry you.

484
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:15,600
Come.

485
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,030
Come with me.

486
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,050
Come here.

487
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,120
I miss mommy.

488
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,310
Here she is.

489
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,040
Yes. I'm here.

490
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,120
Here you are.

491
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,040
Eat slowly.

492
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,200
Come on, I'm ready.

493
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:44,840
Hello?

494
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,880
You finally know how to call.

495
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,620
Lu Chen is beside me.

496
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,140
Do you want to talk?

497
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,780
I just called him

498
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,020
several times just now,

499
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,220
but he didn't answer.

500
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,050
Yes, he was toasting.

501
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,590
I'll give him the phone.

502
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,450
You talk to him.

503
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,820
Qin Mingyu.

504
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:09,490
Hello?

505
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,100
Groom,

506
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,060
we old subordinates

507
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,020
can't go over there.

508
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,980
But we're wishing you congratulations

509
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,740
here in Qining.

510
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,760
Captain Lu.

511
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,860
I’m Zhong.

512
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,570
Congratulations on your wedding.

513
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,300
Congratulations, Captain Lu.

514
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,220
Captain Lu, say hello to sister-in-law for me.

515
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,300
We won’t give her

516
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,360
a call separately.

517
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,190
Captain Lu, congratulations.

518
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,140
Congratulations!

519
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,600
Thanks.

520
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,420
Take care of your wedding guests over there.

521
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,500
When you and Guixiao are free, come back to Qining.

522
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,660
We'll hold a special wedding banquet for you,

523
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,140
Qining SWAT style.

524
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,210
Okay.

525
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:54,730
All right.

526
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,770
The bridesmaid is going to continue the toasting.

527
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,170
I'll talk to you tonight.

528
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,390
You underestimate me.

529
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:01,850
Bye.

530
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,440
Let me see.

531
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,220
Is it good?

532
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,320
Have some more.

533
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,000
Many people are waiting.

534
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,620
You too.

535
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,760
Cheers.

536
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,070
Chen.

537
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,220
Come on.

538
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,710
Wait.

539
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,980
Who wants to make Chen drink

540
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,470
has to go through me first.

541
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,160
Chen

542
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,220
will be going back to the city after the wedding.

543
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,760
I'll still be staying here.

544
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,710
We'll meet every day.

545
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,950
It won't be good if you

546
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,580
get me too drunk, right?

547
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,310
I dare not.

548
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,300
Let's just drink a little.

549
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,020
For the customs.

550
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,340
Yes.

551
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,650
Congratulations, Lu Chen.

552
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,550
Bottoms up.

553
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,280
Haidong.

554
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,970
It's not your wedding today.

555
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,810
Why are you more...

556
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,820
Lu Chen’s wedding is my wedding.

557
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,370
It’s the same.

558
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,280
Cheers.

559
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,540
Okay.

560
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,540
See you tomorrow.

561
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,950
The sofa and room upstairs

562
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,040
are all available today.

563
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,450
Okay.

564
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,300
Come here.

565
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,070
Help the guests up.

566
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,500
Let them sleep in

567
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,900

It used to be there.

759
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,180
After that I got familiar with

760
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,310
the lady boss there.

761
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,670
She often talked to me

762
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,200
about the students nearby.

763
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,380
You were famous.

764
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,060
We talked a lot about you.

765
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,960
What's this reaction?

766
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,580
I knew you liked me.

767
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,040
Otherwise,

768
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,300
you wouldn't have played that game with me.

769
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,380
Didn't this place

770
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,830
used to be a snack store?

771
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,710
I remember the snack store had

772
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,630
two doors.

773
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,580
One facing the school,

774
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,840
and the other outside.

775
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,450
When you were repeating that year,

776
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,410
I remember once

777
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,900
I went in through the door

778
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
facing the school,

779
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,260
and you just came in from the door

780
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,390
outside the school.

781
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,420
Did you know?

782
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,820
All the girls in the store

783
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,950
were peeping at you.

784
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,410
I didn't peep. I just stared.

785
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,160
It seems familiar.

786
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,430
What?

787
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,470
I've heard of it before.

788
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:14,810
You've told this story

789
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,060
many times.

790
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,910
Did I?

791
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,900
I haven't told it many times.

792
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,340
Hey there,

793
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,620
no one is having classes today.

794
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,680
Is there anything I can help you with?

795
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,050
We'd like to go in to have a look.

796
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,780
I'm your principal's brother.

797
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,860
But the doors to the teaching buildings are locked.

798
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,420
Are you going to the teaching buildings?

799
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,750
There's no one in there.

800
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,780
Then we won't go to the teaching buildings,

801
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,220
but to the areas next to it,

802
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:42,950
is that okay?

803
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:43,520
Okay.

804
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,380
You can take a walk there.

805
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,140
No problem.

806
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,060
Let's go to the sports field.

807
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,390
Okay.

808
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,360
Okay, go ahead.

809
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,010
Thank you.

810
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:50,340
Okay.

811
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,230
It's summer.

812
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,930
And they're visiting the sports field.

813
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,130
That's enough.

814
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,480
Come here.

815
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,400
It's too sunny.

816
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,310
You're getting sunburnt.

817
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,420
Are you tired?

818
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,200
A little.

819
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,180
My brother-in-law's bike

820
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,010
is at school.

821
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,820
He just passed me the key.

822
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,360
You've thought this through.

823
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,420
But we've walked everywhere.

824
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,830
Where else can we go?

825
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,350
A place you must want to go.

826
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,460
Young man,

827
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,740
no bicycles are allowed on campus.

828
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,980
Okay.

829
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,370
Done.

830
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:54,610
Here.

831
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,910
Everyone's puzzled at us

832
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,000
riding a bike here.

833
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,110
You wait here. I'll buy some water.

834
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:17,770
Okay.

835
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,450
Do you have money with you?

836
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:20,880
Yes.

837
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,200
It can still last me a few days.

838
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,230
Let me ask you again.

839
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,470
Do you still remember who I am?

840
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,270
♫Turning around and brushing past♫

841
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,860
♫I'm the only one left in the world♫

842
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,930
Do you still remember who I am?

843
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,120
♫Waiting for fate to take its course♫

844
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,300
Yes.

845
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,220
♫Listen to the sound of approaching footsteps♫

846
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,460
I'll remember you even if you turn into ashes.

847
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,310
♫In a flash, I'm not paying attention♫

848
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,940
♫The whole heart has fallen and lost its soul♫

849
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:28,840
[All these years, there were always traces of you by my side. In Qining's wind, in Beijing's dust.]

850
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:28,840
[It was like you were everywhere, but no sign of you when I turn around to look for you. Who doesn't have regrets travelling through the dusty time?]

851
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:28,840
[We will get to wait for the break of dawn to shine on the way back] [Road Home]

852
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,900
♫I accept the push of destiny♫

853
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,870
♫And embrace the extraordinary love♫

854
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,640
Yes.

855
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,550
♫Could you hear?♫

856
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,000
I'll remember you even if you turn into ashes.

857

♫Several years♫

858
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,230
Let's make up.

859
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:43,520
♫Ask for my soul's overall desire♫

860
