I can't send you home.

10
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,120
I can go back by myself.

11
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,240
I'm not a child.

12
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,580
I'll call you when I get off the plane.

Go now.

Congratulations on getting married.

Captain Lu is assisting at Gonghai for a month.

He's very near us.

37
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,160
Great!

No need to wait for the weekend.

41
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,060
They're short of manpower.

42
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,620

there

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,160
Good.

Captain Lu.

47

You’ve all met Captain Lu.

48
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,930
I don't have to introduce you again.

49
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,590
Captain Lu, here is the thing.

50
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,020
They've set up

51
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,270
a base station here.

52
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,350
Yesterday, they dug up many bombs like this

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,780
left behind by the war

54
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,240
at the construction site.

55
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,690
We've surveyed the area.

56
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,420
There are many bombs like this.

57
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,350
A civil explosives company like ours

58
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,570
should be able to handle this.

59
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,100
However,

60
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,050
the terrain here is complicated.

61
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,630
That's why

62
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,230
we've invited you to help us.

63

Let's go in and take a look.

64
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,340
Okay. This way, please.

65
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,170
Look.

66
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:54,930
Here.

67
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,970
Hello, Mr. Shen.

68
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,060
Captain Lu.

69
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,100
Look.

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,250
These...

71
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,130
These bombs

72
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,100
are all awaiting disposal.

73
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,650
Considering that

74
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,970
accumulating too many explosives

75
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,730
here

76
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,810
might be dangerous,

77
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,970
we should transport them away

78
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,990
once we reach a certain number of them.

79
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,300
There are so many bombs.

80
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,910
The climate here is unpredicatable.

81
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,330
We must install a lightning protection system nearby

82
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,460
as soon as possible.

83
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,220
Captain Lu.

84
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,610
You are truly a professional.

85
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,340
Don't worry.

86
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,480
I've made all the arrangements.

87
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,770
Let's take a look outside.

88
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,220
Okay.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,640
These bombs

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,170
are all of different types.

91
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,159
There are different

92
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:51,690
cautionary measures

93
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,220
when handling each of them.

94
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,960
For example,

95
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,420
the fuze of this bomb is at the top.

96
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,490
There's a primer at the base of that bomb

97
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,600
for launching,

98
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,390
but it also has a fuze

99
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,570
at the top.

100
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,150
Moreover,

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,280
the anti-tank and anti-personnel mines

102
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,080
we saw just now

103
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,770
must all be handled carefully.

104
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,170
Yes.

105
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,210
That's why we asked

106
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,450
your team for help.

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,130
However,

108
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,490
the SWAT team here is newly established.

109
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,450
I'm the only experienced member

110
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,720
of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team.

111
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,050
There are so many bombs.

112
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:20,950
I'll go back

113
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,000
to discuss this with my commanding officer

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,890
and request additional manpower.

115
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,530
Okay.

116
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,390
Captain Lu,

117
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,890
the diagrams you provided us with

118
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,930
last time

119
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,330
were immensely helpful.

120
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,700
Now that we are collaborating again,

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,659
I must learn all I can from you.

122
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,210
Mr. Shen,

123
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,409
your opinions

124
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,020
are as valuable as mine.

125
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,120
Captain Lu, go check out

126
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,340
the accomodations.

127
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,770
Our company set it up.

128
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,560
We will be eating and living together

129
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
like colleagues.

130
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,640
Yes, Captain Lu.

131
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,010
We cleared a room for you

132
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,210
in the workers' dorm.

133
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,060
The living arrangements are not ideal.

134
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,730
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,400
Not at all.

136
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,610
I'll ask the team

137
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,930
to send the people and things here.

138
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,290
Sure.

139
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,670
Let me tell you a secret.

140
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,220
What secret?

141
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,760
I'm married.

142
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,710
It's legal.

143
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,310
We have a certificate.

144
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,650
When did this happen?

145
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,860
A couple of days ago.

146
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,360
I couldn't hold it in anymore.

147
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,490
I finally said it.

148
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,830
I haven't told anyone before.

149
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,290
It was like a secret affair.

150
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,610
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

151
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,680
I'll buy you a big meal.

152
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,940
How about lunch today?

153
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,810
All you care about is eating.

154
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,030
Work is hard.

155
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,220
Only eating can relieve our worries.

156
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,210
How do you feel?

157
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,690
How do I feel?

158
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,820
I feel a sense of belonging,

159
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,890
the kind of contentment that comes

160
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,770
after everything has settled.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,130
The feeling of home?

162
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,830
The feeling of home.

163
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,530
What are you looking at?

164
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,890
I want to see what's different

165
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,150
about a married woman.

166
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,530
What is it?

167
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,920
Nothing yet.

168
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,880
You are still so young and beautiful.

169
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,670
Captain Lu.

170
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,010
Are you calling your partner?

171
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,370
Yes.

172
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,410
I'm making use of the free time while we eat.

173
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,010
Say hello to your partner for me.

174
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:53,340
Okay.

175
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:34,920
Excuse me.

176
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,650
My husband is calling.

177
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,800
I'll take it outside.

178
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,080
Take care of her for a moment.

179
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,770
I didn't expect you

180
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,700
to be so whipped.

181
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,490
Just call him back later.

182
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,650
Yes.

183
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,850
You should let men

184
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,130
feel anxious.

185
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,160
His situation makes it troublesome for him to call.

186
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Enjoy your meal. I'll be right back.

187
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,870
Her husband's job must be really special.

188
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,070
He doesn't even have time to make a call.

189
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,480
I heard her father's company

190
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,450
is a publicly listed company.

191
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:56,880
He's probably

192
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,410
from a similar background.

193
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,440
You're wrong.

194
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,570
Her husband is a SWAT officer.

195
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,330
He does explosive ordnance disposal.

196
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,250
There is no cell phone reception

197
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,710
at his latest assignment.

198
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,010
Every time he wants to make a call,

199
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,960
he has to drive out

200
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,330
at least 5 kilometers to get cellular signal.

201
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,770
Apparently, he often calls from mountains.

202
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,590
The signal gets blocked

203
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,190
every time a cloud passes by.

204
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,920
It's not easy to make a call.

205
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
He can't call from his place of work?

206
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
SWAT teams work at the front line

207
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,650
and there is always risk of danger.

208
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,360
It's beyond our imagination.

209
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,950
Did you climb a mountain today

210
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,650
or are you with the team?

211
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,750
The weather is nice today.

212
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,010
I'm on a mountain.

213
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,100
Is it hot over there?

214
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,060
It's getting hot these days.

215
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,560
Long time no see. Do you miss me?

216
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,010
Yes.

217
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,070
But there's nothing we can do.

218
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,810
We might only get to meet again

219
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,970
in the middle of summer.

220
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,050
Yes.

221
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,210
There have been some emergencies

222
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,820
at the new city.

223
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,320
The original timeframe of the mission

224
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,410
may be delayed.

225
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,460
It'll take a long time.

226
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,360
Hello?

227
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,200
What mountain are you on?

228
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,380
The signal is so bad.

229
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,840
How many days of annual leave do you still have?

230
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,500
All of them.

231
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,280
Do you want to go on a trip?

232
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:18,960
Where?

233
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:19,870
Gonghai.

234
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,050
You want to find your husband?

235
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,470
You don't want to see Captain Qin?

236
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,920
Why would I

237
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,480
want to see him?

238
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,730
You work so hard

239
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,610
looking after his child

240
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,560
all the time.

241
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,170
You must have so much to say to him.

242
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,530
You've overestimated me.

243
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,520
I'm always cold

244
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,650
towards strangers.

245
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,770
You two

246
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,300
are not strangers anymore.

247
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,090
You call each other every week.

248
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,240
You're very good friends.

249
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,250
Not really.

250
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,350
We only talk about education.

251
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,710
That's fine.

252
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,790
You've never been married,

253
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,200
but you're turning into a parenting expert.

254
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,330
Are you going or not?

255
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,330
I...

256
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,850
Let me hesitate for a few seconds.

257
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,160
One.

258
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,570
Two.

259
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:58,810
Three.

260
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,410
I'm going.

261
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,210
I'm going.

262
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,070
Happy?

263
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,920
That's right.

264
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,600
Come on.

265
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,490
I'm worried about you.

266
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,090
I have to take care of you.

267
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,310
Thank you.

268
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,570
It's great there.

269
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,630
You will definitely like it there.

270
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,130
You won't be disappointed.

271
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,520
Besides, Gonghai is very near Qining.

272
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,900
It's only half an hour by car.

273
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,210
Let's take time off and go on holiday there.

274
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,480
I'll think about it.

275
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,660
Don't.

276
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,640
It's settled.

277
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,210
Hello?

278
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,640
I'm lucky.

279
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,500
I suddenly got a signal.

280
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,040
I'll visit you next week.

281
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,100
It's dangerous if you run around now.

282
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,170
What danger?

283
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,230
I can't tell at all.

284
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,180
It's settled.

285
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:54,890
Hello?

286
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,210
♫I wish I could go back to my hometown♫

287
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,870
♫To be by her side again♫

288
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,310
♫To see her kindness and gentleness♫

289
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,000
♫To soothe my broken heart♫

290
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,610
♫How much I want to go back home♫

291
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,320
♫To be by her side again♫

292
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,770
♫To see her kindness and gentleness♫

293
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,860
♫To soothe my broken heart♫

294
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,110
How much weight are you intending to gain this time?

295
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,240
♫The year you set off into the twilight♫

296
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,020
We'll talk about it when we get back.

297
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,750
There's no weight I can't lose.

298
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,580
That's right.

299
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,600
♫You thought there was something there♫

300
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,260
You're the only person

301
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,870
whom I will concede

302
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,460
has as much willpower as I do.

303
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,780
♫Look at the strange gazes around you♫

304
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,860
What about a certain captain?

305
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,760
♫No one is by my side when I wake up in the morning♫

306
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,460
He's on a higher level than I am.

307
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,800
By the way,

308
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,760
this weekend,

309
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,090
Qin Mingyu has a day off.

310
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:52,070
♫The quiet rainy night reminds me of her♫

311
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,090
He'll head straight for Gonghai.

312
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,220
You’ll see him soon.

313
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,580
♫I still hear her asking me to stay♫

314
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,180
Luchen didn't tell him you're coming.

315
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,640
We'll give him a surprise.

316
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,670
Captain Lu.

317
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,570
The living conditions are good.

318
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,360
There's a bed to sleep on.

319
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,120
Your room

320
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
is a little dusty.

321
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,460
Wash it with some water.

322
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,140
What?

323
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,590
You asked me to come here

324
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,620
so I can spend my off day

325
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,210
cleaning for you?

326
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,570
I told you to clean up.

327
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,370
You came here just like that?

328
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,240
Why do you need a place

329
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,920
for the disposal of explosives

330
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,960
to be so clean?

331
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,600
My wife is coming today.

332
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,610
She's coming?

333
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:29,850
Not only that,

334
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,600
she's going to introduce a girlfriend to you.

335
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,360
What?

336
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,610
You don't want it?

337
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,090
It's too sudden.

338
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,540
Aren't you single?

339
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,140
I...

340
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,130
My current situation

341
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,060
is a bit special.

342
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,090
What's going on?

343
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,070
I don't want to meet new girls.

344
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,200
You want to be single forever?

345
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,000
That's not it.

346
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,490
Alright.

347
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,040
I won't introduce you a girlfriend.

348
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,570
Okay?

349
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,930
Just meet her as a friend.

350
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,370
Fine.

351
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:56,940
I'm not

352
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,810
good at talking.

353
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,240
When we see your partner,

354
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,590
if I say anything wrong,

355
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,570
-don't take offense. -Let's go.

356
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,100
Let's go.

357
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,190
[Baby]

358
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,540
Slow down.

359
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,170
You didn't get heavier.

360
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,050
Of course not.

361
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,810
Why did you ask me to change my route?

362
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,940
It was a long detour.

363
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,480
[Baby]

364
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,250
He drove by that day

365
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,680
and specially made the sign.

366
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,080
Hello.

367
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,420
Hello.

368
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,210
We meet again.

369
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,270
Yes, we meet again.

370
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,290
There's one more person.

371
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,490
Guess who I am.

372
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:05,819
Duan Rou?

373
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,300
There are only two words.

374
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,290
Did you need to think about it for so long?

375
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,020
Captain Qin.

376
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:13,740
No.

377
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,210
I- I thought about it.

378
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,920
At first, I wanted to call you Miss Duan Rou.

379
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,430
But then I remembered you asked me

380
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,300
not to call you "Miss," because it's too formal.

381
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,849
So I had to switch.

382
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,540
Why are you nervous?

383
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,580
Who's nervous?

384
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,780
I'm afraid I might say something wrong.

385
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,430
Welcome to Gonghai.

386
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,720
Thank you, Captain Qin.

387
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,720
You drive.

388
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,970
We'll take the same car.

389
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,170
You two take that one.

390
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:41,680
Okay.

391
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,540
We'll take the same car?

392
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,630
Calm down.

393
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,090
You got scared twice within a minute.

394
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,950
I didn't train you to be like this.

395
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,280
Who says I'm not calm?

396
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:52,990
Let's go.

397
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,070
Let's go first.

398
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,450
Okay.

399
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,980
Have you had enough?

400
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,580
No.

401
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,570
We haven't seen each other in over a month.

402
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,970
I want to look at you more.

403
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,640
I'll take you to the town.

404
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,110
Will you sleep with me tonight?

405
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:42,880
Yes.

406
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,100
Speak more gently.

407
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,370
Yes.

408
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,720
I miss you.

409
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,100
I'm driving.

410
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,430
Don't touch me.

411
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:54,910
No.

412
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,150
I want to touch you.

413
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,870
I haven't seen you in a month.

414
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,740
Captain Qin.

415
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,900
Yes, I'm here.

416
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,230
Where are we going now?

417
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,640
A town.

418
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,250
Police

419
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,950
work in secured areas.

420
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,280
It's not convenient.

421
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,650
I understand.

422
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,890
Can you play some music?

423
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,260
Sure.

424
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,010
Sure.

425
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,700
It's quite hot here.

426
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,210
It's okay.

427
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,250
It's colder than Beijing.

428
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,610
Are you usually busy with work?

429
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,740
I'm usually quite busy at work.

430
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,660
Are you thirsty?

431
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,880
A little.

432
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,950
Let me find it.

433
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,770
I know this car better than you.

434
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:19,880
Yes.

435
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,730
Why aren't you saying anything?

436
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,810
I keep talking.

437
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,810
and you keep saying "hum".

438
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,450
I thought

439
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,050
you didn't want to talk to me.

440
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,770
That's not it.

441
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,270
My throat hurts.

442
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,960
I can't really speak.

443
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,900
Are you sick?

444
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,200
Let me take you to the hospital.

445
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,230
It's a minor illness.

446
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,140
A minor illness will

447
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,540
become a serious disease if you leave it be.

448
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,980
You can't take it lightly.

449
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,040
I've brought medicine, Captain Qin.

450
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,760
I know what to do.

451
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,020
You really don't need to go to the hospital?

452
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,770
No.

453
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,810
I think...

454
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,930
if you don't feel well, just go.

455
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,310
Are you always

456
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,080
this fussy at work?

457
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:08,680
I...

458
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,740
I'm decisive.

459
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,700
Decisive?

460
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,610
I can't tell.

461
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,500
Really.

462
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,520
I'm always very firm

463
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,460
with the team.

464
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,720
You're taking it too seriously.

465
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,310
Did you

466
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,330
make a wrong turn?

467
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,020
Impossible.

468
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,930
There are no cars ahead.

469
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,740
It seems I've really made a wrong turn.

470
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,770
I got distracted

471
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,970
talking to you.

472
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,490
They're not there.

473
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,760
Maybe he's nervous

474
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,760
because he's with

475
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,050
the girl he likes,

476
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,630
so he's not keeping his eyes on the road.

477
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,750
He likes Duan Rou?

478
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,410
Did he tell you?

479
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,290
No.

480
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,000
But I've been working with him for a long time.

481
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,600
I can tell.

482
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,650
I think

483
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,820
Duan Rou likes him too.

484
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,730
Why don't we set them up?

485
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,100
I think we should

486
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,890
let them go with the flow.

487
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,170
Qin Mingyu is stationed at Qining.

488
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,370
If they get together,

489
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,840
it'll be a long-distance relationship.

490
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,720
And this job

491
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,260
basically has no vacation days.

492
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,050
You have to think it through.

493
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,730
But aren't you the same?

494
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,790
After my mission, I’ll go back to Tianwen.

495
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,720
He's different.

496
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:00,970
It's a problem.

497
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,030
Whatever will be will be.

498
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,900
If they really fall in love,

499
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,850
they will think about

500
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,050
these practical problems themselves.

501
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,220
He went the wrong way.

502
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,190
I wasn't paying attention.

503
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,570
It's your first time meeting.

504
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,230
Keep the number of times

505
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,290
you embarrass yourself under three.

506
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:51,990
Qin Mingyu.

507
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,720
Don't embarrass the SWAT team.

508
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,850
Who's embarrassing?

509
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,040
Duan Rou's throat was inflamed.

510
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,970
I got her water.

511
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,210
Be careful of the sun, you might get freckles.

512
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,720
It's okay. It's not far.

513
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,650
You're different. Pay attention to this.

514
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,890
Otherwise, you'll be depressed

515
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,150
when you get freckles.

516
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,730
You are quite considerate.

517
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,490
No way, Officer Qin.

518
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,950
You've just realized?

519
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,580
I've been taking care of your son for so long.

520
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,690
Have I made any mistakes?

521
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,290
No, no.

522
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,220
Absolutely not.

523
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,780
Where do you want to eat?

524
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,630
You have no recommendations?

525
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,080
I don't come here often.

526
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,170
This one

527
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,390
looks clean.

528
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,490
Captain Lu

529
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,410
looks like a normal person

530
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,690
when he's with his wife.

531
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,780
When he's alone,

532
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,670
he's a machine-like workaholic.

533
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,960
The second time.

534
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,840
Cut the crap.

535
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,990
You know this place well.

536
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,590
You order.

537
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,770
Did the doctor mention any dietary restrictions?

538
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,130
No.

539
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:31,960
I'll order then.

540
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,790
Come back soon.

541
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,080
Did you two not talk on the way here?

542
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,740
Did you drive here in silence?

543
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,330
-We talked.
-We talked.

544
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,580
You're acting like strangers.

545
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,250
That's him.

546
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,740
I'm not being awkward.

547
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,020
I have a sore throat, so I can't say much.

548
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,820
It's my fault.

549
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,500
I'm not good at holding a coversation,

550
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,830
especially with girls.

551
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,960
Weren't you married?

552
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,800
We were set up.

553
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,930
You were set up?

554
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,630
You must talk during blind dates, right?

555
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,760
I've never been on a blind date though.

556
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,780
We didn't say much.

557
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,680
Anyway, it was different from today.

558
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,140
During blind dates,

559
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,590
we talk about our jobs,

560
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,280
how much we earn,

561
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,640
and whether we own a house

562
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,420
and a car.

563
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,600
That's boring.

564
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,900
It is.

565
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,170
I have only

566
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,050
been on two blind dates.

567
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,890
The second time,

568
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,650
I thought we were suitable for each other.

569
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,400
We didn't get to know each other properly

570
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,660
before we got married.

571
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,300
You got married just like that?

572
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,380
That's rash.

573
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,140
At that time,

574
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,950
we both wanted to get married.

575
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,350
We thought we were suitable for each other,

576
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,120
so...

577
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,970
We were also from the same hometown.

578
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:56,850
So we didn't think too much

579
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,110
before we got married.

580
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,330
Weren't you afraid

581
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,160
you wouldn't get along after getting married

582
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,640
because you didn't have feelings for each other?

583
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,060
I'd never had a girlfriend before.

584
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,130
Later...

585
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,120
He's a simple guy.

586
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,930
He thought there wouldn't be any major problems

587
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,460
since their circumstances were compatible.

588
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,980
It was mostly because he lacked experience in relationships.

589
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,890
We win.

590
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,850
So even though he looks

591
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,410
like a single father—

592
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,340
Wait.

593
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,440
he actually doesn't know how to date.

594
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,630
Can't you say something nice?

595
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,920
Who doesn't know how to date?

596
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,530
Am I wrong?

597
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,550
Should I say

598
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,310
you've had a lot of experience with relationships?

599
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,940
Who has been in a relationship?

600
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,640
You have two options.

601
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,300
Choose one.

602
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,160
Have you ordered?

603
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,070
Where do you think I just went?

604
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,850
They came all the way here.

605
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,670
We should order more.

606
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,600
I'll go order a couple more dishes.

607
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,250
Duan Rou.

608
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,430
Thank you for taking care of my son.

609
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:54,770
No need.

610
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,010
It'll be a waste if we can't finish it.

611
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:56,610
It's okay.

612
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,950
We can take them home if we can't finish.

613
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,880
It's not a waste.

614
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,010
Let him order.

615
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,640
He kept telling me about you,

616
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,690
about how grateful he was towards you

617
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,420
and how he couldn't express it.

618
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,650
You wouldn't accept money,

619
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,360
and he doesn't know

620
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,490
how to choose gifts.

621
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,170
But trust me.

622
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,930
He is genuinely grateful towards you.

623
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,160
There's no need for a gift.

624
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,860
I'm taking care of his kid because I want to.

625
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,920
If I didn't want to,

626
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,050
no one can force me.

627
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,790
I have something to discuss with you.

628
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,530
Go ahead.

629
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,470
I rarely see my wife.

630
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,600
Let's sit at separate tables.

631
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:39,610
Separate tables?

632
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,130
Why?

633
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,070
You guys can talk about the kid.

634
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,070
We'll talk about our relationship.

635
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,290
Right.

636
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,120
They don't want to listen to us

637
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,180
talk about the kid.

638
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,000
They haven't seen each other for a long time.

639
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,280
Let's not disturb them.

640
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,990
That's right.

641
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,250
Let's sit separately.

642
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,340
Time is precious.

643
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,340
Don't disturb us.

644
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,590
Okay.

645
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,990
Let's sit separately.

646
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,160
Duan Rou is very nice.

647
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,980
She'd already gotten her marriage registered,

648
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,570
but before they had the wedding,

649
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,830
they got divorced over

650
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,120
premarital assets.

651
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,570
She wanted to sign a prenuptial agreement,

652
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,700
but the guy refused.

653
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,890
Later, she told me

654
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,060
she wanted to find

655
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,520
an independent boyfriend

656
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,340
so that she could focus on work.

657
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,250
She's on business trips

658
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,600
for over 200 days a year.

659
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,970
Also, she likes

660
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,790
well-adjusted men

661
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,850
who have their own pursuits.

662
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,610
She doesn't want someone who

663
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,130
constantly makes trouble

664
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,700
over property, children, or housework.

665
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,150
From this perspective,

666
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,830
Qin Mingyu is perfect.

667
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,950
Qin Mingyu

668
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,400
has been conquered by Duan Rou.

669
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,960
Thank you.

670
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,430
Stop looking at them.

671
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,040
Look at me.

672
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Look at your wife.

673
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,470
By the way,

674
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,450
I have something to tell you.

675
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,800
These are my bank accounts.

676
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,800
The passwords,

677
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:38,920
ATM PINs,

678
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,960
and online banking passwords are all here.

679
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,820
The stocks and funds are here too.

680
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,990
I don't know if you know how to handle these.

681
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,560
You probably don't buy these,

682
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,570
right?

683
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,160
We have a safe at home.

684
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,680
It can be opened by password or fingerprint identification.

685
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,310
The password is your birthday.

686
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,310
My most valuable things are inside.

687
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,270
What are you doing?

688
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,860
Listen carefully.

689
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,410
There are medical risks

690
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,910
in giving birth,

691
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,090
for example, amniotic fluid embolism.

692
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,590
Resuscitation is difficult.

693
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,670
What if something happens?

694
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,600
You need to know where to put these.

695
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,360
You are not at home very often,

696
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,520
and you don't care about these things.

697
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,010
Don't look at me like that.

698
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,610
If something happens,

699
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,050
it'll be troublesome if you don't know.

700
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,020
Don't look at me like that.

701
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,890
I have another bank card

702
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,050
with a million RMB in it.

703
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,670
It's for my mother's retirement.

704
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,530
Keep it in mind,

705
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,590
but don't tell her.

706
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,140
You worry too much.

707
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,650
He who has no anxious thoughts for the future will find trouble right at hand.

708
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,910
Do you regret it?

709
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,770
You're only asking after I've married you.

710
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,000
What I regret the most

711
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,090
is not seeing you

712
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,420
that year you came back.

713
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,450
If I had seen you,

714
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,310
I would have pinned you to the bed.

715
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,130
I regretted this

716
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,570
for a few days.

717
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,570
I couldn't sleep.

718
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,800
How old were you then?

719
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,770
Would you have dared?

720
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,690
Yes.

721
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,330
If you dare, I do too.

722
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,370
Supplements for anemia.

723
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,790
Vitamins.

724
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,650
And this.

725
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,290
Since I got pregnant, I've had hypothyroidism.

726
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,090
I have to take this to counter it.

727
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,310
I asked the doctor if there are side effects.

728
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:25,940
She said

729
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,800
there's a small probability

730
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,160
it will affect the baby's intelligence.

731
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,280
There's a certain chance

732
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,450
the baby might inherit hypothyroidism.

733
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,780
It's a very small probability.

734
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,710
Don't worry. I'm taking medicine.

735
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,840
I hope it won't happen.

736
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:57,820
Lu Chen.

737
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,550
I miss you so much.

738
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,330
Do you miss me?

739
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,290
Empty words

740
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,210
are always the same.

741
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,850
Do you miss me?

742
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:11,810
Yes.

743
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,720
Where are you going?

744
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,490
I'm going to get some water

745
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,550
for your foot bath.

746
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,130
As expected,

747
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,130
you should marry someone handsome.

748
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,960
Handsome people have better tempers.

749
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,290
Ugly men, on the other hand, are arrogant.

750
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,110
He has a bad temper.

751
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,650
When we were in school,

752
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,250
he always pulled a long face.

753
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,000
He terrified people without saying anything.

754
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:53,580
Here.

755
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,680
Massage my feet.

756
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:33,570
Lu Chen.

757
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,680
Where is your dog

758
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,520
now?

759
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,340
It's long gone.

760
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,550
What about it?

761
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,170
Do you remember

762
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,430
the first time you wrote me a love letter?

763
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,200
Are you sure it was a love letter?

764
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,980
[2009]

765
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,280
Hai Jianfeng.

766
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,520
Chen.

767
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,010
What are you doing so early in the morning?

768
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:21,940
Walking the dog.

769
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,870
You're early.

770
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,330
Help me send a letter

771
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,270
to Gui Xiao.

772
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,410
To who?

773
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,590
Gui Xiao, from your class.

774
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,370
You know each other?

775
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,610
Give it to her for me.

776
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:42,890
Go.

777
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,210
Here.

778
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,530
What?

779
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,960
I saw Chen walking his dog

780
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
on my way to school in the morning.

781
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,620
He asked me to pass this to you.

782
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:54,540
[Letter of Apology]

783
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,090
Hello.

784
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,590
You're not angry anymore?

785
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,750
It's okay.

786
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,970
In our class,

787
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,050
people make a fuss

788
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,610
over a boy and a girl talking.

789
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:17,410
I'm used to it.

790
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,930
You don't have to apologize

791
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:20,690
for this.

792
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,240
It's not true anyway.

793
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:26,610
It's my fault for making people misunderstand.

794
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,570
Have you recovered?

795
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,820
How did you know I was sick?

796
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,530
When I saw you along the corridor,

797
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,420
you were holding back a sneeze.

798
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,530
It was hard on you.

799
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,650
You noticed?

800
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,070
They're flirting.

801
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:41,670
Captain Lu.

802
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,800
Why didn’t you close the door?

803
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,540
The open door isn't an invitation to peep.

804
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,400
Do I need to peep

805
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,660
when your door is open?

806
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,250
Do not look at what is contrary to propriety.

807
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,380
You came uninvited.

808
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,150
I brought you some fruits.

809
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,470
Did I ask you to?

810
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,380
Enough.

811
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,110
We're not the only ones living here.

812
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,970
Close the door.

813
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,030
You've washed your feet?

814
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,890
Get some sleep.

815
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,000
And then?

816
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,610
And then?

817
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,410
I'm off today.

818
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,360
You look happy.

819
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,290
I'm glad you're not leaving.

820
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,530
Sleep with me.

821
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,000
It's broad daylight.

822
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,230
Let's take a nap.

823
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,360
Okay.

824
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:40,920
Let's take a nap.

825
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,080
I've never lived here.

826
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,240
I hope you can make yourself comfortable.

827
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,480
Of course.

828
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,130
I often go on business trips.

829
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,060
I go everywhere.

830
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,520
I'm not picky with food or accommodations.

831
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,290
What else

832
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,470
do you need?

833
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,930
We don't need anything else here.

834
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,140
That's good.

835
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,280
Do you usually

836
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,540
have a lot to say

837
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,000
to Lu Yanchen?

838
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,140
We've known each other for a long time.

839
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,640
When guys get together,

840
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,630
we talk more.

841
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,860
I don't know

842
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,080
what to talk about with girls.

843
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,990
Are you tired?

844
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:22,570
No.

845
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,920
Will you show me around?

846
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:26,620
Sure.

847
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,090
Where do you want to go? I'll take you there.

848
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,380
Is Qining nearby?
