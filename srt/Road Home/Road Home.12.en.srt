[Episode 12]

4
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,160
I have a call.

5
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,340
I need to answer a call.

6
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:54,650
Xiao,

7
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:55,900
how did you

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
come to know Chen?

9
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,240
He's my old classmate.

10
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,100
He reattended classes for a year

11
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,830
and happened to be in our grade.

12
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,210
Tell me

13
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,080
what Chen was like at school.

14
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,350
He...

15
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,270
was a student with PE specialties.

16
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,330
He had good grades.

17
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,100
Why did he reattend the class if he had good grades?

18
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,340
It was because of his family.

19
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,670
I knew it.

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,620
When I heard you say Chen has reattended classes before,

21
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,350
I am shocked.

22
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,810
He has been the best in the police force

23
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,870
since graduation.

24
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,370
Hello, who is this?

25
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,329
I'm Gui Yuanshan,

26
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,730
Gui Xiao's father.

27
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,790
You remember me, right?

28
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,020
Yes.

29
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,550
What can I do for you?

30
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,160
I just found out

31
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,030
you and Xiao are dating.

32
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,840
Right?

33
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,530
Yes.

34
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,800
Not long ago.

35
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,150
You're not a good match.

36
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,900
I have no complaints

37
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,870
about your job.

38
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,240
But your family,

39
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,450
your father.

40
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,350
Such a family doesn't deserve Xiao.

41
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,230
Why aren't you saying anything?

42
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,600
Am I not telling the truth?

43
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,680
Yes.

44
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,680
I admit that it is the truth.

45
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,440
But we are different.

46
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,640
If you want to be together,

47
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,730
Xiao will definitely meet your father.

48
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,390
With your family background,

49
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,950
how can you live a good life?

50
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,740
I remember

51
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,020
when I met you in Qining,

52
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,480
I also told you about this.

53
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,280
Back then, you were young and aggressive.

54
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,880
You said it was not a problem.

55
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,900
Now you have

56
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,930
your own career.

57
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,660
You've worked hard

58
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,450
in society.

59
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,450
It's time to be mature.

60
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,410
A man shouldn't bring trouble,

61
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,860
including trouble from his family of origin,

62
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,630
to a woman.

63
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,350
This is

64
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,740
very irresponsible.

65
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,800
If you like Xiao,

66
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,220
you should want her to be well

67
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,940
and to live comfortably.

68
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,400
You're not young anymore.

69
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,550
You are past the age of simply having a romantic relationship.

70
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,580
Now that you're together.

71
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,350
At this age,

72
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,900
you need to form a family.

73
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,350
The collisions between two families,

74
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,480
be they good or bad,

75
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,980
and the contradictions in values.

76
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,709
Have you ever thought about it?

77
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,380
Gui Xiao.

78
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,250
Your father.

79
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:04,900
Dad.

80
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,920
Xiao.

81
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,320
I talked a few words to him just now.

82
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,220
Your brother came to give his New Year blessing to me a few days ago

83
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,640
and mentioned

84
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,370
Lu Yanchen who had left Qining.

85
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,700
Didn't you break up earlier?

86
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,090
We've made up.

87
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,290
Did you ask him?

88
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,680
Or did he tell you

89
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,600
why he left Qining?

90
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:27,880
It's just

91
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,140
a normal job transfer.

92
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,740
You can ask him yourself.

93
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,540
He made a lot of contributions before this.

94
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,500
In Qining,

95
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,890
many higher-ups

96
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,150
spoke for him.

97
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,710
His new position was just confirmed,

98
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,020
but he wanted to leave Qining

99
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,060
and be transferred to a big city.

100
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,090
Xiao.

101
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,350
He came to you again.

102
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,540
But do you think

103
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,180
you still have feelings for each other?

104
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,980
He just wants to get close to you.

105
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,150
I've seen a lot of people like him.

106
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,780
Do you remember

107
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,110
Uncle Zhao's daughter?

108
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,460
It's because she's too naive.

109
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,060
He's not that kind of person.

110
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,720
I was the one who went to him.

111
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,910
To be precise, I begged him

112
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,060
to make up with me.

113
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,110
I disagree with your relationship.

114
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,120
Don't even think about getting married.

115
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,430
You can't see him

116
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,160
and his family clearly

117
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,700
because you are in a relationship.

118
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,330
He just wants to

119
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,540
change his life

120
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,570
by being with you.

121
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,030
No matter what,

122
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,670
this is my own business.

123
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,870
I'm going to hang up.

124
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,590
The signal is bad here.

125
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,860
My dad and I got cut off

126
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,000
after a few words.

127
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,910
Did you encounter the same

128
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,520
just now?

129
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,470
Why didn't you go in?

130
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,500
Your hands are freezing.

131
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,200
How can I get in

132
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,100
without finding you?

133
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,430
What did he say to you?

134
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:55,950
I forget.

135
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,830
I'm asking you seriously.

136
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,340
Come here.

137
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,760
You smell like a sheep.

138
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,520
You say it as if you don't have any.

139
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,060
We ate the mutton together.

140
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,220
A hero can't get over a beauty.

141
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,880
Captain Lu.

142
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,990
You've opened my eyes today.

143
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,430
But Captain Lu,

144
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
you're joking around

145
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,860
with Xiao

146
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,730
beside piles of frozen horse waste.

147
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,990
Aren't you afraid that you'll upset her?

148
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,730
Why are you so good at lying?

149
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,790
What did I lie to you?

150
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,260
You know it yourself.

151
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,330
There is one thing

152
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,880
I did lie to you for more than ten years.

153
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
I'm left-handed.

154
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,780
When I was at school,

155
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,180
I was forced to change it.

156
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,050
Only my family knows.

157
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,250
Left-handed?

158
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,850
I'll use my left hand.

159
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,720
I knew it.

160
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,410
There's no way

161
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,070
that someone can defeat me with their left hand.

162
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,300
Lu Chen, you are a rogue liar!

163
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,560
You're too cunning.

164
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,620
You're too cunning.

165
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,030
You're a big liar.

166
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,630
I'm leaving soon.

167
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,510
I want to talk to them a little longer.

168
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,040
Go.

169
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,700
Do you need someone to trace the characters in red ink again?

170
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,260
One who laid down his life for the country

171
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,860
must have a place for his soul

172
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,380
in this vast prairie.

173
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,830
It's just a formality here.

174
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,300
Was he one of your teammates?

175
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,660
He was one of the rookies

176
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,470
under me.

177
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,210
How did he die?

178
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,620
He was from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.

179
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,550
He was an orphan.

180
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,030
He came here first.

181
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,600
Then he went to

182
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,000
a place at high altitude.

183
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,310
That place is very harmful to the body,

184
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,130
especially with high-intensity training.

185
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,730
It wasn't long before the situation was bad.

186
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,980
He didn't make it.

187
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,660
Before he died, he said he wanted to be buried in Qining.

188
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,270
Captain Lu then arranged for him.

189
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,180
Over the years,

190
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,020
we have buried all those

191
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,990
who are up to a martyr's standard here.

192
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,320
I happen to live nearby.

193
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,860
It's convenient for me to keep a watch over here.

194
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,100
There's one more. I'll go by myself.

195
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,470
That's his former captain.

196
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,260
Captain Lu always has something on his mind.

197
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,990
Every time he comes,

198
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,600
he goes there and talks by himself.

199
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,130
No wonder

200
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,800
he wanted to come even if he took a detour.

201
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:52,910
This is

202
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,680
for our accommodation and meals over these days.

203
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,080
I calculated it roughly.

204
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,580
Ask me for it if not enough.

205
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,750
I don't want it.

206
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,240
Take it.

207
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,980
You've been transferred.

208
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,980
You have no right to order me around.

209
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,220
You really think I can't catch you,

210
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,620
right?

211
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,250
Little brat.

212
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:09,790
Take it.

213
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,470
Xiao.

214
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,010
Look at Captain Lu. Is he vulgar?

215
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,670
I'm much wealthier than he is.

216
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,150
What is this?

217
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,080
Is this watch expensive?

218
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,940
It's a watch only for rich people.

219
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,130
I've never seen anyone show off their wealth

220
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,310
in such a cute way.

221
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,760
Yes, I admit that you're rich.

222
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,240
You are really rich.

223
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,740
You have the sheep, coal, earth, and gas.

224
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,260
Last time I came,

225
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,620
I thought the things here were pricey.

226
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,680
That's right.

227
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,860
As brothers,

228
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,570
we only live once.

229
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,330
Don't be so vulgar.

230
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,470
I wished

231
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,040
you could live here forever.

232
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,640
Of course.

233
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,140
That was when I thought

234
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,420
you could be single

235
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,310
for a lifetime.

236
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,010
I don't think so anymore.

237
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,840
Cut the crap. Take it.

238
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,430
I don't want it.

239
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,310
Are you looking down on me?

240
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,660
Just take it as a wedding gift.

241
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,650
When you two get married,

242
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,180
I probably

243
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,740
can't make it to the ceremony.

244
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,800
You can give it to me

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,940
only if you don't want to marry her.

246
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,470
Why do you involve me?

247
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,950
It's between you two.

248
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,090
Okay, I'll take it.

249
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,770
That's right.

250
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,540
We have

251
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,740
something to do in Qining.

252
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,260
See you.

253
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,200
Okay.

254
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,230
Goodbye, Xiao.

255
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:27,610
Bye.

256
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:53,930
Take care.

257
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,200
What were you talking about

258
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,600
with the groundskeeper?

259
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,420
I wanted to know about

260
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,950
the funeral industry here.

261
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,790
If I remember correctly,

262
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,180
Cai

263
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,010
is kind of your colleague.

264
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,310
I remember she sells

265
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,210
toothed roll crushers.

266
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,260
No.

267
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,310
I'm an investor.

268
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,240
I just look around at

269
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,540
how to spend money for the boss.

270
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,660
A funeral services company

271
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,040
he invested in last year

272
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,900
has been listed.

273
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,040
I just recalled

274
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,240
so I want to know more about this place.

275
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,740
I suddenly have a feeling.

276
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,740
I went back to Beijing once when I was in Qining.

277
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,230
That night,

278
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,620
I looked at the bus stop sign on the street.

279
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,560
I knew none of the stations.

280
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,040
Looking at them one by one,

281
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,640
I suddenly felt like

282
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,210
we were living in

283
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,310
two worlds.

284
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,220
I have the same feeling

285
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,020
hearing you talk about your job.

286
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,210
It's a completely different world.

287
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,900
I help to achieve a prosperous economy

288
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,630
while you protect the country.

289
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,200
Aren't we in the same world?

290
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,540
I suddenly have a feeling.

291
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,020
What?

292
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,220
Looking at you

293
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,610
and the snow here,

294
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,260
I feel like you're wandering

295
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,720
in a vast expanse of whiteness.

296
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:14,840
What's wrong?

297
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,620
We got a flat tire.

298
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,820
I'll change the tire.

299
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,820
I'm afraid people can't see clearly from afar.

300
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,150
Do you have an umbrella?

301
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:38,670
Yes.

302
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,670
Why did you stamp on it?

303
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,670
Tell me.

304
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,140
Although my tires are explosion-proof,

305
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,900
I should learn how to change a tire

306
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,510
in case I come across a non-explosion-proof one

307
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,720
in the future.

308
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,810
You don't need to learn.

309
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:22,980
I'm here.

310
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,990
What are you doing?

311
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,330
Kiss me.

312
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,600
So pretentious.

313
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,590
Well...

314
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,870
Shall I get up?

315
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:10,970
Forget it.

316
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,820
Even if cars pass by,

317
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,430
no one knows us.

318
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,340

319
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,730

No, no.

328

Okay.

341

It was snowing last time.

342
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,260
Many small houses

343
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,460
were covered by snow.

344
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,210
Now, the snow has melted.

345
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,560
Sir.

346
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,760
Good timing.

347
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,060
I have lots of good news.

348
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,900
We just caught the guy.

349
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,100
Is there any better news?

350
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,700
Of course.

351
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,310
Where is Lu Yanchen now?

352
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,780
We just had a call. He said he had arrived in Qining.

353
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,580
Tell him

354
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,110
his girlfriend

355
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,060
is a lucky star.

356
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,830
I'd like to take the privilege as a host

357
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,110
to treat her to a meal.

358
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,620
Don't bother.

359
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,700
I'll call him now.

360
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,740
You may tell him by yourself.

361
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,120
Sure.

362
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:31,760
Hello?

363
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,490
Okay, I got it.

364
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,130
Yes, she's next to me.

365
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,500
Okay.

366
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,300
It's not my dad, is it?

367
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,550
My former superior.

368
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,370
I found that people here

369
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,690
like to drive Off-Road Vehicles.

370
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,950
I found out last time.

371
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,960
It's convenient to load things and drive a long way.

372
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,550
Are you happy to be back?

373
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,030
You've been here for so long.

374
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,670
You must have deep feelings about this place.

375
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,190
If I hadn't met you again,

376
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,770
I would live here

377
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,400
for the rest of my life.

378
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,700
Why did you book

379
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,780
such a nice room?

380
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,410
This is my second hometown.

381
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:47,940
I want you

382
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,680
to live in a nice room here.

383
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,760
Thank you, Captain Lu.

384
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,880
You're welcome.

385
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,260
My former leader

386
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,260
called me

387
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,910
and asked me to see him tonight.

388
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,940
For business?

389
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,160
I can't tell you.

390
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,900
I won't ask.

391
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,380
Go.

392
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,230
I'll talk to you when I get back.

393
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,560
When will you come back?

394
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,340
I want to know if I should sleep first

395
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,870
or wait for you to come back.

396
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,220
It won't take long.

397
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,220
I'll wait for you.

398
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:46,610
Bye.

399
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,810
I forgot my car key.

400
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,820
Think about what's for dinner.

401
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,820
I'll be back soon.

402
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,020
[SWAT Detachment of Qining City Public Security Bureau]

403
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,020
[People's Police Training Base of Qining City Public Security Bureau]

404
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,120
I missed you.

405
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,550
Stop nagging.

406
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,510
Let's get down to business.

407
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,260
Gui Xiao is a lucky star.

408
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,320
I didn't expect

409
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,860
these car thieves would also do smuggling.

410
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,060
We followed the clues

411
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,940
and went to catch them before the Spring Festival.

412
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,500
We got someone

413
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,720
unexpected.

414
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,300
Does it have anything to do with them?

415
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,060
Did you catch them?

416
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,320
We caught most of them.

417
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,150
We were not supposed to

418
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,500
sit in on the interrogation.

419
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,840
You handled this case.

420
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,000
You must come back and hand it over.

421
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,560
And the detective police believe

422
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,900
they'll get information about the explosive through the interrogation.

423
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,900
Captain Chen also asked us to sit in.

424
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:26,980
This will be

425
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,500
the end of your work in Qining.

426
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,300
A perfect end.

427
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,690
Let's go.

428
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,740
Captain Lu.

429
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,640
Captain Lu.

430
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,930
Captain Lu! Captain Lu!

431
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,760
Captain Lu.

432
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,730
Captain Lu.

433
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,180
This time, we followed the clues

434
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,340
and caught these people

435
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,870
thanks to your girlfriend.

436
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,270
It was by luck.

437
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,260
I know the situation at the scene

438
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,390
better than anyone.

439
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,920
Go ahead. I'll sit on.

440
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,640
Director.

441
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,010
It's been a while. How's it going?

442
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,740
Captain Lu is more calm than us.

443
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,020
He worked in the SWAT team of Qining for years.

444
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,860
He's experienced in

445
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,050
dealing with this kind of people.

446
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,780
I believe he can handle it well.

447
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,710
I'm going to a meeting.

448
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,300
Send me the report

449
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,820
once you have the result.

450
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,210
Okay.

451
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,290
Come in.

452
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,480
There are two bombs in New Light Mall.

453
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,980
You chased them too hard

454
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,300
before the Spring Festival.

455
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,480
He decided to have a life-and-death struggle

456
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,870
and take revenge against society.

457
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,330
Hurry up. You must go now.

458
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,230
Continue with the interrogation.

459
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,560
Okay.

460
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,180
I'll ask the EOD technicians to go there.

461
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,180
I'll go with you. Let's go together.

462
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:58,480
If...

463
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,440
Qin Mingyu.

464
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,330
If anything happens,

465
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,860
according to the rule of the EOD group,

466
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,820
whoever has a higher position goes first.

467
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,530
I have a higher position than you as an EOD technician.

468
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,260
Understand?

469
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,580
I wonder

470
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,640
if you want to leave a message to Xiao.

471
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,300
I know.

472
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,080
It's highly confidential.

473
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,680
You can't tell her anything.

474
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,180
But you disappeared right after she arrived in Qining.

475
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,840
I'm afraid she'll be worried.

476
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,630
I'm leaving.

477
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,480
Gao Hai.

478
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,190
Send her the key.

479
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,140
Tell her to wait for me.

480
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,470
Okay.

481
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,560
What are you doing?

482
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,500
Hello.

483
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,960
The subscriber you dialed

484
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,130
is unavailable.

485
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,150
We'll send him a message

486
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,910
to notify him of your call.

487
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,630
Powered off?

488
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,530
His battery died?

489
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:39,880
Gui Xiao.

490
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,540
Xu Yao.

491
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,730
I'm making a call.

492
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,830
Well, make it short.

493
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,000
Or I can call you tomorrow.

494
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,430
I'm worried about something

495
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,790
and want to talk to someone.

496
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,770
Bin's test results are worrying.

497
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,300
It's different from the tumor

498
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,260
diagnosed by the previous hospital.

499
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,590
It's not confirmed yet.

500
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,550
But her situation

501
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,650
seems more troublesome.

502
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,860
She needs radiotherapy.

503
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,070
Radiotherapy may cure the tumor.

504
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,640
But once she gets this disease,

505
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,390
she'll be likely to relapse.

506
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,600
And the tumor's location will be different every time.

507
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,220
I dare not tell our family.

508
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,670
And I dare not tell her.

509
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,460
I really don't know

510
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,260
what to do now.

511
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,600
You're a doctor.

512
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,860
You should know that,

513
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,430
in the current situation,

514
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,470
it's useless to be anxious.

515
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,400
And you are so close to her.

516
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,740
If there's any change

517
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,760
in your emotions,

518
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,700
she will definitely feel it.

519
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,580
Wait. I need to open the door.

520
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,700
Xiao.

521
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,280
It's from Captain Lu.

522
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:14,910
Where is he?

523
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,560
He's dealing with something. He asked you to wait for him.

524
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,400
What is it?

525
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,510
How long should I wait?

526
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,400
He'll be back soon.

527
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,460
Did something happen?

528
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,660
Gui Xiao, take care.

529
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,000
Gao Hai.

530
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:32,860
Nothing.

531
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:13,960
Gui Xiao.

532
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,400
We can talk later if you have something to do.

533
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,420
It's okay.

534
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,060
I have no work to do these days.

535
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,940
I'm in Qining.

536
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,530
You took your annual leave?

537
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,460
Sort of.

538
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:30,469
Wait,

539
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,469
you don't sound okay.

540
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,620
Did you shout

541
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,500
just now?

542
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,960
Lu Chen came back to Qining

543
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,830
to visit his former leader and subordinates.

544
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,010
Maybe

545
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,820
he drank too much

546
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,090
and was afraid that I'd be angry,

547
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,750
so he asked someone to send a message.

548
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,030
Alright.

549
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,720
Xu Yao,

550
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,520
stay with your wife now.

551
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,100
Her life is the most important.

552
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,360
Money doesn't matter.

553
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,750
When we come back...

554
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:10,590
Well.

555
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:11,800
Did something

556
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
really happen to you?

557
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,410
Nothing. I just have a stomachache.

558
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,480
I'm hanging up.

559
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,810
I'll call you tomorrow.

560
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:53,780
Hello?

561
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:54,560
Sister.

562
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,190
This is Gui Xiao.

563
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,050
What's wrong?

564
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:57,650
What is it?

565
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:58,890
Nothing.

566
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,470
I just want to chat with you.

567
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,110
What's wrong?

568
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,960
What is it like

569
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,560
when you SWAT police are on a mission?

570
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,100
You can't say anything about the mission?

571
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,740
Yes, it's confidential.

572
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,180
Sometimes when we're on an urgent mission,

573
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,590
we don't even know what we're going to do.

574
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,580
We'll know it

575
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,690
only after we get on the car and receive a note.

576
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,490
What's wrong?

577
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,370
Are you ready?

578
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,660
Our fire rescue team

579
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,390
are in place.

580
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,500
We can start a fire rescue operation

581
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,340
anytime.

582
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:45,980
Thank you.

583
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,190
How's the interrogation going?

584
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,900
They haven't made him answer.

585
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,370
I don't have a big problem here.

586
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,630
The robot can solve it.

587
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,590
As for your side,

588
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,970
there's nothing I can do.

589
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,500
You should get prepared

590
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,300
when you go there.

591
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,030
What should I get prepared for?

592
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,220
The best hospital in Qining

593
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,210
is nearby.

594
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,830
Do you know the consequences?

595
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,560
Thousands of firecrackers and thousands of blood.

596
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,010
Every inch of land is as valuable as gold.

597
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,080
After putting on this uniform,

598
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,610
remember this in your heart

599
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,420
for your whole life.

600
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,100
Yes.

601
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:48,740
Help me!

602
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:49,630
Don't speak.

603
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,900
Put down your gun.

604
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,260
Okay.

605
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,530
I'll put it down.

606
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,640
Hurry up.

607
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,650
Calm down.

608
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,970
Don't hurt the hostage.

609
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,030
Hurry!

610
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,690
Don't move.

611
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,130
Help!

612
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,100
Walk forward slowly.

613
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,300
Walk forward slowly.

614
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,350
You, the one in the middle.

615
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,070
Okay, I'll go there.

616
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,210
Two more steps.

617
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,400
Okay.

618
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,280
Don't hurt the hostage.

619
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,680
Cut the crap.

620
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,040
Don't move.

621
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,850
Don't move.

622
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,380
I'll blow you up!

623
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,230
Fire!

624
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,910
I don't approve your resignation.

625
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,040
It was an emergency.

626
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:41,910
You can't take all the responsibility

627
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,040
on yourself.

628
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,620
I didn't handle it well.

629
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,940
I should take full responsibility.

630
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:49,600
Bye.

631
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,480
Be careful.

632
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,310
[New Light Mall]

633
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,490
[Smoke Vent]

634
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,680
Wait.

635
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,230
I'll ask someone to get you a ladder.

636
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,450
Don't take off your bomb suit now.

637
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,180
If the explosive's TNT equivalent is,

638
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,410
as the criminal said,

639
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,980
enough to destroy a building,

640
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,460
it's useless to wear the suit.

641
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,340
Time waits for no one.

642
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,490
And wearing the Explosive Suit,

643
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,290
I can't get in.

644
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,290
At least let the robot try.

645
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,690
Given the width,

646
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:41,010
a reconnaissance robot might work,

647
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,180
but an EOD robot is really useless.

648
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:43,980
Stop nagging.

649
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,210
Wait for my news.
