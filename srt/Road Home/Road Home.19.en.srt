[Hongrun Chenghua]

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,840
What will the interviewer

6
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,170
at your workplace be like?

7
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,190
Can you tell us about that?

8
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,520
She's quite casual.

9
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,979
You've already passed the first and second round of interview.

10
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,780
Now that you're interviewing with her,

11
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,690
it's just to see if your personality is compatible with her team.

12
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,650
My boss said

13
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,250
interviews depend on fate.

14
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,620
All the candidates who can get to the final round are elites.

15
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,820
What we'd talk about at the final round

16
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,700
would be your values, the way you work,

17
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,460
and your bottom line.

18
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,440
She said in a team,

19
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,199
synergy is key.

20
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,740
Do you have any further questions?

21
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,580
If there's anything you want to know,

22
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,090
just ask.

23
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,260
I think you are

24
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,270
dressed quite casually.

25
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,070
I thought people in private funds

26
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,360
would have to wear formal clothes.

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,890
There's no need.

28
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,300
Our boss

29
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,060
is very casual.

30
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,630
We keep our dressing style very simple.

31
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,730
I like that too.

32
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,900
Simple and casual.

33
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,540
This is what we do here.

34
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,990
Any other questions?

35
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:39,960
No.

36
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,260
That's all for our interview

37
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,070
today.

38
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,430
I hope I will get

39
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,260
to see you again.

40
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,329
I hope what you hope will come true.

41
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,170
Thank you.

42
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,170
Thank you.

43
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,370
Thank you.

44
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,800
I've had it.

45
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,490
I don't need it anymore in the future too.

46
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,270
How are you going home tonight?

47
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,250
I'm driving.

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,200
Isn’t he coming to pick you up?

49
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,240
You mean Lu Chen?

50
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,820
He's in Tianwen this month. He can't return.

51
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,070
No wonder your dad doesn’t agree.

52
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,079
Your boyfriend

53
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,560
is as good as an illusion.

54
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,100
We've known each other for so many years.

55
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,410
You should know that

56
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,770
I don't like to discuss

57
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,800
private matters.

58
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,490
I thought after studying abroad for many years,

59
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,960
now that we came back to start a business together,

60
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,960
we would be at least close friends.

61
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,610
Friends?

62
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,690
Your boyfriend cares about this?

63
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,370
My fiance doesn't.

64
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,780
I do.

65
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,220
He has high requirements

66
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,860
when it comes to relationships.

67
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,649
I don't want him to be unhappy.

68
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,360
To keep giving in in a relationship

69
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,100
is not

70
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,350
a good way of getting along, you know?

71
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,360
I'm not giving in.

72
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,350
It's sincerity.

73
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,250
I have high requirements

74
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,180
when it comes to relationships too.

75
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,900
He can do the same as me.

76
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,160
What if he's just putting on a show?

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,000
No way.

78
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,530
I talked too much just now.

79
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,620
Sorry.

80
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,659
It's fine.

81
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,780
I said too much.

82
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,450
Let's not discuss

83
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,180
personal issues anymore.

84
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,490
This is the boundary

85
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,510
between me and male friends.

86
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,580
Okay.

87
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,070
I just got off work.

88
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,560
I'm exhausted.

89
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,420
Maybe I talked too much

90
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,050
and drank too little water.

91
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,340
I've been interviewing today.

92
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,130
Be careful next time.

93
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,180
There's no one to make breakfast for me anymore.

94
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,890
I've packed them in the fridge for you.

95
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,830
There are seven kinds.

96
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,300
You can take them out

97
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,170
and heat it up.

98
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,480
Where are you calling me from?

99
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,790
The only place with an outdoor phone.

100
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,780
The training base.

101
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,060
So you can't take photos.

102
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,260
Of course.

103
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,530
Are you sick?

104
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,350
No, I choked on water.

105
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,370
The season's changing now.

106
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,720
Be careful not to catch a cold.

107
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,340
Okay.

108
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,980
I'm going to sleep.

109
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,400
Say something nice.

110
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,790
For example,

111
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,700
you miss me.

112
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,540
My colleagues aren't too far away.

113
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,300
They can hear me.

114
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,310
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

115
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,220
Why are you laughing?

116
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,100
Are you laughing at me?

117
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,340
No.

118
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,450
All right.

119
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,190
I'm going to sleep.

120
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,590
Go back to your dorm.

121
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,170
Wait.

122
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:57,700
Say something

123
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,500
you're not afraid of them hearing.

124
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,380
Forget it.

125
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,180
I do miss you.

126
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,210
I guess you have a conscience.

127
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:16,780
Me too.

128
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,220
I'm going to bed.

129
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,200
Good night.

130
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,740
Good night.

131
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,860
Bye.

132
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,380
Bye.

133
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,380
Oh no, Instructor Lu.

134
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,970
Your wife has you wrapped around her little finger.

135
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,670
It's not a good habit

136
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,010
to eavesdrop on others' phone calls.

137
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,130
I'm not eavesdropping.

138
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,590
I came here to look for you

139
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,710
and accidentally overheard it.

140
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,159
What did you say? "I do miss you"?

141
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,060
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

142
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,190
What is it?

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,550
It's nothing.

144
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,060
My former master

145
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,430
Shen Jie

146
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,060
said he saw you when he was in Qining.

147
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,280
And you even helped him.

148
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,020
Do you remember?

149
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:53,890
Mr. Shen.

150
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:54,460
Yes.

151
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,530
He asked me for an abandoned bomb

152
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,659
and some information.

153
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,100
Yes, that's right.

154
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,980
We just talked on the phone.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,440
I told him

156
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,250
you were here too.

157
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,690
He asked me to say hello to you.

158
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,890
Please say hello to him for me too.

159
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,540
He's doing pretty well now.

160
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,780
After retirement,

161
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,330
he got employed at this civil explosives company.

162
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,830
Speaking of which,

163
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,750
I remember

164
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,420
a few days ago, my boss told me

165
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,060
that an area

166
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,820
that belongs to Qining

167
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,940
has been promoted to a city status recently.

168
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,140
He wants to build

169
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,320
a special force himself there.

170
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,080
But there's no explosives team,

171
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,400
so we can only transfer personnel over.

172
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,670
We wanted to borrow some from your team

173
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,420
but it was

174
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,660
stopped by that vice captain

175
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,660
of yours,

176
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,540
Qin Mingyu.

177
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,260
He never mentioned about that.

178
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,490
He probably did that in consideration of you.

179
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,220
He doesn't want you to stay too far away from home.

180
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:35,700
So he took

181
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,740
this job himself.

182
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,480
All right, I'm leaving.

183
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,400
Rest early.

184
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,020
Okay.

185
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,100
Zhong.

186
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,460
Sit.

187
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,740
As to your marriage application,

188
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,040
I have a request.

189
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,000
Captain,

190
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,930
just go ahead with it.

191
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,950
What request could there be between you and me?

192
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,630
It's not for you,

193
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,500
but for your wife.

194
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,710
After you leave,

195
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,890
I'm afraid we'd be short-handed.

196
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,320
Ask your wife

197
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,480
if she can do us a favor

198
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,640
and move over to Qining after the marriage.

199
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,090
I'll personally pay

200
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,890
for your wedding venue.

201
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,000
That's no problem.

202
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,770
But you don't have to pay for the wedding venue.

203
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,760
I'll book it myself.

204
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,870
Ask your wife.

205
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,150
She already said

206
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:43,980
if I still can't take any

207
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,880
leaves this year,

208
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:45,990
she will just move over for the marriage.

209
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,830
You have to ask even so.

210
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,540
Ask seriously.

211
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:51,710
Sit.

212
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,410
This is a big thing

213
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,280
between you two.

214
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,150
Be serious.

215
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,490
Respect your other half.

216
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,140
There's a reason

217
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,360
why marriages fail.

218
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,670
You can't just assume

219
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,390
that your other half has to give unconditionally

220
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,260
just because of how

221
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,550
highly your career is.

222
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,660
They are also their

223
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,720
parents' precious daughter.

224
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,790
If they're willing to be with

225
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,710
someone like you who has a dangerous job,

226
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,810
they must be a good lady.

227
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,690
To a good lady...

228
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,620
You can't continue, can you?

229
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,400
Continue mopping the floor.

230
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,420
I'm hungry. Let me go have some food.

231
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,490
Lu?

232
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,540
I have something to say.

233
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,740
A conversation between

234
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,580
two SWAT captains

235
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,340
is most likely confidential.

236
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,390
Is that something you can listen to?

237
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,420
Remember to call your wife

238
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,100
tonight.

239
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,260
This is an order.

240
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,700
Yes.

241
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:55,990
Close the door.

242
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,460
I see someone still remembers

243
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,540
their brother in Qining.

244
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,640
You applied to transfer to the new city?

245
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,120
You are well-informed, Captain Lu.

246
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,390
It's called Gonghai City.

247
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,490
It's a new mission.

248
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,370
Qining has many missions.

249
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,130
If you leave,

250
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,860
what about the other side?

251
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,290
I'm asking you.

252
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,220
About what?

253
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,860
Are you afraid I can't handle it?

254
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,980
You can handle it.

255
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,310
It's the truth.

256
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,530
That's right.

257
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,230
As a captain,

258
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,380
I can handle these.

259
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,720
Besides,

260
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,110
you've been transferred.

261
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,780
Don't worry about things here.

262
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,350
I know your situation.

263
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,490
There are many missions this year.

264
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,430
They're short-handed.

265
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,650
Of course there are difficulties.

266
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,530
I can solve my own problem,

267
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,290
right?

268
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,690
Lu Yanchen.

269
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,360
There are so many cities in this country.

270
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,760
There are hundreds of experts.

271
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,130
You are never the best.

272
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,200
There will always be someone better than you.

273
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,490
Just stay here

274
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,720
in Tianwen.

275
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,690
Don't worry about Qining.

276
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,680
There's no need.

277
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:00,930
Oh right,

278
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,140
I happen to be

279
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,180
thinking about something these days

280
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,060
and wanted to talk to you about it.

281
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,290
In the future,

282
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,280
if you get married and have kids,

283
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,740
I'll arrange for Xiaonan

284
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,020
to live alone.

285
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,310
To stay in a boarding school.

286
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,000
I'll take care of Qin Xiaonan for you.

287
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,410
It's not important.

288
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:16,960
The higher-ups asked for me

289
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,880
but you insisted on going in my stead.

290
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,050
You are in the wrong for that.

291
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,970
They did ask for you.

292
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,460
But I'm closer.

293
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,810
I should be the one going anyway.

294
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,600
It's within my responsibilities

295
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,340
and is my job, okay?

296
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,890
Call me if you need anything.

297
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,500
Of course.

298
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,840
I’m not going to die.

299
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,560
Lu Yanchen, Captain Lu.

300
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,190
We used to go between

301
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,740
life and death so much in the past.

302
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,300
I've never seen you so longwinded.

303
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,070
I'll rebel if you keep talking.

304
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:44,650
I'm hanging up.

305
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,660
Maybe I’ve been your captain for years

306
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,820
so I feel like a parent.

307
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:48,900
Get lost.

308
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,310
Don't take advantage of me.

309
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,060
Has my son been good?

310
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:56,870
Yes.

311
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,540
He hasn't been disturbing

312
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,330
your life, has he?

313
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:00,890
To be honest,

314
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,570
if you find it inconvenient,

315
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,650
I'll rent him a house.

316
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:04,930
No need.

317
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,510
Qin Xiaonan is more sensible than you.

318
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,780
Gui Xiao likes him.

319
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,220
You

320
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,040
brought my son back.

321
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,390
But your wife

322
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,240
has no objections to it.

323
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,540
Cherish her.

324
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,520
You don't need to

325
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,670
remind me to

326
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,400
cherish my wife.

327
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,360
All right, I'm hanging up.

328
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,550
I'm in someone else's team,

329
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,310
I can't speak for too long.

330
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,830
I'm hanging up. Stay safe.

331
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,650
Wait.

332
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,760
Put me on speaker,

333
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,190
I'll say hello to your other colleagues.

334
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,360
Hello, everyone from Tianwen.

335
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,010
I'm Qin Mingyu, an explosive expert

336
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,180
from Qining.

337
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,380
I am good at bomb disposal.

338
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,350
If there's a chance,

339
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,440
let's learn from each other in the future.

340
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,900
Cut the crap.

341
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,560
I'm hanging up.

342
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,190
Wait.

343
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,300
Let me ask you one more thing.

344
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:47,890
Go ahead.

345
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,010
What does Duan Rou like?

346
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,500
She doesn't want anything.

347
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,540
Yet helps me take care of my son.

348
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,300
I should get them

349
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,170
a gift, right?

350
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,060
I don't know either.

351
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,900
It's rare for me to beg you.

352
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,290
I've only met her once.

353
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,220
Rather than asking me,

354
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,270
you should probably ask your son.

355
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,770
You're right.

356
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,100
I can't count on you anymore.

357
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,200
Okay, I'm hanging up.

358
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:08,760
Bye.

359
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,620
Bastard.

360
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,300
It's late.

361
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,300
I'm not sleepy.

362
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,050
After talking to master on the phone,

363
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,050
I feel like I'm wasted.

364
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,400
Now that I think about it, I can't sleep.

365
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,840
So I came here

366
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,710
to see what you made.

367
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,100
Well,

368
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,430
this is really well-made.

369
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,790
How did you make it?

370
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,940
I've never seen this before.

371
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,710
I couldn't find anything about it on the internet.

372
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,250
Where did you learn it from?

373
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,780
This is the latest model.

374
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,380
It's only been used on the battlefield

375
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:47,980
these two years.

376
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,920
I just looked at some blueprints,

377
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,560
translated them,

378
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,620
and made them myself.

379
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,730
Tell me more about

380
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,050
how you made

381
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,810
this detonator.

382
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,820
Sure.

383
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,310
I can't sleep anyway.

384
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,030
We can go through this slowly.

385
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,020
What's wrong?

386
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,550
Is something bothering you?

387
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,510
Let's talk about something else.

388
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,890
It's not exactly bothering me.

389
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,670
I've been to

390
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,880
the new city.

391
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,740
I know it better than him.

392
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,510
The higher-ups

393
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,730
wanted me to go there.

394
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,140
They must've considered this.

395
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,700
You still can't let go?

396
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,820
You want to go?

397
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,510
I’m just a little worried.

398
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,350
I’m not Lu Yanchen.

399
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,540
I have a bad temper.

400
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,340
If you say something

401
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,650
you'd get scolded for,

402
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,060
think it through over ten times

403
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,620
in your mind before you say it.

404
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,100
You're obviously feeling guilty.

405
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:04,860
What did we say?

406
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,040
Do you need to say anything.

407
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,560
Look at your faces.

408
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,110
We just need a red backdrop,

409
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,950
and set up a stage,

410
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,140
and we can immediately hold

411
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,580
a performance for

412
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,390
the Qining Police

413
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,370
Chinese New Year gala.

414
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,480
Officer Qin,

415
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,550
you are sharp-tongued.

416
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,540
No girls can stand it.

417
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,100
No wonder you got divorced.

418
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,050
But Officer Qin,

419
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,790
men who had divorced

420
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,870
are the most despised.

421
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,060
They must think

422
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,210
you have a bad personality.

423
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,220
So you must find

424
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,270
someone nice if you are getting remarried.

425
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,550
Don't get divorced again.

426
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,300
Let's make this a rule in the future.

427
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,520
No talking when I'm eating.

428
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,280
Luckily, I'm leaving soon.

429
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,060
It'll be quiet.

430
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,920
You said you weren't familiar with that place.

431
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,089
Why did you insist on going?

432
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,859
I knew you would talk about that.

433
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,660
Zhong.

434
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:17,900
Are you done with your food?

435
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,349
Go practice.

436
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,030
Yes.

437
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,700
Me leaving

438
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:32,940
is a good practice

439
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,350
for you.

440
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,560
Captain Lu is indeed capable.

441
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,210
But we can't rely on him for everything.

442
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,420
He has worked hard

443
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,370
for Qining for so many years

444
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,060
and just got transferred over.

445
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,250
He's getting familiar with the things over there.

446
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,250
It takes time.

447
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,340
It'd be fine if it's in the past,

448
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,990
but this year, our city has attracted some foreign investment.

449
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,630
We have many meetings

450
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,750
and political missions.

451
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,890
If you leave, we–

452
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:53,580
Alright.

453
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,180
I've decided.

454
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,250
In one minute,

455
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,290
write as much as you can.

456
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,360
Take it.

457
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,190
Remember the colors

458
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,950
and the numbers in the color.

459
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,420
Stop.

460
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,210
Tick the colored boxes

461
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,000
and the numbers in the color.

462
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,820
What's wrong with you today?

463
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,060
You sneeze every few words.

464
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,820
I would get allergies

465
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,700
when the willows bloom.

466
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,540
I shan't go in.

467
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,140
It will affect

468
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,020
everyone's eating.

469
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,540
They're almost done eating.

470
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,780
They're going to their next stop.

471
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,650
There's a next stop?

472
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,730
Yes.

473
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,460
They are now

474
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,860
the most popular enterprise.

475
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,680
Everyone wants to invest in it.

476
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,820
They don't even have

477
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,860
enough time to meet

478
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,820
investment companies like us.

479
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,820
If it weren't for your mother,

480
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,190
we wouldn't have had the chance to have a meal with them.

481
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,760
My mom didn't make much money,

482
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,800
but has a lot of friends.

483
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,940
We are

484
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,180
stickler for rules.

485
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,220
I heard that Dongxin

486
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,430
has been taking good care of them,

487
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,790
eating and drinking with them everyday.

488
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,650
In private,

489
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,300
they are closer to each other.

490
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,320
A lot has been taken care of.

491
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,800
I guess

492
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,260
if we don't give them some practical benefits,

493
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,490
we can't win the competition.

494
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:22,850
There's a bottom line.

495
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,540
Bottom line.

496
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,300
I know.

497
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,380
I'm just complaining.

498
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,540
If you really want me to drink with them,

499
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,120
I might get drunk after two glasses.

500
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,290
I'm afraid

501
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,800
we can't invest even if we have the money

502
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,110
in their third round of financing?

503
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,900
If we can't invest in this round,

504
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,230
let's just wait for the next round.

505
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,980
If this project is gone,

506
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,050
we'll just wait for other projects.

507
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,500
But if we go past our bottom line once,

508
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,820
it'll be hard

509
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,400
to get it back.

510
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,100
Okay, Ms. Chicken Soup for the Soul.

511
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,330
What chicken soup?

512
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,700
This is experience.

513
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,910
I lived ten more years than you did,

514
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,900
I didn't live in vain.

515
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,100
Did you write calligraphy when you were young?

516
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,470
Yes.

517
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,340
My dad used to force me to practice it cause he liked it.

518
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,170
When we were young,

519
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,620
we would get ink on our hands

520
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,720
when writing calligraphy.

521
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,670
I knew that it's dirty and black

522
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,200
and just wanted to clean them off.

523
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,050
If someone stopped me,

524
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,250
I might even get angry at them.

525
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,180
After I've grown up,

526
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,320
since we already knew it was black,

527
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,340
why bother going after it?

528
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,060
Why are you looking at me?

529
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,570
I didn't grab the ink-stone.

530
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,240
Me neither.

531
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,970
My boss mentored me.

532
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,390
I can't take it anymore.

533
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,500
I'm about to cry.

534
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,240
Go get it checked.

535
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,890
Get some relief spray.

536
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,570
You will feel bad if you keep sneezing.

537
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:43,770
Fine.

538
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,550
I'll go in and say goodbye.

539
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,750
I'll go with you.

540
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,100
I have to go to the hospital

541
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,190
to get my mom's discharge form anyway.

542
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,680
Okay, wait for me.

543
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,970
I've never seen you play games.

544
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,530
I used to play games in college.

545
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,660
Then I stopped playing.

546
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,980
My friends seem to

547
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,650
be all playing this nowadays.

548
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,420
So I wanted to take a look.

549
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,140
We investors

550
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,190
should have foresight.

551
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,490
Look, just like blind boxes.

552
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,320
No one cared about it at first.

553
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,090
But it suddenly became popular overnight.

554
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,490
No one invested in it in its initial stages.

555
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,140
Now, everyone's looking for them with money

556
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,220
yet they don't necessarily want it anymore.

557
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
You're so smart, boss.

558
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,090
I'm going to get the report.

559
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,470
Wait for me here.

560
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,820
It's a big place. Don't run around.

561
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,260
Okay.

562
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,780
Have you been feeling tired recently?

563
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,630
Unwell?

564
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,490
You get allergic reactions easily?

565
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,740
But I get allergies every spring.

566
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,640
It's an old problem.

567
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,510
Just prescribe some medicine for me.

568
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,740
My nose feels uncomfortable.

569
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,350
I keep sneezing.

570
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,320
It affects my work.

571
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,970
If it doesn't affect your work,

572
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,130
you won't come to see the doctor?

573
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,890
It's just a minor problem.

574
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,050
I will recover soon.

575
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,790
It's not a big problem,

576
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,120
but we need to take it seriously.

577
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,310
Besides,

578
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,070
I can't prescribe just any medicine for you.

579
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,630
As to what medication

580
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,690
and what prescription I give,

581
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,480
I'd need your permission.

582
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,770
You're a professional.

583
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,880
I'll use

584
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,660
whatever you ask me to use.

585
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,190
Are you married now?

586
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:06,840
I'm engaged.

587
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,290
But

588
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,120
he doesn't get allergies like this.

589
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,300
And we haven't seen each other

590
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:11,880
for more than a month.

591
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,340
Is it contagious?

592
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,240
That's not what I meant.

593
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,700
Miss, you seem to be pregnant.

594
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,420
Don't you know that?

595
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,860
But we are

596
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,830
not the gynae here.

597
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,750
I inferenced this

598
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,910
based on

599
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,700
your blood test report.

600
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,500
How about this?

601
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,810
Go to the

602
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,750
gynae now.

603
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:37,690
You still have time.

604
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,790
With a few more checks,

605
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,920
we should be able to confirm it.

606
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,150
The gynae?

607
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:42,620
Yes.

608
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,690
It's on the fourth floor.

609
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,550
Thank you.

610
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,070
I'll prescribe your medication

611
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,220
to you according to

612
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,120
what should be given to pregnant women.

613
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,910
Go back and see if it works.

614
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,750
If it works well,

615
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,940
you can come to me for more anytime.

616
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:01,710
What's wrong?

617
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,900
Is there something on your mind?

618
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,400
No.

619
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,010
It's just that

620
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,430
I came to get a spray prescribed

621
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,400
cause of my allergies.

622
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,780
I'm not ready for this yet.

623
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,190
Surprised?

624
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,240
Shocked?

625
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,940
Both.

626
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,590
Hello.

627
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:48,970
The doctor said

628
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,060
you're going to the gynae

629
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,930
and was afraid you couldn't find it,

630
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,890
so she asked me to show you the way.

631
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,180
I'm not going to go for now.

632
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:55,900
Thank you.

633
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,040
Okay.

634
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:07,960
You got it?

635
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,250
Is it serious?

636
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,340
No.

637
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,520
I really want to eat and drink my fill now.

638
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:18,940
Where is

639
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,020
the best restaurant nearby?

640
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,670
The one we just bought our client

641
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,540
a meal at

642
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,540
is the best place

643
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,170
on Yonghe Palace Street.

644
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,400
You kept sneezing and didn't eat.

645
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,790
It’s a pity.

646
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,600
Duan Rou,

647
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,370
Gui Xiao has been eating nonstop,

648
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,800
what's going on?

649
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,620
There can only be two reasons.

650
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,140
They are extremely happy

651
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,820
or extremely unhappy.

652
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,530
Which one is she?

653
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,020
When one is extremely unhappy,

654
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:17,690
they won't be picky.

655
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,750
They eat whatever they see.

656
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,040
When one is extremely happy,

657
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,300
they will consider their figure

658
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,390
and won't touch meat.

659
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,930
For example,

660
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,150
duck that makes you fat the most easily.

661
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,540
Don't worry.

662
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,700
I'm very happy.

663
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,900
I guessed it.

664
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,630
Well done.

665
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,030
You've gotten a lot better

666
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,490
at observing other's feelings.

667
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,670
Are you there? Squeak if you are.

668
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,720
I'm not a rat.

669
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,040
I think I'm pregnant.

670
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,400
I haven't gone to the gynae yet.

671
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,690
I want to wait for when you return

672
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,340
so we can know the answer together.

673
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,010
Calm down.

674
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:27,630
It's okay.

675
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,560
I just wanted to say hi.

676
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,250
Get back to work.

677
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,630
I miss you exceptionally much today.

678
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,870
The bed and I are waiting for you.

679
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,730
Watch what you say next time.

680
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,700
Same to you.

681
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,270
Why are you still here?

682
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,310
I thought you were going back to Beijing.

683
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,320
I've been busy all day,

684
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,040
I'm going to go take a shower.

685
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,340
Go home and take the shower.

686
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,210
Why do you look like

687
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,150
a young kid who just got in a relationship?

688
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,530
You're afraid your wife will find you dirty?

689
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:33,730
See you next week.

690
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,630
You're back.

691
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,100
Go memorize a model essay after eating.

692
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,850
Hey.

693
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,600
I bought chicken, potatoes

694
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,800
and an oven.

695
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,670
I also bought lamb, beef,

696
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,330
and spices.

697
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,420
Make us chicken stew

698
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,300
tonight.

699
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:19,980
And also barbecue skewers.

700
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,080
Chicken stew?

701
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,320
Have you had it before?

702
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,580
Yes.

703
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,710
But I've never made it before.

704
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,800
It shouldn't be difficult.

705
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,260
We used to think

706
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,360
you were a man

707
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,590
without tears.

708
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,200
But after entering this door,

709
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,510
you'll roll up your sleeves

710
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,490
and do housework.

711
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,870
You haven't seen each other for a long time.

712
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:41,780
Stop arguing.

713
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,850
Go up and memorise the model essay.

714
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,020
You...

715
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,650
go to the kitchen with me.

716
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,570
I have cooked it for you.

717
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,860
I thought you would come back dirty.

718
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,510
You've been away for more than 30 days.

719
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,930
I don't know where

720
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,760
you went rolling around.

721
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,940
I showered before coming back.

722
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,550
No wonder.

723
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:48,860
You smell good.

724
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:19,970
Be careful.

725
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,080
Don't drop the thing in your hand.

726
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,210
You're acting cool.

727
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,600
You don't like it?

728
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,070
You bought it without asking me.

729
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,290
It's okay if you don't like it.

730
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,600
I can buy it again next year.

731
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,080
If you still don't like it,

732
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,250
I can buy it again the year after next.

733
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,870
When the time comes,

734
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:45,970
and you can hang all of them around your neck.

735
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,220
When you get old, no one will have more rings than you.

736
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,290
Try the size.

737
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,530
What about yours?

738
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,060
Why are you wearing it now?

739
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:23,760
It's convenient.

740
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:30,820
You're self-aware.

741
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,090
You deserve praise.

742
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,280
It’s inconvenient for you to leave the base.

743
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,420
How did you buy it?

744
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,020
I looked up the style

745
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,770
I wanted to buy on the Internet.

746
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:43,940
And

747
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:45,500
estimated your ring size.

748
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,100
And asked my boss

749
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,889
to bring a pair back from the city.

750
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,860
Why bother your boss?

751
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:51,520
You're coming back today,

752
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
we could've bought it tonight.

753
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,520
I wanted to put it on first.

754
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,600
Let me take another look.

755
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,340
Why did you put the ring

756
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,510
in your pocket?

757
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,390
How did you know I could touch it?

758
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,400
When I was cooking in the past,

759
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,620
you always liked to

760
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,410

Let me tell you, it's amazing.

795
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,960
My mom called me

796
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,080
two days ago.

797
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,720
She said she dreamed of me giving birth.

798
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,660
How could she dream of that?

799
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,900
I've been sickly since I was young.

800
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
I often went to the hospital.

801
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,520
You know that.

802
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,160
I've never been fine.

803

805
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,810
She's so happy now.

806
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:39,760
Are you happy?

807
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,910
You're not doing anything

808
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,230
nor did you get excited.

809
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,500
I'm turning off the fire.

810
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,840
You can't do this.

811
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,160
You can cook after kissing.

812
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,630
You don't have to be so surprised.

813
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,480
I'm thinking about the marriage application.

814
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,760
How should I plan the wedding?

815
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:12,900
Do I have leaves?

816
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:19,890
We have to go to the hospital tomorrow

817
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:20,470

818
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,740
See how many months it has been.

819
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,210
The first three months

820
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:24,840
are the most critical.

821
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,580

823

But I can't return when I'm on a shift.

824
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,510
