[Episode 11]

4
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,460
How could you date

5
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,770
in other's billiards hall?

6
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,100
You even broke the door.

7
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,890
Your boss gave me the key.

8
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,210
It's indeed the same.

9
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,870
Who are you?

10
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:48,789
Lu Chen.

11
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,470
Are you the EOD expert of the Lu family?

12
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,670
I'm a SWAT.

13
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,539
I know.

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,150
You usually dismantle the bombs.

15
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,420
Why are you here in the middle of the night?

16
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,550
Is something wrong?

17
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,140
Your boss

18
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,340
asked me to check

19
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,080
the surveillance system here.

20
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,740
He said there were blind spots

21
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,820
and asked me to adjust

22
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,220
the angle of the cameras.

23
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,699
Do you know that too?

24
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,550
That's great. I'll take you there.

25
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,610
We'll go right now.

26
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,740
There are indeed some blind spots.

27
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,630
The immature young people

28
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,100
always fight and bully people there.

29
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,300
Let's go. I'll show you.

30
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,360
Let's go. This way.

31
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,070
Let's go.

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
It's so convenient to ask a favour from an acquaintance.

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,829
You even came to check in the middle of the night.

34
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:49,570
Did you and your husband

35
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,770
come here after work?

36
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,040
We're not married.

37
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,410
We are alumni.

38
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,300
When we were in school,

39
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,360
we always played around here.

40
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,940
So we dropped by here today.

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,680
It's done.

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,579
Please move this back to its original position.

43
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:19,770
We're leaving first.

44
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,700
Okay, thank you.

45
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,430
Wait.

46
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,090
It hasn't changed at all.

47
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,940
You haven't changed at all too.

48
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,020
What did you say?

49
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,380
Nothing.

50
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,900
I heard you say something.

51
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,320
I said nothing.

52
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,440
Where are we going now?

53
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,399
The garage?

54
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,250
I'll take you to Meng Xiaoshan's house.

55
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,610
I'm afraid my dad is still in the garage.

56
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,670
He'll make a scene.

57
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,060
You can sleep well in Meng's house.

58
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,050
Does your dad still hurt you?

59
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,780
He doesn't dare to do it now.

60
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,020
Next time when you come,

61
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,350
I'll ask them in advance

62
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,860
and try my best

63
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,980
not to let you meet my family.

64
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,110
You didn't say you were coming.

65
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,670
Are you home?

66
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,510
Look up.

67
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,540
Do you want to go back to Qining

68
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,180
with me?

69
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,280
Are you going back?

70
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,480
I have to help Xiaonan get his household registration permit.

71
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,350
Let them send it over will do.

72
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,610
This matter is complicated.

73
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,650
I'll explain further to you tomorrow.

74
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,580
Do you want to go?

75
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,530
Do you really want to go back?

76
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,730
From my perspective,

77
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,260
Qining is my second hometown.

78
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,420
Last time,

79
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,350
we had a dispute.

80
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,680
I didn't have the chance to show you around.

81
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,290
This time, I want to take you

82
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,650
to see the snowfield,

83
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,290
sunset, forest,

84
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,180
and people in the past.

85
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,520
My working hours are flexible.

86
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,430
As long as I have my phone and an Internet connection,

87
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,860
I can leave anytime.

88
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,580
I'll book a schedule.

89
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,210
Okay.

90
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,050
Have an early night.

91
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,190
I'm really leaving.

92
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,060
I just helped Qin Feng

93
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,700
to fix the surveillance of his billiard hall.

94
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,070
I remember

95
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,100
the CCTV in my brother-in-law's school

96
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,160
is also this brand.

97
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,380
If there's any problem,

98
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,310
he may come to me.

99
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,080
Thank you.

100
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,640
No need to thank me.

101
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,299
I said it on behalf of your brother-in-law.

102
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,500
Recently, he's always worried that

103
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,230
if the CCTV has malfunctioned,

104
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,020
the students facing danger in the blind spot will not be noticeable.

105
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,150
Luckily, you're back.

106
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,740
Otherwise,

107
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,669
he can't sleep well again tonight.

108
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,700
Pork rib soup.

109
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,289
Take it back for the kid.

110
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,179
Your friend asked us to take care of him.

111
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,260
We can't starve him.

112
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,980
Or else, we would disappoint his parents.

113
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,260
Okay, go in quickly.

114
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,580
Okay.

115
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,880
My brother-in-law has been waiting for you.

116
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,830
Drive slowly.

117
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,410
Okay.

118
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,260
Where's Aunt Gui Xiao?

119
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,910
She's staying with her friend.

120
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,380
What?

121
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,340
I was waiting for her.

122
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,640
I need to go back to Qining.

123
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,550
Is there anything

124
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,280
you want me to bring to your dad?

125
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,700
Or is there anything

126
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,500
you want me to bring back for you?

127
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,640
You have just progressed a little

128
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,120
but now you're leaving?

129
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,840
Why do you always worry about me?

130
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,190
Mind your words.

131
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,860
I'm worried that

132
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,580
Aunt Gui Xiao is too outstanding.

133
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,330
I'm afraid that when you return,

134
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,060
you can't get her back anymore.

135
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,400
She's going back with me.

136
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,220
No one is taking care of you lately.

137
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,110
Be careful.

138
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,620
Don't slack off on your homework.

139
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,220
Make it clear before you leave.

140
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,780
I'm going to take a shower.

141
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,090
Have the pork rib soup.

142
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,670
I'm worried that

143
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,460
Aunt Gui Xiao is too outstanding.

144
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,250
I'm afraid that when you return,

145
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,980
you can't get her back anymore.

146
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,930
Your dad always makes a scene when he is drunk.

147
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,260
No one can deal with him.

148
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,240
Don't go home tonight.

149
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,360
Lu Chen.

150
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,920
He's your dad.

151
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,890
Don't take it to heart.

152
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,920
It's okay.

153
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,060
As long as he doesn't

154
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,860
kick my sister out, I'll be fine.

155
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,740
I'm going on a road trip.

156
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,120
Sometimes the signal will be bad.

157
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,940
If you need anything,

158
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,740
just email me.

159
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,060
When the signal gets better,

160
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,320
I will give you a reply.

161
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,740
Why is your first love

162
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,740
going back to Qining all of a sudden?

163
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,620
After he graduated from university,

164
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,080
he was assigned to Qining.

165
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,100
He has lived there

166
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,430
for more than ten years.

167
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,410
It's kind of his second hometown.

168
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,860
Maybe he wants to go back and have a look.

169
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,960
What about Qin Xiaonan?

170
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,840
Who will take care of him after you leave?

171
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,100
You met the person before. It's Hai Dong.

172
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,270
It's him.

173
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,220
He can't even

174
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,220
tutor Xiaonan.

175
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,520
We'll be back in two weeks.

176
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,900
How about you leave it to me?

177
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:09,700
You?

178
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,430
He can stay at my place which is near to his school.

179
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,560
I'll take care of the kid for two weeks.

180
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,710
I'm being serious.

181
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,330
Now I finally admit that

182
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,690
you really like kids.

183
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,550
Why would I lie to you?

184
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,940
My aunt's kids

185
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,000
like to play with me a lot on weekends.

186
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,390
Leave it to me. It's a deal.

187
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,460
Give me his dad's contact information.

188
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,170
Just in case.

189
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,230
If I can't find you,

190
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
I'll go to his dad.

191
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,870
Okay, I'll share his phone number with you.

192
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,530
Qin Mingyu.

193
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,100
He has a nice name.

194
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,420
Tonight,

195
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,700
ask the kid to pack up his things.

196
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,560
I'll call a taxi and fetch him to my house.

197
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,020
Thanks.

198
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,350
Bye.

199
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:54,920
Safe journey.

200
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,930
Ms Meng.

201
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,670
Is there any private room left?

202
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,780
Yes, I'll find one for you.

203
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,910
-Okay. I'll wait for you here.
-Noted.

204
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,680
Gui Xiao.

205
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,800
Are you going on a long journey again?

206
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,000
Is Lu Chen here?

207
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,150
Soon.

208
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,630
Is Chen back too?

209
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,910
Chen.

210
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,430
I bought some fruit. We can eat them on the way.

211
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,790
You're here.

212
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,610
It's bumpy on the road.

213
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,780
It'll be more convenient if you carry a bag instead of a suitcase.

214
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,510
I have a bag here. You may use it.

215
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,600
I'll change to the bag inside.

216
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,010
I'll carry it for you.

217
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,100
Gui Xiao.

218
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,160
I still want to say something.

219
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,410
Lu Chen was thoughtless.

220
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,780
You two just made up not long ago.

221
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,250
But now you are going on a trip together.

222
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,980
If you get pregnant these days,

223
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,680
it would be very troublesome.

224
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,360
Did you buy a new car?

225
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,240
No, second-hand.

226
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,020
I've modified it after the repairs.

227
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,180
Not bad.

228
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,070
You modified a car worth one hundred  thousand yuan

229
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,620
to be one that worth hundreds of thousands.

230
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,170
Awesome.

231
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,100
Think carefully.

232
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,110
If you don't want to

233
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,310
get married so early,

234
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,900
you should take some protection measures.

235
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,700
Don't get dizzy

236
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,180
and have a child on the spur of the moment.

237
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,890
By then,

238
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,020
even if you feel you two are no longer suitable

239
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,860
after those years of separation,

240
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,120
it would be very troublesome to break up.

241
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,110
Fasten your seat belt.

242
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,540
We're leaving.

243
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,700
Drive safely.

244
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:00,980
You said

245
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,060
something you shouldn't have said, didn't you?

246
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,120
I'm afraid Gui Xiao is muddleheaded.

247
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,730
♫You must have secretly collected♫

248
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,160
♫So much wind and frost♫

249

♫Half a moon♫

♫The moon♫

♫You must have wiped it silently♫

255
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,130
Let's take a break.

256
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,920
♫For a long time♫

257
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,310
The next service area is quite far.

258
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,390
♫Knowing that life is silent♫

259
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,260

♫And the fallen leaves of autumn♫

267

Hot coffee.

268
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,340
The food inside

269

♫On a night when you're dating in the garden♫

270
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:25,980
didn't seem to be delicious.

271
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,040
So I didn't buy any.

272
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,220
Don't we have GPS?

273
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,280
I'm used to looking at the map.

274
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:37,340
♫The pathos of youth is sung♫

275
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,420
I came here once last year.

276
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,220
The scenery I can see along the way,

277
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,640
the location where the blacktop of the road was faded,

278
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,370
and the axle smashed by a truck,

279
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,170
I still remember them.

280
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,570
There are some things that can't be navigated through GPS.

281
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,040
Here.

282
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,140
I just remembered something.

283
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,180
Do you remember the man

284
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,380
we saw at the airport?

285
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,579
His name is Xu Yao.

286
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,440
Don't you like meat floss?

287
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,430
You like meat floss.

288
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,940
And I'm not picky. So I'll just eat this.

289
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,829
You're very observant.

290
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,640
His wife is seriously ill.

291
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,260
The local hospital confirmed that

292
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,800
she needs a spinal operation.

293
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,600
It seems to be the back of the neck.

294
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,540
But after the surgery,

295
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,390
she will face dreadful sequela.

296
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,080
They dare not do it easily.

297
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,440
So they want to go overseas for another check-up.

298
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,780
If there is a certain possibility

299
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,300
to diagnosing

300
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,630
another kind of tumour,

301
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,900
she won't need surgery,

302
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,960
but radiotherapy.

303
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,940
His wife has been sick for many years.

304
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,310
He doesn't have much savings left.

305
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,170
So he came to me.

306
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,790
I saved some for myself.

307
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,860
It's enough for the living expenses

308
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,970
of Qin Xiaonan and me.

309
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,570
I gave him the rest.

310
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,560
You're still in debt.

311
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,980
Just leave Qin Xiaonan to me.

312
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,640
He doesn't spend much anyway.

313
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:16,920
No need.

314
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,770
Qin Mingyu always pays his living expenses to me.

315
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,660
Xu Yao and his wife

316
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,460
have known each other since childhood.

317
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,520
They've been tangled for many years.

318
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,310
Probably the year before last.

319
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,650
His wife got sick.

320
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,460
And they keep visiting the doctor since then.

321
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,700
At that moment, they haven't gotten married yet.

322
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,180
His wife refused to get a marriage certificate.

323
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,500
She didn't want to weigh him down.

324
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,420
But Xu Yao

325
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,270
held a wedding ceremony for her

326
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,160
and insisted on marrying her.

327
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,520
Life is so unpredictable.

328
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,010
The previous year, you were still happy with the achievements

329
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,190
but fell into the mud pit the next year.

330
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,700
It's not like Xu Yao could abandon his wife

331
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,100
just because she's sick.

332
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,660
And those who have been married.

333
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,550
After getting married,

334
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,210
if anyone has a career crisis,

335
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,150
they would overcome it together.

336
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,900
Everyone faces ups and downs

337
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,340
in their lives.

338
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,640
You can't hope for your lover

339
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,280
to support you selflessly

340
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,810
when you are facing difficulty.

341
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,060
but then

342
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,780
you yourself find a better person

343
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,980
when you have achieved a great success.

344
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,690
But that's not reality.

345
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,970
It's imagination.

346
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,630
Meng Xiaoshan cares about me.

347
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,970
Don't mind what she said.

348
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,300
Meng Xiaoshan

349
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,460
doesn't have a clear understanding of

350
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,260
my situation.

351
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,130
At most, only two years.

352
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,740
I will settle my debt.

353
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,630
Then I'll save money to marry you.

354
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,170
You wish!

355
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,590
Are you not willing to marry me?

356
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,000
If you agree,

357
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,060
we'll sleep in the same room tonight.

358
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,520
If you don't agree, we'll sleep separately.

359
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,110
The room we booked yesterday

360
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,590
has a double bed.

361
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:11,150
[Jimu Cliff]

362
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,690
Captain Lu.

363
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,470
How have you been these two years?

364
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,400
Good.

365
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,740
This is...

366
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,940
Gui Xiao, my girlfriend.

367
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,260
Hello.

368
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,390
Hello, I'm Sun Hao.

369
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,030
Captain Lu.

370
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,490
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

371
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,020
If you told me earlier,

372
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,620
I would have arranged for a deluxe couple package

373
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,290
for you.

374
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,700
Do you still have this kind of service?

375
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,680
It's for vacation.

376
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,740
Of course we have suites for couples.

377
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,900
Why are you taking me here?

378
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,980
It's cold.

379
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,660
Hang in there.

380
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,860
The sunrise will be beautiful tomorrow morning.

381
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,390
Trust me.

382
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,000
Let me do it.

383
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,290
You came at the right time.

384
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,980
Winter is not the peak season.

385
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,560
There are fewer people staying here.

386
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,130
Look,

387
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,140
during the summer,

388
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,540
it is an endless prairie.

389
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,060
We simply followed

390
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,960
the design of a Mongolian yurt

391
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,020
and built a resort.

392
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,550
Thank you.

393
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:16,940
Xiao.

394
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,420
Actually, I'm not

395
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,620
in Captain Lu's team.

396
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,090
I'm not qualified.

397
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,970
They are

398
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,250
all elites.

399
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,820
But Captain Lu taught us how to dismantle bombs.

400
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,680
He's my master.

401
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,460
Do you know how I felt

402
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,990
when I first met Captain Lu?

403
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,390
He's so arrogant.

404
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,130
The first time I saw him

405
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,060
standing there,

406
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,540
the first sentence he said was,

407
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,070
"It's not easy to be a SWAT."

408
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,250
He scared us on the first day

409
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,540
saying that there is no absolute expert in dismantling bombs.

410
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,670
Everyone is just risking their lives.

411
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,110
Well,

412
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,580
the EOD expert,

413
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,200
who had a communication with him last year,

414
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,930
was just killed in the war zone.

415
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,110
When I first learned it,

416
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,260
I was very careful.

417
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,000
I thought I was successful.

418
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,420
So I cut it off.

419
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,730
And then he came.

420
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,190
Do you know what Captain Lu said?

421
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:00,620
What?

422
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,050
He said I was already blown to death.

423
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,580
Before Captain Lu left...

424
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,110
Alright.

425
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,530
Let's not talk about the past.

426
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,650
How can I not?

427
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,210
That was all your heroic deeds.

428
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:12,600
Xiao.

429
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,810
When Captain Lu

430
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,940
covered for others,

431
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,600
he was shot.

432
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,860
You should have seen the scar.

433
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,340
Captain Lu.

434
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,170
The third one from this side.

435
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,140
I have to help my mom with the account.

436
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,800
Captain Lu.

437
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,140
The horses are all here.

438
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,270
Pick one if you want.

439
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,590
I'll go back first.

440
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,460
It's all dark.

441
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,420
They slept so early.

442
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,390
It's late.

443
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,520
It's already eleven.

444
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,440
How many beds are in there?

445
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:08,480
♫I want to watch the sunrise with you♫

446
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,380
♫I close my eyes and make a wish♫

447
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,440
♫Your shadow becomes further with the long road♫

448
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,580
♫It becomes the truth of my empty dream♫

449
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:35,960
♫Love is the gentle looks of a youth♫

450
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,650
♫Be bolder, come closer♫

451
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:49,530
♫You are the curtain call speech for my youth♫

452
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:54,960
♫You are everything on my tiny planet♫

453
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,640
♫I've thought about it once in a while♫

454
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,820
May I?

455
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,170
♫The wind blows towards the snowfield♫

456
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:09,420
♫Your light will drive away all the cold nights♫

457
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,890
You kissed me that time

458
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,200
without asking.

459
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,990
♫I'm willing to♫

460
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,390
♫Hold all my thoughts♫

461
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,780
♫All dreams are coming for you♫

462
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,620
It was normal when I was injured.

463
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,750
Aren't you an EOD technician?

464
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,630
EOD is my major.

465
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,370
The duty of SWAT

466
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,170
is to maintain the stability of our country.

467
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,530
Whether it's a gunfight, knife battle,

468
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,390
or bomb, I've encountered it all.

469
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,990
You didn't mention it before.

470
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,910
What's there to say?

471
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,080
On the first day I went in,

472
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,760
the old captain told me

473
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
there were things

474
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,580
you shouldn't tell your family

475
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,860
and you'd better not.

476
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,780
It has no benefits

477
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,890
except to worry them.

478
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,630
All these years in the SWAT,

479
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,710
none of us was uninjured.

480
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,220
Last year,

481
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,080
a new kid

482
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,280
hurt his leg during training.

483
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,980
He was quite happy.

484
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,750
He said,

485
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,110
finally, he was injured

486
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,630
and dared to say

487
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,950
that he belonged to the squadron.

488
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,840
You insisted on going.

489
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,250
You didn't listen to any of my advice.

490
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,540
Now you've suffered so much.

491
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,700
This is crazy.

492
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,660
Why do you have to come to the prairie in winter?

493
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,070
People usually come in summer.

494
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,650
It's freezing all night.

495
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,780
I am frozen to death.

496
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,330
The craziest thing is

497
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,800
watching the sunrise.

498
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,060
Sunrise my ass.

499
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,130
I'm going to sleep with Sun Hao.

500
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,070
Calm down.

501
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,260
We've been frozen all night.

502
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,280
Why are you still watching the sunrise?

503
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,940
Okay, go on.

504
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,580
All right.

505
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,100
It's all your fault.

506
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,970
Did you just quarrel with your girlfriend?

507
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,040
Besides this,

508
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,180
I can't think of anything else.

509
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:27,700
Your girlfriend is still

510
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,900
lying on her warm bed.

511
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,970
What can you do coming out

512
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,430
in the middle of the night?

513
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,170
Go that way. It's spacious.

514
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,590
Wait for me.

515
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,890
Last time when we came here,

516
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,470
his wife was still here.

517
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,330
Now, she's gone.

518
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,630
He's left alone.

519
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,820
Let me knock on the door.

520
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,100
He has said it many times.

521
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,880
When you return,

522
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,680
he wants to have a drink with you.

523
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,720
It's too late.

524
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,870
The light is still on.

525
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,330
The guest-welcoming light is on.

526
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,530
It means that the host hasn't slept yet.

527
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,560
Who is it?

528
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,460
Good evening.

529
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,120
Why are you here today?

530
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,440
Captain Lu.

531
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,940
Come on.

532
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,980
Here, take it.

533
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,520
Here, take it.

534
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,850
Sit down.

535
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,630
I made it myself.

536
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,320
Have a taste.

537
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,490
Come on.

538
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,160
Drink.

539
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:21,650
Drink.

540
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,300
The last time we met was...

541
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,620
Two years ago.

542
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,970
Yes.

543
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,730
Is Captain Lu still in Qining?

544
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,700
I went back to my hometown.

545
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Back to hometown?

546
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,020
Okay.

547
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,900
You've reached the age.

548
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,900
It's good to be with your parents.

549
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,390
Here.

550
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,130
Let's eat.

551
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,320
You're drinking too fast.

552
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,180
Here.

553
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:21,710
Captain Lu.

554
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,210
Here.

555
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,690
I wish you could stay for a few more days.

556
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,470
My youngest son is coming back.

557
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,180
Next time.

558
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,310
When he goes to Beijing next time,

559
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,380
ask him to come to me.

560
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:36,900
Okay.

561
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,140
Actually, when I heard about

562
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,650
your family situation at first,

563
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:48,780
I was quite shocked.

564
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,820
What for?

565
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,100
There are over 20 police officers in a family.

566
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,500
It is heroic to say,

567
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,360
but difficult to do.

568
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,040
Outsiders don't understand.

569
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,570
We, as your peers, know that

570
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,880
the family glory

571
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,490
is paid for with blood and tears.

572
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,030
Family glory.

573
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,380
Family glory.

574
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,610
Captain Lu.

575
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:21,790
Thank you.

576
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,570
My stepfather

577
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:44,410
was also a person who defended the country.

578
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,020
He married my mother for only a few years

579
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,750
and died of illness after that.

580
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,600
I had his influence

581
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,410
in getting into this career.

582
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,100
I had no goal when I was studying.

583
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,520
I came here after graduation.

584
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,890
In the frontline of the police force,

585
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,500
I have arrested

586
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,030
the most vicious fugitives

587
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,060
and dismantled thousands of

588
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,520
bombs, professional or non-professional.

589
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:11,900
I think

590
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,239
this is the best way to live.

591
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,860
That's why I envy you.

592
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,300
With the guidance of your parents,

593
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,960
you've avoided many detours.

594
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,469
Is something bothering you today?

595
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,949
People always have something on their minds.

596
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,030
Sometimes more,

597
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,790
sometimes less.

598
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,460
Have you visited your former captain?

599
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,670
The day after tomorrow.

600
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,010
I'll go on my way back.

601
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,550
Also, I'll visit some old friends.

602
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,980
Have some warm milk tea to warm up your body.

603
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,800
Not bad, right?

604
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,000
What were you talking about with Mama Sun?

605
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,870
She said the couple yesterday

606
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,170
was frozen

607
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:56,950
and had a big fight.

608
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,350
They didn't even see the sunrise this morning.

609
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,350
They just went straight to the city.

610
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,370
It's really cold.

611
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,350
And the more I slept, the colder I got.

612
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,320
I just woke up from the cold

613
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
and I found you...

614
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:35,960
♫I want to watch the sunrise with you♫

615
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,140
Do you know what this is called?

616
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,850
♫I close my eyes and make a wish♫

617
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:39,810
What?

618
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,840
The sunlight in the morning (Chen Xiao in Pinyin).

619
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,920
♫Your shadow becomes further with the long road♫

620
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:55,050
It becomes the truth of my empty dream♫

621
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:03,430
♫Love is the gentle looks of a youth♫

622
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:10,130
♫Be bolder, come closer♫

623
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:17,010
♫You are the curtain call speech for my youth♫

624
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,540
Don't you think we're destined to be together?

625
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,700
How can you tell?

626
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,030
Look.

627
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:22,440
You are everything on my tiny planet♫

628
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,180
The last word

629
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,620
of your name is Chen.

630
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,570
Mine is Xiao.

631
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,040
Chen Xiao.

632
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,890
It means the sunlight in the morning.

633
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,500
♫I'm willing to♫

634
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,890
Isn't it perfect?

635
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,900
♫Hold all my thoughts♫

636
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:36,880
♫All dreams are coming for you♫

637
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,780
♫Because it's you♫

638
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,580
♫It's almighty you♫

639
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,090
♫I've travelled through time♫

640
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,620
♫Only for a reunion with you♫

641
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,030
♫Because it's you♫

642
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:57,940
♫You're always at the end of my dream♫

643
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,290
♫Maybe in my life♫

644
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,590
Have some milk tea.

645
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:07,450
♫I've been waiting for dawn to meet you♫

646
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,800
Thank you.

647
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,530
After that couple left,

648
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,460
you are indeed

649
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:11,740
♫You're my only desire♫

650
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,090
the only privileged guests.

651
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,790
You guys talk.

652
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:20,410
♫I just want to hold you tight♫

653
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,520
Come in.

654
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,780
This is a senior apartment.

655
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,940
We have the most convenient transportation.

656
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,980
And the location is good

657
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,170
in the second ring.

658
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,030
Friendship Hospital

659
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,320
is right in front of us.

660
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,740
There are gym and entertainment rooms.

661
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,500
It's totally a hotel apartment.

662
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,960
The rooms are in a suite...

663
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,400
Yes.

664
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,830
My boss is calling. Sorry.

665
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,240
Go ahead. I'll look around by myself.

666
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:49,610
Okay.

667
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,030
Okay.

668
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,570
How is this apartment?

669
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,890
It's pretty good.

670
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,970
We viewed five apartments this morning.

671
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,270
Give a comment.

672
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,800
Me?

673
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,020
I want to know

674
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,790
your view as a kid.

675
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,970
Good.

676
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,440
That's all?

677
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:20,850
You lack words in the expression.

678
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,450
I'll get you more language classes after this.

679
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,650
Aunt Duan Rou.

680
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,490
Why are we viewing

681
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,840
the senior apartments?

682
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,250
It's a long story.

683
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,370
How about I treat you to a nice meal?

684
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:40,900
Let's go.

685
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,990
I'm also from a single-parent family.

686
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,790
Just like you.

687
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,660
My mum

688
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,820
is not in good health recently.

689
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,140
But I often go on business trips

690
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,270
and don't have time to take care of her.

691
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,420
So I am thinking of

692
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,100
arranging for a senior apartment for her.

693
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,020
There are doctors

694
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,500
and others taking care of her.

695
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,900
There are also new friends to play with her.

696
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,690
After finding a few,

697
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:16,180
I suddenly became interested

698
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,180
in this industry,

699
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,540
and started investing.

700
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,950
Didn't your father look for you?

701
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,060
He's busy.

702
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,910
After Uncle Lu left,

703
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:28,930
he will be

704
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,760
the captain of the SWAT brigade.

705
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,150
Is it delicious?

706
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,630
Yes.

707
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,360
One more?

708
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,280
One more.

709
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,480
Come on.

710
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,410
Thank you.

711
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,060
Here, eat.

712
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,920
Make yourself at home.

713
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,150
Have another bun.

714
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,010
Thank you.

715
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,920
The people here

716
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,410
are really enthusiastic.

717
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,390
Last time when I came with Cai Yaya,

718
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,610
we met a family on the way

719
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,010
that we didn't even know.

720
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,780
We just wanted to ask for directions,

721
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,860
but they pulled us into their house

722
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,860
and gave us a bowl of milk tea

723
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,990
and some beef jerky.

724
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,600
We were both dumbfounded.

725
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,770
Change the channel to CCTV and watch the news.

726
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,660
I have a call.

727
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,840
I need to answer a call.

728
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,800
Hello, who is this?

729
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,850
I'm Gui Yuanshan,

730
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,440
the father of Gui Xiao.

731
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,050
You remember me, right?
