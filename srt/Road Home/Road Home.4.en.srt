00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,030
you won first place today.

191
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,690
It's on her.

192
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,790
Then I'll buy something else.

193
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,920
W-who left this?

194
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:07,800
I did.

195
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,260
Chen asked me to put it here.

196
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,560
He said you asked him to buy it for you.

197
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,010
Please thank him for me.

198
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:19,820
What?

199
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,490
He's just in class 7 next door.

200
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,030
You can thank him yourself.

201
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,680
Okay, fine.

202
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,000
I'll go.

203
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,300

204
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,010
Gui Xiao says thank you.

205
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,530
Got it.

206
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,390
Help me tell her,

207
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,570
she's welcome.

[Nurse's Office]

209
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,500
You fell?

210
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,540
You're so mischievous.

211
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,740
You have to protect your face when you fall.

212
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,140
It'll be troublesome if your face is disfigured.

213
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,420
What should you do

214
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,020
if you scarred your face?

215
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,750
How did you fall?

216
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,310
Aren't you afraid of being disfigured?

217
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,670
Are you even trying to comfort me?

218
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,210
Does it hurt?

219
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,090
What if I get disfigured?

220
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,670
How did you fall?

221
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,460
I was just running my 800 meters run...

222
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,540
and was fooling around with my classmates...

223
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,880
so I fell on the field.

224
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,110
Move aside.

225
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,620
You'll recover sooner or later. What are you afraid of?

226
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,280
You're not the one who's hurt.

227
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,080
If I can't recover, my face will be disfigured.

228
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,890
Stop laughing.

229
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,540
Did you get an injection?

230
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,460
That's fine then.

231
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,580
It doesn't matter whether you get disfigured or not.

232
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,110
Who says it doesn't matter?

233
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,980
Me.

234
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,340
Are you going home? It's not on your way.

235
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,160
I'll take you home.

236
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,410
Otherwise, you might not keep your eyes on the road

237
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,410
and hurt the other side of your face.

238
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,260
My home is far away.

239
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,550
It's not like I haven't been there before.

240
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,670
Speed up.

242
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,380
Chen?

243
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,710
Why are you here?

244
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,420
No one's cooking in the garage.

245
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,550
I came to my sister's house for dinner.

246
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,440
Did you come together?

247
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,930
No, we bumped into each other on the way.

248
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,490
I'm leaving. Bye.

249
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,810
Bye.

253
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,410
See you later.

254
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,670
He left first.

256
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:12,900
I...

257
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,980
Props to Hai Jianfeng.

258
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,860
He confessed his love after graduation.

259
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,060
Why are you laughing?

260
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,670
Why hasn't Haidong come recently?

261
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,790
We broke up.

262
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,660
It's fine that he kept

263
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,500
fooling around with girls.

264
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,260
He even flirted with

265
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,790
that Zhao Minshan you know.

266
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,040
That got me so angry.

267
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,160
I scolded him

268
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,160
and we broke up.

269
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,630
Zhao Minshan?

270
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,910
You are here too.

271
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,390
Why aren't you going in?

272
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,020
Can you listen to me?

273
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,750

274
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,110
Okay?

275
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,480
It's not what you think.

276
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,860
Can you calm down? What are you doing?

277
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,980
No, you...

278
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,540
You know

279
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,680
that woman.

280
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,300
She likes to flirt,

281
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,620
and also talk nonsense all day long.

282
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,970
Last year,

283
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,330
she even chased Lu Chen.

284
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,140
What are you talking about?

285
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,140
I swear.

286
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,220
This is the last time.

287
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,940
If I do this again,

288
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,030
you can dump me immediately.

289
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,160
You've been dumped.

290
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,100
I refuse.

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,940
Hello? Xiao.

297

He asked me to call you.

301
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,550
To the hospital?

302
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,560
Yes.

303
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,020
I said you hate the hospital.

304
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,420
You'd definitely not come.

305
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,380
My brother said

306
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,680
if he asked you to come,

307
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,160
you will definitely come.

308
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,300
Say something. Are you coming?

309
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,550
Wait for me.

310
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,070

Go ahead.

throw chalk at me?

You're just waiting for me to pull you back.

00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,200
You think too much.

368
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,550

00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,380
play billiards

370

How is that possible?

00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,540
You're not good at shooting.

379
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,760
Fine. Listen to me.

380
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,340
You even brought it here.

381
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:25,900
Give it to me.

382
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,480

Don't order me around.

00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,620
Nice!

386
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,580
Follow my order.

387
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,060
Come with me.

388
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,790
Listen to me.

389
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,140
The person I'm waiting for is here.

390
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,020
Come here.

391
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,750
Listen to me.

392
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,780
This way.

393
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,660
Follow me.

394
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,920
- Slowly. - Be careful!

395
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,340
Come on.

396
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,340
Come on.

397
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,140
One more round. Come on.

398
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,670
This way.

- Here, here! - Haidong.

400
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,790
- What? - Help me find a restaurant

401
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,720
and book a table.

402
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,110
What for?

403
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,030
I'm leaving for university soon.

404
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,290
I want to buy everyone a farewell dinner.

If only you

408
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,840
confessed to me earlier.

409
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,300

It’s a deal.

413
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,080
Where is Lu Chen? You broke up?

414
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,290
He went into closed training.

415
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,490
It's a long-distance relationship.

416
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,140
And you can't even meet during the holidays.

417
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,900
You guys are really

418
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,630
dating with your imagination.

419
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:45,990
It's true love.

420
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,880
Go away. So annoying.

I'm afraid that one day

422
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,260
he'd tell me

423
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,540
"I don't feel anything anymore. Let's break up."

424
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,740
No sense of security?

425
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,990
It's Lu Chen...

426
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,460

430
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,380
As long as Lu Chen is willing,

431
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,020
no one would

432
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,510
reject him.

We broke up a long time ago.

437
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,550
Why would he contact me?

438
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,950
If he looks for me again, he'd get beaten to death by my father.

439
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,830
I didn't dare to ask.

440
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,290
Why did you break up?

441
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,620
Zhao Minshan.

442
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,240
It's still because of that famous

443
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,240
campus beau in your year.

444
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,770
It's her again?

445

This is the drink your mom asked for.

446
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,610

Yes.

452
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580

453
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,980
Introduce what?

454
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,190
Just call him brother-in-law.

455
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:08,900
Alright.

456
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,140

Bye-bye.

459
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,500
He looks familiar.

460
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,140
He's the boss of the venue I've

461
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,610
once booked for my birthday party.

462
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,540
Do you remember?

463
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,680
When did you two...

464
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,150
When I just broke up with Haidong,

465
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,810
I couldn't recover for weeks.

466
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,260
I stayed up all night

467
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,740
playing games through the night at internet cafes.

468
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,540
They're all places owned by him.

469
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,030
One day,

470
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,440
he came to me and told me

471
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,220
that rascal

472
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,080
is not worth it.

473
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,960
Get together with me instead.

474
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,780
I wanted to make Haidong angry.

475
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,630
I agreed without thinking.

476
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,900
Afterwards,

477
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,330
I fell in love.

478
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,580
Only you and Lu Chen are still going strong.

479
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,110
I hope you can hang in there.

480
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:10,770
I hope so.

481
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,600
No winter vacation homework?

482
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,139
No, it's not high school.

483
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,520
Why don't you come out to watch some TV?

484
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,540
Whose phone call are you waiting for?

485
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,260
No.

486
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,510
Your mom told me

487
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:41,199
that you have a boyfriend.

488
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,820
I need to answer the phone, Aunt.

489
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,860
Please go out.

490
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,820
Is there a secret?

491
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,350
You don't want me to hear it?

492
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,830
You're home?

493
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,540
Just got home.

494
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,430
Are you coming?

495
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,420
My aunt

496
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,180
won't let me go out today.

497
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,640
Forget it then.

498
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,490
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

499
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,870
Are you staying at home during winter break?

500
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,210
No, I don't have a place at home.

501
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,310
I'm staying in the garage.

503
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,200
Lu Chen.

504
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,250
Come in. I’ll get him for you.

505
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,260
It's freezing.

506
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,160
Come in if you're cold.

507
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,270
I mean you're freezing.

508
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,760
You wear so little.

509
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,720
Are you surprised?

510
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,330
Your girlfriend?

511
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,460
I'm going to get married to the boss in the future.

512
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,090
There's a car that's hard to repair.

513
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,260
I'll finish it first.

514
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,340
I'll stay with you then.

515
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,270
I haven't seen you fix a car before.

516
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,190
Luckily, you have a handsome face.

517
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,850
No matter what you do, you still look good.

518
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:48,790
Well,

519
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,340
you have been going out every day.

520
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,470
Where are you going?

521
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,620
Nowhere in particular.

522
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,740
Nowhere in particular?

523
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,860
It's rare for you two

524
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,950
long-distance lovers to meet, how can you go nowhere?

525
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,290
It's too cold outside. I don't want to go out.

526
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,470
It's quite fun to watch him repair cars in the garage.

527
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,600
Young people are so easily satisfied.

528
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,300

531

How many times have you told me that?

532
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,140
Go home and wash up.

533
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,420
I was told that

534
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,200
the water boiler here is solar-powered.

535
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,900
The water temperature is not hot enough these days.

536
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,260
It's too far to go and come back.

537
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,950
I don't want to waste time on the way.

538
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,550
It's okay. I'll wait for you.

539
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,010
I don't want you to wait.

540
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,820
Come here.

541
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,720

There's someone who's super annoying in school.

00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,870
They keep looking for me after school.

546
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,120
I wish you were here.

547

They're pursuing you?

548
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,100
I don't want to watch it anymore.

549
