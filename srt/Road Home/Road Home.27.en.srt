00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:25,990
Alright.

193
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:31,320
♫On an uneventful night♫

194
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,500
Go ask the doctor in charge if it's okay.

195
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,020
Thank you.

196
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,950
You're welcome.

197
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,030
Don't worry.

198
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,110
Hello.

199
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,410
Hello, Shen Jin, it's me.

200
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,840
I know.

201
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,390
Go ahead.

202
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,220
I'm in Qining.

203
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,660
Something happened to Lu Chen.

204
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,060
Xiao came here to see him.

205
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,310
She's in the delivery room now.

206
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,140
Did she just go in?

207
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,060
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

208
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,120
Even if I'm not in China,

209
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,450
you should have told me.

210
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,420
It's not that I didn't want to tell you.

211
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,420
Calm down.

212
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,320
It happened all of a sudden.

213
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,080
Luckily, Xu Yao is with her.

214
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,010
I can rest assured.

215
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,700
It's just that

216
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,830
it's my first time experiencing this.

217
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,600
I'm a little flustered.

218
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,150
That's true.

219
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,430
When I gave birth,

220
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,520
you were not there.

221
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,290
You haven't experienced it.

222
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,150
I didn't expect

223
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,550
you would be the first person I thought of

224
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,560
when I got flustered.

225
00:16:59,070 --> 00:16:59,670
Of course.

226
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,430
Because I'm Gui Xiao's mother.

227
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,740
By the way,

228
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Xu Yao is with her.

229
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,619
He is reliable.

230
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,480
There shouldn't be a big problem.

231
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,690
The lengths of labor

232
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,690
vary among women.

233
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,260
You need to be ready

234
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,700
to wait for a long time.

235
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:15,280
Also,

236
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,579
ask your secretary to buy some food.

237
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,140
Okay.

238
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,349
Tell me if anything happens.

239
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,540
Okay, I will.

240
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,650
You're not young anymore.

241
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,970
Don't panic.

242
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,470
Our daughter is tough.

243
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,060
Although giving birth is highly risky,

244
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,360
I believe she can handle it.

245
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,370
She has the same personality as you.

246
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,710
When I was her age,

247
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,620
I wasn't as independent as she is now.

248
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,820
She's better than me.

249
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,760
[Maternity room]

250
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,770
[Delivery room]

251
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,770
[Maternity room]

252
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,230
Is my husband awake?

253
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,720
Not yet.

254
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,730
They will update us anytime.

255
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,750
Just focus on your labor.

256
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,910
I'll accompany you to the delivery room.

257
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,670
The nurse reported this to their department leader.

258
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,130
The hospital approved it.

259
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,250
I didn't expect

260
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,820
to be

261
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,600
in the same hospital as him.

262
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,060
This must be fate.

263
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,950
He and I

264
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,070
have always been fated to be together.

265
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,900
Gui Xiao's family.

266
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,570
Here.

267
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
It's a daughter. 2.65 kg.

268
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,700
Great.

269
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,400
How is my daughter?

270
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,820
She's still under observation.

271
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,490
She had a natural birth.

272
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,100
She'll be sent to the ward in half an hour.

273
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,220
You can ask the nurse

274
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,480
to take you there first.

275
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,900
Okay, thank you.

276
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,800
Look. She's pretty.

277
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,900
I can't tell who she looks like.

278
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,870
She was just born.

279
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,010
Her facial features haven't fully developed.

280
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,340
You can't tell it at all.

281
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
Based on my experience, she'll look

282
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,750
half like you and half like Lu Chen.

283
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,360
How is... Lu Chen?

284
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,700
He woke up.

285
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,110
He's out of danger.

286
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,660
But he's still under the effects of anesthesia.

287
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,990
So he fell asleep again.

288
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,230
Have a good rest.

289
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,540
Don't rush to see him.

290
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,570
How can I not rush?

291
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,230
I'll take you to see your dad later.

292
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,590
By the way,

293
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,870
your father had been here all the time.

294
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,270
Then

295
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,950
I asked him to go back and rest.

296
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,120
I thought

297
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,340
Lu Chen might not be able to see

298
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,670
our newborn child.

299
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,700
And I

300
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,100
almost died just now.

301
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,560
It's all over.

302
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,450
Everything's fine now.

303
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,580
Eat something first.

304
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,040
Yes, eat something first.

305
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,800
I have no appetite.

306
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,950
You had a natural birth.

307
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,210
You can eat whatever you like. It's okay.

308
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,210
I'm not in the mood.

309
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,830
Don't worry, my lady.

310
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,380
I've talked to

311
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,140
the nurse there.

312
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,340
Once Lu Chen wakes up,

313
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,510
she'll let us know.

314
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,820
You haven't eaten anything all day,

315
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,750
and used a lot of strength just now.

316
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,630
Aren't you hungry?

317
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,290
Yes.

318
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,820
Then hurry up and eat,

319
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,740
my lady.

320
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:03,970
Here.

321
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:09,880
Here.

322
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,260
Is he awake?

323
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,020
Not yet.

324
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,970
His superior came to see him.

325
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,910
He was still unconscious at that time.

326
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,840
But don't worry.

327
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,490
I've told the nurse on that floor

328
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,220
to call us as soon as he wakes up.

329
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,780
Your dad and your brother

330
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,980
also went to check the situation there.

331
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,530
It's still early.

332
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,460
Go back to sleep.

333
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,720
I'll let you know if there's any news.

334
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,520
Thank you.

335
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,070
You do look like your dad.

336
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,870
What should I call you?

337
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,350
Lu Chen is awake.

338
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,310
He woke up just now?

339
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,540
Can he speak? Can he recognize others?

340
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,160
Yes.

341
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,260
I've got you a wheelchair.

342
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,390
I'll push you there.

343
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,020
This is my first time

344
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,270
sitting in a wheelchair.

345
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,500
-Thank you.
-Go ahead.

346
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,700
I'll leave her to you.

347
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm a little nervous.

348
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,330
Why are you nervous?

349
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,960
I'm nervous about seeing him.

350
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,380
It was the same in the past.

351
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,250
I was nervous every time I went to see him.

352
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,300
Isn't it strange?

353
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,400
This didn't change after we got together.

354
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,330
I remember

355
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,170
I went to see him one night,

356
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,590
and he came out wearing a shirt

357
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,110
and carrying a spanner.

358
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,260
It was a windy winter night.

359
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,370
He only wore a shirt.

360
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,790
Seeing him like this,

361
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,280
my heart beat really fast.

362
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,150
I didn't even dare to walk over.

363
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,350
That small ward was given to her.

364
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,440
Special approval.

365
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:12,900
She is the wife

366
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,340
of the injured policeman sent here yesterday.

367
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,400
She gave birth as soon as she arrived.

368
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,940
Is there anything we can do?

369
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,600
Boss, are you out of your mind?

370
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,220
He got hurt in an explosion.

371
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,680
We are the ENT department.

372
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,360
Lu Chen.

373
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,320
I feel like we are still in school,

374
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,930
♫I want to watch the sunrise with you♫

375
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,580
yet I have born you a daughter.

376
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:27,820
♫I close my eyes and make a wish♫

377
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,940
Did you cry because it hurt too much?

378
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:34,890
♫Your shadow becomes further with the long road♫

379
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,030

It must have taken you a long time.

590

I sanded it whenever I had time.

I eventually got it done.

592

Gui Xiao, is there something urgent?

Is it inconvenient for you

596
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,960
to answer my call at this time?

597
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:34,770
It's okay.

598
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,150
Just make it short.

599
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,110
Gui Xiao?

600
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,150
I want to hear more from you.

601
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,630
Can you talk more?

602
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,550
Lu Chen, I miss you.

603
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,580
You caught a cold? A summer cold?

604
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,360
A slight cold.

605
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,790
Go buy some medicine, okay?

606
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,020
Why aren't you talking?

607
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,990
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

608
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,190
Go buy some medicine.

609
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,770
Don't hang up, okay?

610
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,210
I'll come to you after the training ends.

611
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,000
Wait for me for another three months.

612
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,720
Lu Chen, don't hang up, okay?

613
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,490
We haven't had a good talk

614
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:48,870

Can you grow up?

617
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,150
No.

618
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,010
Why is everyone asking me to grow up?

619
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,200
I'm hanging up.

620
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,740
I'll come to you after the training ends.

621
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,670
Lu Chen, if you dare to hang up on me,

622
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,190
there will be no next time.

623
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,060
You'll never see me again.
