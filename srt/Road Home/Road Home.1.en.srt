00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:42,880
Get in.

191
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,490
♫An ethereal heart♫

192
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,760
The owner of the gas station told us

193
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,180
to check the prairie first.

194
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,300
♫A healed wound♫

195
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,070
We might be able to find the car.

196
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:56,790
♫The eagerness to wait for you has overtaken the anxiety♫

197
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,270
Get in.

198
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,990
I have three friends with me too.

199
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,910
I'll go get them,

200
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,770
give me a while.

201
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,150
Let's go.

202
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,160
He's here.

203
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,450
Finally.

204
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,400
We got some help.

205
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,810
Nice to meet you, Captain Lu.

206
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,810
We'll sit behind.

207
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,650
Okay.

208
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,910
He's still the same.

209
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,470
Regardless of if it's spring, summer, autumn, or winter,

210
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,270
he has to have the window opened.

211
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,200
Can you close the window?

212
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,300
Gui Xiao's friend is so cool.

213
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,160
He's a SWAT captain.

214
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,480
Of course he's cool. How else can he scare the criminals

215
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,430
and protect us?

216
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,210
We lost our car

217
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,040
two hours ago.

218
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,900
I wanted to call the police,

219
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,970
but thought of you,

220
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
so I called to ask.

221
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,060
The owner of the gas station said

222
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,540
given his experience,

223
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,790
the car is likely to be

224
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,630
in a forest not far away.

225
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,790
The car thieves

226
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,370
have nowhere to park the cars they've looted from

227
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,830
so they'd toss them there.

228
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,930
These thieves are so smart.

229
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,000
There are no cameras there.

230
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,870
Even if we find the car,

231
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,070
we won't be able to find out who stole it.

232
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,200
Captain Lu, do you know the way?

233
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,360
Yes.

234
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:03,960
That's good.

235
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,660
We'll follow you then.

236
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,980
It's snowy.

237
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,090
Drive slowly.

238
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,110
I called the police for you.

239
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,240
The person in charge will be here soon.

240
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,380
Your friend is so cold.

241
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,320
I was too scared to

242
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,450
say thank you to him.

243
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,430
He's always been like this.

244
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:12,780
I'll go down

245
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,260
and talk to him.

246
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:15,690
Slowly.

247
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,470
Aren't you cold?

248
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:11,930
This is yours.

249
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,130
Thank you.

250
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,300
For helping me.

251
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,120
You're welcome.

252
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,700
How long have you been here?

253
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,610
Nine years.

254
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,380
You haven't been promoted yet?

255
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,480
I have.

256
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,600
Are you going back?

257
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,130
Since you've been promoted,

258
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,590
you can apply to be transferred back, right?

259
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,430
I'm not going back.

260
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,830
I'm staying here.

261
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,850
What brings you here?

262
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,250
The girl in the car

263
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,780
does international trade.

264
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,490
She came here for business.

265
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,370
So I came here for a trip.

266
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,670
It's so snowy

267
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,010
and you're here for a trip?

268
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,200
Snow is also a specialty here.

269
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:03,810
Captain Lu.

270
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,300
Captain Lu.

271
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,780
This is the person who called the police.

272
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,910
I'll leave it to you.

273
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,090
This is her car.

274
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,190
And these cars

275
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
were also stolen.

276
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,880
These stolen cars already have a police report lodged.

277
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,810
The thieves have been apprehended

278
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,180
but they refused to tell us

279
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,100
where the stolen cars were hidden.

280
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,900
Turns out they were hidden here.

281
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,350
I found it by chance.

282
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,550
I'll leave it to you.

283
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,810
- I’ve got something else on. I’m leaving.
- Okay, go ahead.

284
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,720
Hello, I'm the car owner.

285
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,240
Okay.

286
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,030
If it's convenient,

287
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,450
could you drive back

288
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,370
with me

289
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,920
to take a statement?

290
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:40,920
Sure.

291
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,630
Okay.

292
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,860
Thank you.

293
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,170
You're welcome.

294
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,360
Where are you going next?

295
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,160
We want to stay in town for a few days

296
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,650
and then go to Qining City.

297
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,980
Business first, then travel.

298
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,420
Are you close to that

299
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,130
Captain Lu just now?

300
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,820
We've known each other for years.

301
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,730
But we only meet

302
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
a few times a year.

303
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,610
He's in Qining City.

304
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,450
He doesn't come here often.

305
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,080
He's a nice guy.

306
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,840
He's always on the frontline of the SWAT.

307
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,350
It must be tiring to be on the frontline.

308
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,220
Of course.

309
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,650
It's also very dangerous.

310
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,120
But he’s an instructor now.

311
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,730
He teaches others how to detonate bombs.

312
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,990
When he is on a mission,

313
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,670
he would be on the frontline of counterterrorism.

314
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,300
He has

315
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,110
trained many heroes

316
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,500
to protect the people.

317
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,430
A real man.

318
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Bomb detonation?

319
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,440
He's a bomb detonation expert?

320
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,090
Yes.

321
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,440
Their team

322
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,260
is the counterterrorism team.

323
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,180
There were dozens of experts

324
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,510
that came out of the bomb detonation team.

325
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,230
They were all poached internally.

326
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,450
Captain Lu

327
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,390
could detonate a ticking bomb in 30 seconds

328
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,400
without even breaking a sweat.

329
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,220
This is not a movie.

330
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,110
It really happened.

331
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,710
You're here to fix the roof?

332
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,960
Be careful.

333
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,720
Lu!

334
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,330
The old captain's father

335
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,390
is waiting for you.

336
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,640
What's wrong?

337
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,440
You came all the way here

338
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,640
to get some fresh air?

339
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,100
I wanted to visit the old captain's father first.

340
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,300
But I thought about it

341
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,700
and decided not to.

342
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,530
You have no idea

343
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,190
how they made me cry.

344
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,470
You can cry in front of me,

345
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,070
but don't cry at their place.

346
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,300
I understand.

347
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,350
We can't use these planks anymore.

348
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,510
Pass me the toolbox

349
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,530
and the boards we brought

350
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,260
from the car.

351
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,450
I'll fix the opening gap first.

352
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,920
Otherwise, with this heavy snow,

353
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,100
the things in it

354
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,270
will get wet when the snow melts.

355
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,020
Okay, we have work to do again.

356
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,200
Be careful.

357
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,200
Thank you.

358
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,930
This is from me personally.

359
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,390
No, no.

360
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,200
Uncle,

361
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,270
I've been in Qining for so many years.

362
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,400
I've been taken care of by your family.

363
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,280
Chinese New Year is coming.

364
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,670
Take it as some sincerity by me,

365
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,470
who take you as dear as my father.

366
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,850
He doesn't spend much.

367
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,850
He also saved a lot.

368
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,670
He's not even here anymore.

369
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,730
Chen, I really don't need it.

370
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,060
Don't take it to heart.

371
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,630
I still have to count on you

372
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,530
in Qining.

373
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,080
Of course. I don't need you to remind me.

374
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,900
I'll go back to the team later. What about you?

375
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,280
Oh right,

376
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,880
you have to pick up Nan for me.

377
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,160
Have you asked Captain Lu yet?

378
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:28,410
No.

379
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,430
I'm treating.

380
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,320
I asked you to ask them out,

381
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,530
not to pay.

382
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,340
I don't want to ask him out no matter how much money it is.

383
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,650
How can you be so cruel?

384
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,340
It snowed so heavily yesterday.

385
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,820
He came to help you.

386
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,280
And I'm not the only one.

387
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,750
Zhou and Lin Yao

388
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,490
want to treat him to dinner too.

389
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,160
He didn't like socialising.

390
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,960
It's not socialising. It's just a meal to say thanks.

391
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,800
We just admire heroes.

392
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,100
I have his number anyway.

393
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,330
Don't call him.

394
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,600
No, I don't know him well.

395
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,760
Gui Xiao.

396
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,140
Why are you embarrassed?

397
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,740
You're being very immature.

398
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,220
He helped you so much.

399
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,170
He answered.

400
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,680
Hello?

401
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,590
Hello, Captain Lu.

402
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,430
I'm Cai Yaya,

403
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,770
Gui Xiao's friend.

404
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,180
We met yesterday.

405
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,340
Hello.

406
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,180
Yes.

407
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,500
Gui Xiao's phone didn't have any signal yesterday

408
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,110
so we called you with my phone.

409
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,000
Please don't mind that

410
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,330
I've saved your number.

411
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,800
It's okay.

412
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,040
Did something happen?

413
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,020
No.

414
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,680
I just want to treat you to a meal

415
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,080
to express my gratitude.

416
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,010
You have no idea how important

417
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,060
this car is to me.

418
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,760
My husband just gave it to me.

419
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,450
If I lose it, it would bring a huge crisis to my family.

420
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,690
Thank you so much.

421
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,150
Let's not delay it. How about tonight?

422
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:01,850
Okay.

423
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,110
I'll send you

424
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,860
the restaurant address later.

425
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,470
Okay.

426
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,280
Get changed.

427
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,160
Let's go eat.

428
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,110
Close the door.

429
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,580
Your awareness is amazing.

430
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,940
You call this awareness?

431
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,340
That's nothing.

432
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,650
You're going home?

433
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,830
Going for dinner.

434
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:42,610
With whom?

435
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,000
An old friend.

436
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,080
You have friends

437
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,330
besides colleagues?

438
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,200
You've grown taller.

439
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,760
You are half a head taller

440
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,020
than your classmates.

441
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,120
Of course.

442
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,090
Fasten your seat belt.

443
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,660
This is it.

444
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,210
Whose child is this?

445
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,440
Tell their parents,

446
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,810
if not they might get worried that their kid went to the wrong room.

447
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,810
Auntie, I’m with Lu Yanchen.

448
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,980
My dad went to make a call.

449
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,300
He asked me to wait for the guests here.

450
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,100
I need to use the bathroom.

451
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,750
Auntie, go out and turn right.

452
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,910
The toilet is right at the end.

453
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,270
Uncles, auntie, please sit down.

454
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,680
This kid is so sensible.

455
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,580
My dad taught me well.

456
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,950
We broke up ten years ago.

457
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,900
This child is so big.

458
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,760
It makes sense.

459
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,070
He said he would stay here in the future,

460
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,740
which means he has a home here.

461
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,230
Everything makes sense.

462
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,880
So, Gui Xiao,

463
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,460
why are you still looking for him?

464
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,320
What are you looking at?

465
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,520
The ladies' room is downstairs.

466
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,590
Come back.

467
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,640
I'll take you there.

468
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,170
No need.

469
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
I asked you to come back, you hear me?

470
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,630
Isn't it just because I dumped you back then?

471
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,460
You have a child now.

472
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,530
Why are you still acting like I owe you?

473
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,590
What are you doing?

474
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
I didn't hear you.

475
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,700
You didn't hear me?

476
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,890
Then why are you turning back?

477
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,160
She

478
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,720
doesn't want to talk to you.

479
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,500
Please forgive him, Miss.

480
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,410
Captain Lu is...

481
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,110
I mean, the former captain,

482
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,510
he just submitted his resignation report.

483
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,680
He has nothing better to do.

484
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,330
Acting all weird.

485
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,390
Didn't you say...

486
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,720
I'm unemployed now.

487
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:20,970
Why?

488
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,410
You think it's not worth buying me a meal now?

489
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,110
Miss, don't be too offended.

490
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,270
Captain Lu is very straightforward with his words.

491
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:33,490
I know.

492
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,940
Actually, Captain Lu

493
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,070
is still hesitating

494
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,880
whether he should go back to Beijing or not.

495
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
He's hesitating.

496
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,990
He's not exactly unemployed.

497
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,030
It's just temporary unemployment.

498
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,240
I might not necessarily go back.

499
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,040
It's quite troublesome to return to Beijing

500
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,330
if you have to bring your wife and kid along.

501
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,030
Household registration would be troublesome too.

502
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,070
If you need

503
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,300
any help,

504
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,700
you can look for me.

505
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,020
Looks like your son is up to something again.

506
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,560
No way.

507
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,770
He's so afraid of you.

508
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,500
How could he play tricks on you?

509
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,530
But it's possible too.

510
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,280
He's grown up

511
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,340
and is bolder now.

512
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,950
Miss, here's the thing.

513
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,050
Miss, please forgive me.

514
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,330
That is my son.

515
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,430
My son

516
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,180
knows there are many bachelors in the team.

517
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,560
When they go on blind dates,

518
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,440
he'd pull some tricks.

519
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,740
He kept calling them his father,

520
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,200
chasing away many ladies.

521
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,250
I apologize.

522
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,420
So that's not your son.

523
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,900
What a pity.

524
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,460
He's so cute.

525
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,480
He's cute?

526
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,050
That brat is up to no good.

527
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,300
Oh right,

528
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,550
let me introduce myself.

529
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,750
My name is Qin Mingyu.

530
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,710
I'm from Lu Yanchen's team.

531
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,070
That brat is my son.

532
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,610
His name is Qin Xiaonan.

533
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,340
I'm Gui Xiao.

534
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,560
Weren't you going to the toilet?

535
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,640
I don't want to go anymore.

536
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,090
Dad.

537
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,560
Hello.

538
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,989
You played tricks again.

539
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,960
Dang, we all got it wrong.

540
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:23,510
Here.

541
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,790
Apologize to Auntie Gui Xiao.

542
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,310
Auntie, I was wrong.

543
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:28,880
It's okay.

544
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,250
Don't stand around. Sit down.

545
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,610
Sit.

546
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,370
Captain Lu, please have a seat.

547
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,320
I don’t know much

548
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,100
about the restaurants here.

549
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,830
I picked this place based on its reviews.

550
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,260
As to the dishes,

551
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,760
I'll ask the waiter to serve the signature dishes.

552
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,489
Is that okay?

553
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,690
Captain Lu, is there anything you don't eat?

554
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,690
He eats anything.

555
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:56,270
No.

556
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,730
Okay.

557
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,200
Please enjoy.

558
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,010
Captain Lu,

559
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,700
were you neighbors

560
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,940
or schoolmates

561
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,570
with Gui Xiao?

562
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,600
Schoolmates.

563
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,180
We're not close.

564
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,940
Qining's snow is so heavy.

565
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,010
Captain Lu

566
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,270
is not good at talking.

567
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,130
We've sat here for a while now

568
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,150
but he hasn't talked much.

569
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,150
But Captain Lu

570
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,070
is someone who's cold on the outside but warm on the inside.

571
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,310
He must treat you

572
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:40,960
as friends,

573
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,160
that's why he's here.

574
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,270
Right, Captain Lu?

575
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,090
Schoolmates right? Chat a little.

576
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,010
Have a drink.

577
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,920
- Drink your own.
- Captain Lu has to drive.

578
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,510
Exactly, dad.

579
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,920
Eat your food.

580
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,060
I was thinking

581
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,060
Captain Lu's going to Beijing soon.

582
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,630
Please take care of him.

583
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,840
If you can't say it yourself,

584
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,970
I'll say it instead.

585
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:27,830
Here.

586
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,090
You have to drive later.

587
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,200
Let's drink tea instead of wine.

588
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,740
I will drink a toast to everyone.

589
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,010
When you come to Qining in the future,

590
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,260
if you have any problems,

591
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,700
just let me know, okay?

592
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:41,990
I hope

593
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,520
you can take care of Captain Lu

594
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,720
in Beijing for me too.

595
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,450
Of course.

596
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,610
We have to repay more than what we received.

597
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,360
Let alone Captain Lu has

598
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,330
helped us a lot.

599
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,470
We will help you in any way possible

600
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,270
in the future.

601
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,080
Of course we'll help.

602
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,040
As long as Captain Lu asks, I'll be there at any time.

603
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,240
Thank you, everyone.

604
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,330
By the way, the four of you

605
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,860
came here in one car, right?

606
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,230
Yes.

607
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,830
Captain Lu, send them.

608
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,610
Four people in a car

609
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,560
is too crowded. It's not safe.

610
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,820
Is it too troublesome?

611
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,580
No, auntie.

612
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,120
We live in the west.

613
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,530
And you live in the east.

614
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,270
Although it's not very convenient,

615
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,510
it shows

616
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,590
our sincerity by sending the guests off.

617
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,790
Captain Lu and I

618
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,480
shall go get our cars from the parking lot.

619
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
You guys wait here.

620
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:38,810
Okay.

621
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,350
Come with me.

622
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,160
Otherwise, I'll be frozen

623
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,240
to death by how cold he is.

624
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,500
I'll wait for you here.

625
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,730
No, it's cold outside.

626
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,990
Come with me. Let's go.

627
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,740
Captain Lu.

628
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,290
My car is over there.

629
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,340
What about you?

630
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,430
Over there.

631
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:09,740
It's not far.

632
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,590
Don't come out.

633
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,770
Lu Chen!

634
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,420
Gui Xiao.

635
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,390
Are you okay?

636
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,920
I was shoved a few times.

637
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,050
What are they doing?

638
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,410
Watch out, Lu!

639
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,820
Dad.

640
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,380
I already called the police

641
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,660
with his phone.

642
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,270
Well done!

643
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,210
Are you scared?

644
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:28,240
No.

645
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,870
What is there to be scared of?

646
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,130
I covered you with my clothes

647
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,680
because I didn't want to scare you.

648
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,740
I didn't expect you

649
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,980
to not take the hint at all

650
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,980
and pulled it off,

651
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,630
watching it all the way.

652
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,470
Here.

653
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:54,970
Is there snow?

654
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,040
No.

655
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:26,670
Captain Lu.

656
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,320
We meet again.

657
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,260
I'll leave them to you.

658
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,620
They're car thieves.

659
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,310
Okay.

660
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,000
Thank you.

661
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,100
I've got them to speak up.

662
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,690
They are friends

663
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,840
of the group of people who stole the cars.

664
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,500
They happen to be eating here.

665
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,400
They recognized the car at first sight.

666
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,360
So they wanted to avenge

667
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,930
for their friends.

668
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,430
But they didn't expect it's us who they'd face.

669
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,060
Chief Liu,

670
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,260
we captured

671
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,490
13 people for you,

672
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,000
you should treat Captain Lu and me

673
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
to a big meal.

674
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:51,770
Of course.

675
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,560
Eat all you want at the police cafeteria.

676
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,000
Your car

677
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,400
should be commended

678
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,360
for saving our police force.

679
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,570
It also saved resources

680
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,600
for the country.

681
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,890
Sorry for the trouble.

682
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,410
Not at all. I'm happy.

683
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,460
A kid reported the case just now.

684
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,140
Who was it?

685
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:12,590
Me.

686
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,590
My son.

687
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,240
As usual.

688
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:17,930
As usual.

689
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,630
We'll go back and make a statement with you.

690
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,070
You drive Cai Yaya's car

691
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,340
and send those two men back.

692
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,820
I'll drive them home.

693
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:32,780
Okay.

694
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,380
I'll go with Uncle Lu.

695
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,320
Now you know it's Uncle Lu?

696
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,410
[Establish a positive image for public security]

697
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,390
I don't mind

698
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,280
if you want me to call you dad.

699
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,660
W-why?

700
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,230
Can't I have two dads?

701
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,730
Thank you, Captain Qin.

702
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,850
Let's go.

703
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,290
Auntie, don't be angry.

704
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,370
Uncle Lu has a cold face.

705
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,290
He treats everyone the same.

706
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,310
I'm not angry.

707
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,370
I'm used to it.
