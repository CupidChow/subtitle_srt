[Episode 13]

4
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:39,780
Wait.

5
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,430
I'll ask someone to get you a ladder.

6
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,530
Don't take off your EOD suit now.

7
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,320
If the explosive's TNT equivalent is,

8
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,600
as the criminal said,

9
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,160
enough to destroy a building,

10
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,460
it's useless to wear a suit.

11
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,500
Time waits for no one.

12
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,539
Also, if I wear the EOD suit,

13
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,740
I can't get in either.

14
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,380
At least let the robot try.

15
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,830
Given the width,

16
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,110
a reconnaissance robot might work,

17
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,290
but an EOD robot is really useless.

18
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,090
Stop nagging.

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,530
Wait for my news.

20
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,180
Hasn't he answered?

21
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:36,930
No.

22
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,090
He refused to tell us

23
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,150
the time he had set for the explosion.

24
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,130
Is Lu Yanchen disposing of the bomb?

25
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,510
The bomb is located downtown.

26
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,579
Although everyone in the mall

27
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,260
has been evacuated,

28
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,760
there is a hospital nearby.

29
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,290
The patients can't be evacuated.

30
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,040
Captain Lu didn't agree to set off the bomb.

31
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,170
He went to dismantle the bomb himself.

32
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,240
We must find out

33
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,860
the estimated time of the explosion

34
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,460
and how to detonate the bomb.

35
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,579
Bring all of his accomplices for interrogation

36
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,910
to find a breakthrough.

37
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,000
Only I know the time of the explosion.

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,180
It's no use asking.

39
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,160
Just wait for it to explode.

40
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,170
He's on a mission?

41
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,060
With a boyfriend in this industry,

42
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,260
you must take it easy.

43
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,800
Half of him

44
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,400
belongs to the country.

45
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,870
While the other

46
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,630
belongs to the family.

47
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,900
I'm hanging up. I have a stomach ache.

48
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,890
Relax and rest well.

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,890
Bye.

50
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,180
An anti-handling device.

51
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,830
It can't be moved

52
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,560
or shaken.

53
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,170
There's also a timer.

54
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,140
The explosive is in a large amount.

55
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,560
How is it going at the scene?

56
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,960
He's still working on it.

57
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:53,920
Look at his movements.

58
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,100
It must have come near to

59
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,300
the time to detonate.

60
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,400
Inform Lu Yanchen.

61
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,510
We think

62
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,190
it's almost time to detonate.

63
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,300
If he can't

64
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,780
remove the explosive device,

65
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,840
at the last moment,

66
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,090
I hope he holds it accountable

67
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,420
for his own life.

68
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,640
Okay.

69
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,890
Here's an order from your leader.

70
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,950
Protect yourself.

71
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,500
Got it.

72
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,900
I can't leave.

73
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,540
The patients in ICU

74
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,800
in the nearby hospital

75
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,990
need electricity for life support.

76
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,900
Can they leave?

77
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,930
The information from the interrogation room tells us that

78
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,730
the bomb is very likely to go off.

79
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,200
There're so many ways to detonate it.

80
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,220
When the criminal was setting it up,

81
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,060
he might trigger the bomb

82
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,790
by accident.

83
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,180
There must be a correct wire for defusing the bomb.

84
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,909
I can find it.

85
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,250
It's okay.

86
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,360
I'll be fine after taking the medicine.

87
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,060
I think it's almost the time

88
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,060
to detonate.

89
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,300
Lu Yanchen hasn't come out yet?

90
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,910
No.

91
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,210
Lu Yanchen.

92
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,700
Lu Yanchen.

93
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,060
Time is almost up. Let's go.

94
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,860
I can't leave.

95
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,670
When I'm here,

96
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,390
there's still hope.

97
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,150
I found it.

98
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,360
I'm going to cut the wire.

99
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,600
Done.

100
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,360
Qin Mingyu.

101
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,350
Drive the car here.

102
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,120
I'll take the bomb out.

103
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,320
Get some men

104
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,700
to dig a deep pit three kilometres outside the city

105
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,820
and prepare for the detonation.

106
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,140
Yes.

107
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,440
Eh. Why hasn't it exploded yet?

108
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,940
What's going on?

109
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,130
We have plenty of time

110
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,320
to wait for your full confession.

111
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,440
This bomb is too powerful.

112
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,260
We must stop the damage

113
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,590
by burying it deep down.

114
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,110
I've asked some men to dig the pit.

115
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,240
I'll be right there.

116
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,500
Are you taking my credit?

117
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:50,930
I'm also a captain.

118
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,250
My rank is not inferior to yours.

119
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,050
You're right.

120
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,900
There may be some fingerprints and clues

121
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,780
remaining

122
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,120
on the outer shell I removed just now.

123
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,220
Pass it to our colleagues in the station.

124
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,220
Did he make such a sophisticated bomb

125
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,220
by himself?

126
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,380
I don't believe it.

127
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,020
We need to figure it out.

128
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,580
I wanted you to observe the scene

129
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,380
so that you could get over your problem.

130
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,440
But I didn't expect

131
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,410
you would risk your life.

132
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,600
It's destined.

133
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,900
I'll write the report when I come back tomorrow.

134
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,380
See you.

135
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,590
Go ahead.

136
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,760
Captain Lu.

137
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
You should go back quickly.

138
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,380
Your girlfriend looked quite unwell.

139
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,580
What did you tell her?

140
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,070
I couldn't reveal too much to her.

141
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,000
It's all confidential.

142
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,130
I just told her to take care of herself.

143
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,900
I shouldn't have let you go.

144
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:49,780
Hello.

145
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,850
Could you please tell me where I can find a pharmacy

146
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,180
to buy fever medication

147
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,250
and a thermometer?

148
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,270
Go out and turn right.

149
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,390
Then, go north at the first junction

150
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,480
and you'll see a pharmacy.

151
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,080
Thank you.

♫A bowl of nothingness, heart full of hope♫

203
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,000
It was located downtown.

204
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,990
The bomb was tricky to deal with.

205
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,000
I had to go.

206
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,840
I didn't expect this before I left.

207
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,340
I know.

208
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,860
I... I understand.

209
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,900
I just worried about you all night.

210
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,810
I know this is your job.

211
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,220
Maybe this is the first time

212
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,180
and I don't have any experience.

213
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,250
Come here.

214
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,180
Before I went to dismantle the bomb, they asked for my last words.

215
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,420
I didn't mention you.

216
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,630
Do you know why?

217
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,980
I was afraid you wouldn't be able to forget me

218
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,180
if I mentioned you.

219
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,390
Then not only you wouldn't get married,

220
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,590
but you would also come to Qining

221
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,220
to visit my grave every year.

222
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,260
We haven't got married yet.

223
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,390
But you'd act like the wife of a martyr.

224
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,460
I believe you'd do that.

225
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,690
Just one thing.

226
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,970
Lu Chen, listen carefully.

227
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,500
Let's get married as soon as we get back.

228
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,330
Right away.

229
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,550
Last night,

230
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:12,740
I had been dreaming of

231
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,060
our childhood.

232
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,430
I woke up several times

233
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,120
but I couldn't see you.

234
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,000
Then I thought that

235
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,520
if you

236
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,960
perished in this mission,

237
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
I would live my whole life in regret.

238
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,340
I know.

239
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,070
My dad had discredited you before.

240
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,300
I know

241
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,800
your family doesn't like me

242
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,400
because of the engagement cancellation.

243
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,040
It's okay.

244
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,090
I don't want to worry about that anymore.

245
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,050
Things will work out in the end.

246
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,980
We've been apart for more than ten years.

247
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,200
Before I met you again,

248
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,200
I hadn't thought of getting married at all.

249
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,050
Now that we have a chance to be together...

250
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,120
Let's get married.

251
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,040
Do you have to consider it for so long?

252
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:18,980
Are you still concerned about

253
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,620
my dad's attitude?

254
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,220
And my family's attitude?

255
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,580
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

256
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,850
Gui Xiao.

257
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,020
If I didn't

258
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,100
leave you a message

259
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,990
before I passed away,

260
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,170
would you be scared?

261
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,070
Yes.

262
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,820
At least, you should give me

263
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,750
the title of the family of martyrs.

264
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,070
In that way, I can make funeral arrangements for you.

265
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,600
[SWAT Detachment of Qining City Public Security Bureau]

266
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,600
[Qining City Public Security Bureau, People's Police Training Base]

267
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,510
You're usually silver-tongued.

268
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,020
At this critical moment,

269
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,950
how could you backstab Captain Lu?

270
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,190
If his girlfriend was scared to death,

271
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,790
could you make good the loss?

272
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,340
I can't say anything substantial.

273
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,300
What would you say if it were you?

274
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,040
You have no idea too.

275
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:35,820
I seldom

276
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,160
interact with girls.

277
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,860
Your son is already in primary school.

278
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,390
Yet you're still so modest.

279
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,960
You don't understand women.

280
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,360
It's from Beijing?

281
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,010
Probably my son.

282
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,760
I need to answer the phone.

283
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,940
How lucky you are.

284
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,460
Your father is off today.

285
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,350
What are you doing? Say something.

286
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,550
Hello, Captain Qin.

287
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,720
I'm Duan Rou.

288
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,150
What's wrong, Captain Qin?

289
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,750
A mission?

290
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,080
Go.

291
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,540
Go for your meal. Quick.

292
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,060
Go for your meal.

293
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,700
Hello, I'm Qin Mingyu.

294
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,890
I know you're Qin Mingyu,

295
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,520
the captain of the Qining SWAT Brigade.

296
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:27,930
Yes.

297
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,220
Your son is seeing a doctor.

298
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:30,860
The doctor asked

299
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,520
if he had any allergy history.

300
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,530
I don't think so.

301
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,100
What do you mean by that?

302
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,260
I think he doesn't have any allergies.

303
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,860
What do you mean by you think?

304
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:44,620
It's just that

305
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,190
I really don't know.

306
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,380
Duan...

307
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,280
Rou.

308
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:48,790
Rou.

309
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,780
How about I talk to the doctor?

310
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,390
I'll tell him you are unsure and ask the doctor for some advice.

311
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,120
Do you agree?

312
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:56,880
I agree.

313
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,470
Also,

314
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,700
Xiaonan has lived with you all these years.

315
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,410
His diet was too monotonous.

316
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
There are only a few dishes he likes.

317
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,660
It's not that he is picky,

318
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,250
but he's too sensible and doesn't want to ask for anything.

319
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,210
He's a boy.

320
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,030
There's no need for that.

321
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,030
Please be serious, Captain Qin.

322
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,500
The child's nutrition

323
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
is related to his physical strength

324
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,960
and learning efficiency.

325
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,780
You're right, Miss Duan Rou.

326
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,670
Just call me Duan Rou.

327
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,600
No need to regard me as an outsider.

328
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,200
Duan...

329
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,160
Please hold for a moment.

330
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,780
What are you doing?

331
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,570
Do you know privacy? Get lost!

332
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,070
Duan Rou.

333
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:41,940
Here's the thing.

334
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,180
I have no experience

335
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,240
in raising a child.

336
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,390
I didn't mean to refute you.

337
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:48,850
That's it.

338
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,300
I'll listen to you.

339
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,750
I'll pay for your idea.

340
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,730
I asked you to not regard me as an outsider,

341
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,600
and now you are really treating me as your acquaintance?

342
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,910
I'm not a good speaker.

343
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,300
But my salary and benefits

344
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,010
are good.

345
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,640
You may buy whatever you want.

346
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,860
No, I mean...

347
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,090
Just tell me

348
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,600
what the kid needs to buy.

349
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,280
Got it, Captain Qin.

350
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,680
I'm going to see the doctor first.

351
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,410
Don't worry.

352
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,610
Your son, staying with me,

353
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,730
is well taken care of.

354
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,530
Thank you.

355
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,010
Bye.

356
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,920
Duan Rou.

357
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:38,220
Dad.

358
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,650
Aunt Duan Rou is so nice.

359
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,520
Captain Qin.

360
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:55,620
Captain Qin.

361
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,780
They asked who was going to write the report for yesterday's case.

362
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,010
Should I call Captain Lu to come over here?

363
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,010
Didn't you take a lesson last night?

364
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,110
He just came back from the brink of death.

365
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,930
And he's now with his girlfriend.

366
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:07,920
Yet you want to call him over now.

367
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,050
What's on your mind?

368
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,430
If so, who will write the report?

369
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,390
Who else?

370
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,450
Me.

371
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,370
Captain Qin.

372
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,870
You can't write it, can you?

373
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,290
After all, you didn't dismantle the bomb by yourself.

374
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,000
This time,

375
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,060
Captain Lu should be able to get over his grief.

376
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,600
The old captain's death

377
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,570
was not his fault at all.

378
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,820
Every time I think about this,

379
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,780
I feel sad for him.

380
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,410
The leaders did stop him back then.

381
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,410
But he insisted on taking the blame.

382
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,870
You don't understand.

383
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,440
This is Lu Yanchen.

384
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,440
Did you really cry?

385
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,220
Are you upset?

386
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,820
I just recovered from a serious illness, do you know that?

387
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,360
No, I don't.

388
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,000
Who served you all day?

389
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,220
I haven't had a sleep yet.

390
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,910
You only fed me medicine.

391
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,450
Not only that.

392
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,300
What else?

393
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,590
I helped you with the sweating.

394
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,850
I also wiped your body.

395
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,440
So, as we said before,

396
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,840
marry me, deal?

397
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,070
I don't care.

398
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,240
I'm going to tell my mum now

399
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,540
about me getting married.

400
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,540
Tell your mum too.

401
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,720
I'll supervise you texting the message.

402
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,580
Do you want to supervise

403
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,710
me writing the wedding report as well?

404
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,100
My mum has replied.

405
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,630
She said she would bless us.

406
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:14,660
Hurry up.

407
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,330
I'll warm up a towel for you to wipe your face.

408
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,180
Seriously.

409
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,360
You've been lazy since you were young.

410
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,380
Lie down for a while.

411
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,460
Xu Yao?

412
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,060
Did anything happen?

413
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,940
It's okay. I'll call you when I get back.

414
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,310
Are you jealous?

415
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,220
You are not allowed to do so.

416
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,880
What are you doing?

417
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:31,910
Calm down.

418
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,460
It's in broad daylight.

419
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,390
I've been taking care of you all-day

420
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,920
and haven't taken a shower.

421
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,720
Give me 20 minutes.

422
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,000
We'll go out later.

423
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,020
Lu Chen.

424
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:02,810
Why did you

425
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,350
leave Qining back then?

426
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,020
I mean,

427
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,380
did something happen

428
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,500
at work

429
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,310
that made you leave?

430
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,790
Is it hard to say?

431
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,880
Let me think about it.

432
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,660
I'll think about how to explain it to you.

433
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,310
Forget it. I don't want to know.

434
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,980
The first two years I came to Qining,

435
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,390
I had three choices.

436
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,180
There were two leaders

437
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,240
who came from here.

438
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:47,930
When recruiting,

439
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,500
the old captain

440
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,030
talked to me for a few hours.

441
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,120
He knew I lived in Beijing,

442
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,450
far away from Qining.

443
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,600
So he was afraid that I would not come.

444
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,300
He was not

445
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,300
good at speaking.

446
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,060
He just looked at me.

447
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,030
The desire for a good helper in his eyes

448
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:14,670
made me choose Qining.

449
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,780
Among the two leaders who came that day,

450
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:32,190
one died because he covered for his colleague

451
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,620
in the later operation,

452
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,940
the other was my old captain.

453
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
That day when we visited the graves,

454
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,190
you saw him.

455
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,820
The last time you came to Qining,

456
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,429
he had perished not long ago.

457
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,110
When you called me,

458
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,980
I was going to his house

459
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,770
to visit his father.

460
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
I should have been the one to perish.

461
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,540
Among the local organized criminal gangs,

462
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,330
I had caught a few recidivists several times.

463
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,730
The old captain's death

464
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,400
was caused by these people.

465
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,920
So I always thought that

466
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,520
I dragged him down.

467
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:28,760
Later,

468
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,650
I submitted my resignation letter.

469
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,430
What else do you want to ask?

470
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,350
That's all.

471
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,140
You rarely talk so much.

472
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,420
The team wants to meet you.

473
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,310
Meet me?

474
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,430
Since we're getting married soon,

475
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,160
they want to see my future wife.

476
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,540
After we leave this time,

477
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,660
I don't think there will be any chance

478
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,070
for them to meet you again.

479
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,630
But we've met before.

480
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,300
Last time, when we were at that small restaurant.

481
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,160
You were so aggressive that time.

482
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,050
Didn't you notice that they were so afraid of you

483
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,610
that they didn't dare to come close

484
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,740
and say hello to you?

485
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,470
Who was aggressive?

486
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,740
You yelled at me

487
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,560
so I treated you the same way.

488
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,620
Are you going or not?

489
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,490
I want to wear a dress.

490
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,480
Do you know

491
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,410
what Qining's temperature is now?

492
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,890
I look good in a dress.

493
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,000
Wear it if you're not afraid of the cold.

494
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,590
Can't we drive in?

495
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,030
Grab a bite first.

496
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,490
I guess

497
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,500
they won't let me go later.

498
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,500
Do I need some?

499
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:16,660
A little.

507
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,570
thank you and your colleagues

508
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,970

513
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:15,920
Congratulations.

522
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,070
they were joking with me.

I prepared something new.

538
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,020
Sparkling water.

539
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,270
With all flavour.

Captain Lu was no longer in our team.

00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,450
5,000 meters? How can you make it?

568
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,070
It's windy outside

569
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,070
and it's getting dark soon.

570
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,900
Also, I'm wearing a skirt.

571
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,960
How can he carry me?

572
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,790
Does he have to carry me?

573
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,710
Cooperate with me.

574
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,780
How generous.

575
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,570
This is my sister-in-law.

576
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,100
Let's go.

577
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,350
Take it.

578
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,100
Lean on me comfortably later.

579
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,190
Five kilometres will take at least half an hour.

580
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,420
If you don't feel well later,

581
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,050
just tell me.

582
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,180
I'll change my pose.

583
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:45,330
How?

584
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,180
I'll do whatever you say.

585
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,100
Hold me tight.

586
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,230
Who is it?

587
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,370
Captain Lu, our former captain,

588
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,520
brought his wife back to see his brothers.

589
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,050
Then he was taught a lesson.

590
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,340
Captain Lu runs fast.

591
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,690
How heavy are you now?

592
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:16,420
Less than 90.

593
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,900
You are underweight. Eat more.

594
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,460
Go, Captain Lu!

595
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,100
If you cook well,

596
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,940
I'll eat more.

597
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,020
Good job, Captain Lu.

598
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,810
Come on, Captain Lu.

599
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,110
Go! Go! Captain Lu!

600
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,420
Can't you slow down a bit?

601
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,470
They didn't set you a speed limit.

602
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,700
Twenty minutes to

603
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,500
finish a five-kilometre run with a load

604
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,960
is the basic requirement.

605
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,940
As the former captain,

606
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:41,720
I can't disappoint.
