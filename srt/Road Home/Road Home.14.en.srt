00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,660
[Episode 14]

4
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:39,930
How heavy are you now?

5
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,870
Less than 90 jin.

6
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,789
That's too light. You should eat more.

7
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,710
If you cook well,

8
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,570
I will eat more.

9
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,190
Go, Captain Lu!

10
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,860
Go, Captain Lu! Come on!

11
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,020
Captain Lu has such great physical strength.

12
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,100
Yes, he is running while carrying someone on his back.

13
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,880
Such great stamina.

14
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,810
Go, Captain Lu!

15
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,580
Come on, Captain Lu! Come on!

16
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,759
Can't you slow down?

17
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,680
I didn't set a speed limit.

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,270
The most basic requirement is to

19
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,090
finish running 5 kilometers with weights

20
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,150
within 20 minutes.

21
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,590
As the former captain,

22
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,700
I can't lose face.

23
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,440
How much load were you guys carrying in the past?

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,240
20 kilograms.

25
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,950
You weigh about 45 kilograms now,

26
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,390
so the difficulty has been doubled.

27
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,730
20 minutes is a bit difficult.

28
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,530
I will take at least half an hour.

29
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,870
Let's not talk anymore to preserve my energy.

30
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,770
She just arrived here,

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,690
and you guys are already badgering her.

32
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,579
Aren't you afraid that she will get angry

33
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,530
and run away?

34
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,350
Sir,

35
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,430
don't worry.

36
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,720
We have discussed it

37
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,060
and have prepared two options.

38
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,700
If Captain Lu's girlfriend

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,740
is the serious type

40
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,940
and doesn't like to joke around,

41
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,940
everyone will just tease them

42
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,400
in the canteen for awhile.

43
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,079
If she is open-minded

44
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,590
and can get along with everyone else,

45
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,390
we will badger them till the end.

46
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,970
Little brat,

47
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,690
you guys are even playing it by ear.

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,180
Well,

49
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,240
I am just making up in advance for when

50
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,120
I don't get to disturb them on their wedding night.

51
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,790
I don't need it. You wipe instead.

52
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,880
Let's carry on.

53
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,340
Lu Yanchen,

54
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,329
why do you always have the attitude

55
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:29,340
where you look like you can handle anything?

56
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,380
It makes me

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,700
lose face as the new captain.

58
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,710
I was going to let you off easy for a bit,

59
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,710
but now I can't.

60
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,470
You are just getting back at

61
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,980
how badly I scolded you in the past, right?

62
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,480
I am not that petty.

63
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,660
I can do weighted pull-ups,

64
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,310
but she's wearing a skirt today.

65
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,110
How can I do it?

66
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,430
I didn't notice that.

67
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,120
How about

68
00:03:58,329 --> 00:03:59,700
we do it without weights?

69
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,270
I agree.

70
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,860
It's has been tough on Xiao.

71
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,710
She even took off her padded jacket in this cold weather.

72
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,740
What are you talking about?

73
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,820
Are you saying that only you guys are being considerate to Xiao,

74
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,350
while we don't feel sorry for her?

75
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,320
Xiao, I agree.

76
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,280
Let's go without weights.

77
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,140
Please don't mind us.

78
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,580
We don’t mean to make things difficult for you.

79
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,399
We just wanted to see how Captain Lu

80
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,130
cuddle up with his girlfriend,

81
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,350
because we have never seen it before.

82
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,490
We are just playing around.

83
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,570
It doesn't matter if it is weighted or not,

84
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:26,970
right?

85
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,300
Yes.

86
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,820
The person we want to torture is Captain Lu,

87
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,660
which has nothing to do with Xiao.

88
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,170
We also can't torture Captain Lu.

89
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,300
How can the newlywed

90
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,140
waste his energy

91
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,200
on these things?

92
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,950
What are you talking about?

93
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,330
To my sister-in-law!

94
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,210
Come on!

95
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,920
Welcome Xiao to Qining again.

96
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,270
Thank you.

97
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,010
Cheers!

98
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,200
It's almost 2 o'clock.

99
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,660
The place you guys are staying at

100
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,660
is still quite a distance from here.

101
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,510
Gao Hai.

102
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:10,940
Captain Qin.

103
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,620
Make some arrangements.

104
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,940
I will bring Captain Lu and Xiao

105
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,000
over to stay later.

106
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,620
Got it.

107
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,580
Where are we staying?

108
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,060
There is an apartment building

109
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,030
outside our brigade.

110
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,380
It was originally a factory dormitory.

111
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,100
The landlord

112
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,820
really likes all of us from the SWAT team,

113
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,580
who happened to all be bachelors.

114
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,610
So he rented the whole building

115
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,210
to us at a really cheap price.

116
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,670
We would go to work together

117
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,860
and return from work together.

118
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,990
Captain Lu's room is still available.

119
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,090
You can can go over tonight

120
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,100
and it will be livelier for us to stay together,

121
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,500
right?

122
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,340
Yes, it's lively.

123
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,670
Yeah, it will be lively!

124
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,250
These are all newly bought, yeah?

125
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:46,920
Rest early.

126
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,320
Okay.

127
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,420
When I used to live here alone,

128
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,070
I did not realise that

129
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,940
this apartment is actually one living room and one bedroom.

130
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,140
I am not doing too bad.

131
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,300
You don't need to try and prove

132
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,960
you never brought a girl here.

133
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,060
I want to go to the toilet.

134
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,170
Where is the ladies' toilet?

135
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,710
There are only the men's toilets here.

136
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,300
All of them staying here

137
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,430
are male colleagues from the brigade.

138
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,900
So all the toilets were changed exclusively to men's.

139
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
What should we do?

140
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,390
I'll keep watch for you.

141
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,380
I'll go in and take a look.

142
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,260
Don’t look at Lu Yanchen

143
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,770
looking all impressive in normal times.

144
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,550
In the end,

145
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,510
he is just an unmarried male in his older youth.

146
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,840
His skin is really thin.

147
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,170
Someone

148
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,080
failed in a particular aspect,

149
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,750
yet he dares to make fun of

150
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,210
the one who is about to win.

151
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,790
It's so awkward to go out now.

152
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,670
But if I don't go out,

153
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,330
do I want to wait for people to walk in instead?

154
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,880
Captain Lu.

155
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,400
Where are you going?

156
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,750
I am going to the toilet.

157
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,810
Go back to your room

158
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,150
and do 200 push-ups.

159
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,030
Yes, Sir.

160
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,140
He just wanted to use the bathroom.

161
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,900
You asked him to do push-ups instead.

162
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,900
That's inhumane.

163
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,450
He is not even awake yet.

164
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,710
He didn't realize that

165
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,380
I am not his captain anymore.

166
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,549
You are so mean.

167
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,179
Who are you calling mean?

168
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:40,630
You...

169
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,100
Why are you looking at me?

170
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,240
I've never seen you brush your teeth.

171
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,460
When we were living in the tent,

172
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,170
you always ran out

173
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,670
and didn't let me see it.

174
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,030
What's there to see when I am brushing teeth?

175
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,860
Are you not brushing?

176
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,980
I need to maintain a sense of mystery

177
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,630
to keep our love fresh.

178
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,730
What nonsense.

179
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,380
What are you doing?

180
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,540
Sleep.

181
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,060
That's not right.

182
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,710
We are not married yet.

183
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,410
Didn't you say you wanted to marry me?

184
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,350
Who's there?

185
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,190
It's me.

186
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,520
I came to see you.

187
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,820
What a coincidence.

188
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,450
Who is it?

189
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,520
Our former leader.

190
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,620
Commissioner Du.

191
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,360
Is it a convenient time?

192
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,810
Yes.

193
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,030
What can I do for you?

194
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,850
Don't worry. There's no mission.

195
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,970
I am here to see

196
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,610
the girlfriend of Qining's great hero.

197
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,090
Gui Xiao,

198
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,020
I am sorry for

199
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,280
disturbing your rest.

200
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,250
No, you didn't.

201
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:25,750
Hello.

202
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,140
Lu rarely comes back.

203
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,490
But this time,

204
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,100
he walked through the gates of hell

205
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,770
yet again.

206
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,440
I felt really sorry

207
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,980
from the bottom of my heart,

208
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,540
so I came to console his family.

209
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,200
I am not yet his family member.

210
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,400
It's just a matter of time,

211
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,590
unless you dump him.

212
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,100
Otherwise, I think

213
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,660
he is not capable

214
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,010
of breaking up with you.

215
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:48,880
Right?

216
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,620
Yes.

217
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,820
I dare not.

218
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:51,920
Sir,

219
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,420
I have something

220
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,460
to report to you.

221
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,150
I am getting married.

222
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,140
That's great.

223
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,300
After you get married,

224
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,250
you must be nice to her.

225
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,180
Within our team, some of us were dumped,

226
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,500
but none of us

227
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,230
fooled around with the ladies.

228
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:11,920
Gui Xiao,

229
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,880
I always believed that

230
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,630
no one can be truly loyal

231
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,950
in life.

232
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,780
So how can we believe that

233
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,060
he is loyal to the SWAT team,

234
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,720
and the people of the country?

235
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,190
Right?

236
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,400
I didn't disturb

237
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,800
when the younger ones were messing with you just now.

238
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,520
Lu has never left Qining,

239
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,080
since he was assigned here.

240
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,320
Everyone in the force

241
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,870
sings their praises of him.

242
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:42,900
By the way,

243
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,320
he was the best student

244
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,740
among everyone

245
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,440
who was assigned here.

246
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,510
Many units wanted him,

247
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,150
but I managed to snatch him,

248
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,710
and now you got him.

249
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,800
Lu Yanchen,

250
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,140
although you don't need to make a formal report

251
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,660
to the force now

252
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,320
when you are getting married,

253
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,020
and I am no longer

254
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,700
your direct supervisor,

255
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,330
but

256
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,980
I am very happy

257
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,710
you chose to tell me personally

258
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,850
that you are getting married today.

259
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,420
I am happy for both of you.

260
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,420
I am starting to feel that

261
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,500
I abducted a good leader.

262
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,090
Your superior, colleagues and brothers

263
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,630
are all reluctant to see you go.

264
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,310
Is something bothering you?

265
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,050
Are you sad to leave this behind?

266
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,260
From what I know about Commissioner Du,

267
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
he must have left something unsaid.

268
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,130
About what?

269
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,360
The job transfer or a mission?

270
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,770
He will tell me

271
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,180
when he wants to.

272
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,830
Are you cold?

273
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,860
No I am not.

274
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,520
But I am.

275
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,860
Why are you here running rounds early in the morning

276
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,590
instead of accompanying Xiao?

277
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,340
She's still asleep.

278
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,180
How about a race?

279
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:09,840
Come on.

280
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:09,990
Captain Lu.

281
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,340
200 push-ups isn't enough for you,

282
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,150
is that right?

283
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,830
Show me the new police dogs that you have been training

284
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,910
when you have time.

285
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,080
No problem.

286
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,950
I am done with you.

287
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,540
How about one more round at the shooting range?

288
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,250
Next time.

289
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,000
She should be awake by now.

290
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,970
I want to sleep some more.

291
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,160
Captain Lu,

292
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,390
aren’t we going to see the dogs?

293
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,420
They will leave soon.

294
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,310
Sir!

295
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,840
Okay, I got it.

296
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,180
If we didn't break up then,

297
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,880
I am guessing that you will

298
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,860
stay over a couple of days every year.

299
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,340
That's not enough.

300
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,150
Maybe I will

301
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,300
stay for more than ten days every year.

302
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,930
Alright,

303
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,030
they are going to shout again in just a moment.

304
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,890
Let them shout.

305
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,410
If they keep shouting

306
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,670
and you don't respond,

307
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,820
they will be imagining things.

308
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,700
You are already staying in my room.

309
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:35,740
Whatever they are going to imagine

310
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,540
is completely understandable.

311
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,480
I really regret it now.

312
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,360
Regret what?

313
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,700
I regret that one year outside the conference hall,

314
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,760
I shouldn't have left straightaway.

315
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,940
Before I was at the gas station,

316
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,670
I was outside a conference hall

317
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,580
checking on suspected explosives.

318
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,840
That was when I saw you.

319
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,210
You were the one who blew it up then?

320
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,060
And then?

321
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,280
Nothing.

322
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,800
The danger was cleared so I came back to the base.

323
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,820
That's all?

324
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,130
Such an important event

325
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,650
and you put it across in two to three sentences.

326
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,130
It was just my day-to-day work,

327
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,260
what's there to say?

328
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,070
Let me tell you,

329
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,700
that dog of mine

330
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,100
is obsessed with love songs recently.

331
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,060
He becomes obedient immediately upon hearing it.

332
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,700
So cute.

333
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,670
Aren’t you looking for me?

334
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,720
Captain Lu.

335
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,580
Let's go see the dogs.

336
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,540
Yes yes, let's go see the dogs.

337
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,770
Those dogs missed you so much.

338
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,230
I will bring them over now.

339
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:20,970
Lu Chen.

340
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,480
Wait in the room.

341
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,200
I will buy you breakfast.

342
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,100
Why don't I just go with you?

343
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,800
Are you going?

344
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,960
I will wait for you to be back.

345
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,350
Captain Lu!

346
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,730
I heard your girlfriend came.

347
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,020
What flavor does

348
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,280
your girlfriend like?

349
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,080
Meat buns.

350
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,440
That's a pragmatic person.

351
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,590
Okay, meat buns.

352
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
I'll give you two.

353
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,150
It has to be fate, Xiao.

354
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
You and Captain Lu

355
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,710
are really meant to be.

356
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,740
They say that if two people can be together,

357
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,670
there must be some fate to prove it.

358
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,230
This has to be it.

359
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:31,910
Yes.

360
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,980
When we came back from a mission one time,

361
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,860
Captain Lu sat on the playground

362
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,690
and played the harmonica for all of us.

363
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,860
The melody from the harmonica

364
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,010
made a lot of us cry.

365
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,860
That was the only time

366
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,090
I heard Captain Lu play the harmonica.

367
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,010
That was the time when I just joined

368
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,470
and I didn't know him well.

369
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,870
I thought our Captain Lu

370
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
is such a tender person despite his tough exterior,

371
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,700
and he must be missing his girlfriend.

372
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,620
Then I found out

373
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,180
he was single just like me.

374
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,770
So I thought

375
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,220
our Captain Lu

376
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,020
must have been too busy with work,

377
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,020
so he hasn't got a chance

378
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,570
to meet outstanding single women as well.

379
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,030

why did the two of you broke up in the first place?

Because...

394
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,660
Because we were young

395
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,300

566
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,900
Some people from the civil explosives company are coming over.

567
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,870
They heard that you are in Qining

568
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,670
and said that they must meet you.

569
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:14,790
Let's go.

570
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,520
Come in.

571
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,020
Let me introduce.

572
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,500
That's Lu Yanchen,

573
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,360
our Captain Lu.

574
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,470
This is Mr. Shen.

575
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,240
Captain Lu,

576
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,670
nice to meet you.

577
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,220
I’ve heard a lot about you.

578
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:41,950
Mr. Shen,

579
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,200
you are the senior.

580
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,530
I should be saying that.

581
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,390
You are a formidable young man.

582
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,090
Do you happen to be

583
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:48,950
on leave today?

584
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,890
Actually, I’ve been transferred to Tianwen.

585
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,060
I am taking my annual leave this time as

586
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,580
I have something to do.

587
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,150
Sure.

588
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:55,930
Some time ago,

589
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,290
we also went to Beijing.

590
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,460
Sit down.

591
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:58,940
Come on.

592
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,300
Have a seat.

593
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:07,630
Captain Lu,

594
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,420
I purposely

595
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,780
brought my disciples

596
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,810
to learn from your experience

597
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,100
today.

598
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,520
Let's begin.

599
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,370
Recently,

600
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,820
we have been studying

601
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,100
the bombs and mines

602
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,750
left behind from the war.

603
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,340
They say Captain Lu is good at

604
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,660
handling this aspect of explosives.

605
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,230
So,

606
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,740
I specially brought these experts

607
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,790
and my disciples

608
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,710
to learn from your experience.

609
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,900
Indeed, some of these bombs

610
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,960
were handled by me.

611
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,180
Last year,

612
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,780
there was one that was

613
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,990
dug up during the remodelling project

614
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:42,870
for an old neighbourhood.

615
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,860
That bomb was quite similar to these models.

616
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,580
I have written a detailed bomb disposal report.

617
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,910
I can ask Captain Qin

618
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,390
to show you guys later.

619
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:52,710
In the past,

620
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,320
my Old Captain also handled

621
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,960
the explosives

622
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,420
left behind from wartime.

623
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,340
But I need to

624
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,000
find these materials myself,

625
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,400
because they are all hardcopies.

626
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,060
I will need to go to the Resource Room.

627
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,660
If you guys are not in a hurry,

628
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,130
I will sort out everything

629
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,360
by this afternoon

630
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,300
before we discuss in detail.

631
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,860
After this,

632
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,070
quickly scan the files and save a digital record,

633
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,080
so that it will be easier to find them.

634
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,610
Yes, Sir.

635
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,060
Hello?

636
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,220
Something urgent came up.

637
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,300
You will have to settle lunch by yourself.

638
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:52,860
You can go to the

639
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,590
restaurant we went yesterday.

640
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:55,880
Okay.

641
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:57,890
Bye.

642
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,190
Wait a minute.

643
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,900
What's wrong?

644
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,510
What time are you coming back today?

645
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,080
Are we still staying here tonight?

646
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,840
If you don't want to leave,

647
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,810
we can stay a few more nights.

648
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,800
Why does this sentence sound...

649
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,390
I am hanging up.

650
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,130
See you tonight.

651
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,420
What's up?

652
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,000
He's quite gentle.

653
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,190
It's quite rare to witness.

654
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,000
There is no one else here,

655
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,260
shall we eat together?

656
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,970
Alright.

657
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,400
Are you Captain Lu's girlfriend?

658
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,340
My boyfriend told me.

659
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:10,920
Yes.

660
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,750
Are you here to see your boyfriend?

661
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,350
Yes.

662
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,350
We are all from Henan.

663
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,250
After he got here,

664
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,340
it has been three years since

665
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,700
he went back home.

666
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,830
I come to see him every year.

667
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,260
He hasn't been home for three years?

668
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,120
It must have been tough on you.

669
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,590
Their job

670
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,750
requires them to be

671
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,410
working non-stop.

672
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,580
I am used to it.

673
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,990
When I was studying,

674
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,810
we were separated.

675
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,730
He was in Qining back then.

676
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,650
That has been a long time.

677
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,500
Yes, a long time indeed.

678
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,690
This...

679
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,580
This was

680
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,120
the bomb that was dug out

681
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,640
when the villagers were about to rebuild their house,

682
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,100
left behind from wartime.

683
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,300
It was 40 cm long.

684
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,230
I have seen this before.

685
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,710
This is great.

686
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,480
Captain Lu,

687
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,000
with this drawing,

688
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,300
It will be so much more convenient.

689
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,660
It's just that this handwriting...

690
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,960
I can read

691
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,580
Old Captain's handwriting best.

692
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,100
I am showing you the manuscript first.

693
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,760
Later at night,

694
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,000
I will scan it for you

695
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,770
and organize the manuscripts into an electronic version.

696
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:31,430
Captain Lu,

697
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,210
that will be really hard on you.

698
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,260
No worries, it's my duty.

699
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:34,610
Here.

700
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:35,920
Write this down.

701
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,860
These are all

702
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,750
bombs left behind during the war.

703
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,370
This is a napalm bomb.

704
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,040
This is an aerial bomb.

705
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,870
This is a time bomb.

706
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,060
In that era, the time bombs

707
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,320
were fitted with an anti-disassembly steel bead setting.

708
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,360
If we find this

709
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,100
and remove the wire,

710
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:55,840
the bomb

711
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,180
will become a dead bomb.

712
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,240
Then, it will no longer be dangerous.

713
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,980
Maintain the spirit of learning.

714
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:02,590
Great job.

715
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,820
He's more experienced than me in this area.

716
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,660
Take this opportunity to learn some more.

717
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,590
There is no harm.

718
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:19,900
Come here.

719
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,860
Why don't you dry your hair a bit more in the winter?
