1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,320
The beating caused internal bleeding

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,320
and a traumatic brain injury.

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,760
Can we see him?

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,040
No, I'm sorry.
Only immediate family can enter the ICU.

5
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,200
I'm doing paperwork
so he can be transferred to Bilbao.

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,160
Bilbao? Why? Can't you help him here?

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,240
It's the best place for brain injuries.

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,880
Okay, and when will he wake up?

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,040
Could be days, weeks…

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,720
Or never.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,320
-Doctor.
-I'm coming.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm sorry, kids.
I can't tell you much else for now.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,720
Thanks.

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,800
Shit.

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,760
Who did this to him?

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,040
Dalmar, I heard about your friend,
and I thought,

17
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,040
"This kid must be really upset."

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,960
You are, aren't you?

19
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,400
Come here, sit down. I don't bite.

20
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,360
Believe it or not,
I can show a lot of empathy.

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,200
-And I know your life is fucked up.
-What would you know?

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,160
Well, I know you're here on your own,
with no family, no papers.

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,640
And now you lost your best friend.

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,440
He's still alive.

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,320
Unable to move, but alive, yes.
That's what's important.

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,960
I want to tell you

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,160
that I know that, very deep inside,

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,760
you're a good kid.

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,240
And I want to help you.

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Get out, please.

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,480
Dalmar, I'm serious about this.

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,480
I want to help you, if you let me.

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,840
By giving me the money?

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,320
Yes.

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,280
If you go back to your country.

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,200
How much time do you have left
to leave voluntarily?

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,480
How do you know that?

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
Dalmar, it's me.

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,080
I mean, you tell Sonia.

40
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,640
You cheat on Sonia.

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,840
Sonia blabs about it at Las Encinas.

42
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,560
Chloe, my daughter, finds out.

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,920
How much time left?

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,720
Well…

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,160
I don't know. None?

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,600
It's today or tomorrow.

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
Or the day after.

48
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,680
You don't seem to care much.

49
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,120
I can't believe you.

50
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,280
So you already accepted
that you'll stay here illegally,

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,080
with no resources,
very soon with no shelter…

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,880
Why would you need to suffer hardships

53
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,480
when you could live like a king
in your country?

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,200
Look, here's the deal, okay?

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,520
You go back to your family.
To your mom, since you must have one.

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,840
Poor woman, she'll be suffering
having you so far away.

57
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,080
You go back to her, and I assure you that,

58
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,800
with the money I'll give you,

59
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,360
you'll live without worries for years.

60
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,240
My life is here.

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,160
This is my home.

62
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,080
Look, Dalmar, dear.

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,040
I need an answer now, okay?

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,960
Otherwise, your time is up,

65
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,760
and you'll be kicked out
with empty pockets.

66
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,080
So think about it soon.

67
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,040
In the meantime, delete that video.

68
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,440
Look at me.

69
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,360
That's the first thing.

70
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,760
YOU WERE AMAZING LAST NIGHT.

71
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,440
WOULD YOU BE AS AMAZING
WITH A FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S VISITING?

72
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
HE'S VERY GENEROUS.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,560
As soon as all the forms are filled in…

74
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,720
We'll do it as quickly as possible.

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,280
-It's a good--
-What is it?

76
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,680
-How's Omar?
-Don't worry. He's stable.

77
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,320
I was telling Imán and Yusef
that his transfer has been approved.

78
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,440
Okay. That's a good thing, right?

79
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,680
But how will we manage
to be with him in Bilbao?

80
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,000
Our business is here.

81
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,080
We can't just close it and leave.

82
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,280
We can barely afford the rent
for the store, the house,

83
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,720
the accommodation there,
the bills here, everything.

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,160
Take this.

85
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,120
So you can focus on being with Omar
and not worry about anything else.

86
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,320
Take it, please.

87
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,440
Take care of him.

88
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,680
I'm sorry, we can't accept it.

89
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,160
Yes, we can, Imán.

90
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,840
And we must.

91
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,520
For Omar.

92
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,360
Thank you.

93
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,440
We'll never forget this.

94
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,040
I read that, if he wakes up,
he may have really shitty aftereffects.

95
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,880
Honey, don't think about that now.

96
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,400
Iván, I think it's for you.

97
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,960
Coming.

98
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,920
What are you doing here?

99
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,840
Well…

100
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,480
I've been thinking, and…

101
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,680
Shit.

102
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
I love the mirrors.

103
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,680
Kisses.

104
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,800
Another sleepless night?

105
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,800
Oh, it's just that…

106
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,240
I can't get used to sleeping
in my old bed.

107
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,120
Well, I mean Omar's.

108
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,840
And why are you going in
and out all night?

109
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,240
You know the door makes a noise.

110
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,760
I don't know, I go out for walks
to see if I can get tired.

111
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,480
Maybe if you tried staying put…

112
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,640
Here.

113
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,560
The full rent?

114
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,840
Dalmar, I can afford it. You can't.

115
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,560
That's why I got back here,
to help you, and so you're not alone.

116
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,680
Eight thousand bucks to Omar's parents.

117
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,760
Now the full rent. Are you scamming Iván?

118
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,960
No, that money is mine.

119
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,280
Mine and only mine.

120
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,040
What the hell do you do?

121
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,800
PRICE?

122
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,040
Are you going to the end-of-year bash?

123
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,080
It's not the end of the year yet.

124
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,400
I don't understand why it has to be now.

125
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,920
Because, later on,
we'll be very busy with everything.

126
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
With our exams and…

127
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,640
I don't know.

128
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,920
Iván. Come on, get off me. Move.

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,120
You don't seem too excited about the plan.

130
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,400
Are you not going?

131
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,440
I can't.

132
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,000
I have plans.

133
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,440
Well, then…

134
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,040
I'll be missing you.

135
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,160
But we spend all day together.

136
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,840
What's that? A complaint?

137
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,880
It's a fact.

138
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,080
A fact?

139
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,200
The fact is that,
if we had a little more time…

140
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,160
-Iván, we're late for school.
-…we would stay here…

141
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,920
Let's go.

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,240
Okay, let's go.

143
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,200
He's in a hurry.
He's in a huge hurry to study.

144
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,480
So how does it feel being back
to your old house and your old bed?

145
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,760
Well…

146
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,160
Very weird, to be honest.

147
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,360
I mean, I'd do anything for Dalmar, but…

148
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,960
I think I should find myself a place
before Omar wakes up.

149
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
What if…

150
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,240
we looked for something together?

151
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,120
What?

152
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,920
It's just a suggestion, okay?

153
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
We're off to school now.

154
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,880
You think about it on your own.

155
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,240
Well, or talk to someone.
Anyone. And let me know.

156
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,200
Okay?

157
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,320
Well, if you want to.

158
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,920
Okay.

159
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,440
Shall we?

160
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,240
Pier and Guillermina
are determined to have a

161
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,000
special and secret friend gathering
here tomorrow.

162
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,120
You sure left them impressed.

163
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,200
Yeah, I know.

164
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm organizing it.

165
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,920
Why didn't you say anything?

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,160
Maybe because it's secret, right?

167
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,760
And because you're invited.

168
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,320
Doing it on the same day
as the party is stupid.

169
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,440
Why?

170
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,680
With all those drunk suckers out there,

171
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,560
we can't guarantee our guests' privacy.

172
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,360
Hey, don't chew me out.

173
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,320
They decided when, where, how and who.

174
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,320
I just act as PR guy and party planner.

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,800
Is that a new name for a whore?

176
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,240
Do your friends know what you do?

177
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,360
Does Iván know?

178
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,760
Did you see the look on his face?

179
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,760
No, nobody knows.

180
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,560
If Iván finds out…

181
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,240
Don't fuck with me.
If he does, it will be from me.

182
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
No, it's fine with me if you tell him.

183
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,560
He won't believe it from someone else,
but if you tell him…

184
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,520
Let's see how he takes it, huh?

185
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
What's wrong?

186
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,160
You look very tense.

187
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,920
If you only knew…

188
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,160
You can tell me, can't you?

189
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,280
Come here.

190
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,000
What?

191
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,960
You don't want to live with me?

192
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,680
Look, if you think it's too soon, maybe…

193
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,160
I don't think it is. I've been thinking.

194
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,560
-And I want us to be--
-No, I want to.

195
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,240
I want to. I look forward to it.
I don't want to waste any more time.

196
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,360
Cool. So, what?

197
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,560
What's wrong?

198
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,760
Fuck.

199
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,360
This is going to be tougher
than I thought.

200
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
Let's see…

201
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
You know that, lately,

202
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,160
I've been earning a lot of money, right?

203
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,920
Yes, Héctor gives it to you.
So you don't let me.

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,520
-But he--
-No, I don't get anything from Héctor.

205
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
You're not selling drugs, right?

206
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,800
What? Of course not.

207
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,720
Are you on OnlyFans?

208
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,800
Man, I just knew it.

209
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,400
I mean, I didn't know, but I suspected it.

210
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,280
Come on, Joel,
are you showing your ass for money?

211
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Because I imagine it's just you, right?

212
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,160
Joel, I mean, so it's not just you?

213
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,160
You're kidding me.

214
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,160
Are you fucking on the internet
in front of everyone?

215
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,160
I didn't say that.

216
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,520
Do you think it's normal

217
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,920
that the whole world
can see my guy fucking?

218
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,120
Well, not everyone. Only if they pay.

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,600
In my case, it's no one,
because I'm not on OnlyFans.

220
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,320
Okay? There are no online videos
of me fucking with people. I swear.

221
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,080
Okay, so what is it? Say it.

222
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,680
Look, it's true that…
I do the stuff I would do on OnlyFans.

223
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,440
But it's not recorded.
I get that it would upset you.

224
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,520
-Are you fucking for money, then?
-If you put it that way…

225
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,680
How can I put it?
I'm sorry, I'll rephrase it, then.

226
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,920
Are you fornicating for a fee?

227
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
It's not only sex, it's…

228
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,400
Do you tell jokes?
Do cartwheels? What do you do?

229
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,320
-Please let me talk.
-Sorry.

230
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,040
Talk. What do you want to say?

231
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,440
Look, what I do is more…

232
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,640
That's it. It's more.

233
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,360
-More what?
-The conversation.

234
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,960
-The intimacy. The experience.
-Okay.

235
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,200
What are you, then? A geisha?

236
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,720
-Are you a geisha?
-What?

237
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,760
Do you speak different languages?
Do you discuss geopolitics?

238
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,120
Iván, please…

239
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,640
It's madness, I mean…

240
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,520
Joel, what you are is a hustler.

241
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,200
-Stop it!
-You hustle!

242
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,720
-You're not listening.
-You suck cock for money.

243
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,080
Don't just keep attacking me.
Bam, bam, bam! You're hurting me!

244
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,800
Oh, so you are the one getting hurt now?

245
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Damn, I mean…

246
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,120
Man, you and I just can't.

247
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,920
We can't. It's clear. You and I can't.

248
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,760
Fuck.

249
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
Guys! Newsflash!

250
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,920
-Omar is reacting to stimuli.
-Seriously?

251
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,080
-Yes.
-So, what? Is he waking up?

252
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,320
He's waking up!

253
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,640
That's great, man! I told you.
Did you hear? Everything will be okay.

254
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,800
What if we all
take a flight to Bilbao to see him?

255
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,200
Return on the same day.

256
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,480
-Yes.
-Can I join you guys?

257
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,960
I want to see him too.

258
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,000
Don't worry, we don't need to talk
or sit in the same row.

259
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,280
Okay.

260
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,080
I got it, okay?

261
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,800
I'll go on my own.

262
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,960
And she plays the victim too.

263
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,760
She's got some nerve.

264
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,720
Guys, I think this is getting out of hand.

265
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,160
Excuse me?

266
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,280
What matters here is seeing Omar.

267
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,400
And that he feels our support.
Not our crap.

268
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,800
I don't know. It's a matter of priorities.

269
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,320
-Chloe!
-Not now.

270
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,560
-What?
-Please.

271
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,040
Sorry for blanking you.

272
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,960
Sonia is really hurt, understandably.

273
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,320
As for my cousin,
he already had it in for you so…

274
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,760
I have no excuses.

275
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,560
I got carried away by the others
and I behaved like a coward.

276
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,240
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,400
Very well.

278
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,320
Thank you.

279
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,320
Chloe, so are you coming
to Bilbao with us or what?

280
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,720
No, no fucking way.

281
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,240
I'm not into snide glances
and silences meaning, "you're a bitch."

282
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,640
I mean, you've been a bit of a bitch.

283
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
I know that.

284
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,440
-But I haven't been the only one.
-No.

285
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,160
I'm not perfect either.

286
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,960
Well, you are to me.

287
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,680
And I'm really sorry I hurt you.

288
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,440
Right. What about Sonia?

289
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,920
-How could you screw her over?
-I'm sorry too.

290
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,480
What I want to know is why do you do it?

291
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,440
Honestly, I'd like to understand you.

292
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,880
Can you answer me? Why screw over
those who love you the most?

293
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,280
-I can't tell you.
-Why?

294
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,840
-I'd screw my mom over.
-What does she have to do with it?

295
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,800
She has to do with it, Eric.
I can't tell you, I'm sorry.

296
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,240
How much do you charge per hour?

297
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,720
How much do you make?

298
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,560
To be honest with you,
I make a lot of money.

299
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,520
Why?

300
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,800
Want me to get you in?

301
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
I could take Carmen's money and leave.

302
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,360
But that lady is a swindler,
and you guys are all I have, man.

303
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,360
-Blackmail her again, then.
-What?

304
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,760
-No.
-That could set you up for life.

305
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,320
I said no. I'll pass.

306
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
I said no.

307
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,640
Let's see…

308
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,880
It's not easy.

309
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,080
Okay?

310
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,480
It's all about getting the hang of it.

311
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,440
But you know what? I think you'd be a hit.

312
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,960
For real.

313
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,920
The only bad thing
is that little defect of yours.

314
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,880
What little defect?

315
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,160
I mean, I'm smoking hot,
and on top of that I have a…

316
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,720
You're straight, stupid.

317
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,920
So what?
You only get hired by guys or what?

318
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,640
No. There are fewer women,
but they pay better.

319
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,400
What you need to do is diversify.

320
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,440
RAÚL'S MURDERER,
COME SEE ME AT CRUZ9 TONIGHT.

321
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,720
Dalmar.

322
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,480
That's very weird, Mom.

323
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,640
I gave him a chance to go away in style.

324
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,000
He'll shit himself. I'll report him.
He'll know what's good for him.

325
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,120
Okay…

326
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,000
And apart from reporting him,
what will you do?

327
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,400
Mom, I know you.

328
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,400
I'll meet him.

329
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,400
Okay.

330
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,040
I'm coming with you.

331
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Hi, Omar! We miss you so much!

332
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,520
There's lots of stuff
I have to tell you about this month.

333
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,760
First of all,
Isadora House closed, unfortunately.

334
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,520
But look, it's called Cruz9 now.

335
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,800
We redecorated it slightly,
we put mirrors, new screens…

336
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,560
And… all thanks to this gentleman. Say hi.

337
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,440
Omar, you need to see all this.
It's beautiful. You'll love it.

338
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,360
Oh, wait. Look.

339
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,800
There's someone else here
who wants to say hello. Say hi to Omar.

340
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,000
Hey, Omar. We need you back.
We're devastated.

341
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,200
You're obviously coming back, my friend.
We miss you.

342
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,640
Omar wakes up from the coma,
sees the video,

343
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,080
and tells the doctors
to put him to back to sleep.

344
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,040
What's happening here?

345
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,280
I'm wanted at the bar.

346
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,480
Did you guys argue?

347
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,560
No. Well, I'll tell you later.

348
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,720
Excuse me. White wine, please.

349
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,760
Will you be going to the party?

350
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,680
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

351
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,880
Yes, of course.

352
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,320
Can't you remember
what you said the last time?

353
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,160
That I took advantage of you
because you were stoned.

354
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,920
Well, I didn't say that exactly.

355
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,640
No, you did. You said that.

356
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,040
Did you want space? Here's some space.

357
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,680
-Can you see Dalmar?
-No.

358
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,080
Mom, this is very weird.

359
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,320
-WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?
-LOOK UPSTAIRS.

360
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,480
Joel?

361
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,880
-Wait here.
-No.

362
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,600
-I'm coming with you.
-Wait here, please.

363
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,120
Chloe, what's your mom doing here?

364
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,360
So it was you.

365
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,800
And I thought it was Dalmar's doing.

366
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,720
Excuse me?

367
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,720
Wow.

368
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,280
This is high up, isn't it?

369
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,360
What are you doing?

370
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,480
You could have helped Dalmar
instead of giving him crumbs.

371
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,360
-You rich people are like that, right?
-Let go of me, you punk!

372
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,640
You know what? You're gonna pay.

373
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,120
A quarter of a million.

374
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Right…

375
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,120
One quarter of a million today,
and you'll want more soon.

376
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,360
That will be all.

377
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,960
Get it in two days
or I'll take the video to the police.

378
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,000
And hurry up.

379
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,800
It's been our best night in months.

380
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,880
A few more like this,
and the renovation will be paid off.

381
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,760
This is great! Thank you!

382
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,440
No, don't thank me.

383
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,760
Thank my dad's lawyers and consultants,
their viability plan, and all that.

384
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,040
Right, all that. But thanks to you.

385
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,000
-Right.
-Thank you. I love you loads.

386
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,240
I love you too.

387
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,440
I'm sorry.

388
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,680
Isadora, if you don't need me, I'm off.

389
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,120
God, this feels so weird.

390
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,440
You were glued together yesterday,
and now you won't look at each other?

391
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,040
It's very weird. What's wrong?

392
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,120
We're giving each other time.
Well, I'm giving it to myself.

393
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,360
-Why?
-Just stuff…

394
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,720
I need to think.

395
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,440
Think about what?

396
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
You love each other, don't you?

397
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,400
Yes, I love him to bits.

398
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
I love him with all my heart too.

399
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,880
He's the love of my life.

400
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,440
Are you kidding me?
What you said is just beautiful.

401
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,560
So?

402
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,920
So I don't want to suffer
so much with somebody again.

403
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,720
And this guy's baggage is just…

404
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,840
-Damn…
-Honey.

405
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,920
Life is about risk.

406
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,520
About taking the plunge.

407
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,440
About laughing, crying,
falling, and getting back up.

408
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,840
Otherwise, what's the point?
It's really boring, isn't it?

409
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,000
Sure.

410
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,960
More loving and less thinking,
for God's sake.

411
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,440
Look, come here a second.

412
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,520
I booked a suite for you two
to go and have a good time.

413
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,800
You'll get some cold champagne
in a little while, okay?

414
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,760
Thanks.

415
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,520
Are you thinking about your mom?

416
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,920
It's just that I never saw her so worried.

417
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,080
Or so scared, you know?

418
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,720
All because of a fucking video.

419
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,920
A video that Dalmar recorded
in whichever way he wanted.

420
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,840
He just got whatever he wanted.

421
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,120
So it's normal that people think
whatever they want to think.

422
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,080
Shit.

423
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,440
Why don't we talk to Joel?

424
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,280
Yes, of course.

425
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,960
A guy who threatens to fuck up your life
if you don't pay a quarter million.

426
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,040
We'll sure make him change his mind.

427
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,480
-Of course.
-No.

428
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,600
Not in a nice way, but in a bad one.

429
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,000
What?

430
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,560
You're joking, aren't you?

431
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,880
I won't hurt him.

432
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,320
I'll just scare him.

433
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,560
I'm not sure if he can be scared.

434
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,440
In the squat house,
we had issues with skinheads.

435
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,480
I'd pull this out, bam, bam, bam,
and they'd just run away.

436
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,640
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

437
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,840
What did you do to them?

438
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,080
Bam, bam, bam.

439
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,840
-Bullshit.
-You don't believe me?

440
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,000
No.

441
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,120
Gangster.

442
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,360
I'll cut you…

443
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,640
It is scary, actually.

444
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,720
Would you really do that for me?

445
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,520
Sure.

446
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,200
Why?

447
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,800
First, I love you.

448
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,760
That's enough for me.

449
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,600
And second, it's not fair
they want to fuck you over about Raúl

450
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,120
when you had nothing to do with it.

451
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,840
What?

452
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,200
I have so much money
we wouldn't think about it ever again.

453
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,760
Any of us.

454
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,440
Why do you have to do that?

455
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,520
Because…

456
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,320
I don't want to think about money either.

457
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,600
And I don't want to think
that everything we have

458
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,840
or buy is because of you,

459
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,880
and I'm a fucking hanger-on.

460
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,120
Joel, you're no…

461
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,120
Iván, you know what I think about that.

462
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,960
You know it.

463
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,160
I do.

464
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,760
My love.

465
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,880
I take offers, money,

466
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,520
influence from others.

467
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,600
I sell myself to other people
because I don't care about them.

468
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,560
My only interest is what they have
and what I can get from them.

469
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,440
But from you…

470
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,040
All I want from you is you.

471
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,600
And all I want is for things to be
on equal footing between us.

472
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
Or more or less, because…

473
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,680
It's probably never going to be like that,
but you know what I mean.

474
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,080
All I want between you and me
is a Joel and an Iván.

475
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,720
So please tell me we will at least try.

476
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,360
And you tell me
that your job won't last long.

477
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,760
If this little thing
I've got going works out,

478
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,480
I swear I'll quit as soon as possible.

479
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,520
I swear.

480
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,240
You're very naïve, Joel.

481
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,320
You think what you're doing is just a job.

482
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,240
But it leaves a mark.

483
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,000
It destroys you.

484
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,280
And I'm not saying it out of jealousy.

485
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,720
I'm serious.

486
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,200
Iván, I'm fine.

487
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,920
I really am.

488
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,040
Can I kiss you?

489
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Please.

490
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,320
Who's there?

491
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,280
Chloe.

492
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,520
But are they together again?

493
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Dude. Chloe, again? Seriously?

494
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,360
Man, spare me the lecture
because I couldn't care less.

495
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,480
What's that?

496
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,360
Nothing, a gift from a squatter buddy.

497
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,240
Any more questions?

498
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,080
I haven't slept at all,
and I'd like to rest for half an hour.

499
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,560
Why are you here?

500
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,720
-What a warm welcome.
-Stop, don't come in.

501
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,240
I'm here on duty, Isa.

502
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,080
I don't give a shit.
You can't come in like that.

503
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,200
What?

504
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,800
How much do you get for allowing kids
to prostitute themselves on your premises?

505
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,600
I've been seeing it for a month.
I have evidence.

506
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,760
Evidence of what?

507
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,160
You're sick in the head.
Do you realize that?

508
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,920
I left a cell phone
recording in several suites.

509
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,640
For several nights.

510
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,200
I've never seen this before. I have no--

511
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,920
Don't lie to me.

512
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,240
Do you know
what the penalty is for procuring?

513
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,000
Five years.
And they'll shut down the club, obviously.

514
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,440
I'm not lying. I've never seen it before.
I have nothing to do with that.

515
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,760
See that?

516
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,680
What?

517
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,800
All I do is help you,
do what you ask me to do.

518
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,560
And you lie to me.

519
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,200
You avoid me.

520
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,680
Not even a "thank you, Luis."

521
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,680
"You don't know how much I owe you, Luis."

522
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,280
Go. Go away.

523
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
Are you sure you want me to go?

524
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,640
Don't you want me
to save your ass as usual?

525
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,160
All I'm asking is that, for once,
you say, "I appreciate you, Luis."

526
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,960
I'm not asking you to say you love me.
I'm not that dumb, damn it. But maybe a…

527
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,920
Maybe, "You matter to me, Luis."

528
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,320
Let's see…

529
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,440
Say it.

530
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,880
"You matter to me, Luis."

531
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,480
Come on.

532
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,960
You…

533
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,640
You…

534
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,440
You matter to me, Luis.

535
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,560
Oh, do I?

536
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,840
Well, thanks.

537
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,160
That wasn't so hard, see?

538
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,760
We're edging closer
to where we want to be.

539
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,480
See you.

540
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,880
Your parents are on their way.

541
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,880
We said five minutes
on the phone, that's all.

542
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,280
Don't try
to catch up on everything at once.

543
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,640
Okay.

544
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Be right back.

545
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,680
Hi.

546
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,280
First of all, this is a single view video
and you can't record it.

547
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,760
And we have more contacts
in the police than in Las Encinas.

548
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,320
Hello, Omar!
Welcome to the world of the living.

549
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,640
It'd be best in person, but the main thing
is that the message reaches the receiver.

550
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,000
And the message is…

551
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,920
Your sister will lose her internship
if you tell what happened.

552
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,080
Where was it? At a kebab shop?

553
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,000
At the United Nations.

554
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,480
She got it, thanks to Alumni,
so one phone call from us and it's over.

555
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,240
-The United Nations or any other future.
-Except the kebab shop.

556
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,080
We'll let her have the kebab shop.

557
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,000
Are you okay?

558
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,640
Omar!

559
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,880
How are you?

560
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,880
-Omar.
-Omar…

561
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,320
I'm okay.

562
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,960
I have to talk to you, Joel.

563
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,040
-Can it wait until tomorrow?
-I can't wait a single second.

564
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,720
Is something wrong?

565
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,280
It's a work thing, honey.
I need to talk to him.

566
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,360
Okay, then.

567
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,400
-See you tomorrow?
-See you tomorrow.

568
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,120
Come on, Joel.

569
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,880
-I love you.
-I love you.

570
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,600
Dude!

571
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,040
Honey, I'm nervous.

572
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,800
I know. Me too.
But it's okay. We'll just scare him.

573
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,040
Don't worry.

574
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,280
It will be okay.

575
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,120
Fine, I'll see you in there.

576
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,600
-Okay.
-I love you.

577
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,160
Mom, uh…

578
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,920
The thing with Raúl was my fuck-up.

579
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,040
And we've had trouble since then.

580
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,720
It's my fault that we're in this mess,
so I'm going to get us out of it.

581
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,640
Okay?

582
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,880
Isa! Isa, please, listen to me.

583
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,240
I don't want to listen to you!
He threatened to close the club down!

584
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,440
Jail!

585
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,000
He's forcing me to do terrible things.
He won't stop until he rapes me.

586
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,040
Do you understand?

587
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,640
He'll come for me whenever he wants,
and it'll be your fucking fault!

588
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,640
-I'm very sorry, really.
-No, you're not sorry!

589
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,640
You're a selfish son of a bitch.
That's what you are.

590
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,080
I swear to God, you will regret this
every day of your fucking life!

591
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,000
I swear.

592
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,200
Hey, Isa!

593
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,560
-Are you okay?
-No.

594
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,600
No, I'm obviously not okay.

595
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,200
I want to get drunk
and take drugs until I die.

596
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,600
Come.

597
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,080
Joel, I'm begging you.

598
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,800
Stop what you're doing,
and free me from Luis.

599
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,320
I'm serious, Joel.

600
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,440
But if Luis
is a police inspector, I don't…

601
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,440
You have contacts.
Go to Alumni. Get me out of this shit.

602
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,720
You got me into this,
and you're gonna get me out. Look at me.

603
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,920
You'll get me out.

604
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,000
I was awful to you.

605
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,640
I couldn't manage the situation
and I freaked out.

606
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,200
Exactly what situation
couldn't you manage?

607
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,200
Well, having feelings
for someone other than Raúl.

608
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,040
Right. But if you weren't drunk,
you wouldn't be telling me this.

609
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,160
You'll deny it in the morning.

610
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,880
You'll say you need distance
or whatever, and you'll drive me nuts,

611
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,160
I'm sorry, Nico, but I'm not drunk.

612
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,800
I can smell your breath.

613
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,960
Well, maybe I did drink a little.

614
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,440
But I know perfectly well what I'm saying.

615
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:05,000
I hadn't said it before because
I feared you'd tell me to go to hell.

616
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,200
As you are doing now.

617
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,880
But I'm really sorry, Nico, okay?

618
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,240
I'm sorry.

619
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,000
Go grazing!

620
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,320
What?

621
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,560
I tell people to go grazing, not to hell.

622
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,200
What's the difference?

623
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,400
That you can stay and graze here.

624
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,720
If you like.

625
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,320
You're meeting me.

626
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,280
Not her.

627
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,200
What's this about, Joel?

628
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,600
I'll fuck you over
if you don't leave Isadora alone.

629
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,880
Right…

630
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,080
Okay, go turn a few sex tricks
if you don't wanna sleep in jail tonight.

631
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,560
You think I'm scared that you're a cop?

632
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
I know very powerful people

633
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,560
who will fuck up your life
and take your shitty job away.

634
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,000
Are you threatening me?

635
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,960
You know what?

636
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,560
I won't wait for you to listen to me.

637
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,760
Shitheads like you
deserve little less than death.

638
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,520
I'm going to screw you over.

639
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,640
And I'm going to do it right now.

640
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,840
This way, guys.

641
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,440
Guys, clothes in the backpack.
Don't leave anything here.

642
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,200
How are you?

643
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,520
Tense.

644
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,360
Look,

645
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,840
I have a foolproof tool
that may help you relax.

646
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,760
What is it?

647
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,400
It's G.

648
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,120
G for what?

649
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,640
G for GHB.

650
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,840
What does it do?

651
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,800
Well, just like I said,

652
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,800
it will make you relax
and get you really horny.

653
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,800
Come on.

654
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,320
Take it.

655
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,920
Dalmar, this will make it
a lot easier for you.

656
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,320
Take it.

657
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,880
Ready?

658
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,920
Hey, just relax, okay?
It will take effect soon.

659
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,640
I missed hanging out with you like this.

660
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,400
You stopped talking to me.

661
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,320
Will you ever forgive me?

662
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,040
I half forgive you.

663
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,520
You messed me around,
you played me, you blew me off…

664
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,920
Right…

665
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,120
And to be honest, I feel uneasy
about your obsession with Chloe.

666
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,560
I mean, she's not my favorite person
in the whole world but…

667
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,000
accusing her online is really toxic.

668
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,880
What would you do in my place?

669
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,160
I get it that you're upset about Raúl.

670
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,360
And that you think it was her fault, but…

671
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,200
I think you should move on.
You're just hurting yourself.

672
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,560
I'm trying.

673
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,120
But I promise I'll try harder for you.

674
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,120
Have you guys seen Chloe?

675
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,440
What's she doing here?

676
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,680
Have you seen Chloe?

677
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,480
Damn, girl! You just promised!

678
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,200
What the hell is she doing here?

679
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,200
Don't know, don't care.
And you shouldn't either.

680
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,440
How are you, my love?

681
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,800
Are you nervous?

682
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,040
There is still time to stop
if you want to.

683
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,200
No.

684
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,120
Let's go.

685
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,000
Leave them alone, or you'll regret it.

686
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,960
Why are you laughing, asshole? I mean it.

687
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,200
Nothing, it's just that…

688
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,000
You look just like the guys
in old gangster movies, you know?

689
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,000
Let him go, you son of a--

690
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,280
Fuck!

691
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,520
Son of a bitch.

692
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,160
Son of a bitch.

693
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,000
Hey! Hey!

694
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,440
-Let him go!
-Enough, man!

695
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,560
-Leave us alone, you sons of bitches!
-What?

696
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,480
Stop it!

697
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,680
-You and your mom have one day left.
-Let's go.

698
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,440
-I'm gonna kill you.
-Let's go.

699
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,800
Yeah? Come on.

700
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,040
Did you blackmail Carmen?

701
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,800
I did it for you.

702
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,560
And my opinion doesn't count?

703
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,640
Dalmar, I told you
I'd do anything for you, didn't I?

704
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,800
You're my best friend.

705
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,920
Chloe?

706
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,280
What happened? Who did that to you?

707
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,280
Who did that to her?

708
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,600
Joel and Dalmar.

709
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,320
Are you serious?

710
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,360
Yes.

711
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,960
Oh.

712
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,240
What's that?

713
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,000
Nothing, just a stupid thing.

714
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,680
Shall we go?

715
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,320
There's nothing to do here.
All the fun is out there.

716
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,800
That depends.

717
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,880
Doesn't it?

718
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,840
I expected more from you, Joel.

719
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,480
I didn't get you into Alumni
so that you'd be a hustler.

720
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,120
Didn't you?
Tell that to your little sister.

721
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,320
What are you saying?

722
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,240
She arranged my first date
with Pier and Guillermina,

723
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,480
who happen to like young guys.

724
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,280
But you knew that.
That's why you didn't want me to see them.

725
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,400
Why would Emilia do that?

726
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,480
Because she wanted
to impress them, I guess.

727
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,200
And because she hates me.

728
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,800
And she wants you to stop thinking of me.

729
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,880
Actually, you know what?

730
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,600
I think that'd be best.

731
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,240
I have other priorities now.

732
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,320
I have enough money
to pay for 100 hustlers like you.

733
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,120
Oh, yeah? Do it, then.

734
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,000
Name your price. Any price.

735
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,680
You have important contacts
at the police, don't you?

736
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,160
How important?

737
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,320
The most powerful.

738
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,680
The Chief of State Security is Alumni.

739
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,560
And she's out there, with everyone else.

740
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,800
Why? Do you want me
to introduce you to her?

741
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,680
No, not now.

742
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,640
But I need you to ask her for a favor.

743
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,400
That's my price.

744
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,320
Consider it done.

745
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,600
Hey, Iván! Hey!

746
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,280
Come on, get up.

747
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,840
Hey.

748
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,960
Damn, you're drunk!

749
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,720
Oh, man…

750
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,520
That last drink didn't agree with me.

751
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,160
It's time to go home.

752
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,080
No, I'm meeting Joel.

753
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,800
He sent me a really weird message.

754
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,360
I don't understand what's going on.

755
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,760
Look, he sent me this.

756
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,920
"I'm sick of your jealousy.
We need to quit. Come now."

757
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,040
You see?

758
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,960
This makes no sense.

759
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,400
That's why I don't understand
what's going on, you know?

760
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,240
I want to talk to him.
I'm going to talk to him.

761
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,000
Okay, but I'll go with you.
You can't go on your own.

762
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,840
-Let's go.
-Shit.

763
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,720
Be careful. This way.

764
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,400
This is the place.

765
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,320
I'd better sit down, okay?

766
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,040
Fuck.

767
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,520
Hello, my love.

768
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,560
How are you?

769
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,840
I need to be with you--

770
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,560
