1
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,480
Why did you confess?

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,400
No one believes me in here.
And definitely not out there.

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,080
No one believes Iván could've done it,
but I've already been convicted.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,400
Carmen showed me
what people are saying about me online.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,000
She said if I confessed,
my family would be okay.

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,400
What?

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,200
She's trying to save Iván's ass.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,360
But you didn't kill Joel.
You can't go to jail.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,480
There's more to it.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,160
I tried to blackmail Carmen with a video,
and Joel got involved.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,360
He wanted to help me stay in Spain.

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,200
One second. What do you mean, blackmail?

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,160
With a video of what?

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,040
Dalmar, please.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,520
One of Raúl's death.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,200
It showed Carmen looking out
from the rooftop after he fell.

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,240
So you think Carmen killed Joel?

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,080
Maybe.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,600
But the ones
who pulled a knife on him at Alumni

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,720
were Eric and Chloe.

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,360
It shows two people coming from Alumni.

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,240
Sorry, but Dalmar blaming
Eric and Chloe seems kind of strange.

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,680
Didn't he confess already?

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,960
He was bribed and pressured
into it on social media, okay?

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,520
Sorry, but look.

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,160
If we saw them at the party,
we could rule them out already.

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,600
But you can't make out anything here.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,960
Sure. You're a handsome, rich, white boy
who can post bail like it's chump change.

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,960
-So they ruled you out.
-Excuse me?

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,840
It didn't take you long
to take control of the computer.

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,080
-You might be hiding something.
-Sonia, what's your deal?

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,320
The four of us are using the computer.

33
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,160
-Iván didn't do it. Period.
-And neither did Dalmar.

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,640
So, does anyone trust Eric and Chloe?
Let's analyze the situation.

35
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,560
Blackmail, a knife fight,
and Eric isn't firing on all cylinders…

36
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,040
-The cops questioned them already.
-So?

37
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,080
Those fucking fascists did it.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,960
They killed him and dragged him out.

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,920
I'll do whatever it takes
so they go to jail.

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,560
I don't know.

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,200
We all know
Héctor and Emilia are assholes.

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,080
But, I mean, killing someone?

43
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,520
What if Eric and Chloe really are guilty?

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,640
Shit. Come on.

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,040
Omar, you're in no shape
to help with the move.

46
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,840
Or for such a huge change.

47
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,520
Yeah, but I can't make rent on my own.
Should I just throw myself off a cliff?

48
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,720
What should we do with this?

49
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,760
Are we taking it or throwing it away?

50
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,080
Come with me.

51
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,760
What's wrong?

52
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,960
You shouldn't have come here, Omar.

53
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,000
This is a lot for you to handle.
Come on. Let's step outside.

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,400
I've lost everything.

55
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,600
You have your family.

56
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,120
-I'll go get my meds.
-No.

57
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,440
You have to stop relying on them.

58
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,000
Close your eyes.

59
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,200
Sleep, little boy

60
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,960
Until it's dinnertime

61
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,840
And if our dinner's not ready

62
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,400
Our neighbor's will be

63
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,120
Mom would always sing that to us
when we were kids.

64
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,680
Yeah. When you were in a coma,
I sang it to you every day.

65
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,200
It seemed like you responded to my voice.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,920
And I swear it felt
like you were smiling at me.

67
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,840
Sleep, child

68
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,520
Until it's dinnertime

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,520
And if our dinner's not ready

70
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,720
Our neighbor's will be

71
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Sleep, little boy

72
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,680
Until your mother comes to see you

73
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,240
The bread is on the table

74
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,400
And the sweets are on the tray

75
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,240
Sleep, little boy

76
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,480
Until dinnertime

77
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,480
And if our dinner's not ready

78
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,600
Our neighbor's will be…

79
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,040
CHECK-IN IS NOW OPEN.

80
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,360
YOUR FLIGHT TO NEW YORK (JFK)
IS SCHEDULED TO DEPART IN 24 HOURS.

81
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm dead sure he didn't do it.

82
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,840
Not even for Chloe?

83
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,400
Nico, Chloe has him
wrapped around her finger.

84
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,320
She uses that maraca in his head
to get him to do whatever she wants.

85
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Are you hearing yourself right now?

86
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,200
Your cousin isn't just crazy.
He's crazy about Chloe too.

87
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,200
Stop calling him crazy.

88
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,360
Nico, he's not quite right.

89
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,600
Yeah, I know that.
Is he easily manipulated? Sure.

90
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,840
But I'm not gonna let anyone
give him shit for that.

91
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,800
Besides, you're the one who obsesses
over Raúl all day, every day.

92
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,040
If you care about me,
please don't say anything.

93
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,080
All right.

94
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,680
Fine. I won't say anything
because I don't want to hurt you.

95
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,560
But I won't stop till I find that video.

96
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,960
And if your cousin's involved,
sorry, but he's going down.

97
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,240
I swear I don't have it.

98
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,840
Promise me that Chloe will delete it
if she has it.

99
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,800
I'm telling you,
we don't have that fucking video.

100
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,640
What's got you so worked up?

101
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,160
Because I'm afraid
you'll end up taking the rap.

102
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,360
What's up?

103
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,200
-Did you tell anyone?
-No.

104
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,480
I saw you arguing with Sara before.
You didn't tell her, did you?

105
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,960
No, Eric.

106
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,560
You'd hand over your house keys
to any girl who looks your way.

107
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,240
It really hurts
feeling like you don't believe me.

108
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,840
I'm just worried about you.

109
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
Nico is a fucking terrible liar.

110
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,640
I know how to read him.

111
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,800
He wasn't just lying. He felt guilty too.

112
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,960
I hear you, babe.
But he is overly protective of you.

113
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,440
Give him the benefit of the doubt.

114
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,360
Okay?

115
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,880
All right, let's assume
that Nico kept it under wraps.

116
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,960
What if someone saw us
fighting with Joel at Alumni?

117
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,200
No way.

118
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm starting to think Nico
might've let it slip. Or maybe Dalmar.

119
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,600
No, babe. Don't freak out.

120
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,960
We told the cops we didn't see Joel.

121
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,920
So what if Dalmar blabbed?
They didn't buy it. It's all good.

122
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,560
What about you?
Did you get your phone back?

123
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,680
Yeah.

124
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,120
I need to charge it.

125
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,520
Losing your phone
during that fight with Joel?

126
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,480
-If they had found it, we'd be screwed.
-I know.

127
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,880
They're staring at us.
They know, Chloe. They all know.

128
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,440
They don't, babe.

129
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,000
Just relax. If we seem nervous,
they'll get suspicious.

130
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,120
All I want is revenge.

131
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,480
I want whoever did this to Joel to pay.

132
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,360
Baby, you're letting
your anger cloud your judgment.

133
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,480
It's understandable,
but that's not who you are.

134
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
Chloe and Eric are good friends of ours.

135
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,560
Well... no, the truth is
we're not great friends.

136
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,240
Did I tell you what she did?

137
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,160
To get into Alumni, she backstabbed me
and showed Emilia my private accounts.

138
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,680
I can't prove it, but I've got no doubts.
Chloe is the biggest bitch ever.

139
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
She'd do anything to get her way.

140
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,960
And poor Eric
isn't the sharpest tool in the shed.

141
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,680
Although I can't picture her
with a knife in her hand, going at it.

142
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,040
What I can imagine, though,
is that she forced Eric to do it.

143
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,240
I mean, seriously?

144
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,200
They totally did it. But... what for?

145
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,720
To protect Chloe and her mom.

146
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,640
It's obvious.

147
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,640
Where are Baba and Mama?

148
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,720
Baba felt dizzy, so they went
to the ER to get him checked out.

149
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,400
But don't worry.

150
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,720
They're exhausted.

151
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,280
And they're getting older.

152
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,000
How are you?

153
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,120
I'm a fucking wreck.

154
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,280
Dalmar didn't do it.
It was Héctor and Emilia.

155
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,200
They set up a campaign
to get him convicted.

156
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,960
But we can't prove that.

157
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,360
Even if we could, who'd go after them?

158
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,560
Even you're afraid of them.
You called them evil and shady.

159
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,840
Yeah, but not murderers.

160
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,400
They should at least pay
for beating me up.

161
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,640
What?

162
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,080
I kept quiet
because they threatened your internship.

163
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,880
You've seen what they're capable of.

164
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,280
You know one thing for certain. Now what?

165
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,040
Are you willing to sacrifice
your bright future to help me?

166
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,240
I'm sorry, Nadia. I'm being selfish.

167
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,440
Go and embrace the life
that's in store for you.

168
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,400
Hi, Mama. How's Baba?

169
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,120
I'm fine, darling. Really.

170
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,640
It's all good. Don't worry.

171
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,720
We're going home now.

172
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,160
-Okay, see you later.
-See you later.

173
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,200
Report the siblings.

174
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,120
What?

175
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,760
No, Nadia. No fucking way.

176
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,720
Omar, don't worry about my future.

177
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,280
I'll have one anywhere.

178
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,800
Here too.

179
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,600
I'd rather be close to my family.

180
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,400
-We need to--
-Drop dead.

181
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,320
We need to attend
the Alumni end-of-year soirée.

182
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,720
Together, as president and vice president.

183
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,080
Cancel it.

184
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,240
Alumni came from all over.

185
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,160
They're here,
and we have to show them we're united.

186
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,400
If that's all you care about, go alone.

187
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,120
Good luck.

188
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,640
All I care about is you.

189
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,360
You're blowing me off
to the point of not sleeping at home.

190
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,800
I swear I can't take this anymore.
It's tearing me apart.

191
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,600
Please, look at me.

192
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,760
Disappearing from the life
of someone you love

193
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,760
is one of the cruelest forms of abuse.

194
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,800
That's where you're wrong.

195
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
I don't love you.

196
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,120
Hurt me as much as you like.

197
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,360
But I'd be incapable… of doing anything
that would cause you pain.

198
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,320
Are you seriously convinced I did it?

199
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Emilia, you'd do anything
to keep me by your side.

200
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,160
So I requested a transfer...
to study abroad.

201
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
Abroad? Where?

202
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,760
As far away as possible from all this.

203
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,400
And from the memory of Joel.

204
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,800
And from you.

205
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,480
No way.

206
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,840
Tell me it's not true.

207
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,320
-Héctor, you can't--
-I said drop dead!

208
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,720
The thing is, according to Nico,

209
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,440
Eric and Chloe intimidated Joel
as a response to his blackmail.

210
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,360
I don't think Joel could do that.

211
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,720
Honey, I'm sorry
for what I'm about to say.

212
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,560
I know it's too soon,
but Joel would do anything for money.

213
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,280
There's no way it was just intimidation.

214
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,120
Remember that the video
implicates Carmen in Raúl's death.

215
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,080
They wanted to get rid of Joel for sure.

216
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,840
Carmen's no saint, but I--

217
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
If she pushed my Raúl off the rooftop,

218
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,520
she could have killed Joel
in cold blood too.

219
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Or talked Chloe into making Eric do it.

220
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,240
I saw the three of them at the party,
all worked up, scheming something.

221
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,320
-I swear.
-Okay. So what's your plan, then?

222
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,800
We team up
and steal that bitch Chloe's phone.

223
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,480
I bet it has Carmen's video
or incriminating conversations on it.

224
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,000
If we find them and they get arrested,

225
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,840
I can finally get closure on Raúl.

226
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,400
You could do the same with Joel, Iván.
It's a win-win situation.

227
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,840
At least we'd know for sure.

228
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,560
Okay. How do we steal her phone?

229
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,440
At school, right?

230
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,480
Nah. No, we need a more laid-back setting.

231
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,080
What?

232
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,480
There's a soiree at Isadora House.

233
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,160
-Cruz9.
-Cruz9. Sorry.

234
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,840
It's a luxury party organized by Alumni.

235
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,040
Chloe is a member, so she'll attend.
She'll take Eric as her plus-one.

236
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,440
Exactly. In fact, they RSVP'd.

237
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,200
Honey, relax.
No one is looking at us or accusing us.

238
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,160
Let's have some fun, okay?

239
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,080
Just a little.

240
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,680
Sure.

241
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,080
Hey. Hello.

242
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,040
It's an Alumni party, guys.
That means chaos, drugs, and alcohol.

243
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,600
Obviously, security is on our side.

244
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,280
It's the best place
to steal that bitch's phone.

245
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,480
Hey, sis.

246
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,680
"Sis"? As in "sister"?

247
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,960
Yeah, "sis" as in "sister."

248
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,000
Okay.

249
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Hey, I still haven't thanked you.

250
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,840
For everything Carmen and you have done.

251
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,600
Well, with the bail and my arrest.

252
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,000
Your online support too.
Thank you very much.

253
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,120
It's taken me a while,
but I've seen the light about you.

254
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Life was offering me
a mother and a sister, and…

255
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,160
I think it's time for me
to really get to know you two.

256
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,120
Or, at least,
find out where all this is going.

257
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,120
-That'd be nice.
-Yeah, right?

258
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,680
Can we talk for a while?

259
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,680
-Okay.
-Sure?

260
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,840
The only thing is,
I don't want to leave Eric alone.

261
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,320
Give him some space,
or you'll stress him out.

262
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,760
-Right.
-But what do I know?

263
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,400
I mean, you know him best.

264
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,360
No, you're totally right.

265
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,920
Also, I like seeing him with other people,
not so dependent on me.

266
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,840
-Sure.
-Or anyone. It's good for him, you know?

267
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,760
Yeah.

268
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,320
So yes, I'd be delighted
to have a drink with my bro.

269
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,240
Okay.

270
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,040
Excuse me.

271
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,760
Emilia, we need to talk to you
and your brother.

272
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,960
He's wanted to blame us
for the attack from the start.

273
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,720
Because you did it.
You and 20 other people.

274
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,880
Sure, 20. There were 50 of us, Omar.
No, not 50. One hundred.

275
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,280
-Please note my sarcastic tone, okay?
-Noted.

276
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,200
So where's the proof?

277
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,680
It's our job to see if there is any
and if the report is justified.

278
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,160
We didn't do it, Omar.

279
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,440
You lying son of a bitch.

280
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,760
They even sent me a threatening video.

281
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,320
Did we?

282
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,040
Can we see it?

283
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,880
It got deleted.

284
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,320
Right. What a coincidence.

285
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,800
But I'm sure it can be traced, right?

286
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,400
Sure. Let's call Mr. WhatsApp to--

287
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,680
Shut up already!

288
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,240
We didn't beat him up.

289
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,520
But since we're reporting people,
I want to report someone too.

290
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,520
Right.

291
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,120
Can we sue Omar
for making false accusations?

292
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,880
No, that's not it.

293
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,600
I'm reporting someone.

294
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,560
And it's you.

295
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,000
What are you accusing her of?

296
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,640
Killing Joel.

297
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,440
I knew it. I fucking knew it.
And yes, they beat me up.

298
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,360
-What the hell are you talking about?
-You did it. You killed him.

299
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,320
Did you see it?
Did you help her? Do you have proof?

300
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,480
It's your job to see if there is any
and look into it.

301
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,880
But Dalmar already confessed.

302
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,600
If you don't investigate it,
I'll call the head of National Security.

303
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,000
We're friends. I have her number.
Let me know.

304
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,640
-Hey, maybe threatening us--
-Luis, the accusation makes sense.

305
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,240
They posted a video
inciting people against Dalmar.

306
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,760
A simple trick to divert attention.

307
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,560
You forced Dalmar to confess?

308
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
No way.

309
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,920
Héctor wants to hurt me.
He enjoys hurting me.

310
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,840
But I didn't--

311
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,760
Okay.

312
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,320
Let's… go someplace quieter to talk.

313
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,800
I was born here.

314
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,120
But my mom
soon started dragging me around,

315
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,240
after whatever rich boyfriend she found.

316
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,440
This time, when we came back to Madrid
with no boyfriend, I thought, "How weird."

317
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,440
Now I understand why.

318
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,840
She pisses me off because she doesn't see
that I can't put down roots.

319
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,480
That I can't build relationships.

320
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,320
Well, now you can.

321
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,000
With your brother.

322
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,360
Oh, Iván. Thank you. I mean it.

323
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,800
Thank you.

324
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,000
Hey, how about a sibling selfie?

325
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,040
-Okay.
-Yeah?

326
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,560
Let's see.

327
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,200
-I'll do it. I have longer arms.
-Okay.

328
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,160
There.

329
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,080
-I was looking for you.
-What's up?

330
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,080
-Eric's not okay.
-What? Where is he?

331
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,320
In the restroom.

332
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,640
Let's go.

333
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,960
Want some water?

334
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,160
No, thanks. I'm fine.

335
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,440
All right, then. So tell us.

336
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,920
Héctor. Héctor!

337
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,960
Look at me. It's okay.

338
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,760
It's okay. Breathe.

339
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,360
I had to incriminate someone.

340
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,760
Who better than a jealous boyfriend
who had just found out

341
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,800
that his boyfriend was a prostitute?

342
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,160
-Because Joel--
-Yes, we know that.

343
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,040
Well, that's that.

344
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,400
Héctor, for God's sake, help me!

345
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,560
My love, I understand you, okay?
But you'll have to cry later.

346
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,720
-What are you going to do?
-We are getting out of here.

347
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,360
How? Where?

348
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,160
All the guests and the whores
have already gone. We're alone.

349
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,280
Let me think.

350
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,560
The trash people.

351
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,160
Huh?

352
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,600
The images from the drone.

353
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,520
The two people who came out of Alumni.
It was them and the body.

354
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,160
-Check her messages.
-Okay.

355
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,480
Yes, and her photos.

356
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,120
Eric! Eric!

357
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,600
Eric, are you here?

358
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,280
Eric! Eric, open the door!

359
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,680
Eric, please, open the door!

360
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,800
Eric's not here, damn it!

361
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,400
-Honey, are you okay?
-Are you okay?

362
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,840
-Yes.
-Sara said you were not okay.

363
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,560
If that's a fancy way of saying
I was taking a shit, sure.

364
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,160
Fuck, I was so scared.

365
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,040
I mean…

366
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,280
-Lost your phone again?
-I had it a minute ago.

367
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,560
I took it out to…

368
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,760
To…?

369
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,960
To take a selfie with Iván.

370
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,560
Then Sara told me
you were having a breakdown.

371
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,280
Fuck, my cousin told Sara.

372
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,600
Shit.

373
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,680
And Sara tricked me to take my phone.

374
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,560
Come here.

375
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,640
You fucking assholes! Give me my phone!

376
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,800
Hey! Stop, or I'll call security
and kick you both out in 30 seconds.

377
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,920
Okay, we can do this.

378
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,680
The knife. Don't leave it there.

379
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,400
-Fuck, Héctor! Focus!
-He's fucking dead, Emi.

380
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,560
We're carrying a dead body,
and our prints are all over the room.

381
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,800
Even on the knife.

382
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,960
Ammonia or fire.

383
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,880
We'll burn or clean whatever is necessary.

384
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,040
Then you dragged Joel's body
out of Alumni.

385
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,440
Yes.

386
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,720
But before setting up a fake crime scene…

387
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,560
I had to put it together in my head.

388
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,400
And I did.

389
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,680
I went out to the party.

390
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,200
And I left my brother
in charge of the body and the knife.

391
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,800
I discreetly mingled with the crowd.

392
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,000
And without anyone noticing,

393
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,200
I slipped five doses of GHB
into Iván's drink.

394
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,200
That can knock out an elephant in minutes.

395
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,640
That's why Iván fell asleep.

396
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,360
Yes, but I needed him to pass out
where I wanted him to.

397
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,360
Somewhere quiet,
away from all the bustle of the party.

398
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,800
That checks out
with what Dalmar and Iván confessed.

399
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,040
Hey, Iván! Hey!

400
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,320
Come on, get up.

401
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,480
Hey!

402
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,280
Come on, get up.

403
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,040
Damn, you're drunk!

404
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,480
Wait. My phone.

405
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,040
Oh, man…

406
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,680
That last drink didn't agree with me.

407
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,280
-Drink?
-Yes.

408
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,240
-It's time to go home, my friend.
-No, I'm meeting Joel.

409
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,640
He sent me a really weird message.

410
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,120
I don't understand what's going on.

411
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,720
You know? Look.

412
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,160
"I'm sick of your jealousy.
We need to quit."

413
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,640
-"Come now."
-You see?

414
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,000
Did you send that text?

415
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,160
Where's Joel's phone?

416
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,520
More fingerprints.

417
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,440
We'll burn it later.

418
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,520
PHONE LOCKED
FACIAL UNLOCK

419
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,360
What the hell are you doing, Emi?

420
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,720
I'M SICK OF YOUR JEALOUSY.
WE NEED TO QUIT. COME NOW.

421
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800
LAS ENCINAS
LOCATION

422
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,760
Come on, let's carry him out.

423
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,480
And what does Dalmar
have to do with all this?

424
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,400
This is the place.

425
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,480
I'd better sit down.

426
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,760
Hey! Iván!

427
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,200
I didn't expect Iván to be with someone.

428
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,720
So I had to improvise.

429
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,080
Why did he confess, then?

430
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,360
No idea. Someone must have forced him.

431
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,480
You launched a campaign against him.

432
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,120
To divert attention.

433
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,560
Didn't you force him to confess?

434
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,560
No.

435
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,200
Didn't you do it?

436
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,440
To close the case the fastest, easiest way
with the illegal and desperate Black guy?

437
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,520
Emilia, you are under arrest
for the murder of Joel Castellano Soler.

438
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,080
We just wanted to scare him, okay?

439
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,760
Joel was blackmailing our mother.

440
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,520
We just wanted to scare him. That's all.

441
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,280
Why was he blackmailing your mom?

442
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,120
We didn't do it, damn it!

443
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,360
And why did you record Joel having sex?

444
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,600
Did you also film him when you killed him?

445
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,240
-Does that shit turn you on or what?
-We didn't kill him, Iván.

446
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,800
I filmed him in case the scare didn't work
and we needed something else.

447
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Guys, I filmed Joel
and his whore friends turning tricks.

448
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,040
Before I opened the door
for Eric to scare him,

449
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,440
I left my phone recording
where the whores had left their stuff.

450
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,680
It was their base camp.
If something happened there,

451
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,040
I could use it against him.

452
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,600
Chloe, cut the shit
and tell us the truth already.

453
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,880
Fuck!

454
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,960
What is it, Sara?

455
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,400
Chloe filmed Joel's murder.

456
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,120
What do you mean, for murder?
I didn't do it.

457
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,240
-Excuse me?
-But you just said--

458
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,760
I'm only an accomplice.

459
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,080
Everything I did, I did it to save Alumni.

460
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,280
Especially Héctor.

461
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,440
Héctor?

462
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,840
Save Héctor from what?

463
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,840
From getting caught.

464
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
He killed him.

465
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,840
What?

466
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,160
What are you bastards doing?

467
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,960
-Seeing if you look good or what?
-It wasn't them.

468
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,240
Héctor.

469
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,280
Stop doing…

470
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,920
My brother
is very capricious and unstable.

471
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,200
And he was very obsessed with Joel.

472
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,440
Joel used him,
squeezed him dry for his own benefit.

473
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,280
…that I'm in love with you.

474
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,600
Well, you know what?
I'll never be in love with you.

475
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,240
So you can forget about me.
The sooner, the better for everyone.

476
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,360
When Joel stopped needing him,

477
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,640
he wouldn't let my brother go near him
or even touch him.

478
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,600
And since my brother
was drugged out of his mind…

479
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,520
he lost the little control he had.

480
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,680
Over Joel and over himself.

481
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,120
-Are you sure you can't remember anything?
-No, damn it!

482
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,320
We were completely wasted. We fucked.

483
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,320
And when I woke up…

484
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,840
Emi, what have I done?

485
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,120
It's one thing to be an accomplice
and a selfless sister…

486
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,840
and to love my brother above all else,

487
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,120
and another to be an idiot
and take the rap for murder.

488
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,680
I'm innocent, dammit!
She accused me to get revenge! She did it!

489
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,400
Omar, how can we get them out discreetly
to avoid walking them past the crowd?

490
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,520
This way.

491
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,240
Oops, I forgot. That area is closed off.

492
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,840
Construction work.

493
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,200
I'm afraid
you'll have to walk past the crowd.

494
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,160
You fucking bitch, you made it all up.

495
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,680
You can't remember
because you were on drugs.

496
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,000
I just tried to protect you until the end.

497
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,520
That's what I've done all my life.
Protect you. Love you.

498
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,960
I put you first,
and look how you repay me.

499
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,120
You've always been obsessed with me.

500
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,320
Héctor, stop it.

501
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,760
You'll never screw me over again.

502
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,680
Or go far away from me.

503
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,960
You'll stay by my side.

504
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,400
Forever.

505
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,160
I'll kill him.

506
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,760
I swear, I mean… If I see him, I'll--

507
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,480
-No.
-I swear to God--

508
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,360
-Don't say that!
-God.

509
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,200
-What's that?
-What?

510
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,280
