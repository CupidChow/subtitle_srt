1
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,320
Hello?

2
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,920
WHERE ARE YOU?

3
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,240
Héctor. Hey. Look at me.

4
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,880
Look at me, Héctor.

5
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,200
Breathe. Calm down, okay?

6
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,000
-Sure you can't remember anything?
-I told you I can't!

7
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,520
We were completely wasted.

8
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,960
We had sex.

9
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,200
And when I woke up…

10
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,960
Emi, what have I done?

11
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,160
NEW MESSAGE

12
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,760
Please stay in the designated areas
until you're called in for questioning.

13
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
That's Iván!

14
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,360
Hey, that's Iván!

15
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,680
Kids, please.

16
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,200
Is he under arrest?

17
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,560
What do you mean? Iván?

18
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,200
-Stop!
-Where's Iván?

19
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,760
-I'm not stopping.
-Please!

20
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,000
I want to hug him. He's my friend.
I have to be with him!

21
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,600
Someone close that door.

22
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,800
I want to get through.
Let me go, damn you!

23
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,280
This is too much for Omar.

24
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,200
It'd be too much for anyone.

25
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,800
But for him, it's just like…

26
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,040
And after the beating and all.

27
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,320
I'm sure what they're doing is illegal.

28
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,680
They can't keep us locked up here
like pigs, god damn it!

29
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,840
Talking about pigs…

30
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,920
I don't get why they're keeping us here
if they arrested Iván and Dalmar.

31
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,040
They want to question us.
They might not be as convinced as you are.

32
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,640
-They couldn't have done it.
-They didn't do it.

33
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,000
Nico and I saw them leaving
because they were meeting Joel.

34
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,360
Didn't we, Nico?

35
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,160
What is it, cousin?

36
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,840
Yes. Yes, we did.

37
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,360
I swear I'd never seen it before.

38
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,560
Are you sure?

39
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,560
Dalmar, are you sure?

40
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,800
If you didn't do it,
who could have a motive to kill him?

41
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Eric and Chloe.

42
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,920
Why did you request a voluntary discharge?

43
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,840
I wanted to rest at home.

44
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,000
With my friends.

45
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,720
Don't strain yourself, okay?

46
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,360
Sonia, they didn't do it.

47
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,840
Iván and Dalmar. They didn't do it.

48
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,480
Obviously, they didn't.
We know that, honey.

49
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,360
Omar, I don't mean to stir shit,

50
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,440
but they went
to where the three of them were found.

51
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,640
Joel was dead. They were covered in blood.

52
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,040
-Shut the fuck up!
-Stop.

53
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,360
Relax.

54
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,280
You won't make me doubt them.

55
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,680
You already do.

56
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,160
What the hell, Sara?

57
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,040
Pretend you're falling down
and kiss my ass for a while.

58
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,560
Shit!

59
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
What is it?

60
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,960
Alumni. Héctor and Emilia.

61
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,960
What about them?

62
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,000
They did it.

63
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,560
They did what?

64
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,240
-Omar, why do you say that?
-What is it?

65
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,160
They beat me up.

66
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,560
-What?
-Them and several others.

67
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,040
I'll beat the shit out of them.
Why didn't you say it earlier?

68
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,480
-Holy shit.
-Héctor was obsessed with Joel.

69
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,640
I got in the way and gave him a hard time.

70
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,000
So I kinda gave him every excuse
to come after me.

71
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,360
And me being Muslim.

72
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,760
Why didn't you report it?

73
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,480
If I do, Nadia will lose
her internship in New York.

74
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,720
She got it through Alumni.

75
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,880
They make a phone call,
and she'll come back from New York.

76
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,720
No, that won't happen.
Don't worry, it won't.

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,160
I'm going to pee.

78
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,400
I saw the cops pick up your knife.

79
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't fuck with me, cousin.

80
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,640
Explain how it ended up being
the murder weapon.

81
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,640
-I don't fucking know!
-You don't know.

82
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,320
So the knife got from home to school
all by itself, right?

83
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,800
Dude, I'd trust you with my life.

84
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,760
And it really hurts me
that you don't feel the same.

85
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,720
Eric, I do trust you, man.

86
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,920
I think you're innocent,
but you're hiding something.

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,880
I think you know why it was there.

88
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,280
And you're not telling me, man.

89
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,680
Please.

90
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,320
Okay, Joel was blackmailing
Chloe's mom with a video.

91
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,560
And I went there to scare him.
Just to scare him, damn it!

92
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,200
I knew whose fault it was.

93
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,520
It wasn't Chloe's idea. It was mine.

94
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,680
Yes, but to help her.

95
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,640
A video of what?

96
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,040
A video that points to Chloe's mother
as Raúl's murderer.

97
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,520
Son of a bitch.

98
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,960
-Hey! Let him go!
-Enough, man!

99
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,720
Leave us alone,
you sons of bitches! Stop it!

100
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,320
You have one fucking day left.

101
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,280
-I'm gonna kill you!
-Let's go.

102
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,680
Where'd that happen?

103
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
At the…

104
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,720
At Alumni's secret party.

105
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
At the what?

106
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
A…

107
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,840
A party organized by Alumni at their club.

108
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,080
Chloe is a member, and Joel…

109
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,440
Joel was too.

110
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,480
What's that smirk?

111
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Nothing.

112
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,320
I love you.

113
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,560
Oh, Héctor.

114
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,600
Why are you laughing?

115
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,080
I'm only fucking you
to get what I want from you.

116
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,400
Are you okay?

117
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,000
No. Of course I'm not.

118
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,560
You didn't do it.

119
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,400
Remember that,
no matter how high you were.

120
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,400
Are they coming to question us?

121
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,720
Okay, you stay here.

122
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,880
In the state you're in,
you'll almost implore them to arrest you.

123
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,720
Hey, how was Bilbao? Very cool, isn't it?

124
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,400
Shut the fuck up.
I know you and your brother did it.

125
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,800
What? Smash your face in?
Yes, I know that too.

126
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,720
Joel, you moron.

127
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,640
Us? No way, honey.

128
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,840
My brother was in love with him.

129
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,960
He wasn't in love. He was obsessed.

130
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,960
-The same?
-You hated him.

131
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,960
He wasn't worthy of my hate.
I couldn't be bothered.

132
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,640
I don't care much for any of you,
but I don't kill you.

133
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,720
I'm sorry. You knocked on the wrong door.

134
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,680
Keep searching, honey. Bye.

135
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,840
I won't stop until you're in jail.

136
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,720
Well, other than maybe visiting Dalmar…

137
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,960
Just joking.
At best, his tribe might visit him.

138
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,480
If you ask us,
that Black guy can rot in jail.

139
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,720
He is the murderer.
You don't see it because he's your friend.

140
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,960
How can you be such a bad person?

141
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,840
Did you know Joel was a hustler?

142
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,400
Of course not.
You were in a different dimension.

143
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,440
What, you shrew?

144
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,360
I love it.

145
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,320
Yes. He was a whore.

146
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,840
He sold his body for money.

147
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,840
And Dalmar got into that work too.
If you can call that work, of course.

148
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,200
-You're making that up.
-Ask Chloe.

149
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,640
For example. Or any Alumni.

150
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,960
Maybe Joel told Iván.

151
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,880
Ask Iván.

152
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,960
I'm not lying, Aladdin.

153
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,080
Joel was a whore.

154
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,480
And Dalmar was a whore.

155
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,360
Between whores,
things might have gotten very violent.

156
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,240
You know.

157
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,920
Money, drugs, sex…

158
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,440
Jealousy over clients.

159
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,520
The Black guy probably lost it… and bam!

160
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,200
Accepting that the people we love the most
are not only flawed but

161
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,280
really rotten is part of life, amore.

162
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,160
We need to gather students
to testify on Iván's behalf.

163
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,280
What about Dalmar?

164
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,680
Nobody knows him.

165
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,640
Everybody knows Iván.
At least we can save one.

166
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,200
-Sure, he's your friend and your investor.
-Honey.

167
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,160
I really don't want to fight.
I don't have the energy.

168
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,680
The more, the better.
You have a lot of followers, and so do I.

169
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes, sure.

170
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,680
Just post a Story. Come on, help me.

171
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,560
-Shit.
-What?

172
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,440
My phone isn't here.

173
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,240
What do you mean? Where is it?

174
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,160
I don't know.
It's not here. I must have lost it.

175
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,440
You don't want to help? I don't get you.

176
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,120
Sure I do. Want to search me?
I must have left it at the party.

177
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,480
Okay. Calm down.

178
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,840
Joel and Iván truly loved each other.

179
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,160
He couldn't have possibly done it.

180
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,480
Iván would never hurt anyone.
Much less someone he loved.

181
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,560
Let Iván go. He is literally
the best person in the world.

182
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,240
He couldn't have done it.

183
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,880
Joel was his boyfriend.
They had plans together.

184
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
You arrested the wrong guy.

185
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,080
When the police question us,
we'll say we were at home all night.

186
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,080
Emi, if I didn't kill him, who did?

187
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,120
I don't know and don't care.

188
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,400
And fucking snap out of it
because Joel was killed at Alumni.

189
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,520
We need to get rid of any proof,
evidence, suspicion, whatever

190
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,640
that might indicate
he was murdered here, or we're screwed.

191
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,400
Iván's friends have started
a campaign to get him acquitted.

192
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,240
Most students will testify in his favor.

193
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
And what do we do?

194
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,080
Launch our own campaign.

195
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,120
Against who?

196
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,720
-Dinghy boy.
-Who?

197
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,320
The Black guy. Omar almost bought it.
And if he does, everyone else will.

198
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,080
People need a villain. A specific person,
with a first and last name.

199
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,120
Someone whose guilt they cannot doubt.

200
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,400
Someone to focus all their hatred on.

201
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,080
And an undocumented migrant is perfect.

202
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,240
Omar? Omar, what's wrong?

203
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,400
Hey, what's wrong?

204
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,640
It's okay.

205
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,160
Let me go. Let me go.

206
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,840
Weren't you going home?

207
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,160
I feel like it's my fault.

208
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,080
Omar, you were in a coma.

209
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,760
It's the same thing
that happened with Samu.

210
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,560
-What?
-I didn't keep a close enough eye on him.

211
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,280
I warned him
that this fucking school destroys people.

212
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,560
You get a high from rubbing elbows
with the richest, the best of the best.

213
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,760
You think you're like them,
but you're not.

214
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,160
You lose perspective,
and it ends up destroying you.

215
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,680
Las Encinas doesn't want us.

216
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,480
Las Encinas only wants people
worthy of Las Encinas.

217
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,320
As president of Alumni, I want to express
our sorrow over the tragic murder of Joel.

218
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,400
An exceptional man--

219
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,680
Who'll always be in our hearts.

220
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,560
We also want to raise our voices
against the unfair arrest of Iván.

221
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,880
A great classmate, loved by everyone,

222
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,760
and, as we all know,
incapable of such a terrible act.

223
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,880
Least of all against Joel,
whom he loved with all his heart.

224
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,000
Iván should not pay for something
that is someone else's doing.

225
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,920
At the end of the day,
Iván has money, papers, and a future.

226
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,720
Why would he kill Joel? It makes no sense.

227
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,800
It makes sense
that someone with nothing did it.

228
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,400
Out of necessity.

229
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,920
Survival instinct
ensures you won't lose your nerve.

230
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,480
From Alumni,
we want to offer Iván our full support.

231
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,520
Thank you.

232
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,920
Those bastards
want people to suspect Dalmar.

233
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,120
All because he's Black and an illegal.

234
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,240
He's the perfect scapegoat.

235
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,240
You might be right
about those two doing it.

236
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,880
Those fuckers.

237
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,840
Where are you going?

238
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Aren't you ashamed to allow
that kind of speech in a school?

239
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,240
Omar, are you really
lecturing me on racism?

240
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,040
Look, Virginia--

241
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,480
You have nothing to do with this school
and don't need to testify, okay?

242
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,680
Just leave.

243
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,200
-Please, Omar.
-I'll try to make you understand.

244
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,520
"He should be hanged in a jungle."

245
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,280
"Fucking monkey.
No Blacks in our school." Want more?

246
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,160
I said go home, please!

247
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,360
Neutrality does not exist, Virginia.

248
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,200
You can't be on the side
of the abuser and the abused.

249
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,360
Now!

250
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,400
Hi. My daughter Chloe is being held here.
She's devastated.

251
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,960
-You can't come in, ma'am.
-I need to see her.

252
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,280
If you call me "ma'am" again,

253
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,840
I'll call my lawyer,
and you'll get a rap for detaining minors.

254
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,240
Huh? Want to play?
Should I call him? Come on. Let's play.

255
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,400
I just follow orders.

256
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,280
Well, follow this one. Let me through.

257
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,960
Mom, you don't understand.
If the police keep at it,

258
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,280
they'll get to the blackmail,
the video, and they'll come for us.

259
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,560
I choose our family. The three of us.
I'll see how I can get Iván out of this.

260
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,040
Keep an eye on your boyfriend.
He shouldn't know about the video.

261
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,760
He overheard us. What the hell could I do?

262
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,720
Don't worry.
He won't say anything. I trust him.

263
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,840
But he's cuckoo! He's a loony.

264
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,200
Seriously, Mom?

265
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,360
Look familiar?

266
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
Eric, does it look familiar?

267
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,200
Did you and Chloe threaten Joel with it?

268
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,000
That's a lie. We didn't see Joel.

269
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
Did Joel blackmail your mother
with a video that made her a suspect?

270
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,760
Look, I'm fucking sick of that video.

271
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,240
Sorry, but you're talking about a video
that nobody saw and nobody has.

272
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,960
And nobody proved it exists.
Do you cops have it?

273
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,520
You don't, right?

274
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,120
Raúl committed suicide.

275
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,200
I can't believe we're moving in together.

276
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,880
What do you prefer?
An apartment or a house?

277
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,680
Anything, as long as you're in it.

278
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,880
I'm serious, Iván.

279
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,160
I can only imagine my life with you.

280
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,440
Did Joel tell you
he was attending a party at Alumni?

281
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,440
He only told me he had work.

282
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,240
You know.

283
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Doing his thing.

284
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,600
But he didn't say where or with whom.

285
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,200
All we have so far is that,
according to Dalmar,

286
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,960
he and Joel went to that party
to do their thing.

287
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,120
And that fits perfectly

288
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,480
with what Joel told Iván,
that they had work that night.

289
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,440
Yes, but that doesn't prove
there was a secret party.

290
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,680
It's still Dalmar's word
against Eric and Chloe's.

291
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,120
Unless we find someone else
who was at the party that night.

292
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,000
And who saw Eric and Chloe there.

293
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,240
That would prove they lied to us.

294
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,960
Would you like something to eat?

295
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
No, thanks.

296
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,560
Why are you here?

297
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,000
Helping you.

298
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,440
Iván, the judge has ordered you
to be sent to prison pending bail.

299
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,600
A bail that's too high for each of you.

300
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,240
How much for each?

301
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,160
He's asking for this.

302
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,200
If we pay, we're free?

303
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,600
No. If you pay,
you go home until the trial is held.

304
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,960
Instead of waiting in jail.

305
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Well…

306
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,480
You handle my money.

307
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,080
Pay for mine and for Dalmar's.

308
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,360
I can't do that.

309
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,320
-The judge froze your accounts.
-How come?

310
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,080
He saw you were paying for Joel's tuition,
in addition to some irregular income.

311
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,040
Therefore, you will not be able
to access them until the trial is over.

312
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,160
I'm sorry.

313
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,800
I can pay your bail.

314
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,840
How do you have all that money?

315
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,160
Of course.
From the deal you never honored.

316
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,280
You're still here.

317
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,120
I'm still here.

318
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
Good thing I didn't leave.

319
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,280
I mean, so I can help you, right?

320
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
How are you?

321
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,600
Upset, like everyone else.

322
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,000
I can't stop thinking about Joel.

323
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,520
And… you were right.

324
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
What do you mean?

325
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,960
Life's too short.

326
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
I won't waste it thinking about Raúl.

327
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,280
They questioned you?

328
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,760
Yes.

329
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,800
Should we get some air?

330
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,800
What's wrong?

331
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,320
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

332
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,440
Sara, what is it?

333
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,600
I don't want to upset you.

334
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,320
Say it. Please.

335
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,240
The cops asked me
about your cousin and Chloe.

336
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,240
I think they suspect them.

337
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,000
You know something, don't you?

338
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,760
Nico, if we don't trust each other…

339
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,200
Eric is innocent.

340
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,680
But the murder weapon is his.

341
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,720
What's fucked up is that he and Chloe
gave Joel a scare before…

342
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,560
Shit, you know.

343
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,600
A scare? Why?

344
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,160
Nico, I just want to help you.

345
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,640
You and your cousin.
But with Chloe there, it's difficult.

346
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,120
But this thing affects you indirectly.

347
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,320
Well, not indirectly.
It affects you directly.

348
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,120
Joel was blackmailing Chloe's mom with…

349
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,360
with a… with a video.

350
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,760
A video of what?

351
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
A video of Raúl?

352
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,320
I haven't seen it, but yes,
it might have to do with his death.

353
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,760
You need to be taken care of.

354
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,840
And I'll be happy to do it.

355
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,360
If you want,
I'll set up a room for you at home.

356
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,360
Thank you.

357
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,680
Oh, my baby.

358
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,560
That's it. Cry. Let it all out. All of it.

359
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,160
Let it all out.

360
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,360
I'm so scared.

361
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,560
I mean, I…

362
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,760
Not just of ending up in jail, but…

363
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,880
I don't know if I can live without Joel.
Now I have no one left.

364
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,120
-I'm alone…
-Of course you can. You're strong.

365
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,000
-I'm not.
-Very strong, do you hear? You are.

366
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,320
Yes.

367
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,480
And after what happened to my father…

368
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,480
I have no strength left.
I can't go on living. It's just…

369
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,000
Look at me.

370
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,880
You're not alone.

371
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,080
I'm going to help you.

372
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,400
You have me.

373
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,440
Your mother. Are you listening to me?

374
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,280
You have your mother.

375
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,480
I'll be there for you
whenever you need me.

376
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,840
Whenever you want.

377
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,520
Tell me it's clear to you.

378
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,480
Yes.

379
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,440
In the meantime, tell me what I can do to…

380
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,440
To give you what you need,
to make you feel better. Anything.

381
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,120
I don't want Dalmar in jail.

382
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,400
He's innocent too, and

383
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,160
he's also the target of this terrible hate
that he doesn't deserve.

384
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,680
Pay his bail.

385
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,760
I have no money left, honey.
I can't afford it.

386
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
I can't.

387
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,960
And the two million?

388
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,840
I had to pay off very large debts
that I had accrued over the years and…

389
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,520
But José Luis and I
will see how we can fix it, okay?

390
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,840
I promise you that

391
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,160
I'll do whatever I can.

392
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,200
Look into my eyes.

393
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,480
Are you a magician now?

394
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,680
Just relax.

395
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,880
Okay, I'll relax.

396
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,520
And now,

397
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,080
sleep!

398
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,000
And now this.

399
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,000
What?

400
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,920
That's stupid.

401
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,320
-I'm ready. Should we go?
-Yes, come here.

402
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,880
Come here. We have something to tell you.

403
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,600
-Sit down.
-Sit down.

404
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,440
-You'll see.
-Come on…

405
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,080
Go on, tell him.

406
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,440
Well, Iván and I
are going to move in together.

407
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,000
Hey, what's with the face? What is it?
Huh? Do you think it's too rushed?

408
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,160
No, I just think
you're so cute that it's disgusting.

409
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,880
But I guess you guys will move
to a huge suburban house with a pool,

410
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,200
and I'll never see you again.

411
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,600
-Well…
-Yes, that's the idea.

412
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,160
But with a slight nuance.

413
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,040
For the record, it was Iván's idea.

414
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,080
What?

415
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,520
That you… should move in with us.

416
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,840
Joel needs you.

417
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,600
And if Joel's happy, I'm happy.

418
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,800
You'd be happy, Joel too, me too.
We'd all live happily together.

419
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,240
I love you.

420
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,520
I love you too.

421
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,560
Are you serious?

422
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,360
-I have no choice.
-Sure.

423
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,200
In the end,
I got used to your rotten moods.

424
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,800
To your quirks, your bullshit…

425
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,360
Yeah, I get it, asshole.

426
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,520
Come here.

427
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
Come here.

428
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,640
Friendship is so beautiful.

429
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,080
I love you, man.

430
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,920
I love you too, moron.

431
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,600
Why are you here?

432
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,480
This is José Luis, my lawyer.

433
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,760
Well, he's a friend.

434
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,360
A friend who happens to be a lawyer.

435
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,640
-And we're here to help you, Dalmar.
-How?

436
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,200
I'll read you a few things

437
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,320
people are saying on social media.

438
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,280
"Damn Black guy."
"Death penalty now. Poor Iván."

439
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,480
"That unaccompanied minor is guilty."

440
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,440
What?

441
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,400
I'm not a minor.

442
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,440
Just focus on the hatred
they feel for you, Dalmar.

443
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,400
Don't expect them to be accurate.

444
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,840
Let's see.

445
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,960
"I hope they kill him."
"The damn migrants are here to get us."

446
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,880
"Send them to Africa."
"Hang them." It's all horrible.

447
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,400
Etcetera, etcetera.

448
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,360
-Why are you reading this to me?
-Because I…

449
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,600
Because I don't want to mislead you, okay?

450
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,000
The streets have issued a sentence.

451
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,960
And I really doubt
that the judge will acquit you.

452
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
But I'm innocent.

453
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
What kind of innocent guy are you?

454
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,320
The kind who blackmailed me?

455
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,320
Are you that kind?

456
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,480
I didn't kill him.

457
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,800
Dalmar, you need to practice a lot
in the mirror so they'll believe you.

458
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,040
Sometimes, you need a scapegoat
to appease the mob.

459
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,080
It happens from time to time
in the justice system too.

460
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,120
That way, they silence public opinion

461
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,800
and buy time to find the real culprit.

462
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,360
It's common practice in cases like this.

463
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,720
-Justice is very unjust.
-Do you think I did it?

464
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,480
Who cares what I think, Dalmar?
Please, let's be practical.

465
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,920
If you confess,
the judge will reduce your sentence.

466
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,320
Admitting to it is a mitigating factor.

467
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,240
It's good for everyone.
Even for you and your family.

468
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,200
Hell, Carmen. I'm not an idiot.

469
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,760
Don't give me that shit.

470
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,760
Look, José Luis is here
to take note of your confession.

471
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,240
That's it. You sign, and he'll take over.

472
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,720
I'll make sure your family
in Somalia is taken care of.

473
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,640
-It's Guinea-Bissau.
-Guinea, Somalia… They're so close.

474
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,000
Totally different.

475
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,360
Are you listening to me?

476
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,280
I'll secure the future of your family.

477
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,240
What about my future?

478
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,960
You'd spend a few years in jail,
here in Spain.

479
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,440
We'd ensure they're not too many.

480
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,280
You'd spend the rest in your country.
Close to your family, your people.

481
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,800
You're doing all this
to get rid of me, right?

482
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,200
So they don't blame Iván.

483
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,040
It's funny that no one…

484
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,400
No one thinks he could have done it,
and everyone assumes it was me.

485
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,320
All because I'm Black.

486
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,960
I won't accept it. I won't.

487
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,200
I wouldn't do it either.

488
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,760
If I had a choice, or if I was innocent.

489
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,760
Are you innocent, Dalmar?

490
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,200
They did it.
They're after Dalmar as a distraction.

491
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,400
We can't act without evidence.

492
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,800
Somebody must've seen.
The whole fucking school was there.

493
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,200
Wait.

494
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,720
I need a favor.

495
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,040
Holy fuck! There!

496
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,680
-What?
-Go back.

497
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,400
Stop.

498
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,880
-What do you see?
-Can you zoom in?

499
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,960
Yes, sure.

500
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,120
What do they have?

501
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,040
It's very big, isn't it?

502
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,360
It's Joel's body.

503
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,920
And who are they?

504
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,480
I don't know. I can't see shit. Wait.

505
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,800
They're coming from there. From Alumni.

506
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,080
Héctor and Emilia.

507
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,400
You see? I fucking knew it!

508
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,480
I have the sedatives.

509
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,880
-Give them to me.
-It's going to look suspicious.

510
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,920
I don't care. I need them. Emi!

511
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,080
-No.
-What part can't you understand?

512
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,040
I need them to endure
the agony that's tormenting me.

513
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,960
Again? But you didn't kill him!

514
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,960
I mean, he's dead!

515
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,760
And I'll never see him again.

516
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,160
I don't recognize you.

517
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,040
When will you stop behaving
like a weak sissy,

518
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,000
and start acting like a real man?

519
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,040
No more Joel! Accept it!

520
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,720
Besides, it's for the best
because you were no longer you.

521
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,480
What is it now?

522
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,840
-You did it.
-I did what?

523
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,520
-Are you accusing me--
-You hated him!

524
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,760
-You're losing your fucking mind.
-Fucking jealousy.

525
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,920
Take eight at once if you want.
Because you really need them.

526
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,880
How could I be such an idiot?

527
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,520
After the party,
you came in while we were sleeping.

528
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,040
And when you saw us together,

529
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,000
jealousy made your blood boil.

530
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,200
You!

531
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,480
Pain is making you lose your mind.

532
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,360
I didn't kill anybody.

533
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,400
Your fucking jealousy, Emi.

534
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,720
It got the best of you.

535
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,960
You arranged everything behind my back

536
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,960
for Joel to sell himself
to Pier and Guillermina,

537
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,120
and drift away from me.

538
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,800
He told me last night,
before you killed him.

539
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,760
You should have slashed
your own throat, not his.

540
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,280
Héctor, please, breathe.

541
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,480
Take your pills, please. Breathe.

542
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,800
Don't touch me!

543
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,040
You're dead to me, Emi.

544
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,760
What are we looking at?

545
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,760
Fuck.

546
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,880
-People taking out the trash.
-It's Joel's body.

547
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,040
How can you tell?

548
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,360
-They're coming from Alumni.
-Two Alumni taking out the trash.

549
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,000
They're Héctor and Emilia.
Carrying Joel's body. They killed him.

550
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
-They almost killed me.
-What?

551
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,720
Elaborate on that.

552
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,080
No, I can't.

553
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,840
Hell, I just can't.
But you have to believe me, please.

554
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,120
All this drone stuff,
those two taking out the trash,

555
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,320
who almost killed you, but you won't tell…

556
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,280
You're improvising, doing all you can
to save Dalmar. Stop it. Go home.

557
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
What do you mean? Save him from what?

558
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,440
Dalmar has asked
to go before the judge to confess.

559
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,680
He's the murderer.

560
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,160
Case closed.

561
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,400
