1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,960
Guzmán.

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,920
Guzmán.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,200
I need to ask you some questions.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,480
What happened?

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,360
LAKE CLUB

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,440
I need you
to tell me what you saw tonight.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,520
What happened?

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,800
Guzmán.

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,760
Relax.

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,320
Everything will be okay.

11
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,360
Boys, lanes one and two.

12
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,240
Girls, three, four, and five.

13
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,000
Any particular reason?

14
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,800
-For what?
-Dividing us by sex and not by level.

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,000
The fastest in lane one,

16
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,040
and the slowest in lane five.

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,080
Split up like I said.

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,960
Ready…

19
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,960
Your next checkup's not until next year.
We'll have three months of peace now.

20
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,680
Azucena.

21
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,000
Come in, please.

22
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,800
Muñoz, go to class.

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,080
He said the school's been going downhill
these last two years.

24
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,280
And he's here to straighten it out,
starting today.

25
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,560
Fired without warning at my age.
And the year's already started.

26
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,440
-This school sucks. I'm going with you.
-Don't be ridiculous. You're staying.

27
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,480
I should've gone backpacking.
I don't know why I'm wasting my time here.

28
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Honey, this is your last year.

29
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,720
Right, but why do I need to graduate?

30
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,880
In case you change your mind
and want to keep studying.

31
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,480
Stay here with Omar.
Don't worry about me.

32
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,160
-I'll think of something.
-Where'd this guy come from?

33
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,080
Discipline.

34
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,640
Excellence.

35
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Merit.

36
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,200
You might be wondering why a CEO
is running a school like this.

37
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,880
It's very simple.

38
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,320
When a family member isn't doing well,

39
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,920
the father comes running to the rescue.

40
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,840
And I'm sure we can all agree that…

41
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,560
for the last two years,
Las Encinas has not been doing so well.

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,600
Thank you for honoring us
with your attention.

43
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,440
-Shit. Sorry. It's just--
-No excuses.

44
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,200
I hate excuses.

45
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,960
I'll give you some advice as a friend.
Actually, this goes for everyone.

46
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,160
Don't waste your time on excuses.

47
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,960
Spend it… on these three words.

48
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,800
Discipline, excellence, merit.

49
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,160
Welcome to this new era at Las Encinas.

50
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,360
Great race.

51
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,280
-Great opponent.
-I gave it my all.

52
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,760
Had I known you better,
I would have figured out your strategy.

53
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,320
I have no strategy. I just go all out.

54
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,920
Well… maybe that's your secret.

55
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,560
Not thinking so much and going all out.

56
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,440
Nice to meet you.

57
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,040
I'm Ari.

58
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,960
Guzmán. Welcome.

59
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,680
Thanks.

60
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,360
Hey.

61
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
Were you at the new principal's talk?

62
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,520
Yes.

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,160
Don't you think he was trying to act cool,
but he's really fake and full of shit?

64
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,720
He's not a fake. He really is cool.

65
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,560
Sure. Why?

66
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,760
He's my father.

67
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,520
No fucking way.

68
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
See you.

69
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,600
Bye, Ari.

70
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,240
Hey.

71
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,000
How are you?

72
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,920
Quit staring.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,120
I wasn't checking out your package.
I was looking at your scar.

74
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,480
Was it serious?

75
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,080
It was.

76
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,640
Shit, what happened?

77
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,760
Car crash.

78
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,120
What about you?

79
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,320
Leukemia.

80
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,000
I almost didn't make it.

81
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,520
I was bedridden for two years
and needed to learn how to walk again.

82
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,920
They didn't think I'd survive.
By some miracle, it went into remission.

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,520
-But it could come back.
-Fine, you win.

84
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,040
You've got a nice package, by the way.

85
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,200
Since I was looking at your scar…

86
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,480
Sorry.
Didn't mean to make you feel awkward.

87
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,440
No worries.

88
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,040
Nice, too.

89
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,520
Whenever I find a nice, hot guy,
he's always straight.

90
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,920
Not always.

91
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,000
You've got a nice ass.

92
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,080
Since I was looking at your scar…

93
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,600
I just arrived from London,
so I'm a bit lost.

94
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm here to help.

95
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,360
All right. Take me out
to see the gay scene in Madrid tonight.

96
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,080
I don't know many gay bars.

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,080
Are you serious?

98
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,440
Hello, handsome.

99
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,040
This is Patrick.
He just arrived from London.

100
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,920
He's in our class as of today.

101
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,920
Omar, my boyfriend.

102
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,720
Nice to meet you.

103
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,640
Give him two kisses.

104
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,080
Sure.

105
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,800
What, did they kick you out
for being European?

106
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,360
No. My dad's the new school principal.

107
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,440
Omar Shanaa?

108
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,960
Could you come to my office, please?

109
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,400
Coexistence in this school

110
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,880
must be based on honesty.

111
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,320
We all need to be honest.

112
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,880
The principal, the students, everyone.

113
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,760
Do you agree?

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,040
So let's be honest.

115
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,560
Shanaa.

116
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,160
Do you deserve a scholarship?

117
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,840
-Of course he does.
-Don't interrupt.

118
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,080
My sister was here on a scholarship.

119
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,520
A brilliant record.

120
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,520
Your sister, I mean.

121
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,640
She did deserve to be here.

122
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,520
-Do you think you do too?
-I guess Azucena saw something in me.

123
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,200
Can you say what exactly?

124
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,840
Since you failed at a public school,

125
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,840
I guess it wasn't
your academic excellence.

126
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,840
I had to take care of my boyfriend.
He was sick, you know?

127
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,040
He had leukemia.
I had to take care of him 24-7, and--

128
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,600
Yes, I'm aware.

129
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,880
And… I really think
what you did is admirable, but…

130
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,120
we need to understand that
when we're talking about scholarships,

131
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,120
we're dealing with academic achievement,
not personal circumstances.

132
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,680
Do we understand that? Good.

133
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,480
García, what about you?

134
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,800
I have a B average.

135
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,280
But you were expelled
due to serious misconduct.

136
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,480
Yes,
but those were personal circumstances,

137
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,640
and we're only assessing
academic achievement here, right?

138
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,760
Since I want to ensure
there is no preferential treatment,

139
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,000
you will have to take an assessment test,

140
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,400
covering last year's material
so you can prove that you deserve

141
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,440
the privilege of a scholarship here.

142
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,920
Preferential treatment?
Privilege? That is--

143
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,960
-I didn't study here last year.
-That'll be all. Thank you.

144
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,000
I love your vibe.

145
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,080
If you don't mind me saying it.

146
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,640
Thanks. I don't know what vibe
you mean, but you can say it.

147
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,640
I mean, your attitude,
your expression, the way you walk.

148
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,920
All of you, basically.

149
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,680
Shit, you just looked me up and down,
didn't you?

150
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,720
My name's Rebeka, with a k.

151
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,440
I let cool people call me Rebe.

152
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,800
Okay, Rebe.

153
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,840
Mencía. Nice to meet you.

154
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,600
My pleasure.

155
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,840
Dude, I'm sorry if you're mad.

156
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,680
But what my dad did isn't my fault.

157
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,240
It's not my fault I'm mad about it.

158
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,400
I know about your friends, and it sucks.
And about your mom.

159
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,320
-But this school needed--
-What?

160
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,520
I mean, I'm not saying your mom
or Omar dealt drugs or killed anyone.

161
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,480
As far as I know.

162
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,840
But if someone like my dad had been here
to be a bit more on top of things…

163
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,440
Did you come to apologize
or to bust my balls?

164
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,120
Patrick, chill out.

165
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,760
First he flirts with me in the shower,
and then he acts like a badass macho man.

166
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,880
Ander, stop it.

167
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,560
You thought I was flirting?
You don't have a fucking clue.

168
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,920
You and your dad can go fuck yourselves.

169
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,880
Go on!

170
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,320
Let's go.

171
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,440
Patrick.

172
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,080
What's his deal?

173
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,640
Okay, let's see if I got this right.

174
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,880
Swimmer Barbie and Sauna Ken

175
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,640
are the new principal's kids.

176
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,520
And you're new here too, right?

177
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,520
Look, if it's any consolation,
I feel exactly the same way about my dad

178
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,680
and my siblings.

179
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,280
No. It's no consolation.

180
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,560
Good luck, beautiful.

181
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,160
So are you gonna start talking
to me again today?

182
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,520
I guess not.

183
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,160
I see.

184
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,880
It's always the same with you, Dad.

185
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
You go somewhere new,
and you act like a fucking steamroller.

186
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,680
-Language.
-Sorry. Like a steamroller.

187
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,960
And in the end,
everyone winds up hating us.

188
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,560
Could you define "steamroller"?

189
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,320
You fired your predecessor
without warning.

190
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,120
That's what I came here to do.

191
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,040
He didn't warn us
we were leaving London either, did he?

192
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,680
That's what Benjamín does.

193
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,240
Mencía, please.

194
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,800
Ari, I was given the cold shoulder today.
You too.

195
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,280
-You don't always need to take his side.
-Is that true?

196
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,200
No, don't worry.

197
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,320
-I'll order some drinks.
-Sure, I made it all up.

198
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,640
And what's with the exam
to get rid of the scholarship kids?

199
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,280
Sure, you're here to fix things,

200
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,520
but can't you save something
for next week?

201
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,240
On your very first morning,
total chaos. Boom, boom--

202
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,280
All right, let's change the subject.
We're celebrating being in Madrid.

203
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,520
-Where's the waiter?
-Dammit, Ari.

204
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,240
Service is so slow in Spain, isn't it?
And it smells weird, like patchouli.

205
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,720
-Ari.
-Patrick.

206
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,000
Dad has a job to do.
We're here to support him.

207
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,680
We're here because the law says so.

208
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,520
If I were 18, I wouldn't be here,
looking at your ugly faces.

209
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,880
We really hit the jackpot with you.

210
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,200
Look, I'm leaving.
I'm done fucking pretending.

211
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,240
-Mencía, sit down.
-Mencía, sit down.

212
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,480
Let her go. The way she's acting up,
it's for the best.

213
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,640
But one thing is true, Dad.

214
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,400
Maybe the exam for the scholarship kids…

215
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,960
Thank goodness.

216
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,720
I mean, maybe you could assess them
on a weekly basis until Christmas.

217
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,840
Will you stay out of my work?

218
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,600
You've got enough to handle with Mencía,
and you're not making progress.

219
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,680
Dad.

220
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,160
Never mind. He's right.

221
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,120
I'm going to the restroom.

222
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
I know, but this is too weird.

223
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,080
Nadia, please, or I'll lose my hard-on.

224
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,000
Nadia, please.

225
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,880
I'm really sorry, Guzmán. But I can't.

226
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,840
Fuck, this is bullshit.
I need to touch you.

227
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,480
What?

228
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,960
How's my brother?

229
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,120
Your brother's fine.

230
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,240
He's adapting. Working and studying.

231
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,240
-You're taking care of him, right?
-Of course I am.

232
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,120
I promised I would, and I am.

233
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,080
You can organize marches,
spray-paint graffiti,

234
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,880
or bend over backwards, but it's useless.

235
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,720
So why exactly did you join the sit-in?

236
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,840
To show you I'm on your side

237
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,160
and to piss off my dad.

238
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
So I'm gonna get kicked out.

239
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,480
Maybe there's a way.

240
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,640
Benjamín has a weakness.

241
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
My sister Ari.

242
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,720
Maybe if you chat her up…

243
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
She's the only one he'd listen to.

244
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,160
All right. Who's gonna chat her up?

245
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,120
You.

246
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,760
Why me?

247
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
What do you mean?

248
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,000
She's a daddy's girl, she's cute,
and she's a bitch. Your fucking type.

249
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,360
No. Ari wouldn't notice a guy like Samuel.
Guzmán's more her type.

250
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,920
Not everyone wants a preppy guy.

251
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,040
Cayetana, go back to your mop, please.

252
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,160
You're friends with the cleaning lady?

253
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,760
As for that story… we'll tell you someday.

254
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,960
How inclusive.

255
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,240
I love it.

256
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,400
And yes, she's right.
Samuel wouldn't catch Ari's attention.

257
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,400
-Damn.
-Guzmán.

258
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,680
Don't drag me into this.

259
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,240
I tried something like this once.
You know how that ended.

260
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,480
You ended up with my sister.

261
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,960
And we're doing just fine, thanks.

262
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,760
You don't need to fall for her.

263
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,560
-Just make her talk to her dad.
-I know, but no.

264
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,720
Help me, Obi Guzmán Kenobi.

265
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,320
You're my only hope.

266
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,480
Please, dude.

267
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,600
What?

268
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,560
Huh?

269
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,240
What?

270
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,640
What do you mean, "what"?

271
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,000
Why are you smiling?

272
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,920
I'm not.

273
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,560
It's just that maybe I dig your vibe too.

274
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,160
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

275
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,800
For taking our side.

276
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,240
Do you have any plans tonight?

277
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,880
You look beautiful too.

278
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,000
Want a drink? I'm parched.

279
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,560
Awesome.

280
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,560
What's the deal with you
and your siblings? Are you triplets?

281
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,160
Patri and Ari are twins.
I'm the youngest. And the smartest.

282
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,800
-I got moved up a year.
-Oh.

283
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,800
Two shots, please.

284
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,600
I didn't picture you as someone
who gets upset over a guy.

285
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,760
I know. I didn't either.

286
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,400
Until one showed up
and fucked me up real bad.

287
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,440
I see. Boys are okay for sex
and for taking the edge off.

288
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,840
But to take things to the next level…

289
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,640
I don't think I know that level.

290
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,320
What's his name?

291
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,720
Huh?

292
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,240
The guy who fucked you up.

293
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,400
Oh… one of the scholarship kids. Samuel.

294
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,160
The short guy?

295
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,480
Believe me,

296
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,920
you forget he's short
when he's naked in bed.

297
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,080
I see.

298
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,200
But that's him.

299
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,920
Well, I'll make sure

300
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,760
I get his name out of your head
and replace it with a new one.

301
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,960
Which one?

302
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,160
Mencía.

303
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,000
You move as fast as a rocket, don't you?

304
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,640
And I really don't want anything
to blow up in my face.

305
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,120
Again.

306
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,680
Got it.

307
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,560
But this was really cool.

308
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,080
Very cool.

309
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,640
In fact, it's been months

310
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,800
since I last went out all night
with someone

311
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,400
and it felt so easy, so relaxed, so good.

312
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,240
That's part of the next level

313
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,120
I was talking about.

314
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,560
I'm leaving, okay?

315
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,840
I'll see you in class in a few hours.

316
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,480
Bye.

317
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,680
Thanks, María.

318
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,840
Where's Mencía?

319
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,600
You never change, Mencía.
What a nightmare.

320
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,280
Were you out all night?

321
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,640
It was a huge mess.

322
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,680
I had to take a classmate to the ER.

323
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,200
I'm beat. I need some sleep.

324
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,000
Dad, I'll deal with her.

325
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,680
Mencía, won't you even try
to come up with a better excuse?

326
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,640
This is none of your business.

327
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,040
Of course it is. You're hurting me too.

328
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,440
Haven't you hurt us all enough already?

329
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,960
Wow, Ari.

330
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,760
-That was really, really low.
-You know I don't--

331
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,000
For the last time, Ari,

332
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,280
leave me alone.

333
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,000
Hi.

334
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,360
I guess you don't like
the protests and sit-ins.

335
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,120
We've learned to support each other here.

336
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,640
-I like to support my own.
-Right.

337
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,840
Why don't we start over?

338
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,800
Taking it
from where we left off after the race.

339
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,440
Wait, when?

340
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,960
When you said my dad
was a liar and a fake?

341
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,960
No, when you said you didn't beat me
because you had to know me better.

342
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,680
And you know what?

343
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,440
Even if you knew me,
you couldn't have won.

344
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,440
But I'm willing to let you
get to know me a bit.

345
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,080
Then we'll see who wins.

346
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,320
How about a drink after school?

347
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,720
Ander, I'm sorry our day ended so badly,

348
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
after such a fucking great start.

349
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,720
Should we go out tonight
and bury the hatchet?

350
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,840
There's a new gay night at Teatro Tutor.

351
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,360
Cool music and hot guys.

352
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,000
Don't worry about your boyfriend.

353
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,480
I'll try and get him
the answers to my dad's exam.

354
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,800
So?

355
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,760
So if you party with him
and suck his dick, he might…

356
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,760
he might get you the answers.

357
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,040
Ander, Mencía made it clear.

358
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,600
Ari is the one to go after.

359
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,120
You don't need to get close to Patrick.

360
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,080
Okay?

361
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,720
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

362
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,160
-What interests me…
-Thanks. What interests you?

363
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,320
What do I need to know to beat you?

364
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,000
-Why are you obsessed with winning?
-Like you're not?

365
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,880
Life made sure
I got my priorities straight.

366
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,800
Well, you sound like a 40-year-old man.

367
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,520
When your sister dies at 16,

368
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,720
and then your best friend dies,
and your girlfriend goes away--

369
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Girlfriend?

370
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,000
That's the only word you heard.
Interesting.

371
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,800
I know what it's like to lose someone
and have your life turned upside down.

372
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,840
You don't look like you've lost much.
What was it you lost? A hamster?

373
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,520
I lost my mom.

374
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,480
I almost lost my brother too.

375
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,440
She died in a car crash.

376
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,920
Sorry. I'm an asshole.

377
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,920
I lost three hamsters.
I'm still getting over it.

378
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,480
Did you bring your girlfriend here too?

379
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,360
I'd rather not talk about the past.

380
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,320
Hey…

381
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,960
How about our class?

382
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,000
Is everyone as cute and kind as you?
Or are you the only one?

383
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,080
Thanks.

384
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,360
They're upset about your father's arrival.

385
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,000
-But if you lighten up, so will they.
-If I lighten up?

386
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,520
Samuel and Omar's exam,
don't you think it's a bit unfair?

387
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,880
Maybe there are other ways
to prove they deserve the scholarship.

388
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,720
Could you talk to your dad about it?

389
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,000
I already hinted at it,
but my dad's really stubborn.

390
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,000
Right.

391
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,320
But maybe I could try again.

392
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
You'd do that?

393
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,440
Thank you so much, Ari.

394
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,880
Thank you, really.

395
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,360
You're welcome.

396
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,480
No…

397
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,600
Would you like to have dinner
with your sister and me?

398
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,520
Again?

399
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,240
What for?

400
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,840
Just to spend some time together
and talk.

401
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,480
It could be good.
It was Patrick's idea.

402
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,680
But he's not coming.

403
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,720
Classic Patrick.
Makes a mess and runs away.

404
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,920
-Are you coming or not?
-No. I already told you, I'll pass.

405
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,120
Listen, I've had enough
of trying to help you.

406
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,960
-I've had enough.
-Dad…

407
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,800
Don't, since you clearly can't handle her.

408
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,920
Now, this is the tone
I expected from you, Benjamín.

409
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,280
It was a bit unnatural for you.

410
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,360
I mean, your Super Dad act.

411
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,200
It wasn't at all convincing.

412
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,680
All right, then.

413
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,760
From now on, you won't have access
to your accounts or my money.

414
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,720
You will only get
what I'm legally required to provide.

415
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
Fine. I'll manage by myself.

416
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,960
Really?

417
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,080
How?
You haven't worked a day in your life.

418
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,560
Mencía, you bring this on yourself.

419
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,560
You don't always need
to be against Dad and the rest of us.

420
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,320
Patrick went out
with some guys from school.

421
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,120
And I--

422
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,520
You went out with Guzmán,
and you're on cloud nine, right?

423
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,440
You're so stupid.

424
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,000
He only met up with you
so you would help with those kids' exam.

425
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,400
It was my idea.

426
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,600
Yes, Ari.

427
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,720
He used you.

428
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,560
He's very much in love with his girlfriend
and wants nothing to do with you.

429
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,840
He just wants you to talk to Benjamín.

430
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,960
Because that's the only thing
people will want you for, Ari.

431
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,480
Or did you think
a guy like Guzmán would be into you?

432
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,880
Have you seen yourself?

433
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,080
Wake up, you moron.

434
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,080
I'M LEAVING HOME RIGHT NOW.

435
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,840
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU.

436
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,680
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU WHERE WE MET LAST NIGHT.

437
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,560
May I?

438
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,720
Thanks.

439
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,080
Can I sit with you?

440
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,520
Look, thanks for the drink,
but I'm fine like this. Alone.

441
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,600
What a way to say it.

442
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,800
Were you stood up?

443
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,320
Fine.

444
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,120
Okay, I'll see you around.

445
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,160
Hey.

446
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,400
I'm sorry.

447
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,640
You don't deserve my shitty attitude.

448
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,000
Sit here if you like.

449
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,800
What's with the bag?

450
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,200
I'm looking for a place
to spend the night.

451
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,960
Oh.

452
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,080
Excuse me.

453
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,040
This is fucking rad.

454
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,880
Welcome to paradise.

455
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,760
What's wrong?

456
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,080
Is it about Mencía?

457
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,000
No. I'm fine.

458
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,320
Benjamín.

459
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,360
Yes, dessert. Would you--?

460
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,360
I'm not here to take your order.
I'm at the bar tonight.

461
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,160
-I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
-Seriously?

462
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,160
I mean, this is too much.

463
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,080
-Were you telling him already?
-Telling me what?

464
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,480
It's about tomorrow's exam, right?
It's all about the stupid exam.

465
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,400
Ari.

466
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,000
He's going to ask you not to test him.

467
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,840
No, if I have to take the exam, I will.

468
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,240
This is about Omar.

469
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,760
Don't test him, please.

470
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,720
-Any dessert, sir?
-Wait a second.

471
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,240
No. We do want dessert.

472
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,600
Dude, come back in two minutes, will you?

473
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,360
Listen, you asked Omar
if he deserved to be at Las Encinas.

474
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,880
Well, I'm telling you he does.
He's a really hardworking guy.

475
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,080
He helps his parents,
his boyfriend, and me.

476
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,200
I'm his best friend, and he lives with me.

477
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,400
He's the only family I have.

478
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,000
He's all I have.

479
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,440
I'm tired of losing people I care about.

480
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,840
-Samuel, what's going on?
-Nothing.

481
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,680
I'm very sorry. I'll take care of this.

482
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,520
-It's nothing, really.
-Your dinner is on the house.

483
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,880
Excuse us.

484
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,840
Go get your stuff. You're fired.

485
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,520
Should I listen to you and not test them?

486
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,240
Assess them in a different way?

487
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,720
No.

488
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,840
Test them tomorrow.

489
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,440
What's that, you devil?

490
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,840
Me, a devil?

491
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,560
I'm an angel.

492
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,760
Angel, my ass.

493
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
What are you doing?

494
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,040
Nothing.

495
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,680
Stop doing nothing so close to me.

496
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,800
I have a boyfriend.

497
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,920
If you're not naked, it isn't cheating.

498
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,960
It isn't?

499
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,800
Here, so you don't come any closer.

500
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,880
Behave yourself…

501
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,840
I'm not doing anything.

502
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,400
And you said you wouldn't flirt
with me even if you got paid for it.

503
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,800
Are you flirting with me?

504
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,400
You aren't.

505
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,080
Well, there you go.

506
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
Wanna know a secret?

507
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,760
It's more dangerous
to say no to me than to say yes.

508
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,880
You're not naked down here,
so it's not cheating.

509
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,520
Stop it, man.

510
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,120
How far would you go to help Omar?

511
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,280
Is it not about that?

512
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,680
Enough. That's it.

513
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,840
I'd do anything to help Omar.

514
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,360
He did the same for me
when I couldn't get out of my bed.

515
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,120
Anything except betray him.

516
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,160
All yours.

517
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,400
Don't worry about your dad or anything.

518
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,120
Whatever you need,
and for as long as you need.

519
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,840
But let's see…

520
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,840
I don't know if--

521
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,400
I have more rooms in my name,
for work reasons.

522
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,560
Meetings, dignitaries, and so on.

523
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,360
Well, fine.

524
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,200
What do you do?

525
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,440
Know when a politician is very powerful,

526
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,720
like a president or a minister?

527
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,680
They don't have that much power, really.
I have the power.

528
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,040
Like Rasputin?

529
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,600
I read a lot and I'm very smart.

530
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,040
I see.

531
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,160
Well, if you need anything
or you get hungry,

532
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,840
call room service
and put it all on my tab, okay?

533
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,520
Thanks.

534
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,360
Are you OK?

535
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:40,960
Yeah. It's just that this room
is too big to sleep in it alone.

536
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,960
Would you sleep here with me?

537
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,880
-Just sleep?
-Yeah.

538
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,880
No.

539
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,840
No?

540
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,800
Come on, get some rest.

541
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
Armando.

542
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,560
Armando, right?

543
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,440
Come on, stay.

544
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,800
Dad, Mencía isn't here.

545
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,920
She'll show up.

546
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,800
But, Dad…

547
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,520
Where can she go with no money?

548
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,720
We're more than used
to her attention-seeking antics.

549
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,520
ARI: 16 MISSED CALLS

550
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,680
EVERYTHING IS OKAY

551
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,560
Shanaa, I'll see you in an hour
for your exam. García too.

552
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,920
Right, so they'll kick me out.

553
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,800
Hi, hotties.

554
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,400
Leave us alone.

555
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,040
You may find this interesting.

556
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,520
The answers?

557
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,800
So you went out together?

558
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,320
You have the answers. That's what matters.

559
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,800
Right.

560
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,600
Is there anything I should know?

561
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,960
No, we just danced.

562
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,320
Didn't we?

563
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,720
-Right.
-I didn't think he'd give them to us.

564
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,960
How do I know they're the right answers?

565
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,160
-Why would I screw you over?
-To get me out of the way?

566
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,560
Look, we had a shitty start.

567
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,400
This is the only way
I have to say I'm sorry.

568
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,040
In order to know if I'm honest,
you just need to use those answers.

569
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,120
LOAD EXAM RESULTS

570
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,040
You got a 73 out of 100.

571
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,520
You passed.

572
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,160
I spoke to your manager,

573
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,520
so you'll get your job back.

574
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,360
I explained to him
you were only trying to help.

575
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,480
Thank you.

576
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,080
But García, let me give you some advice.

577
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,080
Sure.

578
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,440
Stop fighting other people's battles

579
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,960
and focus on your own.

580
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,440
That said, you stated your case
in a concise, direct, and clear way.

581
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,240
And although it was a bit too emotional,
it wasn't a bad move.

582
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,800
You can never have too many students
who have a way with words.

583
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,960
Welcome.

584
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,560
All right.

585
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,400
How do you think you did on your exam?

586
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,480
Fine, I think.

587
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,120
Fine, you think.

588
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,800
You got a 97 out of 100.

589
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,040
Anyone who obtains an almost perfect grade

590
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,480
thinks it was perfect.

591
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,160
You need to be very careless
to cheat and get an almost perfect score.

592
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,200
Yes, well,
very careless or very hardworking.

593
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,560
So I'm staying, right?

594
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,560
-With my scholarship, my uniform--
-That'll be all.

595
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,200
Okay. Have a good day.

596
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,600
What?

597
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,200
What?

598
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,800
-Fucking great, dude!
-What did you get?

599
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,080
A 97.

600
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,800
-What? How?
-What?

601
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,520
And you were so worried!

602
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,640
That's amazing.

603
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,240
Oh my God.

604
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,600
Hey, dude…

605
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,400
Thank you.

606
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,720
I mean it.

607
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,360
It's nothing.

608
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,560
Thank you so much.

609
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,960
-Yes!
-Dude.

610
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,360
-Did you tell your dad?
-No.

611
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,960
So all we did was dance.

612
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,720
Do you actually believe that?

613
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,520
I'm happy for you.

614
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,840
Hi.

615
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,360
Guzmán.

616
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,240
Is this your girlfriend's Instagram?

617
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:56,960
Yes.

618
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,520
I've been chatting with her.
She's so nice.

619
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,080
We're getting along really well.

620
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,920
I told her about our date yesterday
and how we connected. Everything.

621
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,120
On your marks.

622
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,040
Come on.

623
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,440
Ready?

624
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,520
Guzmán, jump in!

625
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,160
I said I only needed to know you
a bit better so I could beat you.

626
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,480
You used a lie with me,
and I used a lie with you.

627
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,440
-You.
-What?

628
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,080
Tell your buddy I didn't talk
to his girl so he can relax.

629
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,480
If either of you two
thought you could fool me, think again.

630
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,080
The girl is alive.

631
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,200
I repeat, the girl is alive.
