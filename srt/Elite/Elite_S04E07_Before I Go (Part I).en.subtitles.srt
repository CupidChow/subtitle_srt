1
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,040
Didn't you say Omar was working late?

2
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,800
So he said.

3
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,560
Shit.

4
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,880
What are you doing?
He won't go to bed for half an hour.

5
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,160
This whole situation stresses me out.

6
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,320
Like I'm not stressed?

7
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,640
I'm the one lying
and doing a juggling act to see you.

8
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,440
Do you think
I don't want to see you during the day?

9
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,760
That I don't wanna have a drink with you
or kiss you when I see you in class?

10
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,320
I don't know.

11
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,680
Would you like that?

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,280
Does it matter?

13
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,640
Have you thought about how I feel
when you make plans with Guzmán

14
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,320
and I just get the crumbs?

15
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,640
Oh, so for you, this is just crumbs?

16
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,800
-No, it's not.
-Then what is it?

17
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,080
I don't know. You tell me.

18
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,480
You decide when, you're the one
who comes and goes. It's all you.

19
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,960
Of course it's all me.
I'm the one who says and does everything.

20
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,520
You wait for everyone else
to do things for you.

21
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Like when my dad got you out of the bar.

22
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,560
Why do you bring that up?

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,840
Because you're always waiting
for other people to decide for you.

24
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,160
Wake up, dammit.

25
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,560
You have the all clear.

26
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
So do you.

27
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,680
Time for you to take a stand.

28
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,040
If you can't,
don't expect anything from me.

29
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,600
HOSPITAL

30
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,160
Did you do it, Samuel?

31
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,640
I didn't do anything to Ari.

32
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,640
So

33
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,560
you know who did it?

34
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,080
-Good morning, Benjamín.
-Good morning, Your Highness. Welcome.

35
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,120
-If you would come with me…
-I'll see you later, okay?

36
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,640
ARI, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

37
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,360
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO REACT.

38
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,680
Good morning, Samu.

39
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,560
-Hey, relax, man. Shit.
-Wait.

40
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,800
What? Did you put speed in your coffee?

41
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,320
-No, why?
-Hey, have you seen Ari?

42
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,240
What? What do you mean, have I seen Ari?

43
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
-What's up with you, Samu?
-Huh?

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,400
Text her. Tell her you'll meet her
at the Lake Club tomorrow night.

45
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,280
-Why should I text Ari?
-It's a surprise. Do me a solid.

46
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,000
Say it's about debate team.

47
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,640
-Okay. What should I text her?
-Thanks, man.

48
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,640
Shit.

49
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,240
TOMORROW NIGHT AT THE LAKE CLUB.

50
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,520
-Okay, done.
-She's replying.

51
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
She's texting back.

52
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,960
-Let me see.
-What?

53
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,040
Check it. She just replied.

54
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,720
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THE LAKE CLUB? DEBATE?

55
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,240
Insist.
Say you have to meet outside school.

56
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,520
-Go on, insist.
-Sure, fine.

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,880
I'D RATHER MEET OUTSIDE SCHOOL SO WE CAN
TAKE OUR TIME PREPARING OUR ARGUMENT.

58
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,400
-She's sending a voice message.
-Okay.

59
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,440
Let me see.

60
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,120
-She replied.
-Hang on.

61
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,520
-This voice message is for me!
-It's my phone!

62
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,240
-What?
-Is that all? Is that all you have to say?

63
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,520
As if last night never happened?

64
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,560
Last night?

65
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,040
What happened last night?

66
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,120
Well, I mean…

67
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,920
Let's see… She's talking about the debate.

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,040
We… argued. She wants to apologize.

69
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,000
-I don't get what's up with you.
-Huh?

70
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,560
-But listen.
-What?

71
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,160
Just make sure she shows up. Thanks, man.

72
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,760
Jesus Christ.

73
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,360
You've been MIA since the Ambar gig.

74
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,680
It's not like you were missing me.

75
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,560
-God damn it, Patrick.
-What?

76
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,560
I had an awesome time.

77
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,440
-Thanks.
-I'm glad, man.

78
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,760
I know what that look's about.

79
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,360
Felt that way myself too many times.

80
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,160
I'm an idiot.
I let myself get carried away.

81
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,520
You're not an idiot.

82
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,160
We've all been crazy about someone.

83
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,480
-Or something.
-No.

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,880
Not me.

85
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,520
I always decide who,

86
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,280
how much, and for how long.

87
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,800
That's great.

88
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,120
But Ander is a handful.

89
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,720
When he's with you,
you feel on top of the world.

90
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,040
But if he shuts down or tosses you aside…

91
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,800
Come on, cheer up.

92
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,200
You'll be bugging us again in no time.

93
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,280
Hey, I've been thinking…

94
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,480
maybe it's time for you to leave
Armando's room, huh?

95
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,440
Why? He doesn't mind, does he?

96
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,240
No, but…

97
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,960
I don't know.

98
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,160
I'd just rather not have
anything to do with him anymore.

99
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,160
You know?

100
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,120
See?

101
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,760
I knew it. I knew he left the gig
because you guys fought.

102
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,880
-What'd he do? I'll smash his face in.
-Nothing.

103
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,480
He gets really annoying and intense.

104
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,360
Don't worry, okay?

105
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,480
I guess my mom
won't slam the door in my face.

106
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,840
But if she makes me choose,
I know what I'll do.

107
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,400
I'll live under a bridge if I have to.

108
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,280
Hey.

109
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,280
What if you and I make the most
of our last night in the hotel room?

110
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,880
All right.

111
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,640
If that's okay with you.

112
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,040
-Sure. Of course it is.
-Yeah?

113
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,200
What bridge will you live under?

114
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,640
-I'll build one if I have to.
-Yeah, right.

115
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,120
A school full of girls from good families,

116
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,520
all waiting
for my son to deign to look at them,

117
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,240
and he falls for the janitor?

118
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,920
She wants to be a fashion designer.

119
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,600
She's a very bright and intelligent girl.

120
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,640
I know that sort of intelligence.

121
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,960
I've seen it in all the other
nobodies who are after him.

122
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,720
Cayetana will behave
and stick to the path set for her.

123
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,160
How do you know that?

124
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,080
She has shown unconditional support
for her boyfriends before.

125
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,320
She'll be with him no matter what.

126
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,640
She has everything to gain.

127
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,840
They're mine.

128
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,360
Are you sure?

129
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Yes.

130
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,280
Wow, Phillipe.

131
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,320
These are good. Very good.

132
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,480
A prince who's a designer and straight?

133
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,760
You'd be my favorite mythological creature
if you weren't a predator.

134
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,000
Bye.

135
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,160
These aren't mine.

136
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,240
Whose are they?

137
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,760
Caye, you forgot these.

138
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,040
-Where were they?
-On the printer.

139
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,680
Okay, thanks. Did anyone else see them?

140
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,840
I don't know.

141
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,760
I did.

142
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,240
What? Afraid I'll tell the principal
you're using school equipment

143
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,960
without permission?

144
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,640
No. If you want to snitch on me,
go ahead. I don't care.

145
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,880
They're very good.

146
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,720
Ari thinks so too.

147
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,080
Really?

148
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,240
I thought they were his.

149
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,560
They weren't bad for something
a prince sketched on a whim.

150
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,400
Okay.

151
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,360
What?

152
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,920
He heard your voice message.

153
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,600
-Guzmán?
-Yeah.

154
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,440
Why did you say you wanted to meet?

155
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,920
He wants to surprise you.
He's going to the club tomorrow, not me.

156
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,160
You want me to take a stand,
and I will, but I'll do it for my friend.

157
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,840
I can't keep meeting up in secret
and stabbing him in the back.

158
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,120
It's either Guzmán or me.
Now you take a stand. Make up your mind.

159
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,320
You'll throw a New Year's Eve party.

160
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,280
The media will be there,
and there'll be a photo shoot.

161
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,520
I want you to invite all your friends.

162
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,280
You can bring that girl if you want.

163
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,200
Cayetana.

164
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,960
So, Benjamín has filled you in.

165
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,440
Do you really like her?

166
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Very much.

167
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,520
Have you at least given
other girls a chance?

168
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,680
I don't want other girls.

169
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,880
I want her.

170
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Fine. You'll introduce her formally
at the party.

171
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,840
That's part of your campaign
to clean up my image, right?

172
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,680
We're not together right now.

173
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,160
You mean you can't win
your commoner girl back?

174
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,720
Don't call her that.

175
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,600
Do you want her back or not?

176
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,520
Yes, Mom.

177
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,640
Well then, do what you need to do.

178
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,440
What's happened to you here in Madrid?
I don't recognize you anymore.

179
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,160
What's this about?

180
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,920
I'm visiting a friend.

181
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,320
I'm not very busy.

182
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,000
Want a Mahou?

183
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,880
Sure. In the room with the fireplace,
where it's quieter, okay?

184
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,040
Guys, we have a guest.

185
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,720
This is Armando,

186
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,680
former Las Encinas student
and alumni association president.

187
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,720
He's here to make their very generous
annual contribution to the school,

188
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,360
and he wanted to meet you.

189
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,120
Oh, but we already know him.

190
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,600
Isn't he your friend from the gig?

191
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,080
-Yeah.
-Oh.

192
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,080
-Are you friends?
-We've run into each other at bars.

193
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,440
Yeah. How are you?

194
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
-Hi.
-How are you?

195
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,280
Yeah, Patrick and I get along well.

196
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,800
And no, it's none of your business.

197
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,120
I don't know
if you wanna take things further.

198
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,000
It's not like I care, to be honest.

199
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,280
Honestly, I'm not planning on it,
but thanks for your indifference.

200
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,880
If I didn't know you,
I'd say you're a bit jealous.

201
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
What the hell?

202
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,680
I do know you,
and I'd say you're very jealous.

203
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,120
I'm not jealous. I'm concerned.

204
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,520
Excuse me?

205
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,000
Omar, Patrick approaching you
two seconds after being mad at me…

206
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,360
I don't know.

207
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,360
I was the one who approached Patrick.

208
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,800
You left him a wreck.

209
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,560
It's not my fault if he gets too attached.

210
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,760
Come on.
It's partly your fault, if we're honest.

211
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,640
Patrick is intense, but he's not stupid.

212
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,640
Omar, I'm just asking you
not to get your hopes up.

213
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,800
You're into him,
but he just wants to get even.

214
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,720
Omar!

215
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,560
So he hit on you
because he was drooling over you,

216
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,960
but he's using me for an ego boost?

217
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,680
You've got some balls.

218
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,760
I'm just worried about you.

219
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,200
You have some nerve, going through life,
making unilateral decisions

220
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,480
but getting upset when people try
to get over the damage you do.

221
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,520
I'm not upset.

222
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,800
You're a dog in the manger, Ander.

223
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,800
You don't want to be with Patrick or me,

224
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,400
but you're not happy
if we move on without you.

225
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,640
If I'm just a friend,

226
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,920
and Patrick was just a hookup,
why don't you let us do our own thing?

227
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,480
You should go. I have to work.

228
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
There have always been rules.

229
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,160
You tell me they are stricter now.

230
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,360
I say they were stricter in my day.

231
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,800
People before me would say
they were stricter then.

232
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,640
And so on, ad infinitum.

233
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,040
I doubt that when you went to Las Encinas,
it was such a… bunker.

234
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,560
It was all very regimented, believe me.

235
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,880
Skipping class was a balancing act.

236
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,640
Things were more relaxed
under the previous principal,

237
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,280
but my dad
is getting things back on track, right?

238
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,440
If you'll excuse me for a second.

239
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,080
Sure.

240
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,800
Mencía.

241
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,560
Yes?

242
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,880
Are you okay?

243
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,840
I'm great, Benjamín. Why do you ask?

244
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,640
-Weren't you a vegetarian?
-I'm not making anything up.

245
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,600
Everything.

246
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,160
I'm going to the bathroom.

247
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,120
What's gotten into her now?

248
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,160
-What the hell are you doing in my house?
-Your dad invited me to lunch.

249
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,120
No, I mean before that.
Why did you come to my fucking house?

250
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,560
To give him the annual donation.

251
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,400
Cut the crap, Armando.

252
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,240
You could have done that
at the school or in a bar.

253
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,160
So why are you in my house?
To screw with me?

254
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,440
To screw with you? Me?

255
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
How so?

256
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,840
You want to blackmail me
so you can keep fucking me, right?

257
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,160
Does it piss you off that much
not to have me whenever you want me?

258
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,400
You can't end a relationship
over a tantrum.

259
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,080
We're not in a relationship.

260
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,880
…the hors d'oeuvres
and bring the entrées, please.

261
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,520
You seem tense since you saw him.

262
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,320
I'm just a tense person.

263
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,120
What's going on here?

264
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,280
Nothing. We're friends.

265
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,240
A minor and an alum three times her age?

266
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,760
We told you. We're drinking buddies.

267
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm going back to the table.

268
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,720
Honey.

269
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,560
What?

270
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,920
I know communication between us is…

271
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,440
nonexistent.

272
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,160
And, when we do talk,
it's a declaration of war, but…

273
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,680
I think you can tell that…

274
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,000
even if I don't say it…

275
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,880
Well, more than tell, you know

276
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,240
that if something's wrong, you're worried
about something, or you have any problems,

277
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,760
you can tell me.

278
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,360
And with a phone call,

279
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,680
I can get rid of

280
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,760
whatever is bothering you.

281
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,960
That goes for you and your siblings.

282
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,920
Good to know.

283
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,800
If I need to make that call,
I'll let you know.

284
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,320
Okay?

285
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,760
I've rambled on enough.
It's your turn now.

286
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,560
What are your plans
when you finish school?

287
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,960
You'll have to join us.

288
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,160
I'd love to join the alumni association.

289
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,840
Yes. Armando could introduce us
to his former classmates.

290
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,880
Gotta love boomers.

291
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,880
-You have a one-track mind, Patrick.
-A one-track--

292
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,640
I'll tell my dad everything,
and he'll fuck up your life forever.

293
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Yeah, sure, but…

294
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,520
I want to be part
of an alumni association while…

295
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,640
Everything? Including
what you did for a living when we met?

296
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,120
Accept it. I own you.

297
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,440
You're so annoying.

298
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,000
How's it going, Armando?

299
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,600
-I hope everything's to your liking.
-It's all perfect, Benjamín. Thank you.

300
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,480
How are my kids treating you?

301
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,880
You seem to have really hit it off.

302
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,920
Your kids are charming.

303
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,080
A toast.

304
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,520
-Of course.
-Oh, sure.

305
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,320
-Not with water. It's bad luck.
-Not water.

306
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,680
Well, water's what you're getting.

307
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,400
ARMANDO: I WANT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT

308
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,920
REBEKA: WHAT TIME
SHOULD WE GO TO THE HOTEL?

309
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,840
I'M SORRY, REBE. I CAN'T GO.

310
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,840
MENCÍA
I'M SORRY, REBE. I CAN'T GO.

311
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,600
Hello?

312
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,240
-Hi.
-Hi.

313
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,560
Can I come in?

314
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,160
Sure. Come in.

315
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,080
I just…

316
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,280
My mom decided to spend Christmas
here with me.

317
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,920
And since
she can't have an empty schedule,

318
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,040
she's arranged
a meetup with young entrepreneurs

319
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,000
to strengthen business ties, you know.

320
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,000
That's great. Yay.

321
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,840
I told her to invite our seed designer.

322
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,880
Sadelagu?

323
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,280
So… Wow.
Sadelagu is going to be at the party?

324
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,760
-Yes.
-Oh.

325
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,960
I don't know. I thought that…
maybe you'd like to come and meet him,

326
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,640
show him your designs.

327
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,280
You're kidding me.

328
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,640
No.

329
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,680
You've got talent, Caye.

330
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,520
Thank you.

331
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,160
-I don't know what to say.
-You don't have to say anything.

332
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,000
Seriously, thank you so much.

333
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,920
So you're coming?

334
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,640
Hello. Good evening.

335
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,080
Cayetana Grajera.

336
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,320
Thanks.

337
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,560
I guess I'll leave you to it.

338
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Where is your father?

339
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,440
Over there, shaking hands.

340
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,560
Hi.

341
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,240
Christian Dior?

342
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,280
Grajera Pando.

343
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,040
-Wow.
-Yeah.

344
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,520
I never thought I'd meet Sadelagu
in such a solemn setting.

345
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,560
Dreams come true wearing charcoal gray
and holding a tumbler.

346
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,800
Look.

347
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,080
-Is that him?
-Yes.

348
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,080
-Seriously?
-I'll go get him, okay?

349
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,120
Okay.

350
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Oh…

351
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,840
You'll walk into the lion's den
to get what you want.

352
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,520
I didn't ask him to invite me.

353
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,840
Sure. And leaving your designs
where he could see them,

354
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,080
was that a coincidence?

355
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,920
Yeah, Ari. A coincidence.

356
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,480
You sure got over
your doubts about him quick.

357
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,480
You're no idiot,

358
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,640
but you are stupid.

359
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,400
And a climber.

360
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,280
You're a stupid climber.

361
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,560
-Oh shit.
-What are you doing here?

362
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,960
Would you excuse us?

363
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,200
So, do you like it?

364
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,760
It's delicious.
I've never tried it before.

365
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,520
So… it was fashion.

366
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,040
-Fashion brought you two together, right?
-Yes.

367
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,400
And our admiration for you, sir.
Didn't mean to call you sir. Sorry.

368
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,960
I can't help it.

369
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,640
Meeting you is a dream come true.

370
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,280
Put it on my tab. Room 973.

371
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,840
It's on me.

372
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,480
Excuse me.

373
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,400
Do you have five minutes?
I'd like to show you a few sketches.

374
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,160
Sure.

375
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,920
-Really?
-I have all the time in the world for you.

376
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,920
Although I'd rather see them in my room.

377
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,240
It's more comfortable, quieter.

378
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
What do you say?

379
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,040
What are you doing with him?

380
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,600
Rebe, I'll explain later.

381
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,120
What do you mean, later?

382
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,520
Is this your way
of telling me you're done with him?

383
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,640
Mencía.

384
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,640
Please leave.

385
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,600
Come.

386
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,920
Coming up?

387
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,880
-Like hell I'm leaving.
-Mencía, come on now.

388
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,840
Mencía, what's wrong?

389
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,880
I'd rather send my designs
to your workshop,

390
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,640
and we'll talk whenever you can.

391
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,480
Guys!

392
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,120
The New Year's Eve party invitations.

393
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,600
I'm so excited
to start the new year with you.

394
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,960
Samu.

395
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,160
I don't get it, Mencía.

396
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,720
You were done with him that morning,
and I catch you together that night?

397
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,720
That's me. Fickle and impulsive.

398
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,720
Ander.

399
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,680
Maybe it's true that you and I
only got together to erase him.

400
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,160
Then let's erase him.

401
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,120
What?

402
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,400
Your invitations, guys.

403
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,920
I WANT TO START THE YEAR WITH YOU.
PHILLIPE

404
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,920
How much do you charge, Cayetana?
For designing a dress, not mopping.

405
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,680
I want a dress for New Year's Eve,
and I'd like to look spectacular.

406
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,920
I'd need to work it out.

407
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,960
Two thousand? Not including materials.

408
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,600
What's this about?

409
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,480
You have talent.

410
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,680
And self-respect.

411
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,240
The money is tax-deductible
as a charity donation, right?

412
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,800
I can't with you, honestly.

413
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,680
I want your talent, not your friendship.
Will you do it or not?

414
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,040
-I'll work on ideas and get back to you.
-You have three days.

415
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,280
Two are enough.

416
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,200
Oh, and I want a 10% bonus
for every 500 likes.

417
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,160
Five percent.

418
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,680
-No.
-Omar.

419
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
-I said no.
-Yes!

420
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,680
Come on.

421
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,280
No. We're not having sex here.
No way, okay?

422
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,720
No, it's a spell to exorcise him.

423
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,560
A spell, my ass.

424
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,880
Ander?

425
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,120
Ander who?

426
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,520
Have you forgotten him or not?

427
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,120
Well…

428
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,400
Give it time.

429
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,080
I assure you, Ander can be erased.

430
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,960
Babe…

431
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,720
Do you know one of the thousand things
you and I have in common?

432
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,080
It doesn't matter if the people we love
hurt us again and again and again.

433
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,160
We stand by them.

434
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,160
We keep getting punched in the gut,
and we keep taking it. Bam!

435
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,160
For our loved ones,
we'll do whatever it takes.

436
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,240
Whatever it takes.

437
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,280
And you know what we don't have in common?

438
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,680
I'm the sort of person who waits for them

439
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,880
to learn the hard way and come back
with their tail between their legs.

440
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,640
But you're not.

441
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,240
You're incapable of just standing by
if you think they'll get hurt.

442
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,480
You don't stop, and you don't give up.

443
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,480
And I really like that about you.

444
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,520
Maybe you're a better version of me.

445
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,920
Just maybe, okay?

446
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,600
Come here.

447
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,840
Come in.

448
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,920
So you're classmates?

449
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,840
Yeah, we're in the same class.

450
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,800
-I'm Patrick.
-Great.

451
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,000
Is he home?

452
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,280
-Yes, I'll go get him.
-Okay. Thanks.

453
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,840
Hey, handsome.

454
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,640
Patrick?

455
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,480
Patrick, I think you butt-dialed me.

456
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,200
Honey, your friend Patrick
is here to see you.

457
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,840
Patrick?

458
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,720
Yeah, he's downstairs.

459
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,680
What's all this?

460
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,440
We'll talk about it later.

461
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,680
Hey, Ander. How are you?

462
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,480
What the hell?

463
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,840
Do you have a minute to talk?

464
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,280
Ander, you don't get it.

465
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,720
You think the world revolves around you,
and it doesn't.

466
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,480
I'm with Omar because I really like him.
I'm serious about him.

467
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,080
And if that annoys you,
maybe you're the one who's stuck.

468
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,040
I'm happy you guys are together,

469
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,880
as long as you don't hurt him.

470
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,120
Omar isn't like me.

471
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,040
I know. That's why I like him.

472
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,120
I mean, you could really hurt him
because he has feelings for you.

473
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,800
And I hope you do too.

474
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,640
He's not just some fling.

475
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,240
Unlike me, huh?

476
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,960
You just used me

477
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,200
to get over Omar
with meaningless sex and hooking up.

478
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,440
Don't worry. I'm not like you.

479
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,560
I hope I can make him feel
half as good as he makes me feel.

480
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,240
Look, man. I'm sorry if I hurt you, okay?

481
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,960
I thought you knew it was just sex.

482
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,400
It was very clear to me.

483
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,240
I never doubted my feelings for Omar.

484
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,360
In fact, when I got better,

485
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,120
I didn't go backpacking
just so I could be with him.

486
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,320
I've always loved him.

487
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,200
And I always will.

488
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,480
So don't play games with him,
don't use him,

489
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,680
and, above all,

490
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,200
don't you dare hurt him.

491
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,720
No worries.

492
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,280
Answer your messages.

493
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,560
I'll get out of the way forever.
I promise.

494
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,040
Fuck!

495
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,720
Why the long face?

496
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,480
It's nothing.

497
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,160
When will you let me know what's going on?

498
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,000
I can't stand it
when you get so closed off.

499
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,640
BEFORE I GO: MOM, GUZMÁN, OMAR

500
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,600
Thank you.

501
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,720
-So?
-It's good.

502
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,960
You were against it
because it's not French.

503
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,360
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

504
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,360
It's great.
You should have it at your party.

505
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,600
There's something else
I'd like to have at the party.

506
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,000
Or rather, someone else.

507
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,560
I'd love for you to come.

508
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,480
I will.

509
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,040
Yes, but… I mean, with me.

510
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,320
Sounds like a couple thing.

511
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,720
Yes.

512
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,200
It is.

513
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,760
But you and I are just friends.

514
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,320
Friends who are exes.

515
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,960
Sometimes, exes…

516
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,040
get back together for Christmas.

517
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,080
Don't tell me
you haven't thought about it.

518
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,400
I haven't.

519
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Something great just happened.
That's all I'm thinking about.

520
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,520
Well, I'd love it
if you shared it with me.

521
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,600
I am sharing it.

522
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,040
Aren't things okay the way they are?

523
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,920
Yeah, sure.

524
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,080
You could change your mind, you know?

525
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,680
We're only kissing.

526
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,360
And I don't even know why.

527
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,080
Look, it's better if… Damn.

528
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,520
Enough.

529
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,920
Wait.

530
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,120
Stop it.

531
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,640
What?

532
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,760
It's better if we don't.

533
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,800
Why not?

534
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,880
We're better as friends.
You sit there. I'll sit here.

535
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,160
Caye, I'm more certain than ever.

536
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,800
Yeah, and so am I.

537
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,920
I don't see you as an idol anymore.
I don't have to swoon over you.

538
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,320
What if the idol swoons over you?

539
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,440
Seriously, no.

540
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,040
I think it's best if we're just friends.

541
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,680
Phillipe, stop.

542
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,880
Stop it.

543
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,400
Hey, seriously. Stop it.

544
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,160
You love having power over me.

545
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,040
-What?
-You all do.

546
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,160
What do you mean? Stop it.

547
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,880
Stop, Phillipe. Let go of me.

548
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,520
I don't want to.
Let me go. Seriously, Phillipe.

549
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,560
Please, get off me!

550
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,480
No, Phillipe! I don't want to! Get off me!

551
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,840
Shit.

552
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,440
Cayetana!

553
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,600
My girlfriend's here.
Hi. Sorry I'm late for my surprise.

554
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,760
The entrance was blocked.
Who does garden pruning in December?

555
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,400
Weren't expecting me, huh?

556
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,160
Thanks.

557
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,840
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

558
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,640
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

559
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,080
Good. What's with the spare plate?

560
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,480
I'll ask them to take it away.

561
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,760
-Aren't you working today?
-Didn't you cancel?

562
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,800
Cancel what?

563
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,240
Samuel, sit down.

564
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,240
What do you mean, "sit down"?

565
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,680
Ari, what the hell is this?

566
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,680
Guzmán…

567
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,920
Samuel and I have been seeing each other.

568
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,400
What do you mean, "seeing"?

569
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,680
Did Guzmán do it or not?

570
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,040
Samuel.

571
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,240
Are you listening to me?

572
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,320
I'm sorry about this,

573
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,240
but I believe what I have with Samuel
isn't just a fling.

574
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,040
Samuel, I'm in love with you.

575
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,240
And I don't want to leave you.

576
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,200
But I'm in love with you too.

577
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,640
Guzmán, look at me.

578
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,320
I don't want to leave you either.

579
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,720
Look at me.

580
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,120
Right now, you must think I'm crazy.

581
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,520
But I think

582
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:44,040
I would be crazy
if I were to give up either of you.

583
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,600
