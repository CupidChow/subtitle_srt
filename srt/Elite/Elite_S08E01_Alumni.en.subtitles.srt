1
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,840
Hey, everyone! Good evening!

2
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,560
I'd like to propose a toast
to the senior class.

3
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,280
A toast to our freedom
to do whatever the hell we want to do.

4
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,000
And more importantly, a toast to leaving
this fucking school once and for all!

5
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,080
Girl, are you gonna puke?

6
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,040
Come on.

7
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,640
You're gonna make me trip.

8
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,360
What the hell did you eat? It's all pink.

9
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,240
Aren't you a bit old
to still be in Las Encinas?

10
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,000
I could've picked up your last paycheck
and saved you the trouble of coming back.

11
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,280
Why are you here?

12
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,400
Do Mom and Dad know?

13
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,080
Yeah. I called Dad. He said you'd be here.

14
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,120
Since you hate this place,
I came to keep you company.

15
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,400
And to check out if it had changed.

16
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,040
I can see that.

17
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,640
That's new, though.

18
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,520
I have no clue what that is.

19
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,280
That's the Alumni logo.

20
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,400
What?

21
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,160
Senior students,
with Virginia's permission,

22
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,800
next period will be dedicated

23
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,240
to getting to know Alumni,
our new and improved alumni association.

24
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,680
Attendance is not mandatory,
but it is highly recommended.

25
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,520
So there'll be a roll call.

26
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,520
This is my brother, Héctor.
And I'm Emilia. We'll be waiting.

27
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,320
-Hurry up, or you'll be late.
-What on earth?

28
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,080
I used to be a student here.
Why don't I know about Alumni?

29
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,360
Well, because scholarship students
aren't allowed in.

30
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,800
Why do you know about it?

31
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,080
Lu pulled some strings
and managed to get me in.

32
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,720
The contacts they have are incredible.

33
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,000
Alumni got me my internship at the UN.

34
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,480
Despite those two.

35
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,080
A scholarship student like me

36
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,000
was not the ideal representative
for Las Encinas abroad.

37
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,320
They tried to stop me any way they could.

38
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,720
Those two are bad news.

39
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,520
Stay away from them.

40
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,960
Did you really need
to refurbish a whole wing?

41
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,840
You said you were only going
to buy new furniture.

42
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,400
Well, Alumni needs
a suitable space for its new activities.

43
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,840
What new activities?

44
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,840
You're being contrary, Virginia.

45
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,160
I just don't understand
why you need a social club

46
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,360
when I can manage Alumni
from a folder on my computer with a--

47
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,360
That's one of the reasons
you won't be in charge any longer.

48
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,720
What?

49
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,680
Also, this whole thing is a donation
from our parents to Las Encinas.

50
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,320
Get yourself as worked up as you like,
but you have no say in this.

51
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,120
As if she ever did.

52
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,320
Hey… You want to say something?

53
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,760
I'll get my parents on speakerphone
so they can hear what you have to say.

54
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,880
Looks pretty cool, right?

55
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,120
Super appealing.

56
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,560
Beautiful.

57
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Well, Virginia.
Excuse us, but you have to go.

58
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,200
The seniors
are coming to check the place out.

59
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,880
They're gonna feel uncomfortable
with you here.

60
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,080
Should I show you out?

61
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,760
That won't be necessary. Thank you.

62
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,120
We need to make it clear to her
that no one comes here uninvited.

63
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,480
Not her, not anyone.

64
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,160
I'm the president of Alumni.

65
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,800
Totally renovated.

66
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,280
Totally renovated.

67
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,760
And she's my sister, the vice president.

68
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,360
Very soon, the academic year will be over.

69
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,480
You will hopefully be graduating
and leaving Las Encinas.

70
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,800
But neither the school
nor we want you to say "Goodbye,"

71
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,720
but, "When are we meeting next?"

72
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,920
We've made a huge effort
and spent a lot of money--

73
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,080
Alumni was worth it.

74
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,480
Alumni was worth it.

75
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,440
We've invested a lot in creating a space

76
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,600
where we can relax, be ourselves,

77
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,120
and comfortably spend our free time

78
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,560
with like-minded people,
do some networking…

79
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,720
This is a unique space
where only a select few can enter.

80
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,600
And right now,
we're recruiting new members.

81
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,480
The pillars of Las Encinas are
discipline, excellence, and merit.

82
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,720
Our pillars are
pleasure, freedom, and contacts.

83
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,240
If you want to make it in,
you need someone to sponsor you

84
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,080
and see if you are Alumni material.

85
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,720
Only one candidate per sponsor.

86
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,360
So start looking for one now.

87
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,400
And remember, we want Las Encinas…

88
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,800
We want Las Encinas
to be part of your lives forever.

89
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,600
"Part of our lives."

90
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,040
No way in hell
do I want Las Encinas in my life.

91
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,360
The last thing I need is
to join a club run by two arrogant jerks

92
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,160
when all I wanna do is leave this school

93
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,600
and never set foot here again.

94
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,960
We all want that.

95
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,960
I'll be sad to leave.

96
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,240
You won't be as soon as you're gone.
Take my word for it.

97
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,680
Hello!

98
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,600
Hi!

99
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
-How are you?
-Good, and you?

100
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,360
Damn! What's with those two?
Are they together?

101
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,320
Looks like it.

102
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,680
You regret letting her go, right?

103
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,080
If you hadn't toyed with her
and been so indecisive…

104
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,440
You're telling me, after you--

105
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,840
After I what?

106
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,280
Come with me. Let's talk.

107
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,600
About what? Sonia?

108
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,720
For God's sake, Nico. Let it go. No.

109
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,080
Can I borrow her for a sec?

110
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,960
-Think you'll survive without her?
-No…

111
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,360
-I'm not sure.
-Me neither.

112
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
Yes, you will. Come on.

113
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,000
No…

114
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,120
Stop freaking out
about your papers already.

115
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,480
Says the rich, white, Spanish girl.

116
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,240
Hey, I'm not shutting you down.

117
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,680
I just want you to stop worrying
about the same thing all day long.

118
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,760
One, that won't get you the papers.

119
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,120
And two, you'll end up getting an ulcer.

120
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,280
-What if we got married?
-What?

121
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,320
Just for the papers. I'm not that stupid.

122
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,080
It's not like in the movies,

123
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,320
where you sign,
and suddenly, you're Spanish.

124
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,240
Sorry.

125
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,920
Sorry to interrupt
whatever you were doing.

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,160
I forgot

127
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,760
you study here.

128
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,440
Do we know each other?

129
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,840
I know you.

130
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,480
From Instagram.

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,800
I hadn't associated you with Las Encinas.

132
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,400
When I saw you at Alumni,

133
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,240
I was shocked.

134
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,520
Oh, right. Okay.

135
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,480
Pleased to meet you. What do you want?

136
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,720
Don't be defensive.
I'm just being friendly.

137
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,800
While half naked?
I'm not so sure about that.

138
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,800
Literally, I'm half naked.

139
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
From here…

140
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,320
to here.

141
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Seriously,  I'd like to sponsor you
to join Alumni.

142
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,720
Huh… what?

143
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,960
Well, all candidates
need someone to vouch for them.

144
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
What better sponsor than the president?

145
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,240
Right. Okay.

146
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,960
But first, I'd need
to be interested in joining, right?

147
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,200
Of course you are.

148
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,240
-I hadn't thought about it.
-Why wouldn't you want to join?

149
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,200
Tell me.

150
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,440
It's not a place for people like me.

151
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,600
People like you.

152
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,080
I mean, it's not a place for me.

153
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,520
I think you're the perfect fit.

154
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,120
Wanna shower?

155
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,760
I mean, it's hot in here…

156
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,720
What are you doing?

157
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,560
You can watch.

158
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
I like that.

159
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,440
What does the tattoo mean?

160
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,360
It's a university thing.

161
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,080
Stop by the club, okay?

162
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,320
I'll show you around.
You can get to know us first.

163
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,400
VIDEO CALL

164
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,040
INCOMING VIDEO CALL

165
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,160
I can't believe it, man.

166
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,520
-Are you--
-For real, Chloe. Think about it.

167
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,160
Can you hear yourself?
What kind of favor is that?

168
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,880
No, I'm not gonna leave Eric.
Why would I? We're doing great.

169
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,120
You can't give him the stability he needs.

170
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,440
-Excuse me? How do you know that?
-Chloe…

171
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,480
They want us at the police station.

172
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
We'll talk later.

173
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,080
Mom?

174
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,640
Your phone was off. What was I to do?

175
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,480
Her story can't be that convincing
if the cops keep questioning her.

176
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,600
WHAT HAPPENED, SARA?

177
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,800
YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED?

178
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,480
What do I think happened?
I don't think. I know.

179
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,920
Chloe pushed Raúl over
the edge, literally or psychologically.

180
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,480
I don't care. It was her.

181
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,760
Do I have evidence? I don't, honey.

182
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,120
If I had any, she'd be locked up.

183
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,040
I have no proof,
but I have no doubts either.

184
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,400
I know someone must have seen something.

185
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,160
So please, if you're watching this video
and you saw anything,

186
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,560
whatever it was,

187
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,280
please come forward.

188
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,520
How many times will they question us?
They're coming for us.

189
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,320
-We'll leave the country.
-No, not again.

190
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,320
Any options?

191
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,880
So we abandon Iván?

192
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,880
He doesn't want to hear from us.

193
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,720
And I promised him I'd leave, so…

194
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,280
When did you promise that?

195
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,880
I don't know. Before he left.

196
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,640
In exchange for what?

197
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,280
You don't make promises just because.

198
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,120
In exchange for nothing, baby.

199
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,320
If my son doesn't want to see me,
I'll just go.

200
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,200
-To Buenos Aires.
-Then why haven't you gone yet?

201
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,640
I wanted to wait for him to come back
so I could try to approach him again.

202
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,000
That is actually true.

203
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,800
But the whole
"in exchange for nothing" part isn't.

204
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Well…

205
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,560
I don't know why I bother asking.

206
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,920
Baby, listen to me.

207
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,480
Have you ever thought
that this whole thing with your psycho ex

208
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,760
and his record-breaking free fall
is a sign that we should leave?

209
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,360
Look, Mom.

210
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,320
For once, I'm starting to fit in.
I'm doing great with a guy.

211
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,120
You and I are getting along again.
I'm not going.

212
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,200
Talk to Iván's father's lawyer.

213
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,200
-José Luis?
-Ask him to represent us--

214
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,000
Do you know how much he charges?

215
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,720
-Well, fuck him then and get a good deal!
-You…

216
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,880
Hey!

217
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,120
I asked the Lake Club for references,

218
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,640
and they only had good things
to say about you.

219
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,360
I'd be proud to have you
as my bar manager.

220
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,600
Not much pride in the salary.

221
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,920
I'll give you a raise. I promise.

222
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,440
And in the meantime?

223
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,680
The exposure will be pay enough.

224
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,000
Right. The same old story.

225
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,600
Come in tomorrow?

226
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,400
You sure do exploit the needy.

227
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,920
Welcome on board, sir.

228
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,920
If you're not ready,
you don't have to do this just yet.

229
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,200
There's no hurry.

230
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,040
No, I have to get back to my life.

231
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,280
But you don't seem ready to me.

232
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,720
I am ready. Mateo says so.

233
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,640
That therapist of yours isn't…

234
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,080
You just don't like him.

235
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,200
You're such a pain.

236
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,440
Here we go again, father and son.

237
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,160
What?

238
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,040
The four of us.

239
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,360
Together.

240
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,760
Arguing, as usual.

241
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,440
But together.

242
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,440
I'll be flying back
to New York in a few days.

243
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,720
Exactly, darling.
Let me enjoy this moment.

244
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,600
You don't allow me
even one moment of peace.

245
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,160
Oh, Mom.

246
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,520
Let's get Omar's stuff to his room.

247
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,080
Come.

248
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,880
Give it here.

249
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,880
What is it?

250
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Fuck, Omar!

251
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,920
What are you doing here?

252
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,000
Nadia?

253
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,240
Yes. It's nice to meet you in the flesh.

254
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,480
Fuck!

255
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,640
Omar, wait.

256
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,280
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

257
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,240
Omar!

258
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,840
Look, I can't find anything I can afford.

259
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,400
You were with your parents,
so I asked Dalmar.

260
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,400
You didn't ask me about my room?

261
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,400
I thought you and I were cool,
and I didn't want to bother you.

262
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,960
But you didn't think of moving
into Iván's room, did you?

263
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,920
Why here?

264
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,360
Because… it still feels like home.

265
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,760
You guys still feel like home.

266
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,720
Hey, Omar…

267
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,640
Nadia, stay out of this, please.

268
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,640
-Not you.
-Nadia?

269
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,800
-Pleased to meet you, I'm--
-Damn it, Dalmar!

270
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,640
So all this time,
I've been paying for the room,

271
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,440
and you've stayed for free?

272
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,800
Look. Don't worry, okay?

273
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,200
I'll get my stuff and crash on the couch.

274
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,240
You said that before I moved back home.

275
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,760
-I know.
-Yeah, well, forget the sofa. I'm sorry.

276
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,840
Enough, Omar.

277
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,320
-Listen to her.
-Stay out of this, damn it!

278
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,360
Joel, I love you.

279
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,080
I love you very much.

280
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,720
But this is my house.

281
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,760
I need to have calm here.

282
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,560
And having you around

283
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,320
is only going to mess with my head,
my heart,

284
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,960
and all the work
I've been doing for months.

285
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,560
You have to understand.
I need to protect myself.

286
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,520
Okay.

287
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,520
Okay, I'll go.

288
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,200
Come on. Show some empathy, man.

289
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,840
How about a little empathy for me, Dalmar?

290
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,880
Hey, kid. You heard my son.

291
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
Dad.

292
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,960
-Get out of here.
-Yeah, I'll get my stuff and--

293
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,320
No fucking way. This late at night?
You can sleep with me.

294
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,280
There's not much room, but… Look.

295
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,960
Give me a fucking break, Dalmar!

296
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,840
It's my room. I can do whatever I want.
Is there a problem?

297
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,040
You shouldn't have reopened the venue.

298
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,640
It only generates losses.

299
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
That's going to change, Mom.

300
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,320
Why won't you accept
that we're totally bankrupt?

301
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,680
Sell everything,
and let's get away from here.

302
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,120
-I'll get it on its feet again. Trust me.
-Yeah? How?

303
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,120
With your extensive training in finance?

304
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,600
Your revolutionary business ideas?

305
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,520
You have no fucking clue.

306
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,960
On top of that, you're too proud
to ever ask me for help or advice.

307
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,920
-I don't know.
-I'll be downstairs.

308
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,800
Fuck! These two?

309
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,200
It's the Krawietz family!

310
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,480
Do you know them?

311
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,920
Yeah, from school.

312
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,720
Well, they used to go there.
But now they run the alumni association.

313
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,640
I see.

314
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,600
What? Are they famous or something?

315
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,720
The Krawietzs?

316
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,720
They're one of the families

317
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,520
that you might say are
de facto owners of this country.

318
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,160
They made their fortune in the '60s,
with help from…

319
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,160
Well, you know.

320
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,480
No, I don't know.

321
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,520
Come on, baby.
This place's version of Videla…

322
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,920
I don't know who you mean.

323
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,520
Come on! Didn't you study the Civil War?

324
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,240
We haven't got that far yet.

325
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,560
That explains a lot.

326
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,360
Let's see, honey.

327
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,960
Voldemort, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,
ruled this country for many years.

328
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,720
During the dictatorship,
several families got rich.

329
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,440
And after he died? They got richer.
Guess who one of those families was.

330
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,440
The Krawietzs.

331
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,360
Exactly.

332
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,520
They own construction companies,
hotels, banks, airlines, investment funds…

333
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,480
Supermarkets, soccer teams,
private highways,

334
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,480
law firms, and you go
and get with some squatter,

335
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,120
when there's a Krawietz around?

336
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,320
Should I sell myself to him
for 100 camels?

337
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,600
A hundred camels?
That guy would pay a hundred billion!

338
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,880
-He has them, and you're worth it.
-Right.

339
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,080
He is loaded.
Also, you can't deny he's kinda cute.

340
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,920
And very gay too.

341
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,560
Well, then you look the other way.
Pansies' money is worth just as much.

342
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,800
Don't say "pansies."

343
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,200
Okay, honey. Gays, homosexuals.

344
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,680
Did you say law firms?

345
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,640
Investment funds…

346
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,960
I'M DOWNSTAIRS, AT THE BAR.
COME QUICK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DAD.

347
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,960
What is this?

348
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,760
The number for the phone
I smuggled in for your dad.

349
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,240
And why are you doing this?

350
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,680
You helped me arrest him,
so I'll help you stay in touch.

351
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,160
A favor for a favor.

352
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,600
Okay, thanks.

353
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,720
Isa…

354
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,080
I would've told you,
but you don't answer my calls

355
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,720
or reply to my messages…

356
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,600
I don't want any contact with you, Luis.
I don't know why you don't get that.

357
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,760
-I don't get why we can't be friends.
-I don't want to be.

358
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,760
There's no point. And I don't want to.

359
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,880
This makes us even, okay?

360
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,280
Don't call. Don't text.
I don't want anything to do with you.

361
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,720
Despite my accent,
I think I'm quite clear.

362
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,400
Thanks.

363
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,920
Hey! What's wrong?

364
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,480
Nothing. Get up, or you'll be late.

365
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,760
SPANISH GOVERNMENT
IMMIGRATION OFFICE

366
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,160
VOLUNTARY RETURN

367
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,560
Oh, shit.

368
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,880
There's no other way to get the papers.

369
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,280
I'll get kicked out
of the fucking country.

370
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,360
Want to get married?

371
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,600
-I'd rather be deported.
-Hey!

372
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,520
I'd make you very happy, Dalmar.

373
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,360
You'd drive me crazy.

374
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
What a jerk.

375
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,080
"Cooperating with the police
may help with the legalization process."

376
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,400
Easy. We find out about some nasty crime,
and you report it. Problem solved.

377
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,200
Don't worry, okay?

378
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,360
We'll think of something.

379
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
You'll see.

380
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,920
Right. I gotta get to school.

381
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,560
Oh, I'll come
and grab some stuff tonight, okay?

382
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,320
I told you, you can stay here
as long as you need to.

383
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,440
No, it's okay. I don't want to see
Omar's sad grimace every day.

384
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,040
But where are you going to stay?

385
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,000
Iván is letting me use his room
until he gets back.

386
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,600
Oh! Are you two cool? Are you…?

387
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,320
Yeah, actually…

388
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,840
We're cool. We both got carried away
with our egos,

389
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,960
but we're cool, actually.

390
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,680
I can only sponsor one of you.
Let's see what you have to offer.

391
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,560
As owner of Isadora House,

392
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,800
I can offer you spaces,
apart from the club, obviously,

393
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,640
where we can hang out,
relax, and have a great time.

394
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,000
Pleasure, freedom, and contacts

395
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,080
in the greatest nightlife empire
at Alumni's complete disposal,

396
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,120
whenever you need it, of course.

397
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,040
Okay. Thanks, Isadora.

398
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,400
Chloe?

399
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,920
Yes?

400
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,640
What would you offer Alumni?

401
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,080
Well…

402
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,240
my desire to become one of you.

403
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,320
I'll do my best to bring great vibes.

404
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,360
I'll help the club grow in any way I can.

405
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,400
Alumni will be my priority.

406
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,680
That's all very nice.

407
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,160
But how can we test that?

408
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,840
It's not tangible.

409
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,920
It's not something we can hold you to.

410
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,880
Thank you both.

411
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,200
I'll let you know who I pick.

412
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,200
Fuck…

413
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,120
Héctor, I want to go home.

414
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,120
I'll have a few drinks,
make a call, and we'll go.

415
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,000
-I have a million things to do.
-Emi, relax.

416
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,880
-What do you want?
-Nothing.

417
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,960
What's this?

418
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,120
I'll kick him out.

419
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,240
We can talk to Virginia
so she kicks him out too.

420
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,280
Why? He's not hurting anybody.

421
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,720
Look at him.

422
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,160
Poor guy.

423
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,680
Exactly. He's poor.
Why is he crashing here?

424
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,840
-He's a scholarship student, and we--
-Emi, enough.

425
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,560
I'll see you at home.

426
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,280
You're that hung up on him?

427
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,960
Don't be jealous.

428
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,280
I'll sleep with you if you want.

429
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,520
You're not coming home. I'm not an idiot.

430
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,200
Isadora, three of our suppliers
don't want to service us anymore.

431
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,040
Looking at last month's totals,
I can see why.

432
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,560
Tell me the truth.

433
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,480
I'm never getting that raise
because you plan to close the club.

434
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
No.

435
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,280
What do you mean?
We're just in a rough patch, babe.

436
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,120
Just a rough patch.

437
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,000
Cousin!

438
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,680
-Nico, come here!
-No, don't…

439
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,600
What is it?

440
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,200
He's here to check up on me.

441
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,040
What's up, guys? What's up, cousin?

442
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,880
-Hey.
-We're doing great, dude.

443
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,840
Sit down and have a drink with us.

444
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,000
Try to lighten up
and stop acting like you're my dad.

445
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,000
-I'm just looking out for you.
-Well, don't.

446
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,080
I don't know, have fun,
hit the floor, and flirt a little.

447
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,200
But if she falls for you,
don't toy with her, please.

448
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,520
Here we go again.

449
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,000
-You set that one up yourself.
-I'm sick of you getting at me.

450
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,320
I'm going to the restroom.

451
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
-You gonna miss me?
-Yeah.

452
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,920
When will heads start to roll?

453
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,680
-What?
-When are you gonna start firing people?

454
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,640
This is gonna be my shortest gig ever.

455
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,760
Hey, Chloe. What?

456
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,920
Come on, Nico. I mean, stop it already.

457
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,520
Seriously, I'm not doing it. I won't.

458
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,080
Can't you see he's doing better than ever?

459
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,640
-Of course. That's why.
-Well, there you go.

460
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,480
He's flying high now, but he might
come crashing down because of you.

461
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Why are you so unfair with me?

462
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,720
Seriously, can't you see I'm helping him?
Because I am.

463
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,440
Excuse me? You?

464
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,480
Yes, me.

465
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,680
He's okay because of the pills
and therapy, not because of you.

466
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,880
You're the opposite of a solution.
You're a problem. You're unstable.

467
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,040
You're toxic. You're destructive.

468
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,160
Damn, I guess Eric was right after all.

469
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,320
You need a girlfriend or someone
to give you attention.

470
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,120
Look, I get that you miss Rocío and Dídac,

471
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,000
and not being glued to Eric all day
is messing with you.

472
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,760
But, honey, and I say this
with all the love you know I have for you,

473
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,040
let the rest of us be happy.

474
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,760
Go on, now. Go.

475
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,320
Leave me with her.

476
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,240
Go. Can't you see she's upset?

477
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,440
What an asshole.

478
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,920
-Just ignore him.
-What an asshole.

479
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,080
The solution is not firing people
and closing down.

480
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,400
Quite the opposite, in fact.
We need to take Isadora House…

481
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,320
and make it huge, dude.

482
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,600
Gigantic, big, memorable.

483
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,000
We need to hire more people.
That's what we need to do.

484
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,000
Babe, you need to spend money
to make money.

485
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,600
Money you don't have.

486
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,440
Want some gossip to cheer you up?

487
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,040
Please.

488
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,480
Isadora is broke, girl.

489
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,240
-What?
-I swear.

490
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,160
Seriously?

491
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,360
I can get loans.

492
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,920
More? You have about five.

493
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,680
Yes, more. As many as we need.

494
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,960
I can also find investors through Alumni.

495
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,200
Through Alumni?
The club for former students?

496
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,480
Yeah. So?

497
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,360
They set up this exclusive club at school.

498
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,840
They've got influential members,
so I think I can find investors.

499
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,200
So she's broke?

500
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,600
Dalmar told me.
He said Omar mentioned it earlier.

501
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,000
Omar's super worried he might get the axe

502
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,360
because the company is penniless.

503
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,800
But Isa is telling everyone
she's killing it.

504
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,720
It's all an act.

505
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,000
Are you serious?

506
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,000
You know what?

507
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,960
You're going to make our workforce bigger.

508
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,840
I want waiters.
I want dancers. I want security.

509
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,040
I want cleaners, please. That's crucial.

510
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,320
We're gonna make Isadora House huge.

511
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,760
I love you.

512
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,880
Isa…

513
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,880
-Hi.
-What is it?

514
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,360
Could we change tables?

515
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,280
Is there a problem?

516
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,160
Yes, we'd prefer one with more light.

517
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,240
Surely the dark is better
for making out, right?

518
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,040
I'm sorry.

519
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,480
I went too far.
Sorry. Totally unprofessional.

520
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,240
I'll send someone right away.

521
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,720
No, Omar. Not "right away." Right now.

522
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm really busy. Can you wait ten minutes?

523
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,800
Do it now for 100 bucks?

524
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,360
How about it?

525
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,680
For fuck's sake. Okay, girl.

526
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,760
Thank you.

527
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,840
No, leave that there.
I'll take care of it. It's just a second.

528
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,120
-Okay.
-Yeah.

529
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,920
INCOME AND EXPENSES BY MONTH

530
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,960
What?

531
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,880
Hey…

532
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,960
What the hell?

533
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,360
How did you sleep, you stowaway?

534
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,800
The club is cool after all, huh?
You can do whatever you want here.

535
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,920
You can make yourself at home.

536
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,320
You have nowhere to go.

537
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,760
Or were you looking for me?

538
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
Huh?

539
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,200
Let me go.

540
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,120
See all this?
It's here to do whatever you want with it.

541
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,640
It's free.

542
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,720
Fully accessible to all members.

543
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,000
If you want a sponsor, you know.

544
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,760
Stay the night.

545
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,320
You can be my guest.

546
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,000
In exchange for what?

547
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,240
Why would you do that for me?

548
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,120
Huh? What do you want in return?

549
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,440
I want to see you enjoy this with us.

550
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,080
That's Alumni's main purpose. Pleasure.

551
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,880
Getting to know people like us and have--

552
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,000
Yes, but I'm not like you guys.

553
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,600
But you can become one of us here.

554
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,960
Good morning!

555
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,200
Good morning, Isadora.

556
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,760
Here.

557
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,000
Thank you. What's this?
The papers to join Alumni?

558
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,400
Your accounting.

559
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,160
Red numbers.

560
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,800
More red numbers.

561
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,160
And more red numbers.

562
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,280
It looks like a list of missed calls.

563
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,880
Where did you get that?

564
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,600
From the truth.

565
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,400
Not from the fairy tale
you sold me yesterday.

566
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,160
Bankrupt liars are not the kind of profile
I like to sponsor, to be honest.

567
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,240
Have a nice day.

568
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,000
Anything to get in the club.

569
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,800
Even exposing a classmate.

570
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,840
Congratulations.

571
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,920
-I'll be your sponsor.
-Thank you.

572
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,960
Isadora isn't your friend, right?

573
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,840
-What?
-Selling out a classmate, I can tolerate.

574
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,840
But never a friend.

575
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,960
At the club, we want
an atmosphere of good vibes and unity.

576
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,440
We don't want backstabbing or toxic shit.

577
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,520
-Why are you offering me the job?
-You need the money.

578
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,160
You can't have me at home,
but it's okay at work?

579
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,680
I just want to help you.

580
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,480
I'm not saying I don't need it,

581
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,880
but I don't want you to help me
just because you feel guilty.

582
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,320
Oh, Joel, don't be so stubborn.

583
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,160
What did you see?

584
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,520
I'll think about it and let you know. Bye.

585
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,640
But Joel, don't…

586
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,280
Thank you.

587
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,080
What?

588
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,560
What is it?

589
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,640
No, nothing.

590
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,440
No, tell me. What is it, Iván?

591
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,440
We have a lot to talk about, don't we?

592
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,200
I know, but can we do that
some other time?

593
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,840
Right now, all I want is this.

594
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,200
What? What's wrong, Iván?

595
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,240
Why did you stand me up?

596
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,880
I didn't stand you up.

597
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,520
So what do you call what you did?

598
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,720
Not showing up, not letting me know,

599
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,880
not answering my calls…

600
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,800
Fuck…

601
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,720
So what?

602
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,760
Isn't it the truth?

603
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,440
Seriously?

604
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,680
Couldn't this wait?
I asked you to drop it.

605
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,920
But I've been holding onto this
for weeks--

606
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
What about me?
I've been waiting for you for weeks!

607
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,960
I missed you too, Joel,
but I couldn't do it--

608
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,160
I didn't want to be your carry-on luggage.

609
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,320
-Huh?
-What do you mean?

610
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,120
What would I do there, Iván?

611
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,000
I was only going to be with you
when you had free time,

612
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,160
like some kept man.

613
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,560
Joel, you could have done
whatever you wanted. Anything.

614
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,720
An English course,
so you could improve that a bit.

615
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,720
-Can you hear yourself?
-Travel. Africa is nice.

616
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,960
Can you hear yourself?
That's literally having a kept man!

617
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,280
Forgive me if I wanted to stay

618
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,200
and try to finish the year
without anyone's help.

619
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,520
Without anyone's help?
I pay for your tuition.

620
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,960
Look, Joel…

621
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,080
Fuck you, Iván. Fuck you.

622
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,920
Fucking shit…

623
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,040
What's wrong?

624
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,640
I want you to sponsor me.

625
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,560
I want to join.

626
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,680
Okay. Take a seat,
and let's talk about it.

627
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,920
Come on.

628
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,840
You might be hung up on him,
but you still have to test him.

629
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,240
I will. What are you going to do to yours?

630
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,040
I want to have fun.
That's why we started the club.

631
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,560
Why don't we play a little?

632
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,880
Play what?

633
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,040
Let's push them to their limit.
They're so eager to join.

634
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,720
One literally sold her classmate out,
and the other went begging to you.

635
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,440
He didn't beg, Emi.

636
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,560
Let's test them for real.

637
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,520
Let's see if they really want this.

638
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,400
Let's see how far they're willing to go.

639
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,360
Héctor!

640
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,960
To the limit. If he gets in,
you can do whatever you want.

641
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,640
Really? And you won't get in the way?

642
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,560
Perfect, then.

643
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,240
To the limit. Come on.

644
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,720
Hey!

645
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,120
-I'll walk you out.
-Want a ride home?

646
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,640
-No, don't worry about it.
-Oh, yeah.

647
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,720
You don't have a home, right?

648
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,800
-You never explained why--
-Wanna grab a drink?

649
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,800
What's this about?

650
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,800
All right. Let's go.

651
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,120
