1
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,160
When you've had cancer,
you start associating everything with it.

2
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,440
You deny it at first,
but then you can't stop bringing it up.

3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,720
All the time.
Usually in a really contrived way.

4
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,960
But these four
almost invite the comparison.

5
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,840
Which four?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,440
The fucking Benjamíns.

7
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,720
Benjamín, Patrick, Mencía…

8
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,640
And Ari.

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,920
What happened when they showed up?

10
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,120
They destroyed everything.
Like a metastatic growth.

11
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,160
Uh… yeah, it's me.
Didn't you wanna be best buds again?

12
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,120
Well, guess what?
I'm a wreck today, so you're in luck.

13
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,960
About Mencía?
It looked like things were going great.

14
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
I mean, it was awesome,
and she's fucking amazing.

15
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,640
But it's the same old story.
I'm falling for her in a dangerous way.

16
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,360
I couldn't sleep well last night.

17
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,720
I kept dreaming about her.
She hasn't texted since the party.

18
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,640
I've been stalking her Insta.
I almost liked a post. Know what I mean?

19
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,760
Holy shit. What's with the TV?

20
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Morning, Rebe.

21
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,480
Yeah, they're everywhere now.

22
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, like her posts or text her yourself.

23
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,320
Yeah, right.

24
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,240
Good morning, students.

25
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,160
This is a virtual greeting

26
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,120
to introduce a new initiative
from one of your fellow students.

27
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,120
Hi, everyone.

28
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,160
I wanted to thank you
for making me feel so welcome

29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,360
and do something for you in return.

30
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,360
I assume most of you
are familiar with le Bal in Paris.

31
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,000
I'd like to throw one here
with all of you.

32
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,600
I'm really looking forward to it,

33
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,280
and it'll be a great party, so I hope

34
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,240
you won't miss it.

35
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,520
Come on, Samu.

36
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,720
How can I tell her how I feel
if I feel like I'm going crazy?

37
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,240
This is intense.
What if I come on too strong?

38
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,680
Listen to my message.

39
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,840
-I don't wanna say it again.
-You didn't send me anything.

40
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,000
What do you mean?

41
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,280
-No.
-Don't tell me you sent it to…?

42
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,280
What did it say?

43
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,720
-Only good things. Too good.
-So, that's good, right?

44
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,680
Online. She's online, man.

45
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,440
Single? Seriously?

46
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,320
That fast?

47
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,040
-I thought we might change our minds.
-You're the one who broke up with her.

48
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,760
Yeah, but she was okay with it.

49
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,080
Sounds like Nadia's pretty sure.

50
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,080
But you're not?

51
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,880
Why'd you freak out
at the party and dump her?

52
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,000
Distance is a real bitch.

53
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,840
-So, is distance a rich swimmer girl now?
-What are you talking about, man?

54
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,120
You saw us hooking up,
and you broke up with Nadia.

55
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,440
Hey, take it easy. It wasn't about you.

56
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,120
Are you that pissed
that Ari isn't Pluto to me?

57
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,560
So, you hooked up
with her just to mess with me?

58
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,160
No, I did it because I wanted to
and so did she.

59
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,680
-Sure.
-Plus, it's not like you're together.

60
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,800
-If you hadn't gotten in the way…
-See? This is about Ari.

61
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,040
Listen. Drop it,
or I'll kick your fucking ass.

62
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,480
No, you don't get it.

63
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,080
If you're not together,
that's between you and Ari.

64
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,360
Leave me out of it.

65
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,120
Le Bal is a charity ball

66
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,640
to present the debutantes
from the best families.

67
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,960
Sure, and there'll be
plenty of chandeliers,

68
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,280
a guillotine,
and a bit of the Black Death, right?

69
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,400
Caye, that is some backward-thinking,
sexist shit.

70
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,360
It's not sexist, actually.
We get to choose our cavaliers, our dates.

71
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,800
I guess you must mean us students, right?

72
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,600
Ari, you're invisible to me.

73
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
Even worse, you're drab. Ciao.

74
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,680
Bye.

75
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
What was that look about?

76
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,440
Maybe that elitist swipe
you took at Cayetana?

77
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360
It was an objective observation.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,240
She's the janitor.

79
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,720
I'm the waiter with a scholarship.
That's why you're not inviting me, right?

80
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,480
I couldn't have gone anyway.
The Lake Club will be doing the catering.

81
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,440
Sorry you can't come as a date.

82
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,000
It's not my thing, anyway.

83
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,520
I don't go to poser fests.

84
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,960
When are we meeting up again?

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,280
Today's good for me.

86
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,240
No, not today.

87
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,880
Why? Can't you meet after work?

88
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,920
I'd rather chill out on my sofa.

89
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,600
What?

90
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm the one who works.
Let me decide, okay?

91
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:04,080
NADIA, I'D LIKE TO CHAT TONIGHT.
CAN YOU?

92
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,160
Can we talk for a minute?

93
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,800
Yeah, sure.

94
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,800
I'd love to go to le Bal
on a cavalier's arm.

95
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,520
And I believe you're free.

96
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,400
Who told you that?

97
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,200
Facebook. The whole school knows.

98
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,080
I see.

99
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,920
Want to go with me?

100
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,480
I like the ball,
but I don't like being your second choice.

101
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,320
Excuse me?

102
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,880
Samuel turned you down, right?

103
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,520
Uh… no. He didn't turn me down,
because I didn't ask him.

104
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,560
Well, you guys sure had a great time
at the towel party.

105
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,200
-Who told you that?
-Not Facebook. Relax.

106
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,760
Nothing happened between us at the party.
And I won't ask him because he's--

107
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,760
Because he's a waiter. Say it.

108
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,680
He's a waiter.

109
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,160
He's not my type.

110
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Right. I mean, if Samuel…

111
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,640
If he was a count instead of a waiter,
would you ask him?

112
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,080
Well, if you were a short redhead,

113
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,600
you wouldn't be you
and I wouldn't be asking you.

114
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,120
-Are you listening to yourself?
-Yeah, I am.

115
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,480
I don't feel like going to the ball.

116
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,080
Could you please get out of my car?

117
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,480
SURE, CALL ME

118
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,160
Balenciaga, Getaria, 1895.

119
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,480
Jávea…

120
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,680
You scared me!

121
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,600
Miss Grajera Pando?

122
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,760
-This is she.
-How are you?

123
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,200
Good. And you?

124
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,200
Just great. I came to ask you
what you're doing on Friday night.

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,720
Nothing. Studying.
I'm in college, believe it or not.

126
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,320
I see. The thing is…
I'd like you to be my date to the ball.

127
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,600
I mean, I'd like you to ask me
so I can say yes.

128
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm not invited.

129
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,160
You are now.

130
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,200
Why me?

131
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,040
-Why not?
-They won't let me go with you.

132
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,000
I pick the venue and the guests.

133
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,880
Everyone else just donates money
and gets to be in the photo.

134
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,440
You wanted a second date
and didn't know how to ask.

135
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Don't jump to conclusions.

136
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,400
What conclusions are those?

137
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,320
-What conclusions?
-Yeah.

138
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,600
"He asked me on a second date,
so he must really like me."

139
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,320
"And if it goes well,
there could be a third."

140
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,120
A third date? My God, no.
You move faster than I do.

141
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,120
-Do I?
-Yep.

142
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,640
But you're the one who thinks so.

143
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,800
What if I do? Do you like that?

144
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,640
Dammit.

145
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,960
All right, I'm coming!

146
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,680
-Room service.
-What are you doing here?

147
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,640
-If Muhammad won't go to the mountain…
-Well, it's just that Muhammad is sick.

148
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,200
This stuff is a cure-all. Come on.

149
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,720
God damn it.

150
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,720
A couple of shot glasses…

151
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,640
There we go. I'm so dope.

152
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,520
Uh… I can't today, Mencía.

153
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,800
It's not a good time.
I'm really busy, and--

154
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,080
Come on, get comfortable.

155
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,880
We need to have a little talk
about your voice message.

156
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,920
Can we not, please?

157
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,200
Take a seat.

158
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,120
I can't see a thing.

159
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,280
-Oh no… Straight ahead?
-Easy does it.

160
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,200
-Okay. This way?
-I'll guide you.

161
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,120
A little bit further. A little bit…

162
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,520
What's all this?

163
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,320
Pick one, and it's yours.

164
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,480
Oh, my God. But Phillipe…

165
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,480
All right.

166
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,880
For every question you ask me,
I'll ask you one in return.

167
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,200
Oh, I thought you wanted me
to take something off.

168
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,200
That's if you answer wrong
or if you don't reply.

169
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Fine.

170
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,160
Uh…

171
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,080
Describe yourself in three words.

172
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,960
Brave.

173
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,240
Passionate.

174
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,640
And… fucked up.

175
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,360
That's four words.

176
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,840
"Fucked up" is one concept.

177
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,000
But you're right. Fine.

178
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,080
It's four words.

179
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,080
What do you hate
more than anything in the world?

180
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,960
Being lied to. Being taken for a fool.

181
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,720
People talking behind my back.
Being let down, basically.

182
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,560
You said like 25 things.

183
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,640
Okay.

184
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,800
No.

185
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,760
Those don't count.

186
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,600
Okay.

187
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,400
What's your biggest secret?

188
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,440
Well,

189
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,080
the thing is, if I told you…

190
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,720
it wouldn't be a secret anymore.

191
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,680
Would it?

192
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,440
No.

193
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,080
What makes you happy?

194
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,080
People who work hard.

195
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,880
Who are always there.

196
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,640
Who keep their word. Like my old lady.

197
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,200
What do you like about your mom?

198
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,160
My old lady rocks, dude.

199
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,000
She'd do anything for me.

200
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,360
Like stop dealing and start from scratch.

201
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,240
What happened to yours?

202
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,240
Hey.

203
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,800
We don't need
to tell each other everything today.

204
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,240
You wanna kiss me now, don't you?

205
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,880
Do it.

206
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,640
Shit.

207
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,920
Share the love, dude.

208
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,960
Uh… it's not what it looks like, Mom.

209
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,680
It looks like you and your friend
were getting it on in our living room.

210
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,080
Mencía, this is my mom, Sandra.
This is Mencía.

211
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,480
She's so cute.

212
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Listen, Rebe.

213
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,880
My blood pressure's a bit low.

214
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,120
Get some beers and snacks
so we can get to know each other.

215
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,320
-Yeah, right away.
-Good.

216
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,960
How much are you charging her?

217
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,560
Nothing.

218
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,800
I see. The first time is on the house.

219
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,760
Have you told her you're a hooker?

220
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,560
I'm not a hooker.

221
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,160
You have sex for money.
Google that and see what you find.

222
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,800
My life is none of your business.

223
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,440
It is when it concerns my daughter.

224
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,480
So you have three options.

225
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,200
You tell her,

226
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,320
I tell her, or you get out of the way.

227
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,480
Your call.

228
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,320
I've got some cold ones!

229
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,120
Great!

230
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,120
Come on, let's toast to the two of you.

231
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,320
Cheers.

232
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,680
I don't want to have a threesome,
not with Patrick or anyone else.

233
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,640
I mean, we tried it, and it was good.

234
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,280
But it's just sex.
Don't you have faith in us?

235
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,760
I'd rather not test our relationship.

236
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,080
What?

237
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,400
NEW MESSAGE FROM PATRICK

238
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,160
-What?
-What do you mean, what?

239
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,000
You were saying something.

240
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,720
I'M IN THE PRIVATE ROOM. JOIN ME.

241
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,720
Who is it?

242
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,440
It's Patrick.

243
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,720
And… what does Patrick want?

244
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,840
Forget it.

245
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,080
No, tell me.

246
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,680
It's okay.

247
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,720
Look, Omar, you're the one
who decided to open this door.

248
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,680
Now you decide when to close it?

249
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,920
It's not fair.

250
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,640
Maybe I don't want to close it.

251
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,360
I'm sleeping at my place tonight.

252
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,640
Why did I have to wait?

253
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,720
I don't know, Nadia.

254
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,720
To mourn a bit.

255
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,560
Maybe we were too hasty.

256
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,480
I don't know. Maybe I was too hasty.

257
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,920
I get that this makes your head spin.

258
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,280
But if you hadn't done it,

259
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,160
we would've let it die,
and it would've been worse.

260
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,400
Yeah.

261
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,440
But I don't know…

262
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,680
It scares me…

263
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,800
It scares me that you're so sure about it.

264
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,840
God damn it.

265
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,800
Guzmán!

266
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,360
One thing I've always been sure of
is I don't want either of us to get hurt.

267
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,200
I think this is for the best
and that we need to move on.

268
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,680
Yeah.

269
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,560
You're right.

270
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,600
And yeah, it makes my head spin.

271
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,760
I changed my status to single.

272
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
I don't know.

273
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,680
Maybe it's stupid,

274
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,760
but… the fact that it's there
for everyone to see makes it real for me.

275
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,600
You should try to… move on too, Guzmán.

276
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,000
Fine.

277
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,040
Okay, so…

278
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,720
this is it, right?

279
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,600
It was nice knowing you.

280
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,960
You're so dramatic.

281
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,480
We'll see each other again.

282
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,960
Only if you want to, of course.

283
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,040
Wherever the sun sets, I'll be there.

284
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,600
Okay.

285
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,440
I'll try to move on.

286
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,160
Try to move on.

287
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,960
Okay.

288
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,960
Goodbye, Nadia.

289
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,000
Are you okay?

290
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,280
Yes, I'm fine.

291
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,200
Okay.

292
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Mencía, what's wrong?

293
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,800
Shit, I can't do this.

294
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,880
-I don't know…
-Right, I get it.

295
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,880
-I'm coming on too strong.
-No, it's not that. It's just that…

296
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,520
Your mom's out there,
and she caught us, and…

297
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,360
My mom? My mom's super cool.
Did she say something to you?

298
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,080
-No, of course not.
-Oh.

299
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,200
She was super nice to me, but…

300
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,640
But I can't do this sort of thing
at my place with Benjamín around, and…

301
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,680
Let's just…

302
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,080
do this some other time, okay?

303
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,800
Someone at front door.

304
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,120
No.

305
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,600
-Forget it.
-What are you doing?

306
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,040
Oh, hey. How are you?

307
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,600
Hello.

308
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,080
Why are you here?

309
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,840
-Can I come in?
-No.

310
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,520
-My dad's home. I'd rather talk here.
-Right. Um…

311
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,520
I'm sorry, Ari.

312
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,760
I acted like a caveman
and an arrogant prick.

313
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,200
Wow.

314
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,840
Now, that's the way to begin a speech.

315
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,440
I also wanted to tell you that…
I'd love to go to the ball with you.

316
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,560
And wait for you
at the foot of the stairs,

317
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,040
with my arm out like this.

318
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,160
I was hoping that…

319
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,800
you'd invite me,
if you still want to go with me.

320
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,440
Is that a yes?

321
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,520
I'm getting to know you a bit better.

322
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,760
Yes.

323
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,160
It's a yes.

324
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,160
Yeah?

325
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,960
That's great, then. Let's talk later.

326
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,640
-See you around.
-Okay.

327
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,600
-Good night.
-Good night.

328
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,960
Did Guzmán… talk to you about Ari?

329
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,960
He left my sister for her.

330
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,720
-Did he talk to Ander about her?
-I don't know.

331
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,000
Did he talk to Samuel?

332
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,480
Samu!

333
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,480
How are you?

334
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,280
-How's it going?
-All right.

335
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,560
You were right.

336
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,720
If anything was gonna happen
with Ari and me, it was up to us.

337
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,920
Really?

338
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,240
I went to her house.
We're going to the ball together.

339
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,120
That's awesome.

340
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,040
-You're not upset, are you?
-Me?

341
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
Not at all.

342
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,800
No way.

343
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,080
Cool, 'cause you guys
just had a one-night stand.

344
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
You're not into her.

345
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,880
What are you trying to say?

346
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,320
I just think Ari and I like each other.

347
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,960
And I wanted to know
if you are okay with it.

348
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,040
I see.
So why are you involving me in this?

349
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,920
Hey, I didn't want to--

350
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,560
It seems like you're trying
to get with Ari to mess with me.

351
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,360
I knew you'd be pissed.
You went after her to mess with me--

352
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,200
Enough! You're acting
like it's me you're into, not her.

353
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,560
Ari is all yours.
Just like everything else.

354
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,760
I don't get you.

355
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,600
-Good morning.
-Hey.

356
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,960
Listen, I've been thinking, and…

357
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,360
I know you'll think this is old-fashioned.
For the record, so do I.

358
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,800
But it could be fun and all.

359
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,080
Since one of us had to ask,

360
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,880
I just thought,
"Come on, Rebe. You do it."

361
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,880
So… would you be my cavalier?

362
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,280
I can't.

363
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,040
I'm sorry. I just have to…

364
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,760
What is it?

365
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,880
Nothing. I just have to work.
I don't like depending on Benjamín.

366
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,800
Oh.

367
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,240
I'm sorry.

368
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,160
Not here.

369
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,080
Why?

370
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,480
You need to tell me about
these rules you and your boyfriend have.

371
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,240
It was just sex.

372
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,160
What happened?

373
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,880
-Why?
-Because I want to know.

374
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,000
What happened?

375
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
He texted me when I got in the taxi.

376
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,600
You decided to go
when you were at my place.

377
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,600
-No.
-You did.

378
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,240
I made up my mind in the taxi.

379
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Hey, hottie.

380
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,960
How did he come on to you?

381
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,080
We tell each other everything,
and I catch you with this bullshit.

382
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,120
Seriously?

383
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,480
This is the Patrick tequila
drinking method.

384
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,320
First…

385
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,440
you lick the salt.

386
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,280
Then he licked my neck.

387
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,920
He put salt on me

388
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,920
and put some lemon on my fingers.

389
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,600
And finally…

390
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,680
We started getting turned on
right there at the bar.

391
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,800
And stuff.

392
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,640
What stuff?

393
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,920
We fucked.

394
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,680
So, you went for it.

395
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,960
-Does it matter?
-Tell me.

396
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,240
He went to the restroom,
and I followed him.

397
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,160
We closed the door,
and we started making out.

398
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,360
Then I unbuttoned his shirt,
and I started kissing him all over.

399
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,320
Hey, if we're naked, it is cheating.

400
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,720
Until I reached his dick,
and I started sucking him off.

401
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,800
Then he put me against the wall
and fucked me.

402
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,240
Until we both came.

403
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,240
I don't get it.

404
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,400
Are you mad or turned on?

405
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,480
Omar, it was just sex. That's it.

406
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,680
Did you at least use a condom?

407
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,440
Of course. Who do you think I am?

408
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,360
I honestly don't know anymore.

409
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,720
Can I ask you not to do it again?

410
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,120
Sure.

411
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,240
Good.

412
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,680
Want some?

413
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,720
The best in Madrid.

414
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,800
I got it
from the owner of that bar, the Speakeasy.

415
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,280
She sold you the coke?

416
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,840
What are you doing?

417
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,240
I need to go.

418
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,560
Where do you need to go?

419
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,640
I need cash.

420
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,760
I'll make it up to you next time, okay?

421
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,760
Coming!

422
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,320
Is Rebeka home?

423
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,720
Who the fuck do you think you--?

424
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,600
What's all that?

425
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,000
We're going to look fabulous.

426
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Awesome.

427
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,560
We'll be turning heads so far
that necks will break.

428
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,720
Where are you going?

429
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,080
To a party a classmate is throwing.

430
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,520
I won't be long. Shall we?

431
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
You're so pretty.

432
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,560
I know you're dealing again.

433
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,120
Rebeka doesn't know.

434
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,720
Mencía, are you coming?

435
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,840
I guess we'll be the first daughter-in-law
and mother-in-law to get along well, huh?

436
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,320
I love how we send messages
through fashion.

437
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,160
What message am I sending with this dress?

438
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,040
Come.

439
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,000
That the night is yours.

440
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,840
And we'll be killing it on Instagram.

441
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,120
I'm nervous.

442
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,480
Don't worry.
I'll go wait with the other cavaliers now.

443
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,400
Okay.

444
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,680
Shit.

445
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,080
Wow. Handsome!

446
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,240
Well, well…

447
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,720
-Handsome.
-How are you?

448
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,880
-Fine. You?
-Can you charge this for me?

449
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,640
A glass of cava, please.

450
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,480
Sure.

451
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,320
I've been checking the place out.

452
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,200
There are beds with headboards

453
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,440
where you could tie me up
using my bow tie.

454
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,800
Stop it, Patrick.

455
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,200
But you like fucking me.

456
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,160
This could destroy my relationship.
Don't you get it?

457
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,440
Ander…

458
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,320
I told you that saying no to me
was more dangerous than saying yes.

459
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,400
Over here, Phillipe!

460
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,400
Phillipe.

461
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,600
Please!

462
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,640
-Thank you.
-Who's your date?

463
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,160
BEDROOM

464
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,480
Are you okay?

465
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,560
What's wrong?

466
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,920
Do you want to be called
"grumpy girl" on social media?

467
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,080
How would you react if you found out
I'd filmed you while we fucked?

468
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,040
-What?
-Why did you film us?

469
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,840
Will you send it to your friends?

470
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,760
Do you have a group chat

471
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,760
where you share videos
of you guys fucking commoners?

472
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,240
-Huh?
-Do you use it to jerk off? What's it for?

473
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,120
Cayetana, it was a security measure, okay?

474
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,880
Do you think
I'm some sort of international terrorist?

475
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,400
I'll tell you later, okay? In private.

476
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,040
Cayetana, let me explain, please.

477
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,360
Let me explain, please. Listen to me.

478
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,280
What?

479
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,040
Look, I met a girl, okay?

480
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,800
She was charming, like you.
And I liked her a lot, like you.

481
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,640
But she was more into my royal status
than into me.

482
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,160
I guess a prince is the perfect target
for false accusations of sexual assault

483
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,680
and to blackmail to make a fortune.

484
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,320
That does not give you the right
to film me without my consent.

485
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
That is sexual assault, Phillipe.

486
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,120
Sometimes,
security calls for certain exceptions.

487
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,320
So you film me,
you insult me by calling me a whore--

488
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,360
What?
I never called you anything like that.

489
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,360
You didn't?

490
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,200
Do you want to know what they do call you?

491
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,520
-No.
-They say you're a con artist.

492
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,320
A liar. Listen to me.

493
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,080
A murderer's ex-girlfriend,
possibly his accomplice.

494
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,640
I don't know if I should say I found out
thanks to my intelligence services

495
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,440
or the restrooms of Las Encinas.

496
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,600
Listen to me.

497
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,120
-Don't touch me.
-Listen to me, please, Cayetana.

498
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,720
-Cayetana.
-What?

499
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,000
Look, you're intelligent,
you're fun, and you know what you want.

500
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,160
And I really like you.

501
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,280
So despite everything I heard about you,

502
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,320
I still want to get to know you
and hear your side of the story.

503
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,920
Now you decide
if you still want to get to know me.

504
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,320
When I've saved up the money
I'm planning on saving,

505
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,920
we could move in together.

506
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,320
-We could?
-Yeah.

507
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,680
Where?

508
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,200
Wherever you want.

509
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,880
Fine.

510
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,440
But to be honest, right now,

511
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,080
I'm quite happy at home with my mom.

512
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,680
Oh, well…

513
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,440
What would you think if I moved out first
and made room for you?

514
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,560
I think I'm gonna get some drinks
so we can think it over, you know?

515
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,880
This is Sandra, Rebe's mom.

516
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:40,160
Honey, for your own sake and for Rebeka's,
don't even think of threatening me.

517
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,400
You don't want to threaten me.
Especially if my daughter is involved.

518
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,840
Have I made myself clear?

519
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,880
Who was that?

520
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,560
Nobody. It was nothing.

521
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,480
Oops.

522
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,440
ANDER, WE NEED TO TALK

523
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,240
COME, PLEASE

524
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,400
ANDER, I WON'T GIVE UP ON YOU

525
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,440
I'M NOT A QUITTER

526
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,960
Omar, give me my phone.

527
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,040
I'm going home.

528
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,520
Why?

529
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,520
I'm exhausted.

530
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,480
Will you be long?

531
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,000
I need to wait until this is over
and then clean up.

532
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,800
See you later.

533
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,960
-Snooping on Ander's phone?
-Leave him alone.

534
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,200
Leave us both alone.

535
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,160
I can get out of the way,
but he might come to me.

536
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,880
You texted him, and he's not here.

537
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,720
But you are.

538
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,080
Ander and I…
make you jealous or make you envious?

539
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,880
I can only think of one way
to improve this position.

540
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,080
Hey, pal.

541
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,880
Jesus fucking Christ.

542
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,120
What are you doing, Samu?

543
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,680
-And you?
-I'm serving a drink.

544
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,480
You're getting my girl drunk
so she'll get with you again.

545
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,880
-Excuse me?
-Look, I'm not interested.

546
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,160
That's right, laugh. What a jerk.

547
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,560
What?

548
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,640
Come with me.

549
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,640
-Don't drag me around like that.
-Come.

550
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,600
Fine.

551
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,960
I can't tell what the worst part
of that sentence is.

552
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,480
"You're getting my girl drunk
so she'll get with you again."

553
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,600
-Your girl?
-I meant, "my date tonight."

554
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,640
Right, so I'm basically a pushover

555
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,560
who can be manipulated
into hooking up with guys.

556
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,720
Sorry. Your pushover.
Because I'm also yours.

557
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,320
Ari, it's not like that.

558
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,040
We came here together.
I don't see the problem.

559
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,560
Then we're off to a bad start.

560
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,680
Do you want to be with me or not?

561
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,080
That depends.

562
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,080
It depends on whether
or not you'll be a caveman one day,

563
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,840
apologize the next,
and then brandish your club again.

564
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,320
Do you know what I mean?

565
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,400
You're right.

566
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,560
-You're saying that to shut me up.
-I'm not, Ari. I'm apologizing.

567
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,560
I'll learn.

568
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,120
Step by step.

569
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,520
Step by step.

570
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,120
It also depends on if you kiss me.

571
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You're talking about a relationship,
and you haven't even kissed me.

572
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,760
I know.

573
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,320
-Should I do it?
-No, I'll do it. I got nervous.

574
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,280
Okay.

575
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,600
You look nervous.

576
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,120
Are you scared she'll wake up and talk?

577
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,920
No.

578
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,440
I'm worried that she won't.

579
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,920
What if she doesn't wake up?

580
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,600
Then we won't be looking for an assailant.

581
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,440
We'll be looking for a murderer.
