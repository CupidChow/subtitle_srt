1
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,560
So, you made a deal
with his family to get him

2
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,800
away from the rumors in his country?

3
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,840
What rumors?

4
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,880
What?

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,960
Nothing.

6
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,720
Do you have something to say
about those alleged rumors too?

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,720
No, nothing.

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,600
Where's Mencía?

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,800
I've called and texted,
but she hasn't replied.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
So she's not here?

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,360
Ari, I specifically told you
to make sure she would be.

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,920
Dad, I can't supervise her 24-7.

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,720
If you're not okay, we'll stop.
I want you to feel comfortable.

14
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,840
Just so you know, this is the last time.

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,640
We'll see.

16
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes, Mom.

17
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,440
Benjamín said
he'd be here with his three kids.

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,320
They'll be in my class.

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,560
Don't worry.

20
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,920
Me too. I love you. Let's talk tomorrow.

21
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,760
It's a pleasure to meet you in person.

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,200
The pleasure is mine. Welcome.

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
Let me introduce you
to my children. Patrick.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,880
-Hi. How are you?
-Nice to meet you.

25
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,640
-Same here.
-And Ariadna.

26
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,800
Hello.

27
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,080
How are you?

28
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,200
Pleased to meet you.

29
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,920
Three milligrams of alcohol in her blood.

30
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,680
If she's not used to drinking…

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,040
Did she fall in? Was she pushed?

32
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,120
We don't know.

33
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,280
The first 48 hours will be critical.

34
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,440
Phillipe Florian von Triesenberg.
The second youngest heir in Europe.

35
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,480
He opened Le Bal two years ago.

36
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,360
-Yes, sure.
-The Parisian debutante ball.

37
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,960
-You haven't heard of it?
-No.

38
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,760
But above all-- Look, this one is good.

39
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,360
He's an icon and a patron
of the best international designers.

40
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,200
He speaks four languages

41
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,080
since he attended the best schools
in Spain, the UK, and Switzerland.

42
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,680
He's very elegant. He's handsome.

43
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,080
French-Spanish royal and common lineage.

44
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,680
-It's in his blood.
-Hang on, let me see if I get it.

45
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,120
Are you already daydreaming

46
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,920
about this Froilán dude making you famous
or walking you down the aisle?

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,400
Florian, not Froilán.
And I'm just sharing information.

48
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,600
Well, put your helmet on, Lady Cleaner.

49
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,760
You'll crash down to Earth soon enough.

50
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,720
So that's why they installed
the cameras and the metal detector.

51
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,680
Yes, that's right.
And more measures will be taken.

52
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,680
He looks better here.

53
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,080
-Yeah, right.
-See you later.

54
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,120
Wow, amazing.

55
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,440
Hi.

56
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,320
Do you have a minute?

57
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,240
What do you want?

58
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,080
To sweet-talk me into getting my dad
to remove the cameras?

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
No.

60
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,320
I want to apologize.

61
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,720
-I'm sorry if you think it was all a game.
-Which part wasn't?

62
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,720
I enjoyed our walk at the reservoir.

63
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,560
Walk or date? You called it a date.

64
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,760
Okay, date.

65
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,880
Was it a real date?

66
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,320
What else was real?

67
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,320
The connection we felt.

68
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,160
I believe that too.

69
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,880
-The laughs, my guinea pig…
-Your girlfriend?

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,400
My girlfriend is also real.

71
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,840
I'm really sorry, Ari.

72
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,520
I'm going to let it go.

73
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,320
But no connections
as long as you have a girlfriend.

74
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,440
Agreed?

75
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,280
Yes.

76
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,960
It's a deal.

77
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,040
There's been this weird vibe
between you and Ari, huh?

78
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,360
She beats you at swimming,

79
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,320
you keep staring at each other,
having intense conversations…

80
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,480
It was a misunderstanding.
It's been cleared up.

81
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,840
-You're not gonna try your luck, then?
-I have a girlfriend.

82
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,600
-All right. Good to know.
-What's up? Do you like her?

83
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,480
Me? No way.
Don't worry, I won't hit on her.

84
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,880
Oh, okay.

85
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,360
"Oh, okay," what?

86
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,400
-Are you gonna freak out if I make a move?
-No, not at all.

87
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,160
-I mean, you have a girlfriend.
-Yeah.

88
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,560
-But it has nothing to do with me.
-What?

89
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,400
I'm telling you as a friend,
Ari is out of your league.

90
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,120
Hang on, is this jealousy,
or are you being an elitist asshole again?

91
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,880
I want to protect you.

92
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,480
I know you had a marchioness,
but that's it.

93
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,640
Carla was the best you'll ever have.

94
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Ari is not only out of your orbit.
She's fucking Pluto to you, got it?

95
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,400
-Fucking Pluto, right?
-Yeah.

96
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,320
Fine.

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,640
Don't be mad, man.

98
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,080
Where were you last night?

99
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,320
Out.

100
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,360
May I ask who with?

101
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,320
With a girlfriend.

102
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,440
Which friend?

103
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,800
Benjamín, I'm leaving.

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,800
I don't want to be late for class
or you'll get upset.

105
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Mencía.

106
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,080
Mencía!

107
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,360
Excuse me.

108
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,400
Yes?

109
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,600
Criminal record?

110
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Which word don't you understand?
"Criminal" or "record"?

111
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,640
They're very simple words, Parrilla.

112
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,840
I know what they mean.

113
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,200
But why do you want our record
and our immediate family's too?

114
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,720
That's private, isn't it?

115
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,480
With you and your mother,
it's public and notorious.

116
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,320
Leave it blank, if you like.

117
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,400
The Principality of Triesen wants to know
about its heir's classmates, not me.

118
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,320
But it seems reasonable

119
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,080
that they want to assess
who he will be sharing the classroom with.

120
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,960
Doesn't it?

121
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,360
Rebe.

122
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Are you okay?

123
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,400
Fucking great.

124
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,160
Don't get all dramatic, Rebe.

125
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,000
Are you stupid, Omar?
People are going to be kicked out!

126
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,600
He didn't say that exactly.

127
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,880
-Shut up. I'm not talking to you.
-Okay.

128
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,840
You heard him.

129
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,600
This so-called nice guy
is really out for blood.

130
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,320
Who'll be the first to go? Want to guess?

131
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,160
My mom was in the slammer,
and I wasn't exactly dealing cards.

132
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,840
That fucker will get two
for the price of one.

133
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,680
I understand that our first reaction
is to blame others for our mistakes.

134
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,800
But, as you heard,
this is about a royal house.

135
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,680
Rebe, you're not the only one
whose family has a criminal record.

136
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,000
Think of Samu's brother.

137
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,600
Or your father.

138
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,720
Have you forgotten
that he also has a record?

139
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,800
As far as that principality and Benjamín
are concerned, we're on the same level.

140
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,320
The same shitty level.

141
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,560
LOOK IN THE CLASSROOM.

142
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,760
GIVE ME TEN MINUTES. THAT'S ALL I ASK.

143
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,960
Rebe…

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,080
I like you.

145
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,080
And I know you like me too.

146
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,840
So I don't understand
why you keep avoiding me.

147
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,880
And why do you think I like you like that?

148
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,920
Because… the last time…

149
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,520
I did this…

150
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,040
you also took your time to pull away.

151
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,800
Look, Mencía, I don't. I really don't--

152
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,200
Get out of here.

153
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,560
We need to perform a thorough search.

154
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,840
Did the world end when I kissed you?

155
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,160
Huh? Tell me.

156
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,720
Has anything changed
in the last five minutes?

157
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,440
Your old man's face,
thinking, "Parrilla, out."

158
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,560
So my father will be your excuse
to avoid me now?

159
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,920
Mencía, please.

160
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,320
Let's go our separate ways.

161
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,960
It's not that difficult. No.
I'm asking you, please.

162
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,800
We better stay away from Rebe right now,
or we'll get caught in the blast.

163
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,680
Did they hook up?

164
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,320
Looks like it.

165
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,720
And she freaked out because she's a girl?

166
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,400
-That's not like her.
-No.

167
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,040
I think I know what's going on.

168
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,400
Or I can imagine.

169
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,760
Take her to the Lake Club for dinner
so I can talk to her.

170
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,400
If I ask her, she'll tell me to fuck off.

171
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,680
Dad says you've been going out
with Rebeka at night.

172
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,520
Well, if Benjamín says so…
it must be true.

173
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,360
He also says that…
she pays for everything.

174
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,200
Do you know where Rebeka
gets her money from?

175
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,240
From an ATM.

176
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,920
Just like you.

177
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,760
Yes.

178
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,240
Benjamín caught us kissing.

179
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,680
Is that a problem?

180
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,320
Seriously?

181
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,520
Are you a lesbian now or what?

182
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,160
I'm not.

183
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,200
I just don't like labeling myself,
what I do, or what I feel.

184
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,760
-Do you know what that means?
-I do.

185
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,680
That you love attention.

186
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,560
Mencía, I can't allow you
to hang out with that girl.

187
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,280
She's no good for you.

188
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,040
REBE, SORRY TO BE A PAIN. CAN WE TALK?

189
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,480
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

190
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,880
-A message from Mencía.
-What are you doing?

191
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,040
HI, ARMANDO.

192
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,880
MAYBE WE COULD MEET ONE MORE TIME.

193
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,640
IF YOU WANT TO.

194
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,440
Fuck, Nadia has postponed
our video call by an hour.

195
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,600
I always have to adjust to her needs.

196
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,960
Sometimes I feel
I'm the only one making an effort.

197
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,040
Don't worry.
I'll freak out on my own here.

198
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,200
It's not like that, dude.
So are you two okay or what?

199
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,800
We're fine. Thank you, Omar.

200
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,400
The only way we can all meet up at a bar
at night is if you come here to see us.

201
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,520
-Things have changed.
-I liked the way things were before.

202
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,280
I'm still serving your drinks,
so not much has changed for me.

203
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,600
You know what we could do?
Throw a good party like we used to.

204
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,200
-Please.
-Yes.

205
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,040
What kind of party?
Fancy or low-budget?

206
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,800
Just for the old gang.

207
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,200
We could have it at our house.

208
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,400
Sure, but why just for the old gang?

209
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,880
Who should we invite?

210
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,720
Who don't you want to invite?

211
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,160
-The Benjamins.
-No.

212
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,800
No, not the Benjamins.

213
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,200
See? The question is, Samuel,
who do you want to bring?

214
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,280
-Just the old gang, Samuel. It's easier.
-Okay.

215
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,640
-Have you seen the lake, Rebe?
-No, and I'm not dying to see it either.

216
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,920
It's beautiful.

217
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,280
Take a look. I'll be down in five minutes.

218
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,280
Come on, not you.

219
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,440
Move or you're going in the water.

220
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,120
Not until you hear me out.

221
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,120
You've been like this for months.

222
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,960
Not long enough, it seems.

223
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,320
I know I really hurt you.

224
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,160
How can I make things
go back to the way they were?

225
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,920
Look at me.

226
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,080
Fine. Anything else? Anything you want.

227
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,440
Let's see, Samuel.

228
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,120
Do you think a kiss, a hug, and an apology
are all it takes to go back in time?

229
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,080
I know you're fucking sorry.

230
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,000
You'd better be.

231
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,720
So what can I do? Tell me.

232
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Nothing.

233
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
You did everything.

234
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,800
You fucked me over,
you lied, and you humiliated me.

235
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,840
What else do you want?

236
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,200
Now I decide, whenever the fuck I want,
how I want to relate to you.

237
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,120
Okay.

238
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,520
Are we done with our BFF chat?

239
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,160
Okay, then.

240
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,760
But don't close yourself off to others
just because I screwed you over.

241
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,360
Just because I was an asshole
doesn't mean everyone else is.

242
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,680
Hi. I've never seen you here before.

243
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,400
No. I don't come here often.

244
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,280
He does look familiar. Is he your friend?

245
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,440
He usually comes here with girls like you.

246
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,680
Girls like me?

247
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,600
Aren't you a little young for this?

248
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,680
For what?

249
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,760
You have no idea
what's going on between us.

250
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,000
Of course I do, dear.

251
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,520
A great hourly rate.

252
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,080
At least, I hope it's great.
Young flesh is worth double.

253
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,240
Although I always thought
experience should go for more.

254
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Don't touch me.

255
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,520
I hope you know what you're doing,
if you're really so grown up.

256
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,960
-Still asleep down there.
-I'm trying to focus.

257
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,080
Omar, let's talk for a second.

258
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,200
Yes, that's all I need, to talk about it.

259
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,640
You see…
sex isn't just about sticking it in.

260
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,360
It isn't?

261
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,280
No.

262
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,840
What else?

263
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,480
It's about skin…

264
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
About words.

265
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,800
Fantasies.

266
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,440
What do you fantasize about?

267
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,880
The other day, when I went out
with Patrick, he hit on me.

268
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,880
Didn't you say you just danced?

269
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,680
Well, you know, the usual stuff.

270
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,080
Yeah.

271
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,720
The usual stuff. All very normal.

272
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,760
Shut up and listen.

273
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,800
At one point,

274
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,200
we were really euphoric.

275
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,160
We were dancing, sweating,
rubbing against each other,

276
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,400
and he fondled me through my clothes…

277
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,400
"If you're not naked, it's not cheating,"
he said. I let him do it for a bit.

278
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
But then I stopped. I felt guilty.

279
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,560
Because it made you horny.

280
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,600
-Can I be honest?
-We're always honest with each other.

281
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,920
Not just horny. Horny as hell.

282
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,960
And he wouldn't stop.
I asked him to stop, and he kept going.

283
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,800
He started kissing my neck slowly,

284
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,560
and then went down

285
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
very slowly.

286
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,640
He got close to my crotch,

287
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,240
so I could feel his breath…

288
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,120
Why are you pitching a tent?

289
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,600
What?

290
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,360
Phillipe?

291
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,280
I'm sorry, I just…

292
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,480
How's your shoulder?

293
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,080
That's fine. Leave her.

294
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,480
-Feeling better after your ski accident?
-Yes.

295
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,240
-Yes?
-I'm fine. It was nothing. Thank you.

296
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,800
What a crash…

297
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,280
Sorry to bother you like this.

298
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,200
I just had to say hello.

299
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,480
If I hadn't,
I wouldn't have slept for a month.

300
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,920
Cayetana. It's an honor.

301
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,720
Nice to meet you.
I wouldn't want to keep you up at night.

302
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,280
I was told that you give
two kisses in Spain.

303
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,960
Yes, but… I mean, is that okay?

304
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,600
-Yes. It's a pleasure.
-Yes?

305
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,320
-Phillipe.
-Pleased to meet you.

306
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,320
-Welcome to the school.
-Thank you.

307
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,920
Thank goodness you're here.

308
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,480
Someone spilled coffee
in the computer lab.

309
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,880
Could you clean it up?

310
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,200
Is the janitor bothering you?

311
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,400
No, I was just meeting new people,

312
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,720
including employees.

313
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,440
Au revoir.

314
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,920
Cayetana, I understand perfectly

315
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,560
how a janitor like you must feel attracted
to a prince like a fly to honey.

316
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,240
But honey wasn't made
for the donkey's mouth.

317
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,200
Don't get close to people
you don't belong with.

318
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,120
Ciao.

319
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,360
Ciao.

320
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,240
Was she pushed in?

321
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
By who?

322
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,520
They don't know.

323
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,000
Or they don't want us to know.

324
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
Are you all right?

325
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,680
I'm going to wash my face.

326
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,680
He turns you on. Admit it.

327
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,360
Fuck no.

328
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,160
You see?

329
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,240
Listen, Ander. He's hot, no doubt.

330
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,680
But I got a hard-on
because he makes you horny, not me.

331
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,680
I got turned on by picturing you
getting turned on by him. I did.

332
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,400
-Can't you see how fantasies work?
-Yes.

333
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,520
Let's take a shower.

334
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,800
If Patrick turns you on,

335
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,800
and I get turned on
by the fact that he turns you on…

336
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,840
What? Do you want to invite him?

337
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,320
Well, it'd be you and me at all times,
only with one more person.

338
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,360
A game for couples.

339
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,640
You seem to like the idea.

340
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,960
Well, I do.

341
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,880
As long as it is you and me at all times…

342
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,120
At all times.

343
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,720
And how do we suggest that?

344
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,440
I don't know. Talk to him. People do it.

345
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,840
Boys, I need you to clear the room. Now.

346
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,600
Why, Dad? I mean, Benjamín.

347
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,640
It'll only be 15 minutes.
Please leave the room.

348
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,600
Come on.

349
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,600
This guy must have a blue dick
and blue blood.

350
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,360
Let's see if I've got this right.

351
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,200
Your dad just kicked us out so that
the fucking prince can take a shower?

352
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,400
Hey, complain to Benjamín.
I'm half naked here, like all of you.

353
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,680
Maybe you crossed the line.

354
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,920
Maybe it's not about me,
and it's all your dad.

355
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,680
Seriously?

356
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,080
What the hell are you doing?

357
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,320
If His Royal Laziness won't share
the showers with our common asses,

358
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,520
he won't want to share
the classroom either.

359
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,440
Maybe it's not his fault.
It could be his family's.

360
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,080
Being royalty must be a drag.

361
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,880
You're taking his side
to suck up to Ari, right?

362
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,800
I know what it's like to be shunned.
We're shunning him because he's rich.

363
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,200
God, Samu. You sell out real quick.

364
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,000
-What? I'm not selling out.
-Whatever.

365
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,640
Busting my balls again?

366
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,840
If the shoe fits…

367
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,600
-Don't push it, champ.
-Yeah, whatever.

368
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,360
What?

369
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,960
Two cocky guys fighting over you.

370
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,400
They're fighting over Phillipe.

371
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,080
Am I allowed to look you in the eye?

372
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,560
You may not want to be seen
with the janitor

373
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,680
by all your fantabulous friends.

374
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,280
Oh. You don't have any.

375
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,200
In fact, I might start a club
for people getting the silent treatment.

376
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,200
-And who would be in that club?
-You.

377
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,680
And me, some days.

378
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,920
-I'm not sure if I want in.
-Really?

379
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
How do I get out?

380
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,840
It's complicated.

381
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,440
First, you'd need to win over
the founding member, yours truly.

382
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,360
Second, you'd need to turn down
your royal swagger a notch or two.

383
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,440
I accept.

384
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,000
As long as you turn down
your groupie behavior.

385
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,280
Ouch.

386
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,440
I'm sorry.

387
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,840
I've always been a fan,
and I know everything about you,

388
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,040
so I think I know you personally.

389
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
We can start over, if you want.

390
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,840
Yes, please.

391
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,280
Nice to meet you.

392
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,200
Likewise.

393
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,080
-I am Phillipe.
-Cayetana.

394
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,120
Although… I was told that you give
two kisses in Spain, right?

395
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,880
Yes.

396
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
Pleased to meet you.

397
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,400
Half the planet would kill
to have Phillipe at their party.

398
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,920
We said the old gang only.

399
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,480
Phillipe wants to fit in,
same as everyone else, rich or poor.

400
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,920
Can he come or not?

401
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,000
-Sure, bring him.
-Really?

402
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,560
Great.

403
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,600
Ari.

404
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
Are you coming?

405
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,120
-Where?
-To a party at my place tonight.

406
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,120
Sure.

407
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,920
You won't like it. It's not your thing.

408
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,640
Guzmán, I've been to humble houses before.

409
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,520
It's not the house, it's the theme.

410
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,640
What theme?

411
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,320
To celebrate that we don't mind
sharing everything, showers included,

412
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,480
unlike the prince,

413
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,960
we're throwing…

414
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,880
a good towel party.

415
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,520
-Are you nuts?
-Yeah, that's cool.

416
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,480
You may wear one towel only.

417
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,280
I don't think the prince will be game.
Same goes for you.

418
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,520
Phillipe doesn't mind undressing
in front of anyone.

419
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,680
The shower thing was imposed on him.

420
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,640
I'll bring my best towel.

421
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,280
Unless you don't want me to come.

422
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,400
Me? Oh, not me.
If you've been invited, it's all good.

423
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,720
There's no reason why
you wouldn't want me to go, right?

424
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,440
No.

425
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,400
Great.

426
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,600
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

427
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,960
-See you there.
-Right.

428
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,400
Mencía!

429
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,280
There's a party at my place,
and we would love to have you there.

430
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,080
Yes, sure. Thank you very much.

431
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,080
You're welcome.

432
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,440
I'm buying. What are you having?

433
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Three shots?

434
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,280
-Now?
-Sure, to get things going.

435
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,320
Do you always get right to it?

436
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,320
After being bedridden for two years

437
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,040
unable to move,
I don't sit around and wait.

438
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,640
I go get what I want.

439
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,040
To us.

440
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,000
That's gross.

441
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,440
I'm going to the restroom.

442
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,520
I'll let you do the talking.

443
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,640
So… you go get what you want.

444
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,280
I want everything. All the time.

445
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,320
Well, you want everyone

446
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,440
all the time, don't you?

447
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,480
Fine.

448
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,760
Don't think this libertine life
I lead makes me happy.

449
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,680
What I really need is something…
that is worth it, you know?

450
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,520
But that's practically impossible.

451
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,040
Why?

452
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,240
Assuming that your soul mate
isn't dead or hasn't been born yet,

453
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,200
the chances of finding them
are one out of 10,000 lives.

454
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,920
Well, I don't really believe
in soul mates and nonsense like that,

455
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,240
but I see what you mean.

456
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,960
So what is Ander for you?

457
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,160
Call it whatever you like.

458
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,840
You know…

459
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,320
You know when you fuck someone
and you look at him?

460
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,640
Suddenly, time stands still.

461
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,680
And, for five seconds,
there's nothing else but him.

462
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,360
And then you can't help but smile.

463
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,640
Of course you know.

464
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,760
You guys have been lucky enough
to live that experience.

465
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,840
Welcome.

466
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,040
Hi.

467
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,520
Come in.

468
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,880
Look, the restroom and my bedroom
are over there if you want to get changed.

469
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,200
-Want a beer?
-What?

470
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,360
A beer?

471
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,920
-No, I don't drink.
-You sure?

472
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,280
-Yes.
-Ari!

473
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,080
Go on, towel and plenty of booze.

474
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,440
You know I don't drink.

475
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,680
Except when you do.

476
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,680
I want Ira to come to this party.
She's marvelous!

477
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,600
Who's Ira?

478
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,560
She's your evil twin when you get drunk.

479
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,680
Ari, Ira.

480
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Pure fantasy.

481
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,000
Hi.

482
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,720
Here, let's wake up Ira.

483
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,080
Just a little, since my mouth is dry.

484
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,400
Drink. There are no garbagemen here
for you to get busy with.

485
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,520
What garbagemen?

486
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,360
Seven a.m., August, Biarritz.

487
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,360
Want to see the video?

488
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,760
-No.
-Fine.

489
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,800
So I thought of a towel party.

490
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,280
-Hi.
-And I said, "Why not?"

491
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,560
Hey, how are you?

492
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,240
Great, and you?

493
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,880
Great.

494
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,360
Do you want to dance?

495
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,680
Or chat? Or chat while we dance?

496
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,800
Excuse me.

497
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,720
-Is Nadia your girlfriend?
-Yes.

498
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,880
How are you, my love?

499
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,080
Are you naked?

500
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,680
No, I'm wearing a towel.
How are you? Look.

501
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,360
We're throwing a towel party
at your brother's. There they are.

502
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,840
Who was that girl?

503
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,400
One of our new classmates.

504
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,120
I can't hear you, Guzmán.
Go somewhere quieter.

505
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,400
Can't you hear me? Wait, I'm going out.

506
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,800
Enough with the looks and the giggles.

507
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,360
-Do I look bad in a towel?
-On the contrary. You look fucking great.

508
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,840
I mean, at this time of night,
wearing a towel and being drunk…

509
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,160
-It's natural.
-What?

510
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,120
We kinda wanted to suggest…

511
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,400
-What?
-Let's see.

512
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,120
We we're wondering if you'd…

513
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,120
if you'd join us in a little…

514
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,960
A little… excursion?

515
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,880
No.

516
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,360
A party?

517
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,280
A little…

518
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,080
A threesome?

519
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,000
Yes.

520
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,080
Why didn't you say so before?

521
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,280
Well, you said you wanted
a different kind of thing now.

522
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,320
You're after the five-second thing,
not meaningless sex.

523
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,280
At this hour and wearing this,
settling down is not easy.

524
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,120
Your room?

525
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,320
What? Now?

526
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
Come on.

527
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,040
-Let's talk--
-Wait.

528
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,440
Nadia, are you seriously mad
because I'm at a party?

529
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,080
You do your own thing in New York,
and I understand. It's okay.

530
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,080
I'm not mad.
It's just that I'm studying, and you…

531
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,680
And I'm partying. Say it.

532
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,400
I mean…

533
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,680
Don't you realize that…

534
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,120
this just proves that our lives
are as different as day and night?

535
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,320
Literally.

536
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,160
Does this look like a normal,
healthy relationship going somewhere?

537
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,240
Yes.

538
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,280
Yes, it does.

539
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,880
Look, dude, I'm sorry.
Really, I'm truly sorry.

540
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,920
But I have too much baggage.

541
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm full of insecurities,
full of fear, full of…

542
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,400
And your shutting me up like that
is starting to annoy me, you know?

543
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,880
Leave your fears behind.

544
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,040
I can't be that scary in a towel.

545
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,280
Bravo!

546
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,960
Long live love! Fuck yeah!

547
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,200
Mencía, I'm so happy for you!

548
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,320
I'm really glad to see you this happy.

549
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,120
Aw, you deserve the best.

550
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,440
You too, honey.

551
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,840
What are you doing?

552
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,600
Enough looking for the perfect place
and time.

553
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,440
The place is here…

554
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,400
and the time is now.

555
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,600
I thought you didn't drink.

556
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,960
I thought you didn't undress in public
because your nipples were too royal.

557
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,800
Shit!

558
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,880
Who is this hunk?

559
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,720
He's in our class, I think.

560
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,960
-Is he?
-Yes, he's the host of the party.

561
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,240
He opened the door earlier!

562
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,200
-Hi.
-How are you?

563
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,280
-I'm fine, and you?
-I'm fine too.

564
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,520
I'm glad.

565
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,040
I thought you wouldn't come.

566
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,840
Why not?

567
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,600
We're not from the same class.

568
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,920
What do you mean?

569
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,280
Phillipe just said so.
You're driving me nuts.

570
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,240
I mean we don't belong
to the same social class.

571
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,280
I see. But you know what?
I forget about class when I drink.

572
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,560
-Really.
-In every sense of the word.

573
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,080
-Right.
-Class is a polysemic word.

574
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,480
It's one syllable.

575
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,080
So when I drink, I forget.
That's why I don't drink.

576
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,240
I think she's more into waiters
than princes.

577
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,480
-Could be.
-Yeah, right?

578
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,200
Shall we dance?

579
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,520
-Okay.
-Cool.

580
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
I really admire what you do.

581
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,800
Why? What have I done
to make you admire me?

582
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,000
Shit, well,

583
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,920
you could be wearing anyone's clothes,
and yet you support young designers

584
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,720
and give them a level of visibility
they don't usually have.

585
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,880
Yes. So, your seed designer?

586
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,920
Huh?

587
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,320
Every fashionista has a designer
who planted that seed in them.

588
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,880
Mine is Silvio Alessandro de la Guardia.

589
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,800
-Sadelagu.
-Sadelagu.

590
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,280
-Can't be yours too!
-Of course it is.

591
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,160
What is it?

592
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,480
You just smile,
and they all fall for you, right?

593
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,280
Maybe that tactic won't work with me.

594
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,880
I see.

595
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,800
And you want to play hard to get
and say no to me 50 times,

596
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,280
so I end up
falling in love with you, right?

597
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,080
-Ah--
-I can tell you how that tactic ends.

598
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,400
Badly, right?

599
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,160
Best-case scenario, in the friend zone.

600
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,560
In the friend zone?

601
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,400
That's awful.

602
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,680
-Really?
-We don't like the friend zone.

603
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,720
-No, we don't.
-No.

604
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,880
-You know what?
-What?

605
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,080
I wanna hit on you, but you're drunk.
I don't wanna take advantage of you.

606
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,880
Are you drunk?

607
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,840
No.

608
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,800
-You're not?
-No.

609
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,880
-Then I'll hit on you.
-Okay.

610
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,520
Nadia.

611
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,440
Hi.

612
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,800
Hey, I've…

613
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,760
I've been thinking.

614
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,960
And you're right.

615
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,480
We've bitten off more than we can chew.

616
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,080
It doesn't make sense to keep trying.

617
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,280
Let's give each other a few days
to think it over, okay?

618
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,200
Yeah. Good idea. Get some rest.

619
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,400
Oh, the garbagemen.

620
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,720
Now that you sobered up,
you do remember class.

621
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,960
What?

622
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,800
What class? Our class?

623
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,160
What do you mean, "sobered up"?
I don't drink.

624
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,440
Whatever.
Staying on the sidelines is my thing.

625
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,520
I live there.

626
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,320
I don't want anyone
to get expelled because of me.

627
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:59,360
No one should pay for their family's sins
because of who my family is.

628
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,880
It's a matter of control and security.

629
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,480
My family didn't ask for even half
of the measures you put in place.

630
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,760
Besides, I've had the chance
to meet my classmates

631
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,560
and I feel welcome.

632
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,360
I don't see any danger in them.

633
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,560
Very well.

634
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,280
Which measures should I get rid of?

635
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,640
The cameras, perhaps?

636
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,120
No, not the cameras.

637
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,800
I'd prefer it if you kept them.
