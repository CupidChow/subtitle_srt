1
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,600
Fuck.

2
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,040
Hello, my love.

3
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,760
How are you?

4
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,000
I need to be with y--

5
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,320
That makes no fucking sense.

6
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,800
Emilia reported her brother,
and they both got arrested.

7
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,960
It had to be them.

8
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,400
Well, obviously not.

9
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,120
But why Luis?
Why would he want to kill Joel?

10
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,680
Because he's a son of a bitch. That's why.

11
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,080
Sure, he's not the kind of guy
to use the most orthodox methods

12
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,440
to make sure justice is served,
but being a murderer…

13
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,000
You don't know him like I do.

14
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,920
He's been extorting me for months.
He's a real bastard.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,040
Tell him everything.

16
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,400
-He found out--
-Is it true he was turning tricks?

17
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,280
Tricks? What tricks?

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,760
Well, not magic tricks.

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,360
We'll tell you later.

20
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,320
-Did you know?
-Emilia blurted it out.

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,160
I thought she was trying
to convince me Dalmar killed him.

22
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,400
No, it's true.

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,160
They set up a prostitution ring here
behind my back.

24
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,520
Luis found out,
and he's been using it to blackmail me.

25
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,680
I was pissed with Joel,
as you can imagine.

26
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,440
I went to talk to him, and I lost it.

27
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,360
I yelled. I pushed him.

28
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,320
I basically asked him
to stop and leave me out of it.

29
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,080
I guess Joel confronted Luis
and threatened him with Alumni.

30
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,000
-That's how he settled everything.
-Exactly.

31
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,000
So we think
Luis took out the root of the problem.

32
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,240
-So it's your fault, then.
-What?

33
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,240
You got Joel to confront Luis.

34
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,640
What? Am I the one to blame
for his blind ambition, Omar?

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,520
Is it my fault that he was
with Héctor and those pricks?

36
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,480
And that he became a sex worker?
Am I really to blame?

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,400
What?

38
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,400
The tricks.

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,480
Joel was blinded by money,
and he wanted to be like them.

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,880
He dug his own grave.
I'm sorry, but it is what it is.

41
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,000
Give me the video.

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,640
No, we're taking it to the police.
It's settled.

43
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,120
And what do you think they'll do with it?

44
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,640
They'll stop at nothing
to cover for their own.

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,760
This can't be covered up, Omar.

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,000
-This is solid evidence.
-We need to be smart, guys.

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,720
We have a smoking gun.
The timing needs to be right.

48
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,680
Luis has to pay, of course.
But the siblings can't get away scot-free.

49
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,120
But they didn't kill Joel.

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,720
They wasted no time
in accusing you and Dalmar.

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,440
Not to mention, they beat me up.

52
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,080
Give me the video.
I promise you, they'll pay.

53
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,760
I want to see Luis behind bars.

54
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,880
You will. I swear.

55
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,080
But let me do it my way.

56
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,400
You owe it to Joel, Isa.

57
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,160
We all do.

58
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,720
I just sent it to you.

59
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,200
You have two days. That's it.

60
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,280
The handsome cop?

61
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,920
They really are the worst.
Cops and handsome guys.

62
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,240
How long do we have
before they let Dalmar out?

63
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,200
He might already be out.

64
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,800
-Héctor and Emilia were arrested.
-Them too?

65
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,160
You know, I would have put money
on those rotten siblings.

66
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,840
-We need to do something, Chloe.
-I know.

67
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,600
I'm sure the Black kid
still has that video of me.

68
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,600
-Mom.
-What?

69
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,680
You scare me when I see you thinking,
whiskey in your hand.

70
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,520
Let's make him an offer he can't refuse.

71
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,680
Sure. Since the last one
was so successful.

72
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,200
Well, we're going to need a plan…

73
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,680
S.

74
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,040
-S?
-S.

75
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,440
"Skedaddle." I just came up with it.

76
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,240
The school year is about to end.

77
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,160
If this fails, it's S.

78
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,440
Plan S.

79
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,320
Getting out of here.

80
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,040
-What about Eric?
-What about him?

81
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,560
Baby, you can find
a cute boy who's crazy anywhere.

82
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,440
Think of Eric as your first go.

83
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,840
By the way,
since you have a thing for nutcases,

84
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,600
make sure the next one is loaded.

85
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,960
Think about your future.

86
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,240
I don't get why you're with Héctor.

87
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,920
He's using you.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,360
You're his plaything.

89
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,440
He only gets a hard-on
when he humiliates you.

90
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,520
It's gonna tear you apart down the line.

91
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,640
Is that what you want?

92
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,080
You sure do love to exaggerate, huh?

93
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,880
He's not like that, Omar.

94
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,480
And even if he were,
I can keep him in check.

95
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,880
Yeah, that's exactly what Samu said.
And look how he ended up.

96
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,000
I couldn't cope
if the same happened to you.

97
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,560
Thanks for your concern. Really.

98
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,520
But there's no need.

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,480
Can I tell you something?

100
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,760
Never mind.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,320
No. Say it.

102
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,320
Sometimes I think that

103
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,920
if you and I had met
at a different point in time…

104
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,520
If… I don't know.

105
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,080
If we had met
at a different point in our lives,

106
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,960
maybe things would have worked out.

107
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,840
You wouldn't have even noticed me.

108
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,760
I would have always noticed you. For real.

109
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,760
And… who knows?

110
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,520
Maybe life has a second chance
in store for us.

111
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,080
The future is only two weeks away.

112
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,040
We'll leave all this behind.

113
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,560
I don't feel sad at all.

114
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,760
I only want to heal my wounds.

115
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,600
This week, I'll be asking you
what you'll be doing after Las Encinas.

116
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,040
Is there a life after this?
Is there a future?

117
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,200
Don't be shy. Send me your ideas.

118
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,200
You think?

119
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,400
I don't buy it. It seems so fake to me.

120
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,160
I'm not in the right mindset for this.

121
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,640
Why not?

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,600
We need to get our lives back.
You can go back to social media,

123
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,560
pass all these fucking exams,
and leave this behind.

124
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,640
How can I leave this behind,
knowing that Dalmar will be let out

125
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,640
and that he might have
the evidence to put Carmen away?

126
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,600
Not this again. Seriously?

127
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,000
You want justice for Joel's death, right?

128
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,480
I want the same for Raúl.

129
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,000
What more justice do you need?
The guy who abused you is dead.

130
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,800
Didn't you dream of him disappearing
when he bullied you and abused you?

131
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,080
-He's not here anymore.
-But I didn't want that for Raúl.

132
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Can't you see he's got you trapped
even after his death?

133
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,360
He won't let you move on, Sara.
Free yourself from him.

134
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,080
Forget about him.

135
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm not sure I can.

136
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,160
You can.

137
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,600
Come on, record me.
Ask me about what I'll do after all this.

138
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,040
You. What do you want?

139
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,120
I'm here to see you.

140
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,400
To see you there,

141
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,840
on that side.

142
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,440
Screwed. Without your power
and your arrogance.

143
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,760
It feels good.

144
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,200
I have evidence that would free you.

145
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,440
It's a video.

146
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,280
Someone left a phone
filming your orgy, and…

147
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,760
Oh, surprise!

148
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,920
It recorded Joel's murder too.

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,560
-If I hand it in, you'll walk.
-What are you waiting for?

150
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,920
The thing is, I'm in no hurry.

151
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,400
You corrupted Joel,
and he's dead because of it.

152
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,520
I don't care who the perpetrator was.

153
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,200
What do you want? Money?

154
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,080
I want you to beg me.

155
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,000
To humiliate yourself.

156
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,920
To feel how Joel felt
every time he was with you.

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,240
Joel loved fucking me.

158
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,040
He loved everything I stood for.

159
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,640
That's why he was willing to do
whatever it took to succeed.

160
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,680
And he was hungry too.
I bet he never fucked like that with you.

161
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,040
Oh, is that it?

162
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,640
Didn't you want to see me beg?
Aren't you going to fight?

163
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,360
Oh, you impoverished folk are so weak.

164
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,880
You get what you deserve.

165
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,920
You want the video? The solution is easy.

166
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,680
You and your sister sign a confession,

167
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,200
declaring that
you were the ones who beat me up.

168
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,720
One confession for the cops,
one for the public,

169
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,000
saying you wanted to beat me to death.

170
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,840
Oh, Omar. You're bluffing.

171
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,200
You have nothing. Get lost.

172
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,560
Maybe Emilia won't think the same.

173
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,120
Are you really willing to go to jail
for a crime you didn't commit?

174
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,960
You're sentencing your brother
to 20 years.

175
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,600
And you'll get a few years too.

176
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,320
If the evidence exists,
it'll come to light.

177
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,320
With or without your help.

178
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm the only one who has it.

179
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,640
And if you don't sign the statement
within 24 hours, I'll destroy it.

180
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,800
No lawyer will be able to get you out.

181
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,520
Not a chance, Aladdin.

182
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,840
POLICE

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,720
It must have been really tough, huh?

184
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,840
Why the hell are you here? And you?

185
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,400
We're here to support you.
So that you see you're not alone.

186
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,520
It must be tough to get out
and have no one waiting for you.

187
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,120
So here we are. Carmen and Chloe.

188
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,360
You convinced me to incriminate myself.

189
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,800
Dalmar, don't cling to the past, please.

190
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,560
Only resentful people do that,

191
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,760
and they never amount to anything.

192
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,960
And you know what?
Their skin wrinkles much sooner.

193
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,960
Although with that ebony skin of yours,
you don't need to worry.

194
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,880
Look… get lost.

195
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
A hundred thousand.

196
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,880
What?

197
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,000
A hundred thousand for the video.

198
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,360
I'll be deported soon.

199
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,960
If I cooperate with the cops
and share the video,

200
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,840
I might get my residence permit.

201
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,320
Or they might tell you to fuck off
for giving them such irrelevant evidence.

202
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,920
You're offering me 100,000.

203
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,240
It can't be that irrelevant.

204
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,480
Fine.

205
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,360
I admit it.

206
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,760
It could make things
a bit trickier for me.

207
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,560
But I assure you,
it won't solve your problems.

208
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,200
They'll send you back,
and you won't get a cent.

209
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,560
I'm offering you money
and a lawyer to fight for you.

210
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
What if I got you a better video?

211
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,240
One where you can see
who actually murdered Joel?

212
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,240
They already arrested those fascists.

213
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,600
They didn't do it.

214
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,480
I'll get you the video,
you give it to the cops,

215
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,840
and I guarantee you
they'll give you your residence papers.

216
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,520
You'll be granted citizenship,
but you won't get a single euro.

217
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,560
Mom.

218
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,320
Why offer him that kind of money
if you have that information?

219
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,640
Mom, give him the money.

220
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,600
Of course. A deal's a deal.
100,000 for your video.

221
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,520
Now, don't tell me
we're not your guardian angels, Dalmar.

222
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,960
Get me that video, and we'll talk.

223
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,240
So, Héctor, tell me.

224
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,920
Are you ready to confess?

225
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,560
Mmm, no. Because I didn't do it.

226
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,760
We'll soon find out who did.

227
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,000
You don't say.

228
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,760
Omar has a recording of what happened.
Have a judge issue an order for it.

229
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,000
What recording?

230
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,520
A perv snuck a phone in to film
our party but filmed something else.

231
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
If I were you, I'd tell the judge.

232
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,960
How do I imagine my life
after Las Encinas? Well…

233
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,920
I want to go into medicine
and study psychiatry.

234
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,680
Everything that goes on in here
is super important.

235
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Okay, cut. I sound like a dickhead.

236
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,800
Just a bit.

237
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,480
Let's do it one more time.

238
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,360
Nico, I don't know
if anyone will be interested in this.

239
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,280
Ask me something, then.

240
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,960
Before we talk about your future,
do you have any unfinished business?

241
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,320
I guess I would have done things
differently with my cousin.

242
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,000
That way, we wouldn't be
so distant and screwed up.

243
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,520
To think that the year is coming to an end

244
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,160
and that he might leave like this
isn't cool at all.

245
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,000
Eric, let's fix this, okay?

246
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,240
I swear I'm sorry for all
the crappy things I've done.

247
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,080
Honestly.

248
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,200
I love you, man.

249
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,360
That's better.

250
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,320
What happened?

251
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,480
-We've been robbed!
-You don't have anything to steal.

252
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,920
Omar, we've been robbed.

253
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,280
What?

254
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,160
-Is there something I should know?
-Shit, they took my laptop.

255
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,840
Hey, do you mind if I spend some time
with Omar now?

256
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,000
I have a bad feeling about this,
and… I'll call you later, okay?

257
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,040
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

258
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
Okay.

259
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,880
-Is this about Joel's video?
-What?

260
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,000
The video of Joel's murderer.

261
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,960
-You know about it?
-Chloe mentioned it.

262
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,160
And since our apartment is trashed,
I put two and two together.

263
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,320
Maybe you have it and someone wants it.

264
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,360
No. That's not it.

265
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,000
If you had it, we could use it
to get my residence papers.

266
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,520
Right.

267
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,200
Does that mean you have it?

268
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,280
One second, Dalmar.

269
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,920
Hello?

270
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,400
Yes, that's me.

271
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,760
Omar, this is my family's lawyer.

272
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,160
He helped me write my statement.

273
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,720
I admit responsibility for the beating
and for wanting to beat you to death.

274
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,680
All we need is your signature and mine,
and then you'll accept my confession.

275
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,720
That's great.

276
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,320
Come on, sign it.

277
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,560
I have something better.

278
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,680
Whatever you want.
All you have to do is ask.

279
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,760
I'm your Santa Claus,
your fairy godmother, your genie.

280
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,440
Whatever. Tell me what you want,
and you'll get it.

281
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,280
And think big.

282
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,320
I just want your signature.

283
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,440
Would you really turn down
the chance to have it all?

284
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,640
What kind of future do you want?
I'll make it happen. Be ambitious.

285
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,960
Or are you the kind of sucker
who won't dare to have real dreams?

286
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,680
That's how you won Joel over, right?

287
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,480
And where is he now?

288
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,320
You're smarter than him.

289
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,600
And you have the advantage now. Use it.

290
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,640
Your families make you believe that.

291
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,520
In your world, everything is for sale.

292
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,920
But it's not.

293
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,480
I'd set fire to you, your little sister,
the fucking Alumni club, and the school.

294
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,120
-Done.
-What?

295
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,600
You want to finish us off?
And Las Encinas? It's done.

296
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,840
I'll offer you that.
Shut down Alumni, shut down the school.

297
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,360
What are you talking about?

298
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,480
Tell me you don't want it.

299
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,200
Tell me you wouldn't love it
if it all closed for good.

300
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,080
Think about it.
What will happen if I sign this?

301
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,080
We'll be sentenced to a few months,
and we won't even go to prison.

302
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,320
And that public scorn you dream of? Zilch.

303
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,840
Not gonna happen.
Do you prefer that to the grand prize?

304
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,480
So, what should we do?

305
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Should I sign?

306
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,320
Or you give me the evidence,
and we end Las Encinas?

307
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,200
Omar, are you home?

308
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What's going on?

309
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,200
Nothing. Someone broke in,
and I'm a little paranoid.

310
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,840
Nadia, I might make a deal with Héctor
to shut down Las Encinas.

311
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,480
I give him the video
proving his innocence,

312
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,280
and he'll shut the school down.

313
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,640
Omar, are you okay?

314
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,560
Sure.

315
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,000
Stop worrying about me, damn it.

316
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,760
I'm going to end that cancer of a school.

317
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,040
It's in my hands.

318
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,840
That's all that matters.

319
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,880
Not if I'm okay or not, Nadia.

320
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,240
This is much bigger.

321
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,480
Do you hear yourself?

322
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,000
Forget about revenge.
About shutting down the school.

323
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
About making deals I don't understand.

324
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,400
Can't you see you're becoming like them?

325
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,560
If you make deals and get swept away
by their way of doing things,

326
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,640
you'll think you're winning.

327
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,760
But in reality,
you'll be their next victim.

328
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,760
-I'll die if anything happens to you.
-I'll be fine.

329
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,640
Isn't that what Samuel said?

330
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,560
And Joel?

331
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,080
Whenever we think we've outsmarted them,
they go in for the kill.

332
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,920
Omar, forget about all of this.

333
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,960
Go to the police.

334
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,720
I can't lose you.

335
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Not you.

336
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,880
Hello.

337
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,800
-Omar.
-I'm here to report a crime.

338
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,440
-Okay.
-I have a video of the night--

339
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,920
-I'll deal with this.
-Don't worry. I'll do it.

340
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,480
Yeah, she can do it.
Don't waste your time.

341
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,400
Don't worry. Come.

342
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,040
No, I'd rather come back some other time.

343
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,840
Relax, Omar. You're in good hands.

344
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,280
If you're reporting a crime,
the sooner, the better, right?

345
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,200
REPORT
GO TO YOUR NEAREST STATION

346
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,880
Tell me, what's this about?

347
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,280
Come on. I'll help you.

348
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,280
You wanted to report something,
and you had a video of the night…

349
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,960
What night?

350
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,880
Do you have it?

351
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,840
Luis, I'd rather come back later.

352
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,000
And I'd rather we be direct about this.

353
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,560
That's if you can. You need to be brave,
and I don't know if you are.

354
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,600
I don't know what you mean,
and I don't get your tone either.

355
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,560
You know perfectly well, Omar. Hey!

356
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,760
Listen. You give me the video,
and your suffering is over.

357
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,040
I wouldn't like you to leave here
and have some sort of accident.

358
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,560
Give it to me, damn it!

359
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,120
No! Help!

360
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,360
Help! Help me!

361
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,280
What's going on here?

362
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,800
Just a misunderstanding.

363
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,880
What the fuck happened, Luis?

364
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,360
You heard him. A misunderstanding.

365
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
So he knows you have the video?

366
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,560
We're screwed, guys. I'll call him.

367
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,600
-Call him? What for?
-He's been hitting on me for months.

368
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,200
Will you stop this, Isa?
We'll just go to the police and--

369
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,520
No, Iván. Don't you realize
it's no use going to the police?

370
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,840
Omar was just there.
There's only one way to end this.

371
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,560
Hey, babe. How are you? All good?

372
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,680
Listen, I'm free tonight.

373
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,480
How about we meet up around ten o'clock?

374
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,880
Isa, he's not stupid.

375
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,360
I know he's not stupid,
but he wants me badly. He'll be there.

376
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,480
Trust me.

377
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,600
-Omar, can you stop her?
-We can't go to the police.

378
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,840
-Trust Isa.
-I said no, damn it! Isa!

379
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,600
I won't leave you alone with him.

380
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,760
You'll have to find another solution.

381
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,600
So help me, then.

382
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,280
Okay, but how?

383
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,040
We hang out for a while.
You turn up. We grab him.

384
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Oops! He has a little overdose. He dies.

385
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Isa, are you nuts?

386
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,240
I mean, you've totally lost it.

387
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,280
You want to ruin your life?

388
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,600
Listen, this club is more yours than mine.

389
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,880
My share of it is nothing but debt.
My mother won't speak to me.

390
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,400
My father…

391
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,440
My life is pretty screwed up as it is.

392
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,760
Don't say that--

393
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,400
I'm going to get some champagne,
and we can chill for a while, okay?

394
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,480
-They'll bring it up.
-I want to walk.

395
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
I'll do squats on the stairs.

396
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,600
Thank you.

397
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,760
I love you.

398
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,160
I love you so much.

399
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,680
Hey, you're going a bit too fast,
aren't you?

400
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,840
Sorry.

401
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,320
-Sorry.
-You don't have to go.

402
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,400
Are you okay, Iván?

403
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,040
I just kissed Joel.

404
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,680
But it wasn't Joel.
Because I won't kiss Joel ever again.

405
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,120
Guys, love each other as much as you can.

406
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,920
Life is like that. Before you know it…

407
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
It's too late.

408
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,680
Let's do a video.

409
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,800
Now?

410
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,640
Sure. Didn't you do
live videos about school and stuff?

411
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,800
This is the very essence of the school.

412
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,000
This is about the future, right?

413
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,880
I don't know what future awaits me.

414
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,960
But what I do know is
that it's much better than a year ago.

415
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,880
Thanks to my cousin and his family,

416
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,600
who took me in and took care of me
despite all of my quirks and my flaws.

417
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,600
I know many people hate Las Encinas now

418
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,640
because of what it represents,
but it has meant everything to me.

419
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,960
All because you were here, Nico.
And you brought me with you.

420
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,240
I love you, man.

421
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,560
And thank you.

422
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,320
Are you forgiving me?

423
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,160
You apologized. What's left for me to do?

424
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,800
I made your life impossible.

425
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,840
But despite that,
you've always been there for me.

426
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,160
Okay, Sara. Cut.

427
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,080
No, let the whole world know, man.
I love you.

428
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,080
I don't know what will happen to me,
especially now that I'm moving out.

429
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,360
But you'll always be with me. Always.

430
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,640
I know many people hate Las Encinas now

431
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,680
because of what it represents,
but it has meant everything to me.

432
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,720
Luis won't pay for Joel,
and the siblings won't pay for beating me.

433
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,400
Las Encinas and Alumni will live on.

434
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,480
It'll be business as usual.

435
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,640
But at least us decent people
can still be honest and dignified.

436
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,480
More like tamed.

437
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,600
So that nothing changes.

438
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,000
Nadia, if we do nothing to change things,
nothing changes.

439
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,440
In order to change
something so systematic,

440
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,000
you can't just punish
every action individually.

441
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,680
You need to get rid of the root cause.

442
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,840
And that's really hard.

443
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,960
It takes a long time,
and it's a long struggle.

444
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,720
Let's have dinner.

445
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,800
Omar, where are you going?

446
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,520
To you.

447
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,120
Because you deserve it.

448
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,600
So you're leaving Nico's house.

449
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,560
Yeah, I've already relied on them enough.
But I won't go far.

450
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,320
Okay.

451
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,840
Because you and I have plans, right?

452
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,520
Yeah, sure.

453
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,720
But we don't need to talk about that.

454
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,320
No.

455
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,840
This is good too.

456
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,960
This is good too,

457
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,920
but you're not avoiding talking
to me, right?

458
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,400
Look, Isa gave me this.

459
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,640
She says doing it on 2C is… Whoa!

460
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,400
You down?

461
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,120
I mean, I don't need anything.
All I need is you. Don't you agree?

462
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,440
This whole thing of taking drugs
at school, at the club, during sex…

463
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,040
-While having a snack, I don't--
-Okay, we won't do it. Look.

464
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,720
What if we record it

465
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,960
and send it to Sara?

466
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,840
Doing live videos of Las Encinas
with no sex involved?

467
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,280
Now, that's not very realistic.

468
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,320
I'm kidding, you dork!

469
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,480
Fuck me as it if were the last time.

470
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,000
What are you talking about?

471
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
I'm kidding.

472
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,880
I just got carried away, okay?

473
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,000
But since we're not taking drugs
or making a video, well…

474
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,080
I was joking, silly.

475
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,240
God, I could eat that silly face of yours.

476
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,200
I love you.

477
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,080
Shit.

478
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,160
Hello.

479
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Want a drink?

480
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
Or two.

481
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,280
Are you arresting me?

482
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,560
Do you want me to?

483
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,160
My house, my rules.

484
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,720
Put them away.

485
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,160
You won't need them
to have a good time with me.

486
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,400
Trust me.

487
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,720
If I trusted people like you,
I'd be dead already.

488
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,000
Okay, let's play my game for a while,
and then we'll play yours.

489
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,240
Get naked.

490
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,440
I need you to do me a favor.

491
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,760
-Start a live video with me.
-Okay.

492
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,720
Okay, but let's go somewhere quieter.

493
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,720
You're graduating, and I don't know
what you learned at Las Encinas.

494
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,040
I can tell you what I learned, though.

495
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,600
Rich sons of bitches
cover up for each other.

496
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,480
They know how to do it.

497
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Otherwise, how can you explain
that this shitty school

498
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,840
has seen cases of overdoses,

499
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,640
rapes, murders,
and none of them made the news?

500
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,040
I don't get it.

501
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,520
Why do your parents
keep enrolling you here?

502
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,960
My friend Samu was killed.

503
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,400
So was his girlfriend, Marina.

504
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Iván and I almost lost our lives.

505
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,800
And those fascist siblings
and Alumni drove Joel into ruin.

506
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,920
Okay, they didn't kill him.

507
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,080
But that doesn't matter.

508
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,920
This school's poison reaches everywhere
and corrupts everything.

509
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,040
Seriously, isn't anyone
going to do anything to stop this?

510
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,200
Are your children's lives worth so little?

511
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,880
How many more have to die?

512
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,720
How many more have to suffer
to put an end to Las Encinas?

513
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,240
I also need to add a video.

514
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,880
Can we upload it?

515
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,000
Do you think I'm an idiot?

516
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,880
You want to seduce me so that I confess
to a crime you think I committed.

517
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,960
No, baby.

518
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,520
It's more like… the last meal…

519
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,360
for the condemned.

520
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,400
I am that meal.

521
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,360
What are you doing with that?

522
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,080
Killing me with an overdose?

523
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,840
That's how you're going to die,
you fucking bitch!

524
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,720
And you know what? No one will care.

525
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,760
That poor rich girl, gone broke,

526
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,880
addicted to all sorts of shit,
couldn't handle her debts,

527
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,920
the hustlers at her club,
her daddy's death…

528
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,680
Everyone will understand
why you'd want to die.

529
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,840
But I won't stick a needle in you.

530
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,320
You're more into this pink shit, right?

531
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,800
Oh, dear. It was laced
with fentanyl and GHB.

532
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,760
Poor thing. It's too bad.

533
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Open your mouth.

534
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,720
Open up, bitch!

535
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,320
Hey, wake up.

536
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,120
Wake up. We need to have some fun
before I finish you off.

537
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,120
Hello.

538
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,200
Let's cut the crap and fuck already.

539
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,240
Look, I'll give you a little bit of this
to help you relax. Open your mouth.

540
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,840
Open up, Isa. Open your mouth.

541
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,000
Don't move. Open your mouth.

542
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,480
There.

543
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,520
That's it. There you go.

544
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,440
Where the fuck is Luis?

545
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,240
You.

546
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,320
Wake up.

547
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,040
Wake up, hey.

548
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,280
Hey, wake up.

549
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,120
Are you okay?

550
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,480
Isa, open the door, damn it!

551
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,760
What the fuck?

552
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,440
Luis, get away!

553
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,200
Isadora is unconscious.
I don't know what she took.

554
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,520
Call an ambulance.

555
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,480
Shut up!

556
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,360
You're making a mistake!
I had nothing to do with this!

557
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,720
We need to help her.

558
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,520
You're under arrest
for the murder of Joel.

559
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,040
You have the right to remain silent.

560
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,400
Anything you say may be used against you.

561
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,520
Isa, wake up.

562
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,520
Get dressed.

563
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
Fuck.

564
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,560
Do you know what your problem is?

565
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,520
You're a fucking mediocre piece of shit

566
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,840
who came into our lives
and thought he could have it all.

567
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,280
Of course.

568
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,520
If a fickle, pampered
little brat like me had it all,

569
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,840
you could too.

570
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,520
And you know what? You can't.

571
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,680
Because even if you were up to your balls

572
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,760
in coke, in 2C,
and every fucking drug in the world,

573
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,200
you would never in your life
reach our standards.

574
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,960
Enjoy your last meal.

575
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,960
-Fuck!
-Come on, let's go.

576
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,440
-What did you do to me, bitch?
-Shut up and walk.

577
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,560
-You're making a mistake!
-Move!

578
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,240
Hey, are you okay?

579
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,200
Yes.

580
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,200
Luis?

581
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,160
Call an ambulance.

582
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,360
Sara?

583
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,160
I think you wanted this.

584
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,080
Do whatever you want with it.

585
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,480
What?

586
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,400
I was planning to use it
to help me with my situation, but…

587
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,240
I don't care anymore.

588
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,520
And I think it's about time
that we all started doing things right.

589
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,760
If I have to leave the country,

590
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,280
I will.

591
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,840
Are you looking for Chloe?

592
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,840
Yes. Have you seen her?

593
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,480
She must have run off.

594
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,640
I sent her a video,
and she probably doesn't like it.

595
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,480
Tell them I'm coming after them.

596
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,600
Her and her mother. Both of them.

597
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,840
Be careful. That's fragile.

598
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,320
And it has to arrive in Milan intact.

599
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,120
They can't wait for us to get there.

600
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,000
Damn it, Emi.

601
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,360
MOVING COMPANY
INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT

602
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,800
Leaving without saying goodbye?

603
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,640
No. We're only going for a couple of days.

604
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,520
I know Sara has the video of your mom.

605
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,960
I know, Eric, but…
it was a question of time.

606
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,760
We were bound to leave sooner or later.
It is what it is.

607
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,600
You know I'd stay with you all my life.

608
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,320
Do you?

609
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,920
Then take me along.

610
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,520
I'm going with you.

611
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,840
Mom?

612
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:17,440
That's the last thing you want, trust me.
Besides, don't think of it as a goodbye.

613
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,520
If it's meant to be, you'll meet again.

614
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,920
Say goodbye. We're leaving.

615
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,000
How are you?

616
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,400
Why can't he come with us, Mom?

617
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,640
This pain will go away, my dear.
It will. Believe me.

618
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,360
We all need to put down roots
once and for all somewhere.

619
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,360
Let him do the same
with his aunt and uncle and Nico.

620
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,040
I'll make sure that you meet again.

621
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,400
Sooner than you think.

622
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,840
Okay, honey?

623
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,840
Right now I need you to give me
this trip, just the two of us, right?

624
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,000
Yes.

625
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,680
Put your seat belt on.

626
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,960
Let's go.

627
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,080
I wanted you to see this firsthand.

628
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,960
This is thanks to you, Omar.

629
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,600
And I'm not going to detract from myself,

630
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,640
because I intend
to contribute to the cause

631
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,560
all the files full of scathing information
about this school that I have in storage.

632
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,920
I'm fucking sick of being their puppet.

633
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,440
Dear students, after an urgent meeting

634
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,160
held yesterday
with the members of the School Board

635
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,680
and the Parents' Association,

636
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,600
I hereby inform you that Las Encinas
will close immediately and indefinitely.

637
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,840
What about our exams?
Do we get an automatic pass?

638
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,680
To ensure that you have access
to your final exams,

639
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,960
we have reached an agreement
with a public high school.

640
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,280
Did she say "public"?

641
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,520
The principal's office
will remain at your disposal

642
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,520
to answer any questions
or queries that you may have.

643
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,360
It's over.

644
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:46,600
SAN ESTEBAN HIGH SCHOOL

645
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,200
Is this a school or a kindergarten?

646
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,800
They're all, like, super young, right?

647
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,440
No, girl. They're our age.

648
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,760
Guys, it's this way, I think.

649
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,520
Hey, how's it going? I have a question.

650
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,000
I need to take a little something

651
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,120
because this is all quite fucked up.
Where's the restroom?

652
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,200
Over there.

653
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,000
Want some?

654
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,560
No.

655
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,880
