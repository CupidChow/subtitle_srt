1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,360
Well done, girls!

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,040
Okay, shake hands.

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,760
What do we know
about the dead soccer player's son?

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,040
Iván Carvalho?

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,080
-You jealous?
-Curious.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,760
You're not competing for Joel.
You're testing him for Alumni.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
Yes, ma'am.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,840
He has to earn it,
not get in because you have an itch.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,320
Emi, focus, please.
Tell me what you know about Iván.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,480
Get off me.
You give off way too much heat.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
Come on, the next two.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,960
Iván is, or was, his boyfriend.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,360
He was until he went abroad for months.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,920
Iván.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,720
Shit.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,720
Iván

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,080
and Joel.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,160
What about now?

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,080
Come on.

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,520
Who knows. It ended badly.
Maybe they made up.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,000
If there's already a crack,

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,440
there's no closing it,
even if they want to.

23
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,440
Come to think of it,
maybe you are competing for Joel.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,560
If Joel gets back with Iván,
he'll forget all about you and Alumni.

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,400
That won't happen.

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,280
Contact.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,640
Of course it can happen.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,520
Partners and exes are
the hardest piles of shit to get rid of.

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,240
MY BOYFRIEND HAS BPD

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,280
HE TAKES HIS MEDS,
LIVES A NORMAL LIFE, I'M CRAZY ABOUT HIM

31
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,560
What are you scheming?

32
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,200
My test for Chloe.

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,880
Do you have yours?

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,240
I'd rather go with the flow.

35
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,120
Okay, let's stop it there.

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,040
That's enough!

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,080
No, Iván! Stop it! Stop it already!

38
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,880
Stop.

39
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Shake hands.

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,280
Fine.

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,760
But he'll get away.

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,600
Trust me, he won't.

43
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,400
Mom?

44
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,480
What's wrong?

45
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,480
Nothing, I'm just dead on my feet.

46
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,520
I'm like a baby.

47
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,440
When I'm hungry or sleepy,

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,360
I start to feel down.

49
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,280
You're stressed out, huh?

50
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,200
About the thing with Raúl,
and, well, about everything, I guess.

51
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,520
About everything, yeah.

52
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,000
The police are closing in on us,

53
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,120
and it kills me
that your brother is so distant from us.

54
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,480
That's the truth.

55
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,560
-Right.
-I can't stand it.

56
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,640
Look, Chloe, I know
you've always thought of me as evil.

57
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,480
And selfish

58
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,240
and fickle.

59
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,400
You're crazy, scheming, manipulative.

60
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay, enough already.

61
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,760
But you're also a lioness

62
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,920
who will do anything to defend me.

63
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,160
And a woman who,
even having nothing, has had it all,

64
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,760
and has fought on
so that I would want for nothing.

65
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,760
So I could be whoever I wanted to be,
no matter what anyone else said.

66
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,800
Mom, it's taken me a while,
but I see the things in you

67
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,240
that aren't so bad, let's say.

68
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,360
Come here.

69
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,360
My love.

70
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm so stuck.
I swear, I don't know what to do.

71
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,240
But you've never known, Mom.

72
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,080
That never stopped you.

73
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,760
That's never stopped you.
You've always pushed right on ahead.

74
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Right.

75
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,600
But now I think that I won't see
Iván again, after I found him, and

76
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,240
that anything could happen to you
because of the thing with Raúl.

77
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,200
I don't know what to do,

78
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,200
but I would do anything,
no matter how crazy.

79
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,880
I know. But look, Mom.

80
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,560
If you're feeling stuck, for once,
let someone else take care of you.

81
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,880
Just this once.

82
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,920
I'll take charge on all fronts,
and make sure you're okay.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,040
Just this once.

84
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
Okay?

85
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,640
Yes?

86
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,360
When did you get so grown up?

87
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,880
-I don't know. It just happened.
-No, I mean it.

88
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,080
You're getting Botox tomorrow.

89
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,920
-Are you serious?
-What do you mean?

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,520
-About the Botox?
-Let's see.

91
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,640
Preventive Botox. Do that again.

92
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,400
-This is so pronounced already.
-Mom!

93
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,040
Come here! I can't stand how sad
it makes me to see you grow up so much.

94
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,160
PE CLASS YESTERDAY WAS EMBARRASSING
YOU OWE ME A SINGLET

95
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,840
Good morning!

96
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,440
So? How did you sleep?

97
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,040
Really well, to be honest.

98
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,040
Good. Because today's the big day.

99
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,400
-What?
-The tests to join Alumni.

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,720
Trials?

101
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,880
Trials, plural?

102
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,600
As many as I come up with.

103
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,760
How many will there be?

104
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,600
I just told you.
As many as I come up with.

105
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,480
See you later, okay?

106
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,360
Are you ready?

107
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,560
Very ready.

108
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,160
Nervous?

109
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,920
To be honest, no.

110
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,680
Should I be?

111
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,840
Not at all.

112
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,440
Can you get me a Diet Cola?

113
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,400
This is a test for Alumni.

114
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,800
Could be.

115
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, okay.

116
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,040
Now I get it.
This is like some hazing thing, right?

117
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,720
Go get me that Diet Cola.

118
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,200
Okay.

119
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,760
Is she paying for it?

120
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,520
Hon, it's a can, for God's sake.
It's not a barrel of Brent oil.

121
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,080
Are you willing
to humiliate yourself to join?

122
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,320
Is this humiliating myself?

123
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,720
Bowing your head
and obeying her like a boss? Yes.

124
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,960
Oh, babe. Anarcho-syndicalism
this early in the morning? No way.

125
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,920
Why do you want to join?

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,640
Because we're graduating. This is over.

127
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,240
I can make contacts that I'll need.

128
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,400
They're so demanding.
They want you to be there all the time.

129
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,720
It's not a big deal.

130
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Babe, they're like a cult.
That's what people say.

131
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,480
Then I'll make sure
that the cult doesn't suck me in.

132
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,160
-You don't believe in us anymore, do you?
-What?

133
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,360
-Do you?
-What?

134
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,480
When school's over, you'll break up
with me, and you're getting ready.

135
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,520
Why do you--

136
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,960
You're just getting ready
so it doesn't hurt as much when it's time.

137
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,240
-Don't worry about me. Let's quit now.
-Eric.

138
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Eric, stop.

139
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,560
You don't know how happy you make me.

140
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,360
Besides, if we break up,
it'll be because you leave me.

141
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,840
No.

142
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,760
-No?
-That's not gonna happen.

143
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,200
Well, there you go.
It's never gonna happen.

144
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
Okay?

145
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,720
Isadora, you want me to come in
five hours before my shift,

146
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,320
and this is my time off.

147
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,080
I know it's just this once.
And tomorrow, it will be twice.

148
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,680
I doubt you'll pay me overtime
when you don't even pay me a living wage.

149
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,680
What is it?

150
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,200
Yeah, okay, I'm coming.
I'll be right there.

151
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,280
What do you mean, "Take a cab"?

152
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,960
Do you know how much that costs?

153
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,160
I appreciate you paying me half.
That's very kind of you.

154
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,120
Half?

155
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,200
I'd rather take the bus.

156
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,400
Okay, that's fine.
I'll get a taxi. All right, bye.

157
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,000
Omar, this stress
isn't good for you at all.

158
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,920
Maybe I'm just not ready
to go back to normal life yet.

159
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,040
You are. What you're not ready for
is to have a boss who's so…

160
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,080
Say it.

161
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,400
Say it, Sis. Go on, say it.

162
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,640
Stand up to her!

163
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,360
-Let's have breakfast.
-I can't.

164
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,600
What? I mean, call her and tell her.

165
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,520
I can't, Nadia, dammit!

166
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,960
Don't stress me out even more!

167
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,120
We had plans.

168
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,840
Rain check?

169
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,000
Omar, I'm flying to New York tomorrow.

170
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,760
Let's have lunch, then.

171
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,560
Or dinner?

172
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,960
Or we can meet up tomorrow
before you go. Okay?

173
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,400
Is that a plan? Yeah?

174
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,760
-Yes.
-Yes?

175
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Love you!

176
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,760
Oh my God.

177
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,480
Thanks, Chloe. See you around.

178
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,880
Are you okay?

179
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
I'm fine.

180
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Hmm?

181
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,960
I love you.

182
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,240
I love you too.

183
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,920
I mean, I love you.
I love you. I love you.

184
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Bye.

185
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Good morning.

186
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Why are you here?

187
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,520
I was on patrol,
and I stopped by to say hello.

188
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,880
On patrol? An inspector?

189
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,840
Yeah, well, I still walk the beat
once in a while.

190
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,480
I can't talk to you now, Luis.
I have a work meeting.

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,120
I'll stop by later.

192
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Look, with all due respect
and all my affection,

193
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,080
I've told you a thousand times
that I don't want any contact with you.

194
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,760
You can't just show up here like this.
I'm gonna end up calling the…

195
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,640
Calling the police?

196
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
I'm sorry.

197
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,680
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to trouble you.

198
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,080
My meeting.

199
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,880
-A big party? Today?
-Huge.

200
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,760
We can't do something like this
with no money, no license…

201
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,280
Shut up! What did I say?
How do you make money?

202
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,000
-You spend it, my love.
-We can't even pay for ice!

203
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,240
I'll ask for favors.

204
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,560
-Favors you'll need to return.
-Exactly. That's my problem.

205
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,400
The DJ booth has to be epic.

206
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,440
You're DJing?

207
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,400
I don't feel like it.
And I don't draw crowds anymore.

208
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,640
Then who is affordable and brings them in?

209
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,880
Whoa! You're anxious all of a sudden.

210
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,920
I'll make some calls.
In the meantime, use "surprise DJ."

211
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
What about the booth?

212
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,640
You're gonna flip.

213
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,160
Like this.

214
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,520
That's worth more than my house, Isadora.

215
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,080
It's not just the structure
but the people who set it up, the time--

216
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,360
No, no way. The waiters can set it up.

217
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,160
How many waiters should I hire?

218
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,000
-Eleven.
-What?

219
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,200
Eleven.

220
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,320
Eleven more? Or 11 in total?

221
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,720
Eleven in total.

222
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,560
No need to spend a fortune.

223
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,800
Get a grip. I think
you have to watch your tone again.

224
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,240
I can't pay for the structure
and 11 waiters.

225
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,000
Well, get rid of some people.
How many? Four? Tell you what.

226
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,320
Send the bouncers home.
Except the doorman.

227
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,720
A mega party with no security?

228
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,680
And no insurance. Whatever.

229
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,240
I'm sorry.
I can't work in these conditions.

230
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,760
Oh, Omar. Don't say that.

231
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,480
Everything's gonna be great.
You're the best. Have faith in yourself.

232
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,160
Can I offer you 5%
of the proceeds as a bonus?

233
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,800
Deal?

234
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,680
All right! Fucking awesome. It's a party!

235
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,280
-Thanks.
-Party!

236
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,440
Let's party!

237
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,880
Us two, alone in the shower,
not looking at each other?

238
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,040
Well, I did look at you quite a bit.

239
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,920
Head to toe.

240
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,760
I don't know, Iván. I wasn't comfortable.

241
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,320
It was kinda weird, after what--

242
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,760
Sorry about the argument.

243
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,320
I really missed you too,

244
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,840
and I was worked up.

245
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,040
Me too.

246
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,920
How are you?
Did you find a place to sleep yet?

247
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,280
Yes. Yeah, I'm crashing at Alumni.

248
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
I see.

249
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,360
I saw you getting cozy with the president.

250
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,560
Well, we get along well.

251
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,240
He thinks I'd fit in, and I want to join.

252
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,560
But that's it. Nothing more to it.

253
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,200
Look, I'd love to get back together.

254
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,320
And pick things up where we left off.

255
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,880
I wish I could say yes, but

256
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,560
it's not easy to forget what happened.

257
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,920
Especially the argument.

258
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,600
I know, and I totally get it,

259
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,600
but what if we take it slow?

260
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,960
We could start by spending
the night together, if you like.

261
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,720
Let me think about it.

262
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,920
Okay?

263
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Okay.

264
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,480
SHOULD WE START?

265
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,360
Record the girls showering
in the locker room.

266
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,280
What?

267
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,840
-Are you kidding me?
-No, why?

268
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,880
I expected something else.

269
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,800
-Something else?
-Something less…

270
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,120
Less what?

271
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,920
Less childish?

272
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,760
Less like primary school?

273
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,720
It would have been a few years ago.

274
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,200
These days,
with all the feminist bullshit,

275
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,040
you could end up in jail.

276
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Or worse,

277
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,680
expelled.

278
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,200
"Feminist bullshit"?

279
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,320
Radical feminists.

280
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,800
Feminazis.

281
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,840
The stinky, hairy ones.

282
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,560
You know what, Héctor?
I just lost my interest in joining.

283
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,760
-I'm kidding, Joel, damn it!
-Also, my best friend is Black.

284
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,160
What does that have to do with feminazis?

285
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,680
Okay, fine.

286
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Hey.

288
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,080
Will you forgive me?

289
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,200
What if I get caught?

290
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,680
You have to prove to me
that you'll do anything to belong.

291
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,800
Even risk losing your spot
at the best school in the country.

292
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,040
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT?

293
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,480
Girls, whose bag is this?

294
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
Joel.

295
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,640
Looking for this?

296
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,800
Cousin!

297
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,720
-What's wrong?
-I don't know.

298
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,360
-Should I call a doctor?
-I don't know if it's anxiety or what.

299
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,800
Should I call my parents?

300
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,920
Eric!

301
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,840
Fuck.

302
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Chloe!

303
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,800
My love, are you all right?

304
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,240
-No, something's wrong with me.
-Did you take your meds?

305
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,080
-Yes. You don't trust me, do you?
-I didn't say that.

306
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,840
"The kid has anxiety
'cause he didn't take his pill."

307
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,480
-Stop imagining things.
-Don't gaslight me, dammit.

308
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,800
What do you mean?

309
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
Well, it seems you're gonna leave me.

310
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,520
-Deny it, and I'll snap.
-No.

311
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,880
You use that condescending tone
to get me to take my meds.

312
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,680
Don't act all innocent.

313
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,000
Excuse me, Emilia.

314
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,880
This should not be happening.

315
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,920
It's not nerves, right? No, this is me.

316
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,040
It just is what it is.

317
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,400
Go take care of him.

318
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,640
Excuse me.

319
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
Eric.

320
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,240
Maybe Eric can tell you something.

321
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,560
Do you really think
my cousin is fit to play detective now?

322
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,240
Right.

323
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,760
But maybe he knows something
about Chloe and Raúl, and you can tell me.

324
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,680
There's trouble when we talk about her.

325
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,800
Right.

326
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,320
Are you okay?

327
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,280
I don't know what else to do.

328
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,360
Maybe let it be.

329
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,440
And accept that what they say happened
is what happened.

330
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,920
Raúl would never do that.

331
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,520
I think you're starting to forget
who Raúl was. And all he did to you.

332
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,000
-He deserved to die for it?
-I'm not saying that.

333
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,840
I'm saying don't romanticize
your relationship with him.

334
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,560
Don't let your memory
turn him into someone he wasn't.

335
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,480
Okay?

336
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,320
Hug?

337
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,680
No, I can't. I can't.

338
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,680
Sara.

339
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,920
Give me the keys.

340
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,320
Give them to me. Come on.

341
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,400
I said no. I'm going.

342
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,840
Nico! Nico, come on!

343
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,960
I won't leave you alone until you go in.

344
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,880
You go first? Or I go first?

345
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Okay, I go first.

346
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,840
You can open your eyes now.

347
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,840
Thank you.

348
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,760
Hi.

349
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,160
How's your boyfriend?

350
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,560
Better. I sent him home,
so I hope he'll be okay.

351
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,600
He does have a lot of fits, doesn't he?

352
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,240
I heard he makes a huge racket.

353
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,960
No. Well, he used to.

354
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,560
But he's on medication now
and goes to therapy, so he's much better.

355
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,320
He's a different person.

356
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,760
Come, sit.

357
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,360
I'm worried this might affect
your membership.

358
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,600
If you get in.

359
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,960
Why? I don't see why it should.

360
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,000
It's simply a matter of priorities.

361
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,440
How far are you willing to go
to be one of us?

362
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,160
Look, I swear Eric is okay,
and I don't know if--

363
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
Mental problems never go away.

364
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
His episodes will be less frequent,

365
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,760
but they'll always plague him.

366
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,600
And then what?

367
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,160
What do you mean?

368
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,880
You'll drop what you're doing,

369
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,200
even if you're with us,
to go and take care of him, won't you?

370
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,000
Well, of course I will.

371
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,600
-Obviously.
-That's my point.

372
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,640
Obviously.

373
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,520
Priorities.

374
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,000
I'll see you around. Bye.

375
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,000
So that was my test.

376
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,640
What?

377
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,040
What you just asked me.

378
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,240
Whether I'd put Eric before Alumni, right?

379
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,680
No, not at all.

380
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,720
That was just a question. A quick chat.

381
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,920
-Bye.
-Right. Bye.

382
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,040
You were recording the girls
while they showered, weren't you?

383
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,840
Are you aware that this
is not a childish prank but a crime?

384
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,280
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Virginia.

385
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,040
But why did you do it?

386
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,640
Was it your idea, or were you coerced?

387
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,560
Because this
doesn't seem like you, to be honest.

388
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,120
Tell me.

389
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,040
Joel, if you don't reply,

390
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,520
I'll have to expel you right now.

391
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,680
Please explain what happened.

392
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,000
Good morning!

393
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,320
Did anything happen?

394
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,680
That's Joel's phone.

395
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,680
Here. Go to the club,
and wait for me there.

396
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,240
Close the door on your way out.

397
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,200
-What are you doing?
-Giving you a hand.

398
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,120
Because if you expel Joel,

399
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,720
an attorney, a really good one,
will sue Las Encinas for malpractice.

400
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,160
And then someone will leak the video.

401
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,080
Those poor girls will be exposed,
and their parents will ask themselves,

402
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,600
"How was the video leaked?
How was it recorded?"

403
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,080
Your management will be questioned.

404
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,120
They'll let you take the fall.

405
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,600
I don't want you to go, Virginia.
I really don't.

406
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm really fond of you.

407
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,760
So I will delete the video.

408
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,080
Okay? You have my word.

409
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,280
Let's pretend nothing happened.

410
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,400
No need to thank me, I guess.

411
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,360
You scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours. Right?

412
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,360
Okay. You won't get expelled.

413
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,800
Seriously?

414
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,200
But what did you say to her?

415
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,360
Come. Sit down and show me the video.

416
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,960
-What for?
-Sit down and show me the video.

417
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,760
But why?

418
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,840
Because that's the next test.

419
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,320
And close the door.

420
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,280
That's fucking hot.

421
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,240
Does it turn you on?

422
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,920
Everything beautiful and pervy does.

423
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,360
-I should leave you to it, then.
-No.

424
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,880
-The test.
-What test?

425
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,760
That's right. Look at me.

426
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,240
You're getting a hard-on.

427
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,560
No, it's best if you don't.

428
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,680
You can't come.

429
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,720
That's the test.

430
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,960
Stop. We'll get caught.

431
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,800
Yeah? You think so? Let's see.

432
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,120
Héctor.

433
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,240
Don't give up.
You're so close to joining Alumni.

434
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,760
Did you come?

435
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,720
Héctor!

436
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,080
Where are you?

437
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,640
Yes, yes! Don't come in. I'll come out.

438
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,960
What are you doing?

439
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,960
You'll continue later.

440
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
Yes?

441
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,000
The whiskey is good, huh?

442
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,640
If I slept with Iván, I'd be saying,
"Yes, I'm your little kept trophy."

443
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,320
That was my argument,
and yours, up until now.

444
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,560
-Now I doubt it's really yours.
-What?

445
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,880
-You just convince yourself of it.
-I'm with Chloe, love.

446
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,240
-You want to get back with Iván.
-Of course I do.

447
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,360
But I won't if we're not on equal terms.

448
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,040
-Who's on equal terms? Sonia and I?
-No, you're not. That's why.

449
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,200
What do you mean?
Sonia won't buy me a bag of chips.

450
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,680
Because I won't allow it.

451
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,000
If you don't want to feel like a kept man,
don't allow it, man.

452
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,560
But you do allow it.

453
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
You let people take care of you.

454
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,600
What do you mean?

455
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,520
The president of that club?

456
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,080
Look, there's Iván.

457
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,080
Did you know
he forked over two million to Chloe's mom?

458
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,560
Well, his own mom. So she'd get lost.

459
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,960
Who? The club guy?

460
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,600
No. Iván.

461
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,360
Chloe's mom is Iván's mom?

462
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,280
Follow me. Two million, okay?
Two. Just like that.

463
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
Easy as me giving you
a drink on the house.

464
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,480
Well, no. They'd take it out of my pay.

465
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,920
Same thing.

466
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,440
In short, yes,
I do want to get back with him.

467
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,600
But I've got to stand on my own two feet.

468
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,800
No benefactor or wealthy family?
If you're born poor, you die poor.

469
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,680
So what should I do?

470
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,080
If you love him, go get him.

471
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,080
You saw how quickly
he forgot about you in South Africa.

472
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,800
Oh, great. Thanks. That's great.

473
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,160
Thanks for making me even more insecure.

474
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,360
It's what I think.

475
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,760
Right. What about your papers? All good?

476
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,640
Son of a bitch.

477
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,600
That was a low blow, you jerk.

478
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,040
Go get the millionaire.

479
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,520
-Dalmar.
-We don't want you to be a kept man.

480
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,680
Go get him.

481
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,760
I'm chained to this bar. I can't.

482
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,280
Are you in love with him or not?

483
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,120
-Leave me alone.
-Just make something up.

484
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,480
-I said leave me alone.
-Bring him ice, glasses, lemons.

485
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,760
Whatever! Go on!

486
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,680
Okay.

487
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,720
I JUST THOUGHT OF ANOTHER TEST. NOW.

488
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,400
I'M WORKING.

489
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,000
LEAVE AND COME MEET ME.
WHERE ARE YOUR PRIORITIES?

490
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,320
OFFLINE

491
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Hey!

492
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,640
Didn't we agree you'd stay home and rest?

493
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,040
Yes, but I feel fine.

494
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,200
I'd rather be with you
than at home, staring at the ceiling.

495
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,760
I'll order. Want anything? And you?

496
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,320
I'm okay.
And you shouldn't be drinking, please.

497
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,240
-Don't you trust me?
-I do, but you had a fit today.

498
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,640
-A fit?
-Yes, a fit. An episode.

499
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,920
Saying that because you're sick of me?

500
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,120
-I'm not sick of you.
-Relax, it's just an expression.

501
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,600
I'm very relaxed, thank you.

502
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,480
-Don't talk to her like that.
-You were staying home.

503
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,080
-Just what we needed.
-Shit.

504
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,560
-Wasn't he going to stay home?
-I told him that.

505
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,520
You didn't confuse him by texting
things like "stay home" and "I miss you"?

506
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,440
Nico, stop.

507
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,560
Stay out of it, man.

508
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,000
Everybody stop.
What the hell's wrong with you?

509
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,400
Am I always to blame for everything?

510
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,720
-Chloe.
-No, I don't want to talk now.

511
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,720
-Is everything okay?
-You two have some fucking nerve!

512
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,200
You happy now, cousin?

513
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,520
Eric, wait!

514
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Hi.

515
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,000
Hey, I haven't seen you in a while.

516
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,720
Yeah, I had to sort something out
with Isa.

517
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,720
Fucking shit!

518
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,320
-I'll get a mop.
-Someone else can. You're off the clock.

519
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,080
-Iván, look at that mess.
-I paid Isa to let you off.

520
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,480
We can go to my place now.
She charged me bar manager rates, but--

521
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,240
I said I wanted to think about it.

522
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,120
-But do you like the idea?
-Yeah.

523
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,280
-That's it, then.
-You can't make decisions about my job.

524
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,280
Joel, I'm not…

525
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,040
Ask Isa for your money back,
and wait until I'm done.

526
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,400
-But I spoke to--
-You know what? Don't wait for me.

527
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,000
-I'm not in the fucking mood.
-But, Joel…

528
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,280
Damn, I'm fed up with this, Iván.

529
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,520
Now you're paying my boss
so you can spend the night with me.

530
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,520
I'm not even your kept man anymore.
I'm just your whore.

531
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
Go.

532
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,960
Just go and let me work.

533
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,440
Omar!

534
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,320
Omar!

535
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,000
Omar!

536
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,440
Checking up on me?

537
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,800
Getting to know the place.

538
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,280
Right.

539
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,400
It's really cool.

540
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm okay, Nadia.

541
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,840
I'm really busy.
Have a drink, and I'll find you later.

542
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,680
Hey!

543
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,120
Careful, huh?

544
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,760
Fuck! My bike!

545
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,040
-What?
-It's gone!

546
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,080
He can't work without his bike.

547
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,920
-He needs to report it himself.
-No, he's too nervous.

548
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,800
Come here, kid.
We need your ID for the report.

549
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,360
-I'm the one reporting it!
-Isn't the bike his?

550
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,400
Kid!

551
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,320
I left my ID at home.
She said she was going to report it.

552
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,920
Are you sure? Do you have any?

553
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,720
Are you asking because he's Black?

554
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,080
No, I'm sure he has papers
if he's working.

555
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,080
-Give me your details. I'll look you up.
-Look.

556
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,720
Forget it. We'll be back some other day.
It's only a bike.

557
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,840
My love. Uh…

558
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,240
I've been thinking about it, and yes,

559
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,440
maybe it's best if I stay away.

560
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,720
Well, stay away. We're in the same class
and share the same friends.

561
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,600
But

562
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,000
I think it's best
for us to just be friends.

563
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,480
Maybe they are right,

564
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,800
and I'm not what's best for you.

565
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,960
I do believe, my love,
that I give you the best of me, but

566
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,440
with your insecurity and your episodes,

567
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,920
although they're less and less frequent,
what you need

568
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,000
is to not have to worry.

569
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,320
We'll talk about it in person, okay?

570
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,400
But… now you can let it sink in,

571
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,920
and it won't catch you by surprise.

572
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,680
Omar.

573
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,640
Hey, easy. Easy.

574
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,560
Breathe.

575
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,640
Hi, Isadora.

576
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,960
Don't worry. These things happen.

577
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:00,000
Omar, I'm going to need all the papers.
The permit, the insurance policy--

578
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,120
Excuse me.

579
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,480
It's not the right time.

580
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,960
Take him to the paramedics.

581
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,840
Can you show me the papers?

582
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,120
Who can show them to me?

583
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,560
I don't have them.

584
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,080
What?

585
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,920
I have no permit,
no insurance, no money. I have nothing.

586
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,320
Come with me.

587
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,800
Stop! What are you doing?

588
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,320
If you want,
I can try to misplace the report.

589
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,760
What?

590
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,160
Ask me. I'll do whatever it takes
to make sure this goes nowhere.

591
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,880
Sure, it'll be complicated.

592
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,160
Much more than sneaking the phone
into jail, but if you ask me,

593
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,640
I'll do everything in my power.

594
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,440
You won't stop until my whole family
is in jail, including myself.

595
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,480
Why do you say that?

596
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,840
I've seen what you are capable of, Luis.

597
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,920
I'm doing a favor for a friend.

598
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,480
Right. In exchange for what?

599
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,360
Friends don't ask for anything.
It doesn't work like that.

600
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,400
You'll want something in return.
We both know that.

601
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:36,120
Isa, what matters now is whether you need
and want me to help you.

602
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,280
Yes.

603
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,880
Yes, I want you to help me, Luis.
Do what you have to do.

604
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,680
You should go. You'll miss your flight.

605
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,360
I have time.

606
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
How are you, man?

607
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,240
I slept on the floor

608
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,120
with a scrap of cloth
that barely covered my knees.

609
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,800
I wasn't allowed to take a piss.

610
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,440
I'll take him to his room.

611
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,560
And they let me go
as though they were doing me a favor.

612
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,560
But anyway, I have a record now.

613
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,640
They're after me.

614
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,560
Let's go.

615
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,160
I mean,

616
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,120
this apartment is full of misfortune
and piles of shit.

617
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,600
I'm going to bed too.

618
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,800
Go on. Hurry back to New York.

619
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,840
And to your dream internship at the UN.

620
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,640
-I'm not sure if that's what I should do.
-Hmm, yes.

621
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,080
It's the only thing you should do.

622
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,080
Get out of here while you can.

623
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,000
Thanks, Mom.

624
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,000
Bye, darling.

625
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,160
Honey!

626
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,120
Sure you don't want us
to go and do girlie things?

627
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,840
Mom, I have to talk to Eric.

628
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,400
If he's here,
because he probably stayed home.

629
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,320
I just want you to be okay.

630
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,400
-I know. And me too.
-So let's go! Skip class.

631
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,000
Mom, I have something important
to deal with.

632
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,360
It's not because I don't want to, okay?

633
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,200
-I love you.
-Me too.

634
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,840
Emilia.

635
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,720
-Hi, Chloe.
-Hi.

636
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,280
Good morning.

637
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,800
I wanted to ask you if you've made
a decision about me and Alumni.

638
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,560
-Unfortunately not.
-I left Eric.

639
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,800
Priorities, right?

640
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,840
And on top of that, I'm on file.

641
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,480
Getting my papers now is…

642
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,480
Don't think about that.

643
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,560
I'll be right back.

644
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:58,720
CHOOSE USERNAME

645
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,800
I KNOW YOU GOT 2 MILLION EUROS.
SHOULD WE TALK?

646
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,080
Good morning.

647
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,120
You should find
another place to sleep, okay?

648
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,880
Come here.

649
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,040
What?

650
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,120
I said come here.

651
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,520
Please.

652
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,000
What? What do you want?

653
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,520
I want to join the club.

654
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,720
-Your priorities weren't clear last night.
-They weren't clear to me.

655
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,280
This was my test, wasn't it?

656
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,520
You messed with me with your tests,

657
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,920
but you expected this, right?

658
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,240
You wanted to know
if I'd do whatever it took.

659
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,960
So there you go.

660
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,680
Is that what I am to you?

661
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,760
A sacrifice?

662
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,040
Does it matter?

663
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,960
If you want it, take it.

664
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,400
You guys are used to taking
whatever you want.

665
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,640
Come on, then.

666
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,720
You have my permission.

667
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,160
Héctor. Héctor, look at me.

668
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,760
Héctor. Héctor, take it easy.

669
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,400
Breathe.

670
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,720
It's okay.

671
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,320
