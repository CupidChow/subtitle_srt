1
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,640
Bravo! Nice!

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,240
Hottie!

3
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,040
I don't know what got into me.
I have no idea what I was thinking.

4
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,800
I'll wait for you on the dock at the lake.

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,640
Please come and hear me out.

6
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,680
-I never got that message.
-It says here it was sent.

7
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
I never got that message, damn it!

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,560
It's not the same.

9
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Why isn't it the same? Why?

10
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,600
-Tell me.
-It was just sex for you.

11
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,920
Are you hung up on him now? Is that it?

12
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,440
No way.

13
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,520
No fucking way, Omar.

14
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,360
Are you fucking kidding me?

15
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,240
Listen, Ander, I don't…

16
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,640
I don't know…

17
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,040
Dammit, I'm really confused here, Ander!

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,520
-Let's go talk by the lake.
-Talk about what?

19
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,400
What's there to talk about?

20
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,640
Rebeka's sleeping, so go the fuck home.

21
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,520
What's going on, Mom?

22
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,760
-Hi.
-Hi.

23
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,320
Let her in, please.

24
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,880
I didn't know
what I was getting myself into.

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,000
It happened too many times
for you not to know.

26
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,440
Rebe, I can't change what happened.

27
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,920
I wish I could, but I can't.

28
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,320
But I can change
what happens from here on out.

29
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,880
Are you kidding me?

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,760
Do I look like a total sucker to you?

31
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,640
When I got home,
I had an excuse ready, but nobody asked,

32
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,120
because they couldn't care less.

33
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,080
They were probably relieved.

34
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,880
And I liked that feeling… of relief.

36
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,840
It was the same sense of relief
I felt when you hugged me

37
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,680
after seeing all that.

38
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,920
Wait.

39
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,560
Come over here.

40
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,080
Don't ever do this to me again.

41
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,480
Have you seen Ari?

42
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,280
She said she'd be here.

43
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,360
I'd go with the personal stuff first.

44
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,360
And use facts later.

45
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,160
Facts are boring.

46
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,000
Emotion is transcendent.

47
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,320
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE

48
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,560
How was your weekend?

49
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,360
-Uh… good. It was nice out, wasn't it?
-Yeah.

50
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,240
Did Mencía say anything else?

51
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,400
No. It's better not to talk to her.

52
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
I see.

53
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,240
So…

54
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,000
Show me what you've got.

55
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,400
Okay.

56
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,440
No, stay there. Over there is fine.

57
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,560
I can go first. I'm looking forward to it.

58
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,320
Very well.

59
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Prisoner reintegration is a pipe dream.
It's been demonstrated by evidence.

60
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,560
Its success depends on the inmate,
not state institutions.

61
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,280
In fact, our country has
the highest incarceration rate in Europe--

62
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,280
But not the highest crime rate.

63
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,720
García, we're not debating in a bar.

64
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,280
Wait your turn to respond
and don't raise your voice.

65
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,680
We're above the European average,

66
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,640
with 126 prisoners
for every 100,000 inhabitants.

67
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,000
And that, Samuel, is a fact.

68
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,960
That's 126 prisoners
with 126 families and 126 friends.

69
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,360
Inmates have families and friends.
I don't know if you've considered that.

70
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,600
I have, but we're not talking about them.

71
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,120
Of course we are. It goes without saying.

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,320
Are you talking about people or numbers?

73
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,880
Talking about numbers
takes away the human element.

74
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,520
Look,

75
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,560
I picture myself,
Samuel García, going to prison.

76
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
About to serve a really long sentence.

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,600
And I imagine
all the Samuel Garcías in prison.

78
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,480
My family and friends could help me,
but they wouldn't be allowed to.

79
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Because once you're a convict,
that's all they'll let you be.

80
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,680
That's what happens
when you reduce people to labels.

81
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,000
You strip them of their humanity.
Numbers do that too.

82
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,800
And that's all I have to say.

83
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Thank you.

84
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,080
You'll need to refine it a bit,
but keep up the good work.

85
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,400
What were you up to this weekend?

86
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,160
It's better to let Samuel think
he can beat me.

87
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,480
We just saw that he can.

88
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,720
And if that were to happen,
I'd be quite disappointed.

89
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,440
You.
What were you doing on Friday evening?

90
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,640
Excuse me?

91
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,760
-What were you doing on Friday evening?
-Envy really is an awful thing, Ivanka.

92
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,440
Isn't it enough to have two guys
fighting over you?

93
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,840
-I was with her.
-From what time to what time?

94
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,640
I don't know exactly.

95
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,080
What's this about?

96
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,840
My sister came home with bruises on her.

97
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,120
-From what time to what time?
-I don't know.

98
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,200
He was with me. He just told you.

99
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,800
Just stay away from my sister.

100
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,240
Understood? Stay away.

101
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't know what her deal is.

102
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,040
PHILLIPE VON TRIESENBERG ABUSE

103
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,120
NO RESULTS FOUND FOR YOUR SEARCH

104
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,200
You can't go accusing people
without proof.

105
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,840
I have my reasons.

106
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,120
Fine. If you're so sure,
why don't you report him?

107
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,240
Because, like you said,
I don't have proof.

108
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,880
Without proof, I don't report people.
That's just the kind of girl I am.

109
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,880
The girl in his country
didn't report him either.

110
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,640
Must be the kind of girl she is.

111
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,640
Honey…

112
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,120
Look, I get that you like Phillipe.

113
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,680
And I'm not saying
that he doesn't like you.

114
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,360
But it's not the same thing.

115
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,320
You always expected a no,
and he always expected a yes.

116
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,280
People like Phillipe
don't know what "no" means.

117
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,040
And this is none of my business,
but if I were you,

118
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,120
I wouldn't wait for proof to distrust him.

119
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,920
Once you have proof, it might be too late.

120
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,880
If there's one thing
you and I have in common,

121
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,840
it's that we're both women.

122
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,400
If we don't help each other out, who will?

123
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,280
I guess you hate me now.

124
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,920
I just want to say
I'm here for you if you need me.

125
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,760
If you want.

126
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,600
We all made our own choices.
I have nothing to forgive you for.

127
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,240
Well, then… sorry about what I told you
and how I told you.

128
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,640
Please forgive me for that.

129
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,920
Okay.

130
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,240
If you need me to forgive you
for something, I forgive you.

131
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,960
Cool.

132
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,440
Thanks.

133
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,800
Ander…

134
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,080
Just think, you were hooked up
to a chemo machine for a year.

135
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,520
You shouldn't be feeling guilty
or asking for forgiveness… or permission.

136
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,560
OMAR, I NEED TO SEE YOU.

137
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,000
What is it?

138
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,440
I wouldn't have beat cancer without you.

139
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,320
What you did was amazing, and…

140
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,080
I'll never forget it, but…

141
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,200
No, don't say it.

142
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,240
Omar…

143
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,520
maybe it took its toll on us too.

144
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Not on me.

145
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,560
I promise you.

146
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,800
I admit I was majorly confused,
but not anymore.

147
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,400
When I thought about losing you…

148
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,600
I only love you.

149
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,960
Listen.

150
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,840
This isn't about Patrick.

151
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,600
This is about me.

152
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,840
I thought I was gonna die,
but I'm still here.

153
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,840
I just want to live.

154
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,400
There's a ton of stuff out there
for me to do. A ton.

155
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
But you can do that stuff with me.

156
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,120
It's me.

157
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,320
Omar.

158
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,680
It's me…

159
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,240
-I know.
-Omar.

160
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,240
And you have to keep being Omar, okay?

161
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,760
That's why I think
we should end things now.

162
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,320
Because I don't want this
to turn into something else.

163
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,840
Thank you.

164
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,080
Thank you, Omar. I really mean it.

165
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,000
And I'm sorry, okay?

166
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,320
I thought I'd take you out
for dinner tonight.

167
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,160
-So you can clear your head.
-You got me to go out last weekend.

168
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,640
-Look at me now.
-You'd rather be in the library with him?

169
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,720
What if we have dinner at my place?

170
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,880
We could hang out…

171
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,520
With your dad?

172
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,040
Not what I had in mind, to be honest.

173
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,840
Well, it's just the start.
The rest is okay.

174
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,600
Ari, García is coming over
so I can look at both your arguments.

175
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,360
-How are you, Nunier?
-All good, thanks.

176
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,360
Dinner at your place it is.

177
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,280
SHARE MY LOCATION

178
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,680
DID YOU BLOCK ME?

179
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,560
What is it?

180
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,920
Armando.

181
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,840
What?

182
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,680
What the hell does he want?
We're calling the police right now.

183
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,760
Whoa, hold on.
Do you want my family to find out?

184
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,360
So you do care now?

185
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,280
Well, my family,
the whole school, and everyone.

186
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,680
Just chill, okay?

187
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,200
I can handle him, Rebe.

188
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,880
Did you know I lived off chocolate
until I was three years old?

189
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,320
Really?

190
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,720
Hey.

191
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,440
I won't let that jackass
ruin our chocolate party.

192
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,160
No, Mencía…

193
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,440
Sorry, I can't resist.

194
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,760
Mencía…

195
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
-Thanks.
-Samuel?

196
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,000
None for me, thanks.
I wanna be at the top of my game tomorrow.

197
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,640
So if the winner goes
to the European Debate Championship,

198
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,280
they'll have to present in English.

199
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,640
Yes, of course.

200
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,640
What will you do?

201
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,080
You don't speak English?

202
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,320
I speak English pretty well.

203
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,720
For a hick.

204
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,320
What?

205
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,400
Don't worry. Ari's gonna win,
so it won't be a problem, right?

206
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,840
You should thank him, Samuel.

207
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,680
Why?

208
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,280
People like us rise to the occasion
when challenged.

209
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,440
Excuse me, "people like you"?

210
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,680
Yes. I mean scholarship students.

211
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,840
I see.

212
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,920
People who haven't been given
the same advantages as you three.

213
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,040
It's like you're the one
competing against Samuel.

214
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,560
-Me?
-Yes.

215
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,720
Not at all.
I just can't see you spending the holidays

216
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,360
with his family
in some hideout in Morocco.

217
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,240
What?

218
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,280
His brother fled there.
And his mom went with him.

219
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,720
I thought he'd been acquitted.

220
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,280
He didn't wait around for the verdict.

221
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,400
So he broke the law while on probation?

222
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,760
Imagine having that gem
for a brother-in-law.

223
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,560
See you tomorrow.

224
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,800
Mencía.

225
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,400
-What are you doing here?
-I just want to talk--

226
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,400
-Are you following me?
-I saw it on Instagram.

227
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,920
Mencía, please.

228
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,520
I just want to apologize.

229
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,480
Why?

230
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,120
I found out what happened, and… I'm sorry.

231
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,560
-That bastard is done for.
-Right.

232
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,720
He can say goodbye to his career
and everything else.

233
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,240
Can I drive you home?

234
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,040
I quit.

235
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,040
Maybe you need to change your number.

236
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,280
-Why?
-The other guy has it, right?

237
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,560
I blocked him, though.

238
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah, but he might give it to someone else
and start harassing you.

239
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,200
Oh. I hadn't thought about that.

240
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,880
Thank you.

241
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,800
Where are we?

242
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,440
Maybe we could have a drink
before I drop you home.

243
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,560
No. I don't think my girlfriend
would be too happy about that.

244
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,200
-I'm sorry. Bye.
-At least let me take you home, Mencía!

245
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,120
Mencía, please.

246
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,280
Mencía.

247
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,800
Let me give you a ride home. For real.

248
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,440
Hey.

249
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,520
I'm here for my stuff.

250
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,400
Yeah. Omar told me.

251
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,880
Do you need help?

252
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,960
No, I can manage. Thanks.

253
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,800
All right.

254
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,760
Do you want to check
to make sure you have everything?

255
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,080
Are you okay?

256
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,280
It's just that…

257
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,120
This can't be happening.

258
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,200
I mean, yeah, maybe I did have my doubts.

259
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,760
But not anymore. It's all clear now.
I can't believe this hurts so much.

260
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,640
And if it hurts this much,
it means I really love him, right?

261
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,120
This is the worst.

262
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
I can't breathe.

263
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,560
You think the knot in your stomach
will be there forever.

264
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,840
But one day, the knot starts to go away.

265
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,040
It starts hurting less and less.

266
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,560
Until you suddenly realize

267
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,840
you haven't thought of him once all day.

268
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,360
And you can't remember
why it hurt so much.

269
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,320
I can't forget him.

270
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,360
I can't and I don't want to.

271
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,960
Hell, it's Ander we're talking about here.
It's Ander.

272
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,440
Well, yeah, he came looking for me.

273
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,880
Why the hell did you lie to me?

274
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,760
-He just wanted to apologize.
-Sure.

275
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,320
This video shows what your mom saw.

276
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,120
What do you see?

277
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,400
Seems like
you only see what you want to see.

278
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,760
Haven't you wondered
how your mom knows that guy?

279
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,440
Or why he was outside her bar?
You haven't.

280
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,640
You just assume I'm lying.

281
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,200
What the hell are you saying about my mom?

282
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,600
The first time she saw us,
we were at her bar.

283
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,080
We went there for a drink…

284
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,480
and to buy coke from your mom.

285
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,440
No.

286
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
No, that's impossible.

287
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,880
-My mom quit that shit for me.
-No, Rebe. I quit for you. I did.

288
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,680
But you still trust your mom,
when she's the only liar here.

289
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,520
Patrick.

290
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,080
Yeah?

291
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,800
So…

292
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,880
How about we skip class today
and hang out?

293
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,080
How come?

294
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,320
I don't know. I feel like it.

295
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,400
They'll be busy with that dumb debate,
so they won't miss us.

296
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,920
What do you have in mind?

297
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,760
I was hoping you'd think of something.

298
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,960
-Mencía, have you seen Ander?
-Nope.

299
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,520
-Have you seen Rebe?
-No.

300
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,480
All right. I'll call you after the debate.

301
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,720
And Patrick, don't trash the house.
We don't want Benjamín to lose his shit.

302
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
Okay, bye.

303
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
DEBATE DAYS

304
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,080
Hey.

305
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,560
The dress code is shirtless.

306
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,000
Excuse me. Where's the bathroom?

307
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,640
Very good, Samuel. Thank you.

308
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,000
-Ariadna, whenever you're ready.
-Thank you.

309
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,600
The success of reintegration
depends on the inmate.

310
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,680
Some say former inmates
are not allowed to change.

311
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,480
But maybe they don't want to change.
Or maybe they can't change.

312
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Recidivism statistics are clear,
and there are specific examples…

313
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,480
In fact,

314
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,560
I'm sure my opponent will recall the case
of a man accused of murder two years ago.

315
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,160
He spent several weeks in prison

316
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,520
then violated probation
and fled the country.

317
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,360
He broke the law and added to his charges.

318
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,560
My opponent will recall the case because…

319
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,800
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE

320
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,440
…I'm talking about his brother.

321
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,160
-Why are you using that?
-Adding names to data is useful.

322
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,320
-I ask that my brother not be mentioned.
-Everyone here is familiar with this case.

323
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,320
It's not like
I'm revealing a state secret.

324
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,560
I'm sorry, Samuel.
I'm afraid Ariadna is right.

325
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,560
Samuel's brother…

326
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,000
Samuel!

327
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,480
-What's this tantrum about?
-Maybe we're not so alike after all.

328
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,000
-I'm over being questioned--
-Is it always like this with you?

329
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,680
You wallow in your misfortune
and use it to stay right where you are.

330
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,600
Not your Jedi master speech again, please.
I'm sick of it.

331
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,640
You want a Jedi master speech?
I'll give you one.

332
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,520
Do you know why I have so much respect
for the art of debate?

333
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,560
Because, like all the arts,

334
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,520
it represents life itself.

335
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,520
You can have all the right arguments.

336
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,000
You can prepare yourself
to the point of exhaustion, feel superior

337
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,240
and indestructible.

338
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:22,400
But then something unexpected
will break through your protective shield.

339
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,640
It always happens.

340
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,640
And then you find out how weak you are.

341
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,440
You realize
that all your ideas about yourself,

342
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,040
everything you had prepared…

343
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,280
is absolutely useless.

344
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,240
-I was looking for you.
-Oh, hello.

345
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,120
Would you like to stay over
at my place tonight?

346
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
Okay. Sure, okay.

347
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,720
And you can run away,

348
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,240
cry, and hide behind an excuse

349
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,640
that has nothing to do with you,
like your brother,

350
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,120
or you can strike back

351
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,400
and fight for what you want to be.

352
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
Let me know what you decide.

353
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,640
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE

354
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,080
And poor Samuel just up and left.

355
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,960
Right in the middle of the debate.

356
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,600
Ari didn't know what to do.

357
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,280
So… I wanted to ask, are you hungry?

358
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,280
-Yeah, a bit.
-Are you?

359
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,640
I'll see
if they can whip something up, okay?

360
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,840
-Fine.
-Okay.

361
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,080
I'll just get my phone…

362
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,880
What are you doing?

363
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Nothing. I wanted to play some music.

364
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,640
I thought we trusted each other.

365
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,200
I'm sorry. I don't know…

366
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,080
Ari's been getting into my head.

367
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,680
Ari has no idea where I was on Friday.

368
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,800
-Right.
-And you do. I was with you.

369
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,640
-Right?
-Yeah.

370
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,560
I'm sorry.

371
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,120
You have so little self-love,

372
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,760
you can't see why
someone like me would be with you.

373
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,720
And you're constantly looking
for reasons to break up.

374
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,640
I…

375
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,240
Will you always
be reminding me of who I am?

376
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,120
Looking for faults
with a magnifying glass?

377
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,760
Closer and closer.
So close that you can't even see it.

378
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,480
I see it. I do.

379
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,600
I see you, and I like you.
I like you so much. Please.

380
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,320
I'm not like the others, okay?

381
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,240
I'll tell the driver to take you home.

382
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,040
You can check that I deleted your video.

383
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,240
Or snoop around as much as you like.

384
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,240
Babe? Can't you hear me?
I've been calling you for a while.

385
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,760
Are you alone?

386
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,160
Shit, this house stinks of testosterone.

387
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,000
-Seriously?
-No.

388
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Thanks.

389
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
What's this?

390
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,320
I don't know.
It came when we were partying.

391
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,320
A NEW NUMBER SO YOU CAN START
FROM SCRATCH. BIG KISS, ARMANDO.

392
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,360
I RAN AWAY FROM HOME.

393
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,040
I didn't tell you about Nano
so that you'd use it against him.

394
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,840
And this winning at any cost thing, Ari…
I don't know.

395
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,160
Take your own advice.

396
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,080
I'm not the only one obsessed
with competing with Samuel.

397
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,720
-It's like you're not even friends.
-We are.

398
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,480
For real.

399
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,600
Samu's a really cool guy.

400
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,240
One of the best things to come out
of these two shitty years.

401
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,440
And I used to look down on him
when he arrived, but hey…

402
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,560
when everything was against him,
the guy made it through.

403
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,040
Okay, well…

404
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,160
-You still look down on him a bit.
-No. Not anymore. Really.

405
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,280
Actually, I'm kind of jealous of him.

406
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,240
And maybe I'm scared I'll lose you.

407
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,160
You're scared of losing me?

408
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,600
Well, it's not that I'm terrified.

409
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,760
Just a bit scared.

410
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,680
What?

411
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,920
What?

412
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,680
You like that I'm scared of losing you?

413
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,200
I like that you're not afraid to say it.

414
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,800
I don't know what got into me.
I have no idea what I was thinking.

415
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,640
I'll wait for you on the dock at the lake.

416
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,520
Please, come and hear me out.
