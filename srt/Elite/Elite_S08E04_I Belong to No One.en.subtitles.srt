1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,280
I'm so happy you're here
to see the new club.

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,480
Guillermina and Pier are married
and are members of Alumni.

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,840
We met here, at Las Encinas.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,440
I was an exchange student.

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,920
What happened?

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,400
-Well, I--
-Just a clumsy accident.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,520
Yeah, clumsy. Very clumsy.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,160
Joel, they are majority shareholders
in several multinationals.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,320
I'll tell you more about it in private,
when they're not here.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,440
They're considering donating
a very generous amount.

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,840
Outrageously generous, in fact.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,720
Oh, that's great.
What does your decision depend on?

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,920
On whether they're happy
with what we did with the club.

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,040
Shall we give them a tour, Emi?

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,280
Us?

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,000
Shouldn't they get to know Joel?

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,360
He has to get to class.
Maybe some other time.

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,280
Okay. Go on, Joel.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,720
Please follow us.

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,440
You can see all the effort and care

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,840
Emi and I have put
into launching the club.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,160
It's on par
with other centers in the world.

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,840
That guy was really handsome.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,600
Impressive.

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,760
Sorry, who?

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,480
-Joel.
-Yes, he just joined.

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,720
He's still very green.

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,920
Even better, right?

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,480
No, he's not your type.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,360
There are other guys.

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,000
We like Joel.

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,600
-Are you guys together or something?
-Seriously.

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,760
I'd rather introduce you to other guys.

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,760
We might need to reconsider our donation.

35
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,520
Give us a call, okay?

36
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,480
What the hell?
Joel is not yours. The donation--

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,680
I don't give a shit.

38
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,640
There will be other donors.
Many others want to take part.

39
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,320
-Yes, but Pier and--
-I said no!

40
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,240
YOUR DRIVER IS WAITING
TO TAKE YOU TO SCHOOL

41
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,120
Don't worry about the venue now.

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,640
You have enough on your plate.

43
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,880
No, I am worried.

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,960
I'm worried because I need to reopen it.
Otherwise, it's just draining money.

45
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,440
Well, don't worry about the money.
I've got your back with all that.

46
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,160
Yeah, I know.
This whole situation is embarrassing.

47
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,760
I was ashamed to ask you, and even
more so now that you're helping me.

48
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,960
Do you really need to?

49
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
Reopen it, I mean.

50
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,240
Yes.

51
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,840
For me,

52
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,280
for him, for my mom, for…

53
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,520
I don't know,
a certain sense of normality.

54
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,520
Right, but I'll help you.

55
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,400
I'll talk to Omar, and we'll reopen it.

56
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Thanks.

57
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,480
-I'm sorry. It's a pain to be around me.
-No, Isa.

58
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,560
No need to apologize.

59
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,160
It wasn't your fault.

60
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,880
Look, I'm asking you as a favor.

61
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,440
Stop punishing yourself.

62
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,440
It wasn't your fault.

63
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,920
Okay?

64
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,600
Hello.

65
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,840
How are your hands?

66
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,120
Fine. They're fine.

67
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,680
It all happened so fast.

68
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,320
-In a second.
-Yes.

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,720
Between my question and your answer.

70
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,840
Well, after my question
and before your answer.

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,960
What are you talking about?

72
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,480
-Nothing.
-No, say it.

73
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,920
I asked you if you were with Héctor.

74
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,320
And well, then I ran after Isa,

75
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
and you stayed there,

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,480
and everything happened.

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,840
Joel, handsome,
want to come to my place? To my pool?

78
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,680
No, I'm not with him. For real.

79
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,800
You're not?

80
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm not.

81
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,520
Does he know?

82
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,000
Fuck.

83
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,560
HEY! SINCE YOU BLOCKED ME ON EVERYTHING…

84
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,400
Hey, Eric.

85
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,480
Don't get mad at me.
It was just a prank to break the ice.

86
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,520
-The ice is fine as it is.
-Okay, but come on.

87
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,160
I'm trying to do things right,
and I don't know how.

88
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,360
We could try and be friends at least.

89
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,600
But I don't want us to be friends.

90
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,000
You really hurt me, and you still do.

91
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,480
We'll see each other no matter what,
so can we please try to be okay?

92
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,360
I'd like to, but it's me who suffers.

93
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,000
I wish I could delete you
because I'd do it right now.

94
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,840
-You don't need to be cruel.
-No, you were cruel to me.

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,160
I want to delete you.
I don't know how, but I'll do it.

96
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,960
Want anything?

97
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,840
Everything okay?

98
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,160
Yes.

99
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,320
Fucking great.

100
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,320
What?

101
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,600
You do the same.

102
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,440
With your sister staring, right?

103
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,840
Who cares, Joel?

104
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,360
Emi only has eyes for herself.

105
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Come on.

106
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,360
You take it off me.

107
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,000
Did you invite anyone?

108
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,040
Yes, I'll let him in.

109
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,000
Who, Emilia?

110
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,600
Someone.

111
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,040
Shit.

112
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,560
No, Joel, where are you going?

113
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,720
Someone's coming, and I'm naked.

114
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,840
Wait.

115
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,680
Look, I don't care.

116
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,200
What's more…

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
it turns me on.

118
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,120
What about you?

119
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,800
I don't know.
It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest.

120
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,000
You don't seem to agree down here.

121
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,800
That fucking Dalmar.

122
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
You see?

123
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,280
He has to be really desperate
in order to blackmail someone.

124
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,440
Deep down, he's a nice guy.

125
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,760
-Really?
-Yes.

126
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,680
I don't know.
He works doing food delivery.

127
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,920
He's got no papers,
and his family's not around.

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,600
Oh, now I understand.

129
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,360
So blackmail was a desperate measure.

130
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,800
Poor kid.

131
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,520
Without a family, all alone.

132
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,640
He's not exactly alone, Mom.

133
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,840
He's got his girlfriend, Sonia.
You know her.

134
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,760
And his roommate too,
so he's not really alone.

135
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,880
Okay, so we should make sure
he loses all of his people.

136
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,200
Right? That's what we should do.

137
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,240
And when he feels weak and fragile,
we can win him over.

138
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,000
That's really twisted, Mom.

139
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,600
Trust me, honey. I'm doing this for us.

140
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
-It won't end badly.
-No, it's not a good idea.

141
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,000
What's the girl's name? Was it Sonia?

142
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,360
-Yes.
-Right. Have her break up with him.

143
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,120
What?

144
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,160
You can get over a breakup.
Getting over jail is harder.

145
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,400
Have her dump him. You're great at that.

146
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,720
Which company does he work for?

147
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Hi.

148
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,320
You're late.

149
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,160
Stop. Wait.

150
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,760
What's up, Eric?

151
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,120
What's up, man?

152
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,920
-How are you?
-Hey.

153
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,760
Let them have fun.

154
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,120
Hey, I feel a bit awkward
with your brother and Joel there.

155
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,440
Ignore them.

156
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,120
Or watch them.

157
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,040
Does it turn you on?

158
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,040
Yeah, it does,

159
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,080
but Joel is my friend.

160
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,160
Do you want to delete Chloe or not?

161
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,800
Come here, then.

162
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,240
Let's delete her.

163
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,880
Good evening, my friends.
We're at the reopening of Isadora House!

164
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,800
And I'm here with my friend Sonia.

165
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,800
WE LOVE YOU!

166
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,240
Sonia the scatterbrain.
I'll buy you a shot and you hit on her.

167
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,400
It's easy. She's a hottie.

168
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,360
PARTY! THE BEST COMPANY!

169
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,520
Girl, are you already texting Dalmar?

170
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,360
He got fired from work.

171
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,800
What? How come?

172
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,400
Some customer said
he crossed the line with her.

173
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,760
A client said that?

174
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,200
What a customer! I can't believe people.

175
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,520
I asked him to come here, and he said no.

176
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,560
He doesn't want me to go see him either.

177
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,320
-But I'm going anyway.
-No, look.

178
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
You're going to stay for 15 minutes.

179
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,760
Then you can go with him if you want to.

180
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,960
Whatever you want. 15 minutes, please.

181
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,440
Okay, but just 15.

182
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,920
Great. Thanks.

183
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,080
That's great.

184
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,720
Hey. You're really cute.

185
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,560
Thank you.

186
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,680
What's your name?

187
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,600
Bernat.

188
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,440
Okay, can you wait here one sec?

189
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,360
Girl, that guy couldn't be more handsome.

190
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,480
He's cute, isn't he?

191
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,080
Come. What was your name again?

192
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,440
-Bernat.
-Bernat, this is Sonia. Sonia, Bernat.

193
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,360
Say hello. Come on.

194
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,280
Drinks?

195
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,400
Well, I'm out.

196
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,720
Why?

197
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,800
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

198
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,200
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

199
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,840
I'M WITH ERIC AT ISADORA'S. AND YOU?

200
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,680
UP FOR A MOVIE
ON THE COUCH AT MY PLACE?

201
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,560
-I got the beers.
-Hey, man, I'm going.

202
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,680
What? We just arrived!

203
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,840
I know, but Sara invited me over.

204
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,280
Sara? What if I interfere,
like you did with Chloe?

205
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,840
Why do you say that?
Chloe is no good for you.

206
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,560
Is the crazy widow good for you?

207
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,800
Are we discussing crazy, Eric?

208
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,320
I'm sorry, Eric. I didn't mean you, man.

209
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,720
No? Who did you mean?

210
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
I meant Chloe.

211
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,120
Yeah, sure.

212
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,440
I ALREADY BOOKED IT FOR YOU
AND ASKED FOR ROOM SERVICE.

213
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,560
THANK YOU. ALMOST THERE.

214
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,960
Where are you going?

215
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,040
Isadora House.

216
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,000
Now?

217
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,040
What for?

218
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,240
To see Joel.

219
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,760
You're a little obsessed, aren't you?

220
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,080
Come on.

221
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,520
Stay with me. Let's watch a movie.

222
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,560
I'll come home late, and with Joel.

223
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,560
Wait!

224
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,760
What?

225
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,160
I'll go with you.

226
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,960
I've been left wanting more of Eric too.

227
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,840
You stay here and give me space, okay?

228
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,520
HÉCTOR IS ON HIS WAY TOO.
DON'T LEAVE YOUR SUITE.

229
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,880
My friend is taking a long time.

230
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,560
Let her take her time.

231
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,560
Wow, you're even saying hello?

232
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,720
Must be because you haven't forgotten me.

233
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,200
Quite the opposite.

234
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,360
I'm saying hi because I'm over you.
Totally deleted.

235
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,920
I just needed a girl to help me.

236
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,880
Emilia.

237
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,000
What?

238
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,440
And it was awesome.
You can't imagine how we hit it.

239
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,200
You're making that up just to hurt me.

240
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,800
Well, you can ask her if you want to.

241
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,840
What is she doing in this pic?

242
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,960
Why is her tongue like that?

243
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,240
I don't get why people follow Chloe.

244
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,360
Ignore her.

245
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,720
But look at her!

246
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,400
Okay, wait.

247
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,760
Here.

248
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,080
Let's see.

249
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,160
If I reach 50K, I'll show vag.

250
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,560
That's a good impression.

251
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,760
Well, all you have to do
is look and sound like a slut.

252
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Right.

253
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,520
What a pair.

254
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,200
Let me take a decent one.

255
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,960
I can't.

256
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

257
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,800
Damn, girl, I didn't know.

258
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,400
No, you didn't know
because I didn't tell you.

259
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,560
Let's just forget it, okay?

260
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,000
Sure. Don't worry about it.

261
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
I get it.

262
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,680
It was great meeting you.

263
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,040
If you want, I'll give you my Insta.

264
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,320
No, best not to.

265
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,320
Okay, don't worry.

266
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
I get it.

267
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,120
-I'm gonna go with my friends.
-Okay.

268
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,160
BABE, HOW ARE YOU? SHOULD I GO SEE YOU?

269
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,400
Did we…?

270
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,080
We did.

271
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,920
And it was incredible.

272
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,720
Fuck.

273
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,360
"Fuck"? What's wrong?

274
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,320
I really lost it.

275
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,640
What?

276
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,240
I mean, I wasn't very clear-headed.

277
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,240
And that really served you well.

278
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,160
Excuse me?

279
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,840
Nico, I was really stoned, and you knew.

280
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,760
And…

281
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,440
And what?

282
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,360
Well, that.

283
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,560
Are you saying I took advantage of you?

284
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,920
I'm not saying that.

285
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,960
-Yes, you are.
-No, I don't know what happened.

286
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,440
I'd never do that.

287
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,560
I mean, I'm surprised
you're even considering it

288
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,960
and you're blurting it out just like that.

289
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,240
What you are implying
is a huge load of shit.

290
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,680
So you're the victim now?

291
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,040
-What? There are no victims here.
-Okay.

292
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,520
I don't want to keep talking.
You're making me anxious. Please go.

293
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,040
I'm going to the bathroom.
Get dressed and leave.

294
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,240
-Sara, I mean--
-I said leave, Nico!

295
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,440
Don't talk to me, don't text me. Just go.

296
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,960
-Sara--
-Nico, I need space. Go.

297
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,680
-We both wanted to do it.
-Are you invalidating me like Raúl did?

298
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,640
Nico, just leave.

299
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,960
Bye.

300
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,120
Room service.

301
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,560
Hello, good evening. Room ser--

302
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,280
Oh, hello! I'm Joel, from Alumni.

303
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,400
Hello, Joel.

304
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,720
Sorry about the waiter uniform.

305
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,920
We know you work here.
That's why we came and requested you.

306
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,080
So we get to know each other.

307
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,080
We were left wanting
to know more about you.

308
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
Same here.

309
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,400
Come in, get comfy.

310
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,800
Are you with Sonia?

311
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,640
Do you have ice?

312
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,760
I don't get why you broke up with Eric
if you still love him.

313
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,720
I don't know.

314
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,800
I let everyone talk me into it.

315
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,800
Nico, especially, and

316
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,720
other people got in the way.

317
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I don't know.

318
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,200
Anyway, enough with the drama, right?

319
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,280
I'm being a bit intense.

320
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,280
Let's make a toast

321
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,840
to shitty nights.

322
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,680
What do you think?

323
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,840
To shitty nights.

324
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,800
Cheers.

325
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,440
Why didn't you go with Sonia?

326
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,640
Because I couldn't find her.

327
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,800
And why did you come here?

328
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,800
Because she said
you were feeling like shit.

329
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,280
And because two fucked-up souls
with a bottle of Jäger

330
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,800
can change the world.

331
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,200
Let's have another.

332
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,080
What you said about not finding Sonia…

333
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,680
is it because she was with this guy?

334
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,400
Can I be frank with you?

335
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,080
I thought it wasn't nice

336
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,520
that Sonia kept partying with this guy

337
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,160
after what happened
with your job, to be honest.

338
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,480
She wouldn't leave his side.

339
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,680
She was smiling, touching his abs…

340
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,520
They must have been chatting.

341
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,760
She has the right to have fun,
doesn't she?

342
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,080
Yes, of course she does.
But to what degree?

343
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,240
What do you mean?

344
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,080
What degree?

345
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,240
I'm sorry, I'm overstepping here.

346
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,840
-What degree?
-No, it's nothing. No degree.

347
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,840
Ignore me. Jäger makes me talk too much.

348
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,520
They were very lovey-dovey.

349
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,120
But I'll tell you one thing.
Sonia is very clever.

350
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,920
She wouldn't fuck up something nice
with a hot guy like you.

351
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,120
Well, not only hot.

352
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
Super hot.

353
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,480
ANSWER ME, PLEASE.
SHOULD I COME OVER OR NOT?

354
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,480
I SAID NO. I'D RATHER BE ALONE.

355
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,880
Have you ever been told

356
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,240
that you're very different
from other guys?

357
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Because I'm poor? Or because I'm Black?

358
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,680
You're mysterious.

359
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,920
I never know what you're thinking.
It's a rare thing.

360
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
And it turns me on.

361
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,760
And there's one more thing about you
that I don't think you're aware of.

362
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,320
What is it?

363
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,200
How hot you are.

364
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,320
Have you seen yourself?

365
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,440
I can't do it, Chloe.

366
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,440
Why not?

367
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,160
I'm with Sonia.

368
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,560
But do you believe Sonia
is thinking of you right now?

369
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,520
Because I don't.

370
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Where's Joel?

371
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,800
-And your manners?
-What?

372
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,960
Big private school, very little manners.

373
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,480
-Are you messing with me?
-I'm not.

374
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,960
Who do you think you are
to mess with me, Aladdin?

375
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,360
I'm the bar manager, asshole.
I decide if you stay or go home.

376
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,000
-I asked about Joel.
-He's working.

377
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,120
-Where? I can't see him.
-Not your business.

378
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,440
Do you need anything else? A table?

379
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,280
You're playing with fire, you know?

380
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,920
Grazie, amore.

381
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,400
No. No, thanks.
I mean, I shouldn't. I'm working.

382
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,360
For us. And we tell you to drink.

383
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,840
Okay, thanks.

384
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,920
HEY. WHERE ARE YOU? I'M AT ISADORA HOUSE.

385
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Excuse me.

386
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,600
IN A SUITE WITH PIER AND GUILLERMINA.

387
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,800
THANKS FOR GETTING US TOGETHER.

388
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,960
Which suite is Joel in?

389
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,720
Suite number…
I'm clearly not gonna tell you.

390
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,840
You're asking for it.

391
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,240
Upstairs, right?

392
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,880
That's Héctor, isn't it?

393
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,360
Yes, I think so.

394
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,280
-Don't open the door.
-Why? It could be urgent.

395
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,000
Hey, what's going on?

396
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,200
You're coming with me.

397
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,160
What? You set everything up
and then you pull me out?

398
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,200
Let's go. It wasn't me, Joel.
I didn't set anything up.

399
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,880
Okay, but why the hell
did you pull me out like that?

400
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,520
-He's working. Get out.
-Stay out of this, asshole.

401
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,400
-Héctor, take that back.
-I don't want you to be with them.

402
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,160
-Why?
-Go inside, please.

403
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,400
Back to work. Take care of our guests.

404
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,240
-Let's go.
-Leave me alone, you fucking towelhead!

405
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,640
-What did you call me?
-"Towelhead." Don't you know Spanish?

406
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,200
I'm as Spanish and as queer as you are.

407
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,360
Is my origin a real problem for you?
Would it be okay if my dad was a sheikh?

408
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Oh, right. In the end,
your only problem is I don't have money.

409
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,800
Security.

410
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,160
Aggressive, preppy asshole coming down.
He attacked me and Joel.

411
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,040
Throw him the fuck out, please. Thank you.

412
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,640
-Get the hell out!
-Let me go, damn it!

413
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Out!

414
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,120
You don't know
who you're fucking around with, Mustafa!

415
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,280
"Mr. Mustafa" to you, asshole.

416
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,920
Oh, and one more thing. I adore Joel.

417
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
He adores me.

418
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,560
And he listens to me.

419
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,920
I swear I won't stop until I get him away
from you, fucking fascist shit.

420
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,000
Eric, did you see…?

421
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,040
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

422
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,000
Chloe? You can say her name.
It's no big deal.

423
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,280
She left a while ago.

424
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,240
She left the club?

425
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,640
What is it? Did she bail on you?

426
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,440
You don't say! Chloe?

427
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,520
That's not like her at all, right?

428
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
NEW STORY

429
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,280
Damn, is she making viral sex tapes again?

430
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,080
Why didn't he want me to see you?

431
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,520
Because we want to offer you a deal.

432
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,360
We like you.

433
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,640
And we want you to have
the life you deserve.

434
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,360
Everything by Alumni and for Alumni.

435
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,160
In exchange for what?

436
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,720
Look, the thing is,

437
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,440
I'm gay.

438
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,960
Okay? I mean, really gay.

439
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,280
Amore…

440
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,120
Labels are for the poor and the ignorant.

441
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,320
Pleasure knows nothing but bodies.

442
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,760
I should be going.

443
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,680
We paid for two more hours
of room service.

444
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,120
Yes, I know that,
but I just don't want to do this, okay?

445
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,400
I'll let them know
so they can send some other guy or girl.

446
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,160
Héctor didn't want you to be with us.

447
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,200
He thinks you're his.

448
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,800
Do you really belong to him?

449
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,480
An Alumni has no owner
and no one to answer to.

450
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,360
Do you, Joel?

451
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,800
I don't belong to anyone.

452
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,800
Geniale.

453
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,440
Because only if you are free
will you get where you want to be.

454
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,280
Name your price.

455
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,600
Vai.

456
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,760
-No, I don't have a price.
-Yes, you do.

457
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,440
But it's not what we're offering you.

458
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,360
It's natural, amore. He's very handsome.

459
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
Very handsome.

460
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,440
Fifteen hundred?

461
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,360
Go up.

462
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,160
-Tutto?
-Tutto.

463
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,480
Ti amo.

464
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,480
Easy.

465
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,360
Relax.

466
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,320
My love, how are you?

467
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
Are you nervous?

468
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,960
We can stop if you want to.

469
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,080
Let's do it.

470
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,040
I told you, you didn't know
who you were fucking around with.

471
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,760
What was it you called me?

472
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,680
"Fucking fascist shit"?

473
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,120
No. Please, no.

474
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,240
Hit him.

475
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,280
