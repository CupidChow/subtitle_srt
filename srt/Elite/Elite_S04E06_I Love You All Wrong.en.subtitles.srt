1
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,920
Patrick.

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,040
Patrick, no one could find you.

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,200
Where were you?

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,760
LAKE CLUB

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,360
Don't have Samuel over
for debate practice.

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,200
I want to keep my school
and homelife separate.

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,640
I offered to work at the Lake Club
and other venues whenever they need me.

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,560
I need to look out for myself.

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's continue tomorrow.
I need to go change.

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,040
You're leaving?

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,480
I'm late for work.

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,680
Don't forget to go over
your arguments for tomorrow.

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,640
Okay.

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
Bye.

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,200
When Samuel says we're done, we're done.

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,480
Good work, honey.

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,400
Thanks.

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,400
I'm very proud of you.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Wait in the car.

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,840
García forgot his keys.

21
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,680
What are you doing here?

22
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,920
You forgot these.

23
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,320
I'll… leave them here, okay?

24
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,920
-You're in no hurry to leave.
-You're in no hurry to cover up.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,520
-Nothing you haven't seen.
-I can't remember.

26
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,120
-Considering the state you were in…
-It wasn't anything memorable.

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,120
-It wasn't?
-No.

28
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,560
Bye.

29
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,960
Oh, God.

30
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,640
It would've been cheaper to buy a horn.

31
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,640
Your mom was calling all night long,
and I didn't complain.

32
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,800
If you guys had just slept in my bed…

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,440
Sure. First, we take over your house
and then your bed. No way.

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,520
I'll find us a place to stay tonight,
no matter what, okay?

35
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,080
No. You go home, and I'll stay here.

36
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,920
The sofa's fine for one person.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,240
I'm not leaving you on your own, Rebe.

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,120
End of story.

39
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,120
Man, what a pair.

40
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,160
Omar, exams are just around the corner.

41
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,000
You can't keep skipping school.
Benjamín will--

42
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,680
Screw Benjamín.

43
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,480
You can't avoid Ander forever.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,240
I don't know about forever.
I'd rather take it one day at a time.

45
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,960
And today I can avoid him.

46
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,400
It's a super exclusive party.
Ambar Lucid might be performing.

47
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,440
Are you into her?
Would you like to see her?

48
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,880
I'd kill to see her.

49
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,640
Phillipe, will Ambar Lucid
be singing at that party?

50
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,120
How should I know?

51
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,200
Of course you know.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,480
You're buds. You like each other's posts.

53
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,600
If you'll excuse me…

54
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,600
Patrick, quit being a pain.

55
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Your Highness,

56
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,880
if you get us tickets,

57
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,120
your humble subject

58
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,280
will do whatever Your Grace wishes.

59
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,360
I'll make a few calls.

60
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,760
GOOD MORNING, HANDSOME…

61
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,280
MORNING. HOW'S THE PHONE?

62
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,320
GREAT. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU IN PERSON.
WANT TO MEET TONIGHT?

63
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,360
Let's hope Phillipe can get us tickets.

64
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,560
Of course he will.

65
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,320
But for the record,
I'm the one who got them.

66
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,560
Just make sure you wear a tie
so I can pull on it.

67
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,520
Is this appropriate classroom behavior?

68
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,880
I've sent you a document with a survey
about your career aspirations.

69
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,280
It'll be used for an internship program
during the second semester.

70
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,720
Fill it out, please.

71
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,880
Not so daring
when your dad's around, huh?

72
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,480
I mean…

73
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
What?

74
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,960
You think you call the shots.

75
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,080
But you don't.

76
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
What the hell?

77
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,480
Just to prove
that I always get what I want.

78
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,560
In front of a prince or my father.

79
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,800
Samuel.

80
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,280
How's Omar?

81
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,920
It's your life.
Do whatever the hell you want.

82
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,200
But be a bit more careful in class.

83
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,040
This might cost him the school year.

84
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,480
García.

85
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,400
Yes?

86
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,200
The book I told you about.

87
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,560
I'd like you to…

88
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,080
They get along
just because of debate team.

89
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,960
Come with me.

90
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,840
What are you doing?

91
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,280
-Benjamín, do you have a minute?
-Sure. What is it, Nunier?

92
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,080
I'd like to take you
and your family out to dinner.

93
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,320
What's the occasion?

94
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,360
Well, Ari is important to me.

95
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,560
And you guys are important to Ari.
We could get to know each other better.

96
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,000
It would be inappropriate for a principal
to let a student pay for dinner.

97
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,080
-I see.
-But Guzmán and I are together, Dad.

98
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,440
What I mean is it would be
his formal introduction to the family.

99
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,560
Well, in that case, I guess
I'll have to accept the invitation.

100
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,000
Good. I'll see you all tonight
at the Lake Club.

101
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,720
Bye.

102
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,680
You can't come in!

103
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,960
Phillipe, you can't just barge in here
whenever you want.

104
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,720
You use my computer whenever you want.
What was that little look earlier?

105
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,920
What little look?

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,320
The one you gave me when you ran over

107
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
to eavesdrop on our conversation
about the party.

108
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,320
Do you want to go too?

109
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Look, I told you that playing hard to get
doesn't do it for me.

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,440
It won't work.

111
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,000
And yet, here you are.

112
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,400
Don't act all high and mighty.

113
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,080
Accept the fact that you can't go
without asking me.

114
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,040
Thank you, but I can't make it.

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,080
-Seriously.
-Sure.

116
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,960
Of course.

117
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,320
You don't want to ask me.

118
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,320
Sure, I'm the selfish groupie
who wants to take advantage of you.

119
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,240
You said you couldn't separate
the real me from the prince.

120
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,480
Yeah. Unlike your friends,
who do a great job of it.

121
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,040
Excuse me?

122
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,080
Now, if you don't mind,
I need to get changed.

123
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,040
Right?

124
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,000
CAYETANA

125
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,560
YOU AND YOUR SELFISH FRIENDS.

126
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,720
Von Triesenberg.

127
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,240
What were you doing in the janitor's room?

128
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,080
Nothing bad.

129
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,880
Listen…

130
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,520
I saved your hide by bringing you here.

131
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,960
Yours and your family's.

132
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,440
Do you really think
I'm not watching your every move?

133
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,080
I was only talking to her.

134
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,120
In here, you are my responsibility.

135
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,240
I'm not risking my neck
for you to rekindle certain rumors

136
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,840
you're supposed to have buried.

137
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Is that clear?

138
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,360
Excuse me?

139
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,760
Benjamín, don't use that tone
with me, okay?

140
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,360
Is that clear? Yes or no?

141
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,680
You're not so sick after all.

142
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,720
-I can't miss work.
-You can't miss school either.

143
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,760
Benjamín asked about you.
He can't wait to get rid of you.

144
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,280
Like father, like son.

145
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,920
Well, he won't have to worry
about me much longer.

146
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,760
HEY, PATRICK

147
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,600
HOW ABOUT DINNER AND DRINKS
AT THE LAKE CLUB?

148
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,600
PATRICK - ONLINE

149
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,560
I'm dropping out of school.

150
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,480
What?

151
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,440
Yeah.

152
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,600
I'm happy working behind a bar.
I'm good at it, and it pays.

153
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,240
You don't want to stop studying.
What you want is to stop seeing me.

154
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,760
Just because we're not together
doesn't mean I don't love you.

155
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,160
You know that.

156
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,360
I love you, and that will never change.

157
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,360
I'm not so sure anymore.

158
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,160
Well, I am.

159
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,360
I'll always be here for you.

160
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Okay?

161
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,200
Come on.

162
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,000
-You really like portrait mode, huh?
-It's very cool.

163
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,080
And you look so manly. Check it out.

164
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,080
Oh, shit.

165
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,320
What is it?

166
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,160
A guy from class
was supposed to get us tickets

167
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,600
for an exclusive party where Ambar Lucid
might perform, but it fell through.

168
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,960
Maybe we can fix that.

169
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,720
Maybe…

170
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,400
What is he doing here?

171
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,600
We're having a drink, all three of us.

172
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,880
-What would you like?
-His treat, right?

173
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,360
Did he pay for your phone too? Of course.

174
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,040
-Could you not be so negative?
-Did she offer you a two-for-one deal?

175
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,280
-Look, I'll let you two talk.
-Yes, please.

176
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,160
No, Armando. Stay.

177
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,400
-Why do you always do this?
-What?

178
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,880
Take one step forward
and three steps back.

179
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,520
-What's this about?
-Hang on. I'll be right back.

180
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,560
Will you just listen for a minute?

181
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,400
Actually, I will.
Go ahead and fucking explain this.

182
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,400
I'm just trying to help you, okay?

183
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,800
Are you laughing in my goddamned face?

184
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,040
I said I quit, and I did.

185
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,920
So please come with me and hear me out.

186
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,000
Okay? I'm asking you, please.

187
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,800
If you won't take the hotel room…

188
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,520
tell me what we can do.

189
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,640
Because… you were quick to leave home
but not so great at finding alternatives.

190
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,160
I left my mom's house for you.

191
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,240
You can use the room
for as long as you need.

192
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,600
It's on me, of course.

193
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,800
-Should we wait for Mencía?
-No.

194
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,600
Thanks.

195
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,720
Don't call her. Why bother?

196
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,240
She's invited too.

197
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,840
Okay.

198
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,800
The host is in charge. Call her.

199
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,480
Her phone's off or not reachable.

200
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,120
Well…

201
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,560
Nunier, if you want to keep waiting,
I believe they serve breakfast too.

202
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,200
Sorry, I just wanted to help.

203
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,040
-I didn't mean to interfere.
-Help with what?

204
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,080
Well, your relationship with Mencía
isn't great.

205
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,600
What? These things
should be discussed openly, right?

206
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
No, let him talk.

207
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,280
I want to listen to this Nunier
who you like so much.

208
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,480
Mencía reminds me of my sister.

209
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,200
She was smart, rebellious,

210
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,480
really intense.

211
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,400
And she was different too.

212
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,520
The stricter my parents got,
the more she rebelled.

213
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,360
-Are you giving me parenting advice?
-No.

214
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,840
Keep going. I'm interested.
Tell me how to raise my daughter.

215
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,840
I don't know how to do that.
But maybe you should cut her some slack.

216
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,560
Let her make her own decisions,

217
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,800
even if she screws up.

218
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,800
-She has the right to screw up.
-We all do.

219
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,240
You can cut kids some slack
when they behave.

220
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,680
But what if they don't?
What good does it do?

221
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,320
The slack you cut them
is the rope they hang themselves with.

222
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,880
It's like a swimming pool.

223
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,680
Someone's drowning,
and you jump in to save them.

224
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,840
Without thinking.

225
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,800
With your good intentions,
strength, and swimming skills.

226
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,360
But in your desperation to save them
and their panic,

227
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,640
which makes them fight you,

228
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,040
you both end up going under…
and they drown.

229
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
But if you had taught them how to swim…

230
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,760
how to breathe, how to stay in control,

231
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,440
or if you had thrown them
a life preserver,

232
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,560
they probably could've saved themselves.

233
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,200
And this guy isn't on the debate team?

234
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,240
I'd rather be the guy
waiting for Ari outside.

235
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,000
Guzmán…

236
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,760
did you have something in mind for us
to share, or should we order separately?

237
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,680
I'll have some.

238
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,120
You're going to drink?

239
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,040
Yes.

240
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,760
This is a celebration.

241
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,080
I swear,
when you started talking about Mencía…

242
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,320
I could have killed you, to be honest.

243
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,400
But then you won him over.

244
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,720
Like you won me over.

245
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,000
Is that you or the wine talking?

246
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,320
What?

247
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,040
It's the wine.

248
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,640
Ari, please. We're in a restaurant.

249
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,520
Oh, I don't care.

250
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,240
Shit.

251
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,920
Please don't do that in here.

252
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh, Samuel. Go away.

253
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,560
I'm so sorry, man. We're going.

254
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,320
I'll get our coats.

255
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
Shall we, Samu?

256
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Good morning.

257
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
Good morning.

258
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,360
How long have you been awake?

259
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,040
Well, just to give you an idea,
pretty much all night.

260
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,960
Give or take.

261
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,880
Why?

262
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,280
I'm not sure being here is worth it.

263
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,400
Can't you enjoy anything for two minutes
without freaking out?

264
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,200
An upstanding whoremonger?
That doesn't add up.

265
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,440
-Did you order anything?
-Me?

266
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,080
-Cut the act, okay?
-It wasn't me, I swear.

267
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,880
He got us two tickets to the gig.

268
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,800
No fucking way.

269
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,080
I told him we couldn't get tickets, and…

270
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,840
-Holy shit!
-Okay, all right.

271
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,480
Don't get too excited. It's just a rumor.
Who knows if she'll show up.

272
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,680
You hate that you're starting
to like Armando, right?

273
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,120
Stop it. No.

274
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,480
You must know someone.
You're a goddamn prince.

275
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,880
Your dad is one of the top businessmen
in Europe, and here you are, begging me.

276
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,000
Come on, Phillipe.

277
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,360
It's a cool plan so we can all hang out.
Don't you want to?

278
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,560
I wanted to have dinner
with you last night.

279
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,880
But sometimes things don't work out.

280
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,000
-Shit.
-Hi.

281
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,240
-Hey!
-Hey, dude!

282
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,560
Mencía, let Dad know you're okay.

283
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,160
I already told Patrick.

284
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,280
I missed you so much, you assholes.

285
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,520
-All right!
-Hey, look who's back!

286
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,600
Awesome, dude!

287
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,080
-Hey.
-How are you?

288
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,320
Thanks.

289
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,560
"I can't speak English,
and I'm going to Kentucky. What can I do?"

290
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,400
And his friend says, "Don't worry."

291
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,560
-Good morning.
-Hi.

292
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,800
-I should probably go to class.
-No, Parrilla. Stay.

293
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,680
I want you to sleep at home.

294
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,840
And if Parrilla has no place to stay,
and she wants to…

295
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,040
then she could use one of the guest rooms.

296
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,920
I wonder where the hidden camera is,
as if there weren't enough cameras.

297
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,680
-What?
-Well, it sure beats where we are now.

298
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,240
Actually, we're fine sleeping together.

299
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,120
But thanks anyway, Benjamín.

300
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,080
-We could listen to his offer--
-Let's go.

301
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,000
Thank you anyway.
You're very kind, Benja… mín. Benjamín.

302
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,680
-I couldn't meet up last night.
-I guess you couldn't reply either.

303
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,040
It slipped my mind. I'm sorry.

304
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,240
Unlike the tickets.
You keep hounding me for those.

305
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,800
But hey…

306
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,440
It's okay.

307
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,920
I'm the one who needs to change
the way I interact with people.

308
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,280
Without the fanfare and giving out gifts.

309
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Why?

310
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,840
I want to see what friends I still have
if I'm not a prince.

311
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,240
What's the problem with being who you are?

312
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,120
You were born a prince.

313
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,160
This Phillipe is the result of his palace,

314
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,840
his fortune, his education,

315
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,600
his family, his friends, his riches…

316
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,880
and his wonderful royal genes.

317
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,320
Why hide that?

318
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,040
To find out who likes me for me.

319
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,920
What am I, then? A fake friend?

320
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,160
All I'm doing
is asking a friend for a favor.

321
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,040
He can pull it off because of who he is.

322
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,720
Just like… I don't know, my dad.

323
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,720
Because of who he is, he was able
to help you and bring you here,

324
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,160
away from the rumors in your country.

325
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,520
Excuse me?

326
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,760
We belong to the same small social circle.

327
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,240
But don't worry. My dad and I
are the only ones here who know.

328
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,720
Well, and Ari. I told her about it.

329
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,160
And as someone

330
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,160
who has the privilege
of being your friend,

331
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm asking you to help me get tickets
for the Ambar Lucid gig.

332
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,040
For Ander.

333
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,760
I just want to see him happy.

334
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,040
My geolocation works better than Grindr's.

335
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,840
Oh, that one…

336
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,680
Definitely one of us.

337
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,200
What about him?

338
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,240
No.

339
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,560
Damn.

340
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,280
Look, here comes your man.

341
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,040
-Hey!
-Hi.

342
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,280
No. I had too much yesterday.

343
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,200
For you, then.

344
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,840
Thanks for sticking up for me
in front of Benjamín.

345
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,200
You'd do the same for me.

346
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,720
Welcome.

347
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,880
Hey!

348
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
-How are you, Rebeka?
-Fine, thanks.

349
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,240
Thanks for the tickets.
And the hotel room. It's very nice of you.

350
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,280
My pleasure.

351
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,120
Likewise.

352
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,280
Sparkling water, please.

353
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,160
What?

354
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,240
Afraid of losing control again?

355
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,720
Do you want to dress me down again?

356
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,360
I'd rather undress you.

357
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,840
Maybe you're just afraid
of losing control with me.

358
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,840
Know what your problem is, Samu?

359
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,120
You think too much of yourself.

360
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,920
I'll say it in public and in private.

361
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,360
Thanks for the invite.

362
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,720
Thank you for coming.

363
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

364
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,360
Why isn't Cayetana here?

365
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,480
We're going through a rough patch.

366
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,360
She doesn't trust me.

367
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,480
She's right not to.

368
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,000
I'M SORRY. IT'S ONLY NORMAL
THAT YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME.

369
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,520
NOT EVEN MY FRIENDS DO.

370
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,600
-I'm gonna grab a beer. Want one?
-Yeah.

371
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,520
I need a beer
to put up with that guy, you know?

372
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,440
Can I have two, please?

373
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,600
I'm happy to be here with you.

374
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Did I misread this?

375
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,240
Misread what?

376
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,120
I don't know. You took my gifts,
you asked for more…

377
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,400
Even a room for you and your girlfriend.
You used to cost me less.

378
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,760
Mencía, we're not kids.

379
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,840
I don't do favors for free,
and neither do you.

380
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,040
Actually, I am a kid.

381
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,000
-Come here.
-Don't touch me.

382
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,000
Where is he?

383
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,520
Er… I don't know.
Something came up, and he left.

384
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,120
Are you okay?

385
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,840
Yes.

386
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,320
Are you sure?

387
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,080
I'm sure.

388
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
Let's enjoy this.

389
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,480
Ander.

390
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,560
Patrick. What's up?

391
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,840
See you on the dance floor, okay?

392
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,960
Patrick!

393
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,960
Hey!

394
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,760
-Ari, what happened?
-Nothing.

395
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,760
Hey, you. Relax, okay?

396
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,840
Leave me alone!

397
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,120
Did he just hit you?

398
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,000
No. My brother has these outbursts.

399
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,360
-Outbursts? He split your lip!
-I'll get ice.

400
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,880
-Talk to him.
-Wait here.

401
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,200
Let me take a look.

402
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,440
Ice, please.

403
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,560
I can't believe it.

404
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,120
Hey, what got into Patrick?

405
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,920
That.

406
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,600
Shit.

407
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,160
I have to go. Got a lot to do.

408
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,200
-I guess I understand Patrick.
-Excuse me?

409
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,000
Not the violence, the pain.

410
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,840
What kind of pain justifies
hurting someone you love?

411
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,360
It doesn't justify it, but I get
how pain can make you lose control.

412
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Like the pain I feel when you look
at Guzmán the way you look at me.

413
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,440
What?

414
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,560
It's the truth. Sorry.
If you don't like it, deal with it.

415
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,040
You sure you're okay?

416
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,760
I've had better days, but yeah.

417
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,680
All good.

418
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,880
Okay, buddy.

419
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,520
-Bye.
-See you.

420
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,480
Did you forget your keys?

421
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,160
Forget something?

422
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,720
Where's Guzmán?

423
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,120
Home, I guess.

424
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,680
Oh.

425
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,000
Have you been drinking?

426
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,520
I wish.

427
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,400
Please, I don't want to see him.

428
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,600
What is it, Ari? Was it him?

429
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,720
-Dad, why can't we go home?
-We can't just yet, darling.

430
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,040
We need to be patient.

431
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,840
But I'm fine, really.

432
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,640
You're not going anywhere.

433
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,680
I should go. Ari doesn't want to see me.

434
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,600
Really?

435
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,840
Why's that?

436
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,960
What about this?

437
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,680
Who did you beat up? Huh?

438
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,920
I have to go.
