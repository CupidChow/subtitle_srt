1
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,360
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

2
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,200
Welcome.

3
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
Thank you.

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,360
Welcome.

5
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,960
Welcome.

6
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,560
-Thanks.
-Welcome.

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
Great. Congratulations, everyone.

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,840
You are now
full-fledged members of Alumni.

9
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,360
-I'm so sorry.
-You're not sorry at all, Joel!

10
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,160
You're a selfish son of a bitch.

11
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,600
And I swear to God

12
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,640
you're going to regret this
for the rest of your life. I swear.

13
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,320
You don't look so good. Anything wrong?

14
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,000
Everything, basically.

15
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,360
Tell me what I can do to help.

16
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,320
I really miss my dad, Luis.

17
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,200
He won't answer the phone,

18
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,400
or when he does, he hangs up right away,
and to be honest, I just want to see him.

19
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,360
I want to apologize to him,
tell him that he was right,

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,000
and ask him for help
because I can't take it anymore.

21
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,720
You want a family visit.

22
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,440
Please.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,040
Isa, your father
isn't allowed to receive visits.

24
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
What do you want in return?

25
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,360
No, that'd be two favors you owe me.
Two big ones too.

26
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,560
Go ahead. Ask away.

27
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,760
Want me to order room service?

28
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,080
Yeah, good idea.

29
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,800
But get dressed up.
You can't stay in your pajamas.

30
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,600
Get undressed, take a shower,
get changed. I don't know.

31
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,360
Get dolled up. It's a special dinner.

32
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,400
Will you be able to get me
the visit with my father?

33
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,960
I'll do everything I can. Count on it.

34
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,840
And smile.

35
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,760
I like you better when you smile.

36
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,280
Go on, go shower.

37
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,280
I've got to go, okay?
I have a meeting with Virginia.

38
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,560
By the way,

39
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,880
tomorrow's your first Alumni event.

40
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,640
Oh, I forgot.

41
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,560
I'll leave this here, okay?

42
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
What is that?

43
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,480
Your fee.

44
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,640
What do you mean? There's a fee?

45
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,520
Yes, Joel. Of course there's a fee.

46
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,720
We need to pay for events,
trips, and conferences.

47
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,600
They're only an excuse
to have a blast abroad.

48
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,000
Then there's maintenance
and blah, blah, blah.

49
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,720
Two thousand euros. Are you joking?

50
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,440
-No, why?
-A month?

51
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,000
One thousand a month
and another thousand for tomorrow's event.

52
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,200
And it's a cheap one.

53
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,880
Héctor, I'm crashing here,
and I wait tables, okay?

54
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,880
I couldn't even pay 100 euros.

55
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
That's why we don't take scholarship kids.

56
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Okay. I'll take care of your expenses.

57
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,680
No, no fucking way.
My school fees are already paid by my…

58
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,960
Your?

59
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,720
Iván.

60
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,960
Do I need to worry?

61
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,440
No. I mean, I refuse
to depend on him, you, or anyone.

62
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,880
Think of it as a loan.

63
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,840
When will I pay you back? And how?

64
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,200
How about this?

65
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,520
Let's say tomorrow's event
is a competition with a very big prize.

66
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,440
The fees, the extra fees,
and what's in the bank,

67
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,480
we normally give it all to charity.

68
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,640
So if I win,
and I always do, I'll give it to you.

69
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,160
So I'm your charity now?

70
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,280
Joel, with a prize like that,
you can stop worrying about fees, tuition,

71
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
and a lot of other things for a long time.

72
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,000
Honey, you don't know
how proud I am of you

73
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,840
and how excited I feel.

74
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,280
Belonging with the Krawietzs.

75
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,840
Coffee? Diet Cola?

76
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,240
It's only natural he's like that.

77
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
You broke up with him on WhatsApp.

78
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,640
I know.

79
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,240
But it was the best way.

80
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,920
Yeah, he was probably alone at home,

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,600
in a safe space,
where he could react how he needed to.

82
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,720
-Of course, my love.
-Yes.

83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Young people
are too considerate these days.

84
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,760
Who's this interrupting me now?

85
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,160
-Get me something from the machine.
-What's wrong?

86
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,120
Nothing, honey. A pest
who wants to see me again. And I don't.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,800
Cappuccino. Thank you.

88
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,040
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND EUROS,
IN 50-EURO BILLS, IN A DUFFEL BAG

89
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,320
LUGGAGE LOCKERS

90
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,440
You look great, Dad.

91
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,120
And you look too skinny.

92
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,480
-Don't start! I'm not.
-It's true. You hardly eat.

93
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,480
All right.

94
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,480
How are you?

95
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,800
Feeling like shit.
Pretty bad, to be honest.

96
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,560
Oh. See, I thought that you were stronger.

97
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,920
That no one could stop you or break you.

98
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,360
That you were a loyal daughter.

99
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,320
Dad, forgive me.

100
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,320
Yeah, your apologies
won't get me out of here.

101
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,360
What will get me out
is what I need you to do for me.

102
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,520
Sure, I'll do whatever you want.

103
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,000
Do you remember Cibrán?

104
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,240
No, who is he?

105
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,520
You've seen him a thousand times
but were probably focused on yourself.

106
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,480
Please. We did business
with him several times.

107
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,200
And, well, let's say
we still owe him a lot of money.

108
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,880
How much is a lot?

109
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,320
-A lot.
-And "we" means Mom and you?

110
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,560
No, "we" means all three of us.
Mom, you, and I.

111
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,920
Since you're the owner now.

112
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,960
I want you to sell everything to Cibrán,
regardless of the price he offers.

113
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,280
-No, I won't sell anything to anyone.
-Yes, you will.

114
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,440
-Selling is stupid.
-You will do it.

115
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,080
Give him whatever he wants.

116
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,680
With that money,
you hurry back here and bail me out.

117
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,760
That's your priority.
Forget about saving the business.

118
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,480
Your priority is to pay my bail

119
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,080
and get me out so the three of us
can go far away, to Argentina.

120
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,440
Yes, please.

121
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,840
The only place where, someday,

122
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,480
I might forget what a disappointment
you've been as a daughter.

123
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,640
You're being dramatic, Dad.
I can fix everything.

124
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
-I'll pay the debts, pay Cibrán--
-Isadora.

125
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,040
I'll make a profit--

126
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,760
Isadora! You're not listening to me.

127
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Don't argue.

128
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,720
I don't have much time.

129
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,080
What do you mean, Dad?

130
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,960
You get out there, go see Cibrán,

131
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,840
and do exactly what I asked you.

132
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,720
No. Stop.

133
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,360
I have lots of things to say.

134
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,840
Am I really a disappointment
as a daughter?

135
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,680
Bye.

136
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,240
Baby. Baby, listen to me.

137
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,560
Wait, say something. How are you?

138
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,840
Fuck!

139
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,960
That fucking bitch!

140
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,000
Hello.

141
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,880
Hi.

142
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,800
I'm Chloe's mom.

143
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,560
You look very familiar.

144
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,640
-You know my daughter, don't you?
-Yes, I do.

145
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,080
-Uh-huh.
-How can I help you?

146
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,760
-I'm looking for this sort of Black kid.
-Ma'am.

147
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,120
Well, not "sort of."

148
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,440
Dalmar.

149
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,680
-Dolmar.
-Dalmar.

150
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,680
Sorry, I get confused with names.

151
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,880
And if they're exotic, even worse.

152
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,120
-Right.
-Is he home?

153
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,040
He must be. I saw him come in.

154
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,760
I didn't see him come in, but… Dalmar!

155
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,880
Chloe's mom is looking for you.

156
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,240
Hello.

157
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,680
Shall we take a walk, handsome?

158
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,120
I need to tell you something about Chloe.

159
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
I'm heading out.
I'll leave you guys alone.

160
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,720
-Okay.
-Omar, no. Wait.

161
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,760
-Pleased to meet you.
-Don't go.

162
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,360
-Have a nice day.
-There's a letter for you.

163
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,360
Bye!

164
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,640
Does anyone else live here?

165
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,960
Are you sure?

166
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,000
Can you get me a glass of water? With ice.

167
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,960
How can I help you, ma'am?

168
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,360
Quit the formalities.

169
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,560
You're blackmailing me.

170
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Are you scared of the police, Dalmar?

171
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,120
What?

172
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,360
I am too.

173
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,080
If the police saw that video,
they might think that I

174
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,520
had something to do
with what happened to Raúl.

175
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,040
And that wasn't the case,
as I'm sure you'll understand.

176
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,080
Hmm?

177
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,600
It's as if…

178
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
It's as if I took this knife…

179
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,960
Hmm? And cut myself.

180
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,840
And I went to the police station
and told them you did it.

181
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,040
Who would they believe? Tell me.

182
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,480
A white, Spanish woman of a certain age

183
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,840
or…

184
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,800
Do I need to say more? I don't, right?

185
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,680
Come on, sweetheart.

186
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,120
Give me back the money, okay?

187
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,000
We'll forget about the video,
about all this nonsense,

188
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,440
and carry on as if nothing happened.

189
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,360
What do you say?

190
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Bye.

191
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,360
SPANISH GOVERNMENT
IMMIGRATION OFFICE

192
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,200
ONE MONTH TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY

193
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,640
Couldn't we meet somewhere else?

194
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,640
This won't take long. Come on.

195
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,520
-Another loan was denied.
-I can't fucking believe this, dude.

196
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,320
Did all the banks agree
not to lend me money?

197
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,520
Do you want a glass of water?

198
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,200
No.

199
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,680
Then sell to that family friend guy.
Cimbel?

200
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,920
Cibrán? No, I can't.

201
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,080
Do you know how it feels to be
a disappointment to your parents?

202
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,160
I'm a Muslim, and I'm gay. I do know.

203
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,880
That's true. Sorry.

204
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,280
Dude, what I need to do
is rescue my business,

205
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,360
and rub it in my parents' faces.

206
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,720
That's what I have to do.

207
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,880
Oh, yeah?

208
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,960
How?

209
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Hey. No. Come on.

210
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,480
Come here.

211
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,880
Don't let them see you cry.

212
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,440
I'm not going to cry.
But I can't take it anymore, Omar.

213
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,640
Aren't you Iván's best friend?

214
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,440
And isn't he the patron of the needy?

215
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,120
I can't. I'd be mortified.
It's a lot of money.

216
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,320
Well, that's what friends are for.

217
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,360
Dude, do you realize
what you're getting into?

218
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,160
Alumni is a bunch of fascists.

219
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,240
My sister knows them.
They're something else.

220
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,560
I don't care about that.

221
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,600
You don't care
that you're joining a fascist cult?

222
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,640
-I'm doing my own thing.
-And what is that?

223
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,160
Networking.

224
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,480
Which you can't afford.

225
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,800
Well, I'll figure something out
with the fees and everything.

226
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,840
That's what I always do.

227
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,200
Joel, Las Encinas is also supposed to be
a safe bet for the future, and look at me.

228
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,680
Come on, get real.

229
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,360
Your sister is doing great.

230
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,960
Isn't she?

231
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,040
Well, there you go.

232
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,480
You've gone stiff all of a sudden.

233
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,360
I'd appreciate an answer, if possible.

234
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,840
It's a lot.

235
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,440
I know.

236
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,000
I mean, Isa…

237
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,640
if I lend you all the money you want,

238
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,000
I want you to promise to pay me first.

239
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,360
Before paying back other lenders,
before covering expenses,

240
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,320
and long before there's a profit,
if there even is any.

241
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,760
And I doubt there will be.

242
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,360
-What?
-Look.

243
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,440
Pay me before anyone else.

244
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,880
Pay the others.

245
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,920
Cover your expenses.

246
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,360
And then you get your profit.

247
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,880
Any profit will be shared, obviously,

248
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,800
but I doubt there will be any.

249
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,160
You don't trust me.

250
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,800
-I do.
-You don't. I can't believe it.

251
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,120
I do, but the structure collapsed
not long ago.

252
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,480
What about the structure, Iván?

253
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,440
Is there a police report somewhere?

254
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,280
I had all the papers.
The structure collapsed. Bad luck.

255
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,040
Shit happens, what can I say?

256
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,160
I can't believe it.

257
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,440
My dad, my mom, my best friend.
No one trusts me.

258
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,880
-I trust you, but--
-Forget it, Iván. I'm really grateful.

259
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,160
I'll have them bring the bill.
You're not getting a fucking discount.

260
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,920
Baby?

261
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,760
Yes?

262
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,960
You spoke to Cibrán, didn't you?

263
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,000
Huh?

264
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,680
Oh, no. No, I didn't in the end.

265
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,800
What do you mean, "in the end"?

266
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,840
I'll find a different solution, Mom.

267
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,560
That's enough, baby!
Listen to me for once in your life.

268
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,120
Your dad told you
to sell everything to Cibrán,

269
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,680
and that's what you're gonna do.
Do you hear me?

270
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,280
-Mom, I'm not--
-We're getting your dad out of jail.

271
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,880
Where you, you fickle brat, put him.

272
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,320
Do you know what we're gonna do?
We're calling Cibrán right now.

273
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,680
You're going to speak to him with me here
because you don't seem to get it. Here.

274
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,800
Hello, Cibrán. How are you?

275
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,120
No. I'm Isadora, her daughter.

276
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,720
Likewise.

277
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,160
Is this your offer?

278
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,800
-I have more money in the bank.
-With what you owe me, we'd be even.

279
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,800
-I need to pay my dad's bail.
-It's not negotiable. Take it or leave it.

280
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,720
How much do we owe you?

281
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,520
No. I've been giving your father time
for too long. I won't give it to you.

282
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,520
You have today to decide.

283
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,920
Someone's in here!

284
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,400
Shit.

285
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,720
For crying out loud.
Is everyone peeing at the same time?

286
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,200
-What is it?
-How are you, Joel?

287
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,600
I'm fine, and you?

288
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,360
-Fine.
-I'm glad.

289
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,360
Is it true what I heard
about the Alumni event?

290
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,160
How do you know about that?

291
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,080
-Chloe told us.
-She shouldn't have.

292
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,120
No, that's a lie. It wasn't Chloe.

293
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,760
Chloe told Sonia
because she wanted to tell Eric,

294
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,760
but Eric won't speak to her,
and then Sonia told Eric.

295
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,600
And Eric, who won't speak to me either,
but sometimes does,

296
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,280
spoke to me
in this case and told me about it.

297
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,480
Is it true or not?

298
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,920
Nico, what happens
in Alumni stays in Alumni.

299
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,040
-I'll take that as a yes. Where is it?
-I can't tell you.

300
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,120
But the prize would blow your mind.

301
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,520
-Wanna know what it is?
-Sure!

302
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,720
-But you can't tell anyone!
-I won't, man!

303
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,640
What are you doing?

304
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,920
Going with you.

305
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,840
Honey, you can't.

306
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,600
Hold on.

307
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,520
What do you want?

308
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,680
I want to take part.

309
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,880
What?

310
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,000
-I didn't--
-No, she didn't tell me. No.

311
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,920
Who did?

312
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,720
I don't know. Anyway, can I?

313
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,000
It's Alumni only. I'm sorry. Bye!

314
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,360
What if I gave you
a share of Isadora House as payment?

315
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,240
For taking part. A percentage.

316
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,600
What the fuck? You're out of your mind.

317
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,120
You shut up.

318
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,520
Come on, Isa.

319
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,120
Keep talking.

320
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,600
If I win, the prize is mine, obviously.

321
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,800
If I lose,
I'll give you a share of Isadora House.

322
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,600
You mean your bankrupt club?

323
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,720
It's much more than a club.

324
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,600
Also, you can save it.
Aren't you the best at everything?

325
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,640
Let's go.

326
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,440
See you in a bit.

327
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,280
The fascist and the furious.

328
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Don't I get a good-luck kiss?

329
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,840
You may just have to earn it.

330
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,920
Come here, you!

331
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
Are you serious?

332
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Don't bust my balls. I'm doing it anyway.

333
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,280
-You're a shit driver!
-I'm a perfectly fine driver.

334
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,640
Yes, to go shopping,
not for a race like this.

335
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,320
You're gonna get yourself killed.

336
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,280
It's not like I have much to lose.

337
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,360
Fuck!

338
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,560
Come here.

339
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,600
There, back, and there again.

340
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,840
The first to finish wins.

341
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,440
Are you girls ready?

342
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,280
Are you boys ready?

343
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,800
In three,

344
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,840
two,

345
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,680
one!

346
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Joel, don't say go!

347
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,920
What?

348
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,000
Go!

349
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,520
Isa!

350
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,600
Come on!

351
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,920
-Why are you here?
-Are you annoyed I didn't come for you?

352
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,920
She can't fucking drive!
She'll get herself killed!

353
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,400
-This was her decision.
-You're so selfish.

354
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,920
Me? I'm selfish?

355
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,840
What?

356
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,880
If I had come looking for you,
would you not have made out with Héctor?

357
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,520
Are you guys together?

358
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,800
Shit, Iván!

359
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,320
Joel, come!

360
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,560
Joel, come!

361
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,320
Get away!

362
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,320
Joel, listen. Look at me.

363
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,840
Come on, get up.

364
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,640
Come on.

365
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,240
-Can you?
-Yes.

366
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,160
Come on.

367
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,000
Wait, let me help.

368
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Are you okay?

369
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,760
Easy.

370
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,240
Okay, look at me.

371
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,680
Are you okay?

372
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,240
-Yes.
-Are you?

373
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,200
Are you okay?

374
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,280
-Yes, I think so.
-Cool.

375
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,800
Should we talk business?

376
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,680
-Excuse me?
-I'm not talking to you.

377
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,600
-What business?
-Yours. You owe me your business.

378
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,320
What do you mean?

379
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,600
She offered a share of her club
to take part.

380
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,280
Well… that's impossible.

381
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,640
-I'm not talking to you.
-Well, you have to.

382
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,480
Because I'm the owner of Isadora House.

383
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,400
What?

384
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,760
Isa sold it to me yesterday and

385
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,680
I don't know why she promised you
something that wasn't hers to give.

386
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,440
It's in my name,
so you'll have to talk to me.

387
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,240
You're in debt with Alumni.

388
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,520
And I can assure you that you'll pay.

389
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,960
Thank you.

390
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,400
I hate coming to this shithole.

391
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,200
Good thing it's all over now.

392
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,520
-When are you closing the deal?
-I'm not.

393
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,880
-What?
-He offered me peanuts, Mom.

394
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,160
-What did your father tell you?
-I don't care.

395
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,320
But I couldn't accept his shitty offer.

396
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,640
I almost had to pay him.
And there wasn't enough for Dad's bail.

397
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,760
He said that, considering Dad's debt…

398
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,000
Did he mention the debt?

399
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,680
That's all he talked about.

400
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,400
What else did he say, Isadora?

401
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,160
That I had to give him
an answer yesterday.

402
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,880
I want to see my husband.

403
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,960
-I need to see him. It's urgent.
-Ma'am.

404
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,320
-Don't touch me!
-Calm down.

405
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,360
-Please.
-I need to see my husband.

406
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,600
Please, his name is Martín Artiñán.

407
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,000
I need to see him, please! It's urgent!

408
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,280
Roberta! Roberta, what is it?

409
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,320
Don't touch me!

410
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,200
Mom, what's happening?

411
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,400
No. They killed him.

412
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,760
They killed your father.

413
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,360
They killed him.

414
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,920
You killed him.

415
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,040
You killed him.

416
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,760
You fickle, drug-addict bitch!
You killed him!

417
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,760
You killed him!
You're the worst thing to happen to me!

418
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,000
The worst!

419
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,240
My poor Martín.

420
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,120
Do you think I'm scared that you're a cop?

421
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,040
Are you threatening me?

422
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,320
You know what?

423
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,920
I won't wait for you to listen to me.

424
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,080
Shitheads like you
deserve little less than death.

425
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,040
I'm going to screw you over,
and I'm going to do it right now.

426
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,480
