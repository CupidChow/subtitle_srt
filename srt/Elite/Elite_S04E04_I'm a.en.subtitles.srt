1
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,160
How are you doing?

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,040
Who did this?

3
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,480
Stay calm, honey.

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,040
The doctors said you'll get
your memory back little by little.

5
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,200
It took me over 20 years
to get a Las Encinas girl into bed.

6
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,440
And I had to pay her.

7
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,120
-I used to go to your school.
-You did?

8
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,080
Yeah.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,040
Don't worry. Some of us turn out okay.

10
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,520
Mind if I give your number to someone?

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,920
Who?

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,800
A friend.
I told him good things about you.

13
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,400
Didn't you want to grow your business?

14
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Yeah, actually.

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,560
It'd be in this room, all expenses paid.

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,680
Just like it is with me.

17
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,960
Not exactly.

18
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll be charging your friend double.

19
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,880
I want you on the debate team.

20
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,120
When I first got here, you did a nice job
defending your friend Shanaa.

21
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,520
I think you've got talent.

22
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,320
And if you used it for good causes,

23
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,440
you could become…
a brilliant lawyer, for example.

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm not sure I want to be a lawyer.

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,760
You'll need to work very hard
every single day after school.

26
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,360
Hang on. I work at the Lake Club
every day after school.

27
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,400
Then you'll quit.

28
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,160
-How much do you make?
-Why?

29
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,720
The school could offer you 25% more
for secretarial or IT work,

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
and you'd be able to do debate team.

31
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,200
Excuse me for asking,

32
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
but are you trying to help me?

33
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,800
-He said I'm good at it.
-He must want something from you.

34
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,680
They don't offer that stuff
to people like you.

35
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,920
People like me?

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
He wanted to kick you out because he said
you didn't deserve to be here.

37
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,240
Now he says I could be a brilliant lawyer.

38
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,840
And you seriously believe him?

39
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,720
-What are you laughing at?
-Come on, Samu…

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,440
-All right. Let's go.
-Don't be mad, okay?

41
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,040
What's up, Gonza?

42
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,080
Samuel, make sure Mencía isn't coming.

43
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,680
-Why?
-I've got a surprise for her.

44
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,640
You're so nosy. What's this?

45
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,080
"Suite 428."

46
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,920
"Gran Hotel Brenwhorf."

47
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,960
Tomorrow.

48
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,840
Shit.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,640
-Why didn't I switch to girls sooner?
-I must have done something well.

50
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,160
Yeah, now that I think of it,
you did a great job of messing it up, pal.

51
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,480
Wanna hang out tomorrow? I'm free.

52
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,840
How about today?
I have plans with someone tomorrow.

53
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,840
Oh, who? Can't you reschedule for me?

54
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,320
I'm free today, not tomorrow.

55
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,560
Never mind. Forget it.
I can't meet up tomorrow either.

56
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,920
Just a second. Almost done.

57
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Coffee?

58
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,840
-Like that'll make everything okay?
-I deleted it.

59
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,320
Your video.

60
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,160
I deleted it this morning.

61
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,960
You still filmed me without my consent.

62
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,800
It had nothing to do with you. I swear.

63
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,680
I don't trust anyone.

64
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,440
Look, Phillipe, let's end things now
because this was never going to work.

65
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,600
You're a prince,
and I'm the fucking janitor.

66
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,240
There's no planet or parallel universe
where this would've worked out.

67
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,600
-Especially not after you taped me.
-Let me fix things.

68
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,760
Let me show you
the person behind the title.

69
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,280
Maybe I'm not interested in him.

70
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,120
Maybe I got close to him
just because he was a prince.

71
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,640
And you got close to me
because I was easy prey.

72
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,120
-No.
-Yes.

73
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
-Just another groupie.
-No.

74
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,760
Cayetana…

75
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,720
We're done.

76
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,080
You go your way, I'll go mine.

77
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,120
Be grateful
we're in the library, not the showers.

78
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,200
Stop it, please.

79
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,640
I'm not doing anything.

80
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Do I have to do this the hard way?

81
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,440
Chill, okay?

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,800
It was sex, not a marriage proposal.

83
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,800
You don't give a shit
'cause you have nobody to care about.

84
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,160
Ander.

85
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,400
Look, whatever his problem is,

86
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,040
the three of us can work it out
just by talking it over.

87
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,240
Yeah, right.

88
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,360
He won't even look at me.
You think he'll want to see you?

89
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,920
Well, we can try.

90
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,480
Just get the three of us together,
and I promise you, I'll fix this.

91
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,200
Trust me.

92
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,600
-How about we go somewhere quiet?
-Let's just stay for a while.

93
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,120
-Please.
-Just for a little while. Come on.

94
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,200
-What are you doing?
-Look. Your turn.

95
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
-No damn way.
-Come on. Take it off.

96
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,240
Come on.

97
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,880
What the fuck, Ander?

98
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,760
Patrick!

99
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Hey. How's it going?

100
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,480
What's up?

101
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,440
You don't need clothes to be happy, huh?

102
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,560
Did you plan to meet here or something?

103
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,160
No, I swear.

104
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,800
-I'm leaving, man.
-No, stay a little while.

105
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,000
-No way. I'm beat.
-Why the rush?

106
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,720
Don't worry about that.

107
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,520
I have something
that will lift you up off the ground.

108
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,040
What is it? Magic?

109
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,000
No.

110
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,840
It's G.

111
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,760
What's that?

112
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,880
-GHB.
-One squirt, and it's goodbye fatigue.

113
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,160
Well, goodbye fatigue,
repression, shame… everything.

114
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,440
It can't be worse than chemo.

115
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,320
People die using that stuff.

116
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,680
What?
Now you're worried about letting loose?

117
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,160
What a surprise.

118
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,840
Listen, Omar.

119
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,760
I said no!

120
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,560
It'd do us good to chill out a little.

121
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,000
I said no. Do what you want.
I'm not interested.

122
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,600
-Want a squirt?
-Sure.

123
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,240
Where did you get this?

124
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,160
So, you're searching my room now?

125
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,600
You got this from Rebeka?

126
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,360
Leave Rebe out of this.

127
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,000
-Her mom went to jail for drugs.
-She's not involved!

128
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,400
So?

129
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,640
I'm not giving it back
until you tell me how you got it.

130
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,760
You don't even know
what the hotel card was for?

131
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,680
It could be anything.

132
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,320
Shit, and you're the new star
of the debate team?

133
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,320
The others must really suck.

134
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,640
No, what I meant was--

135
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,560
I don't care what you meant.
What's wrong with me? What's wrong?

136
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,640
What's my problem?
You tell me, since you played me too.

137
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,080
I'm so sorry, Rebe.

138
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,040
People make mistakes.
That has nothing to do with you.

139
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,000
Right.

140
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,760
It's not about what you do or don't do.
The rest of us are to blame.

141
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,720
Just because the rest of us are assholes
doesn't make you one.

142
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,440
Just the opposite.

143
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,200
Rebe,

144
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,800
you're an amazing girl.

145
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,280
That's the one thing
you should be sure of.

146
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,560
Maybe you're not so bad
at debating after all.

147
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,120
-Want some ice cream?
-I want a ton.

148
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,480
-Good, because it's chocolate.
-Right on.

149
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,520
-I come here all the time with my dad.
-Yeah?

150
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,520
Hey.

151
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,000
Hello.

152
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,320
Hello.

153
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,960
-Do you have a reservation?
-Yes.

154
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,440
You look great.

155
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,280
Thanks.

156
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,160
Our coats, please.

157
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,520
Thanks, Samu.

158
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,520
I'm leaving.

159
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,360
No, Omar. Listen.

160
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,880
I can't go to bed right now.
Look how high I am.

161
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,480
That's your problem, Ander.

162
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,880
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

163
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,440
Omar!

164
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,720
Hey, try a little bit.
It's so fun. You'll see.

165
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,760
I said no!

166
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,120
Omar, please. Listen to me.

167
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,080
Get as high as you want,
but leave me alone!

168
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,320
Look on the bright side.

169
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,000
More for us.

170
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,160
I don't want any more.

171
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,520
Ander!

172
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,280
Patrick.

173
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,080
Watch out!

174
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,600
Shit. Give me a hand.

175
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,000
Patrick.

176
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,840
Omar!

177
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,440
Omar!

178
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,880
Move!

179
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,560
Shit!

180
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,120
Patrick!

181
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,680
Patrick!

182
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,440
Close the door.

183
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
I'm gonna puke.

184
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,720
God damn it, Ander.

185
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
What are you doing?

186
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,360
Taking you to the shower.
It'll help you feel better.

187
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
Come on.

188
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,160
Help me out a little.

189
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,680
Feeling better?

190
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,560
Go to bed. I'll join you in a minute.

191
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
-Come on.
-No.

192
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,800
-Move.
-No.

193
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,160
Are you okay?

194
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,200
I'm cold.

195
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,160
Stay, please.

196
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,120
Okay, but make room for me.

197
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,880
-Why'd I repeat a year?
-Yes.

198
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,560
-You sure do like asking questions.
-Come on.

199
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,920
Excuse me. We're closing.

200
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,520
Your dad wants me to join debate team.

201
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,200
-Really?
-Yeah.

202
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,600
I'm on it too.

203
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,520
Really?

204
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,440
But you can't join, right?

205
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,280
You don't have time,
with work, school, and all.

206
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,280
I might join anyway.

207
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,840
Yeah? And what about this job?

208
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,560
That's my business.

209
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,160
-Would you like to pay now?
-Yes, please.

210
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,400
Need a ride, or did you bike here?

211
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,440
I biked.

212
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,360
Samu.

213
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,600
Our coats, please.

214
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,760
Benjamín, I'm joining debate team.

215
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,160
We're late for class.

216
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,880
Omar. Are you working at the club tonight?

217
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,160
Yeah, why?

218
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,120
I need you to do me a favor.

219
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,520
Cut it out.

220
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,280
What's wrong?

221
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Hangover.

222
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,400
Did you go out?

223
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,000
You said you couldn't.

224
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,960
Who are you hanging out with today?

225
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,160
I told you, I work
so I don't have to live off Benjamín.

226
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,840
What type of work?

227
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,120
We both have a secret.

228
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
Mencía, you need to stop this.

229
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,440
Dad doesn't want you seeing Rebeka.
Stop pushing his buttons.

230
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,640
Children shouldn't be blamed
for what their parents are like.

231
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,920
-Rebeka shouldn't be blamed either.
-Hello.

232
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,440
-Okay. Hi.
-Hi.

233
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,360
-Shall we?
-No, come in and say hi to my dad.

234
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,600
Come on.

235
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,600
Why are you here?

236
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,480
I'm meeting with your dad
about the debate team.

237
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,280
Can't you meet at school?

238
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,080
He invited me over.
What was I supposed to do?

239
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,320
Are you sure?

240
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,680
-I'm out of here.
-Samuel!

241
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,600
I thought you had changed your mind.

242
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,960
Almost.

243
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,920
Come on in.

244
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,880
-Dad, say hi to Guzmán.
-Yes, sure.

245
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,720
How are you? All good?

246
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,320
All good, Benjamín. Thank you.

247
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,120
-How about we talk in my office?
-Sure.

248
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,480
Make me an espresso, Ari? Want anything?

249
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,400
Me?

250
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,680
Coffee with cream, please?

251
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,760
I also worked all kinds of jobs
to pay for school.

252
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
What?

253
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Do you think I had it easy?

254
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,240
I don't.

255
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
I can't even remember my dad.

256
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,600
I never met mine, so…

257
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,400
I was given a scholarship
to a private college in London,

258
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,360
and well…

259
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,400
I was ecstatic when I got home.

260
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,000
And my mom,

261
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,720
the first thing she said was,

262
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,880
"Never forget that we are not like them."

263
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,000
"Like them," she said.

264
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,000
And from that day forward,
I set out to prove

265
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,640
that there is no "them,"

266
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,000
and that the future belongs
to those who deserve it.

267
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,640
Right?

268
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,480
I'm sure your mom was very proud of you.

269
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,360
Yours must be proud too.

270
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,480
Ari.

271
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,200
You'll be Samuel's partner.

272
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,560
What?

273
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,320
You'll be great partners
on the debate team.

274
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Yes.

275
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,000
Well, I'm going for a walk with Guzmán.

276
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,440
Thanks for the coffee.

277
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,280
No visitors.

278
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,280
Okay.

279
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,280
Get out of here.

280
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,640
What?

281
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,560
I don't want you to upset her.

282
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,080
-Hello?
-Hi, Caye. It's Omar. How are you?

283
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,080
I'm just calling to confirm
your reservation at the Lake Club tonight.

284
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
What?

285
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,400
Good evening, madam.

286
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,920
Omar, what's all this?
Why is the place empty?

287
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,120
Your table is ready. If you'll follow me.

288
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,480
Omar--

289
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,480
Here you are.

290
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,240
Welcome.

291
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,280
May I?

292
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,200
Okay.

293
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Thank you.

294
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,200
You look amazing.

295
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,800
Look, Omar, I'm leaving. This is--

296
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,120
Good evening.

297
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,520
No way.

298
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,720
Petit apéritif.

299
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,160
What are you doing?

300
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,920
I'm so sorry, madam, but…
you must be mistaking me for someone else.

301
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,320
I'm only your waiter.

302
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,280
Playing waiter for a night
won't change how I see you.

303
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,440
-Everything to your liking?
-You listening?

304
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,160
No, please. It's my first day.

305
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,840
I see.

306
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,800
-Not cold enough.
-It isn't?

307
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,200
Sorry for the inconvenience.
I'll bring a new bottle. Anything else?

308
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,760
Yes, my napkin.

309
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,880
It's dirty.

310
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,040
Sorry, I'll bring you a new one.

311
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,720
Will you speak my language, please?

312
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,680
-Would you like a recommendation?
-From the menu?

313
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,320
Let me see.

314
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,320
I think I know what I'd like.

315
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,560
Great. What is it?

316
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,520
Trust.

317
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,360
That's what I want. Some trust.

318
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,360
It had nothing to do with you personally.

319
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,360
I don't care about anyone else.

320
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,600
You made me second-guess myself.

321
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,760
And I don't know about you,
but that night we spent together…

322
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,160
I forgot who we were.

323
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,560
We were just you and me,
naked, and I forgot.

324
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,680
And I'd like you to be able to forget too.

325
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
I'm sorry.

326
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,400
Will you forgive me?

327
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,600
I'M COMING TO THE CLUB TO SEE YOU

328
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,760
I'M VERY BUSY. IT'S BETTER IF YOU DON'T.

329
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,080
Lovebirds.

330
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,880
Go on, get moving.
I need to clean up before anyone comes.

331
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,560
Come on!

332
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,280
I know what you're thinking.
This isn't a third date.

333
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,600
-It's not?
-No.

334
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,000
This is just a little show I put on,
like a fool.

335
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,920
Oh, great.

336
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,640
Our third date will be now, at my place.

337
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,960
If you want.

338
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,960
I do.

339
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,520
Mencía?

340
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,600
Take it all off.

341
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,760
Aren't you forgetting something?

342
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,800
That's for one hour.

343
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,880
Let's not waste it then.

344
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,840
Pizza?

345
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,200
We agreed on sushi!

346
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,680
I brought one with tuna.

347
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,280
Dad, we said sushi!

348
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,200
Dad.

349
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,160
Is that how you defend your position
in a debate?

350
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,000
-He'll tear you apart.
-I can't believe this.

351
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,120
Where's Mencía?

352
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,960
-She left before I did.
-Who was she meeting up with?

353
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,800
Rebeka, I think.

354
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,600
You let her go?

355
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,520
-Dad, I--
-I don't want her near that girl.

356
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,520
Hold on.

357
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,560
Rebe is one of the best people I know.

358
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,360
My daughter had 3,000 euros in her room.

359
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,280
What?

360
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,760
Where does a girl get 3,000 euros,
hanging out with a dealer's daughter?

361
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,440
Care to connect the dots, García?
Or should I?

362
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,680
She's not involved
with that stuff anymore.

363
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,000
-I need to get that.
-Hey!

364
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,720
Not now.

365
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,160
Hey, look. Let me go, okay?

366
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,480
What?

367
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,920
I've had enough of this game. Let me go.

368
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,200
Come on, now.

369
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,560
If you want to get paid,
you need to act like a professional.

370
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,680
I told you I'm not a professional,
so let me go.

371
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,840
Patrick, check if she's at the club
or if anyone's seen her.

372
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,400
-Let's go to Parrilla's house.
-She's not there.

373
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,640
Nobody asked you.

374
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,480
-I'll get the car keys.
-Dad, don't drive in this state.

375
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,880
She's involved in something serious.

376
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,040
-I hope Guzmán isn't home yet.
-I can drive your dad's car.

377
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,040
I'm going with Samuel.

378
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,920
-What? Why?
-You need to stay here in case she calls.

379
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,600
Come on.

380
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,480
-Patrick?
-Have you seen Mencía?

381
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,720
No. I've been here all night,
and I haven't. Patrick!

382
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,960
Get out of there!

383
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,240
What the hell is he doing?

384
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,800
What's going on, man?

385
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,480
-Dammit!
-Hey!

386
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,920
You.

387
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Shit, you scared me.

388
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,680
What are you doing?

389
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,160
-What?
-Are you after Omar now?

390
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,480
What are you talking about?

391
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,600
First you get in his bed,
and now you turn up here?

392
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,720
My sister is missing.

393
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,000
Right, and I'm an idiot.

394
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,360
It's true, god damn it. Mencía is missing.

395
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
More than an idiot, you're blind.

396
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,640
Omar came looking for me.

397
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,160
At the ball.

398
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,880
You fucked him at the ball?

399
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,640
He fucked me, actually.

400
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,880
You must think our family is insane.

401
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,120
Not at all. My family--

402
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,400
We have reasons to be insane, though.

403
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,320
When Mencía was little,

404
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,920
she ran away from home.

405
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,760
We didn't notice until dinner.

406
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,760
My mom went out looking for her
in her car with Patrick,

407
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,880
and soon it got dark.

408
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,320
My mom was really nervous, and…

409
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,400
they got in a car crash.

410
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,960
Patrick was bedridden for two years.

411
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,240
And my mom died instantly.

412
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,840
Shit.

413
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
My dad still hasn't gotten over it.

414
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,800
Three grand?

415
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,640
Did you give it to her?

416
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,560
What? Who do you think I am?

417
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,040
Mencía won't answer the phone, and we--

418
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,520
Are they worried?

419
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
I have to go. Ari's in the car.

420
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,240
Oh shit! The hotel key card.

421
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,440
Please, let me go.

422
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,480
Hey, can we stop?

423
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,560
Are you listening to me? Please.

424
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,520
Who is it?

425
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,160
Room service.

426
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,040
We didn't order anything.

427
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,440
It's a bottle of champagne, sir.
It's on the house.

428
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,640
Leave it at the door!

429
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,000
Hey, I could go for some champagne.

430
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,120
Who are you?

431
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,160
Get out of here!

432
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,080
What the hell?

433
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,520
That's Rebe calling.

434
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,800
Mencía!

435
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,000
Where are you?

436
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,720
Fine, but are you okay?

437
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,600
Shit.

438
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,080
I'll see you at home. Hurry up.

439
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,040
Okay, bye.

440
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,640
Home, then?

441
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,880
Do you want some pizza?

442
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,680
Okay.

443
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,520
-It's not what it looks like.
-Really?

444
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,200
Explain it to me then.
This can only be one goddamn thing.

445
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Not you too, please.

446
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,160
Rebe…

447
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,040
You know I do it so that…

448
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,360
I can get away from here.

449
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,240
Hopefully with you.

450
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,080
What's wrong with you?
You think this is just a game?

451
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,840
I don't give a shit why you did it!

452
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,880
But that guy
could have done anything to you.

453
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,280
Don't look at me like that.

454
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,960
Please.

455
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,280
Not you.

456
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,680
Don't ever fucking scare me
like that again, you brat.

457
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,600
Ari.

458
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,040
Samuel García?

459
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,440
What?

460
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,560
-Come with us.
-What's wrong?

461
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,120
-Come on.
-What's wrong?

462
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,520
Ari!

463
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,960
What…? Ari!

464
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,720
Ari!

465
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,800
Ari!
