1
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,880
What did her message say?

2
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,320
"Is that all you have to say
after last night?"

3
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,560
So, you still smelled of her, you bastard!

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,080
-Guzmán!
-Let me tell you something, Samuel.

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,040
You're a liar.

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,320
You pretend you're a good guy
and my friend,

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,520
but you have no fucking clue
what being a good friend is.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I'd punch you
if we weren't in a restaurant.

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,840
-Don't look at me like that.
-Is this your idea of taking a stand?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,520
Guzmán.

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,480
This isn't a competition
or something I did on a whim, okay?

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,280
What matters is that you're my friend,
and I don't want to hurt you.

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,080
Let me say something to you two, okay?

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,840
Fuck you both!

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,640
Got that?

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,200
-Will you please listen--
-Shut the hell up.

17
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,040
-I'm finally gonna read it.
-Good. I gave it to you a year ago.

18
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,640
Now I'll have the time on my trip.

19
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,880
Know what? I might even go with you.

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
How come?

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,160
I honestly don't know what I'm doing here.

22
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,280
You should've left when you wanted to.

23
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,480
I had my reasons.

24
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,920
One reason in particular.

25
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,480
You idiot.

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,280
I love having the two of you at the house.
Even if it's a goodbye.

27
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,600
Are you telling everyone at school today?

28
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah.

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,440
Leaving halfway through the year? Really?
Can't you wait till summer?

30
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,720
Who knows where I'll be come summer.
Or if I'll be here.

31
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,160
Come here.

32
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,000
Come on. Okay. Stop.
You said you'd support me.

33
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,040
Yes, but let me have
my "suffering mother" moments.

34
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,440
Off you go.

35
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,600
Bye.

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,520
Bye.

37
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,120
BEFORE I GO: OMAR

38
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,040
I can't wait for the holidays this year.

39
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,120
I've always liked spending time
with my family, and maybe…

40
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Ari, I need to talk to you.

41
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,320
To me? What about?

42
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,680
Your sister won't listen,
so maybe you will.

43
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,240
You're gonna use me
to solve your problems with my sister?

44
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,520
Have a merry Christmas, Rebeka.

45
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,520
-Well--
-Please.

46
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,280
I'll be right back.

47
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,440
My advice to you
is that you forget about my sister.

48
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,600
Save yourself some sleepless nights.

49
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,880
And leave her with no choice
but to keep seeing that creepy old guy?

50
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,840
What creepy old guy? Armando?

51
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,800
They're just friends.
What do you mean, she has no choice?

52
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,440
Now you're crazy and jealous?

53
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,200
Yeah, sure, they're besties.
Did she say how they met?

54
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
-Out drinking.
-Yeah, right.

55
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,120
With money involved.

56
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,480
What?

57
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,960
I'm not telling you this
because I'm bitter or want her back.

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,120
I know that telling you
means I'll lose her forever.

59
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,680
This is in case you can help her
since she won't let me.

60
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,800
Get out.

61
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,720
-Caye, just a second.
-No, get out.

62
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,120
-Let me--
-Don't touch me.

63
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,840
Listen to me. I'm begging you.

64
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,560
Let's go outside, where there are cameras.
You like them, right?

65
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,200
I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.

66
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,240
We were partying,
and we had a lot to drink.

67
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,160
So? That's not an excuse, Phillipe.

68
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,000
Cayetana, it's totally normal
that I misread the signals.

69
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,520
What signals exactly?
There were plenty of signals.

70
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,160
I don't know. We were making out, right?

71
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,720
The fact that we were making out
is no excuse.

72
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,720
I said no more than once, Phillipe.

73
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,840
Did you misinterpret those signals, too?

74
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,000
You only got the message
when I jumped out of your limo.

75
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,520
Caye…

76
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,560
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,760
I mean it.

78
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,000
Fuck no.

79
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,440
Don't listen to her.
She made it all up because she's hurt.

80
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't think
she'd make something like that up.

81
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,080
Ari, I'm telling you, ignore her.

82
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,120
Mencía, are you sure?

83
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,880
-Stay out of my goddamn life!
-Mencía…

84
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,600
All right…

85
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,240
Whatever's going on
with Armando or whoever…

86
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,760
It's my own goddamn problem,
and I'll handle it myself.

87
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,920
No, Mencía! That's what you always say.

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,520
Then you just walk away and leave
the rest of us to clean up your mess!

89
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,920
You should trust your family a bit more.

90
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,560
-Let's tell Dad.
-No.

91
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,240
-Will you stop being mad at Dad?
-Don't say a word to Benjamín.

92
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,000
But Dad could fix this in a second.

93
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,280
I said no, Ari.

94
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,880
Not a word to him, Patrick, or anyone.

95
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,400
I swear if you tell Benjamín,
you all will never see me again, got it?

96
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,200
I've tried everything to forget you.

97
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,520
But I realized it's pointless,
because I can't,

98
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
and ridiculous, because I don't want to.

99
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,840
I won't forgive myself for giving up
on you because I'd never done that.

100
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,720
Not even when I thought you were dying.

101
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,240
I won't do it again.

102
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,840
Give up on you, I mean.

103
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,440
If you're willing,
I want to give us another chance.

104
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,000
What do you think?

105
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,760
You were going to New York for Malick,
and you didn't because of me.

106
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,080
Have you wondered where you'd be now
if you'd listened to your gut?

107
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,280
I didn't stay here for you. It was for me.

108
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,200
I can't imagine my life without you.

109
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,640
I want to be with you.

110
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,360
But if you don't want that, it's okay.

111
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,040
I won't start drama
or hold it against you.

112
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,280
I'll just accept it.

113
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,520
I'll leave you alone.

114
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,120
BEFORE I GO: OMAR

115
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,840
Omar, wait.

116
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,320
Come in.

117
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,880
Excuse me. You wanted to see me?

118
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
Benjamín, would you give us a moment?

119
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,920
Are you trying to defend
your son's actions?

120
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,640
No matter what passing fads may claim,

121
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,680
men are born with

122
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,760
that characteristic vigor,

123
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,120
and we women
have the ability to harness it.

124
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,960
And that is a very powerful gift.

125
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,080
There's no need to deny biology
or to make a huge fuss about changing it.

126
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,680
Forget about any other girls

127
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,240
and whatever you might have heard
about Phillipe

128
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,680
because my son has chosen you.

129
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,160
Over everything.

130
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,160
And everyone.

131
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,680
Do you know how many things will no longer
be a concern for you and your family?

132
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,000
Countless things.

133
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,560
Don't be silly.

134
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Don't refuse this gift
life has offered you.

135
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,920
Cayetana, I'd love it if you came
to our New Year's Eve party

136
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,320
on Phillipe's arm.

137
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,480
DECEMBER 31

138
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,840
Oh, you look so handsome!

139
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,480
Come on in. Ander's in the shower.

140
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,200
We have so many plans
for after graduation.

141
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,080
-We deserve it.
-Can I ask you a personal question?

142
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,840
Yes?

143
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,600
-Shoot.
-Why did you get back together?

144
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,600
Because… we love each other, Azucena.

145
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,720
But that's not enough.

146
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,880
I love my ex very much.

147
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,200
He's Ander's father,
and I'll never stop loving him.

148
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,720
But you need to share a common goal.

149
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,920
I don't mean a house and kids.

150
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,240
I'm not that crazy.

151
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,640
But you need to be on the same page.

152
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,000
I just told you we have so many plans.

153
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,760
"We" or just you?

154
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,640
He's staying for you again.

155
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,000
I didn't force him to do that.

156
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,720
I told him that if he didn't want
to get back together, I'd accept it.

157
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,080
Omar…

158
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,320
What's up?

159
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,520
Wow.

160
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,120
You look great.

161
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,680
Would you excuse me?

162
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,880
-How's it going?
-Fine. And you?

163
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,360
Hi.

164
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,480
Hi.

165
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
You look amazing.

166
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,040
Thanks.

167
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,320
It's your moment to shine at the photo op.

168
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,600
Impress them.

169
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,200
Excuse me.

170
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,280
Your son's vigor
is not a question of biology,

171
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,480
Your Highness, but of upbringing.

172
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,840
Screw them.

173
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,720
What do you intend to do?

174
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,280
I organized this to celebrate
the New Year with my guests.

175
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,960
And Cayetana is my guest in her own right.
As a friend and as a designer.

176
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,880
You are a fool and an ingrate.

177
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,280
And whose fault is that?

178
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,560
Who raised me this way?

179
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,280
Phillipe…

180
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,960
I brought you into this world.
I raised you.

181
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,560
I never took my eyes off you,

182
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,480
except when it was better
to look the other way.

183
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,240
Which was often the case.

184
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,920
My role has been to love and protect you,
and I have done so impeccably.

185
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,720
If now, all of a sudden,

186
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,600
you want to be an adult
and go it alone, fine.

187
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,080
Accept the consequences of your actions.

188
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,480
Take it easy, Ari.
We know how you get when you drink.

189
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,000
I don't know what you mean.
I hardly ever drink.

190
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,520
We've now gone
from "never" to "hardly ever."

191
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,920
Go talk to her.

192
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,440
No way.

193
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,800
Then keep wallowing in your pride
and see how it goes.

194
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,560
Don't start lecturing me.

195
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,600
You were going to travel
but didn't because of Omar.

196
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,960
-I'll go when the time comes.
-You can't give things up for others.

197
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,160
They won't do the same for you.

198
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,920
You know? Take Nadia, for instance.
She chose her future over me.

199
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,520
And I kept pursuing our relationship
like an idiot.

200
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,800
And what about Ari?

201
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,920
What about her?

202
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,240
You're still pissed that Nadia
put her future ahead of being with you,

203
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,600
but Ari wants to be in your life,
and you reject her?

204
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,920
Ari and Nadia are totally different.

205
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,520
Ari wants me, Samuel,

206
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,720
and the entire soccer
and basketball teams.

207
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,440
Okay? Totally different things.

208
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,440
You told me a thousand times

209
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,040
you want the kind of relationship
I have with Omar.

210
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,880
Well, this is how it works.
We compromise. Both of us.

211
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,080
Do you want to lose Ari
because she screwed up? Or Samuel?

212
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,680
I wouldn't want to lose Omar over that.

213
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,080
Go on, talk to her.

214
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,160
Come on.

215
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Thanks, handsome.

216
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,000
What?

217
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,200
Nothing.

218
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,920
Do you have a minute?
I can't talk in there.

219
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,400
I don't want to end the year
with drama, Samuel.

220
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,760
One minute. That's all.

221
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,000
I also imagined
a different start to the year.

222
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,760
With you and stuff.

223
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,520
I never believed someone like you
would love someone like me.

224
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,880
Well, you were obviously wrong.

225
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,160
Was I wrong, Ari?

226
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,520
That stunt you pulled
about not wanting to give up Guzmán or me

227
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,520
seems like a very cowardly way

228
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,760
of not being honest
with the one you don't love.

229
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,800
I know you love Guzmán.

230
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,560
It's no big deal. Admit it.

231
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,120
It seems perfectly logical.
The way it should be.

232
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,640
But please leave me alone.

233
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,560
You're used to having it all in life,
but that's a lie.

234
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,640
You can't have it all.

235
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,640
So stay away from me

236
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,080
and don't tempt me
whenever you feel like it.

237
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,760
Forget about me.

238
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,640
To me, all the damage we've done
and will keep doing isn't worth it.

239
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,080
It's just not. Sorry.

240
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,240
WHERE ARE YOU?

241
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
I WANT TO START THE NEW YEAR WITH YOU.

242
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,040
I HAVE PLANS. I'M SORRY.

243
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,880
I KNOW. I'M HERE, IN YOUR PLANS.

244
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,080
Seven minutes until the New Year!

245
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,160
-Come with me.
-Even on Grindr, people say hi first.

246
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,840
Patrick. Born here, raised in London.
Versatile. More of a bottom.

247
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,480
Coming or not?

248
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,360
I don't know what got into me.
I have no idea what I was thinking.

249
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,400
I'll wait for you by the dock at the lake.
Please come and hear me out.

250
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,480
Are you smiling at me?

251
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,160
Should we end the year right?

252
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,360
Okay, what's wrong? I know you.

253
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,560
I know you were planning to leave. Twice.

254
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,040
And you put it on hold for me twice.

255
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,320
I think about it sometimes,
but it's no big deal.

256
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,880
-Go.
-I don't want to.

257
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,480
Seriously, go.

258
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,160
Omar, I'm happy here with you.

259
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,440
I know. I don't doubt it.

260
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,440
But I'll feel better
if you go on that trip.

261
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,160
I really mean it.

262
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,360
I'll wait for you if you want me to.

263
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,520
Sure, we'll do our own thing.
I'm not my sister, and you're not Guzmán.

264
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,760
Your happiness makes me happy.

265
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,880
Rebeka, I don't know if it's true.

266
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,040
I can't be sure whether
that stuff about Armando is true or not.

267
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,480
Whether what you said is true or not.

268
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,120
I cannot know.

269
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,880
All I know is that Mencía said that
if I do anything to help her,

270
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,400
I'll never see her again.

271
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,160
I told you the truth, Ari.

272
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,000
Son of a bitch.

273
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,400
What's wrong?

274
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,160
Don't touch me.

275
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,920
You invaded my house, my relationship.
What else do you want from me?

276
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,640
To spend New Year's Eve with you.
I told you, Menci.

277
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,520
Don't call me "Menci," you crazy fucker!

278
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,080
Don't call me "crazy fucker," you brat.

279
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,440
-You bitch!
-Rebe! What are you doing?

280
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,200
I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere.
If you need help, I'm there, okay?

281
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,280
Mencía!

282
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,600
Guzmán.

283
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,160
I'd like to start the year off
by giving my friend a hug.

284
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,080
Forgive me. I swear I'm done with Ari.

285
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,920
Well, well, well!
Three minutes until the New Year!

286
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,040
Is that why you were with her earlier?

287
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,600
-Hell no! I was just--
-Stop lying to me, Samuel!

288
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,800
I don't care
if my sister won't talk about it.

289
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,000
-What the hell do you want?
-I'm telling my dad everything.

290
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,880
He'll snap his fingers,
and your life will be over.

291
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,920
Because you're a huge son of a bitch.

292
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,960
You won't be able to ruin my sister's life
or anyone else's

293
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,680
because my family
and I will fuck yours up first.

294
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
-I'm calling my dad.
-What are you doing?

295
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,840
I already told you. Calling my dad.

296
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,720
Give me the phone.

297
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,000
No.

298
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Hello?

299
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,720
Ari? Ari, can you hear me?

300
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,680
Dad!

301
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,760
No… Help!

302
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,000
Elodie, I know
it's probably too late now, but

303
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,320
forgive me.

304
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,440
Leave me alone!

305
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,760
You're a goddamn liar!

306
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,440
Now you have a voice message from me
admitting what I did.

307
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,960
Use it as you see fit.

308
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,600
I love you.

309
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,640
I love you too.

310
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,240
Are you okay?

311
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,120
I'LL BE AT THE DOCK
AFTER THE LAST BELL RINGS.

312
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,360
I don't know what got into me.
I have no idea what I was thinking.

313
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,920
I'll wait for you by the dock at the lake.
Please come and hear me out.

314
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,840
Hey!

315
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,080
Hey!

316
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,360
Ari!

317
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,800
Ari!

318
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Ari!

319
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,280
Ari! No! Ari!

320
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,520
Are you okay? What did he do to you?

321
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,480
Who was that? What did he do to you?

322
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,320
Guzmán, go after him.

323
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,680
Okay.

324
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
You stay here.

325
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,160
Son of a bitch!

326
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,000
Hey!

327
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Have you seen Ari?

328
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,280
What happened?

329
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,680
You haven't seen her?

330
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,560
Damn…

331
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,280
That sick bastard was blackmailing Mencía
so he could abuse her.

332
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,960
Ari knew because I told her.

333
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,800
-Shit!
-It's over.

334
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,120
She was so wasted earlier
that I bet she went after him.

335
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,760
That's why he was hitting her.

336
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,680
He's a son of a bitch, Guzmán.
A son of a bitch.

337
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,120
Call the cops. We'll tell them.

338
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,160
We'll call the police now,
but we're not telling them everything.

339
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,120
We'll tell them Ari is missing
and that we don't know where she is.

340
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,160
Period.

341
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,760
And I won't confess?

342
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,560
Guzmán, I need you to tell me
what you saw tonight.

343
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,360
The girl is alive.

344
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,240
I repeat, the girl is alive.

345
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,280
If you go to jail, your life is over.
Even when you get out.

346
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,160
Just look at my brother.

347
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,920
Your brother was innocent.

348
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,240
So are you.

349
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,240
Until proven otherwise. Got it?

350
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,840
He knocked me down and ran away.

351
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,880
I couldn't do anything.

352
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,120
Why didn't you want to see me?

354
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,040
I couldn't look you in the eye
after all I've done to you.

355
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,040
I don't know what happened to me, Guzmán.

356
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,840
I've never been confused
about my feelings.

357
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,360
I know you'll always be there for me,
and I want to be there for you.

358
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,600
You love Samuel.

359
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,160
No, that's not true.

360
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,720
-I understand.
-No.

361
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,920
I read the text you sent him.

362
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,360
And I went looking for you.

363
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,720
I wanted you to tell me to my face.

364
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,120
But it's okay.

365
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,360
Forgive me for all the bad times.

366
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,880
I hope the good times outnumbered them.

367
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,560
Take care of yourself, Ari.

368
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,080
That's it?

369
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,360
Goodbye.

370
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,280
Waiter…

371
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,680
I should have hit you harder, you jerk.

372
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,800
Take care, Samu.
You would've made a great brother-in-law.

373
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,320
Rebe…

374
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,120
Thanks for everything.

375
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Don't say anything to Cayetana or Omar.

376
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,320
Of course not. I swear.

377
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,040
I love you.

378
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,440
I love you more.

379
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,440
Well…

380
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,600
the same?

381
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,760
Okay.

382
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,640
Well, guys…

383
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,880
thanks for everything.

384
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,880
Yeah?

385
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,960
Any news about Armando?

386
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,960
Not at all.

387
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,000
It's like he disappeared
off the face of the earth.

388
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,400
Well, maybe it's for the best.

389
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,400
Are you upset about that?

390
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,680
I'm scared he'll show up all of a sudden.

391
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,920
I'm going to tell Dad everything.

392
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,360
Enough is enough.

393
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,440
It was my fault Mom died.
It was my fault Patrick almost died.

394
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,520
And it was my fault you almost died.

395
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,720
Don't be ridiculous, Mencía.

396
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,280
You're not to blame for anything.

397
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,520
Okay?

398
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,760
Ari… I will always think that.

399
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,400
Come here.

400
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,680
Could you be there with me
when I tell Dad?

401
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,520
I'll be right by your side.

402
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,040
