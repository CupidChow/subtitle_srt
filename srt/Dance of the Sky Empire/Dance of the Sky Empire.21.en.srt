Dance of the Sky Empire

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,860
Episode 21

4
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,380
Stop.

5
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,720
Your Highness,

6
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,340
the gate of the city has been heavily guarded.

7
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,340
If we wanna go out,

8
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,110
what we can do is break through.

9
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,750
Youlian is injured.

10
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,150
We can't break through.

11
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,420
Prince Mu,

12
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,220
you've helped me a lot.

13
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,380
This time,

14
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,280
I can't encumber you anymore.

15
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,580
Youlian,

16
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,590
you're injured.

17
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,340
All that you should do is mind yourself.

18
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,540
I'll take care of the rest.

19
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,820
Turn round.

20
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,900
Yes.

21
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,540
Turn round.

22
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,100
How is Li Xuan?

23
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,260
He won't die.

24
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,540
But

25
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,820
he was badly upset,

26
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,500
I'm afraid...

27
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,900
Su Youlian,

28
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,220
she was so merciless that she hurt Li Xuan to this extent.

29
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,580
Don't let me catch her.

30
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,540
Otherwise,

31
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,940
wait and see how I will deal with her.

32
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,620
Have you looked into it clearly?

33
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,750
I don't think Youlian is such a person.

34
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,220
You're defending her, aren't you?

35
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,480
She's not anyone else.

36
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,620
She is the saintess of the Clan of Kunwu.

37
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,780
Because of trusting her,

38
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,040
Li Xuan has suffered all of these things.

39
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,180
How do you feel?

40
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,820
Much better.

41
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,060
Thank you, Prince Mu.

42
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,590
You don't have to

43
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,140
thank me.

44
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,940
Prince Mu.

45
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,480
What are you doing?

46
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,580
Prince Mu,

47
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,140
the first time I've met you,

48
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,420
you helped me fix my damaged carriage.

49
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,500
So this time,

50
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,030
I wanna ask you to help me one more time.

51
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,140
The broken Saintess Stone

52
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,510
is the hope of our entire Clan of Kunwu.

53
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,159
You should stand up first.

54
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,510
Prince Mu, you don't intend to help me, do you?

55
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,460
Of course not.

56
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,180
Why

57
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
the Saintess Stone is able to awake the Dragon Emperor

58
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,860
is that it has strong spiritual power.

59
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,420
Now it's broken

60
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,180
and the spiritual power has died out.

61
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,420
Even if I repair it,

62
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,020
it will be merely an ordinary stone.

63
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,820
I've finally ruined the hope

64
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,500
of our Clan of Kunwu.

65
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,580
I let them down.

66
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,660
Actually,

67
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,600
if you do wanna awake the Dragon Emperor,

68
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,300
there's a way.

69
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,660
You have a way?

70
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,040
Your Highness.

71
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,980
You're...

72
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,620
Prince Mu,

73
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,700
what's the way?

74
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,680
Go back to the State of Sha with me.

75
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,200
Go back to the State of Sha?

76
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,220
If I go back to the State of Sha, will I be able to awake the Dragon Emperor?

77
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:38,980
Trust me.

78
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,320
Your Highness,

79
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,440
is there anything strange with the belt?

80
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,780
Ten years ago,

81
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,300
Princess Qingsheng of the Clan of Kunwu intermarried with a human being

82
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,780
and they had a son.

83
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,430
Have you heard about it?

84
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,860
Yeah.

85
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,580
It's said that the hybrid has the strong power

86
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,100
to even destroy the world.

87
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,780
But I also heard

88
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,180
that hybrid was killed by Lord Zi later.

89
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,060
He has the blood of the imperial family of the Clan of Kunwu in his vein

90
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,780
that can suppress the Dragon Emperor.

91
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,910
Wouldn't it be a pity

92
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,540
that he was killed?

93
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,980
What do you mean, Your Highness?

94
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,380
Nothing.

95
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,220
Put away the belt.

96
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,540
Maybe

97
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,620
it will be useful.

98
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,380
Stop.

99
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,600
How is your ability of self-healing?

100
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,320
Why you were able to

101
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,900
leave the Bloody Icebound Ward at that time

102
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,780
was that Li Xuan exchanged his ability of self-healing

103
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,580
with Elder of the Book of Heaven.

104
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,020
Why would have you done this?

105
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,600
Your Highness,

106
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,180
we haven't got any news of Princess.

107
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,340
Send someone to keep finding her.

108
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,300
Yes.

109
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,340
Your Highness,

110
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,420
as for what Miss Su asked,

111
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,300
have you made your decision?

112
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,220
If you decide to help her,

113
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,620
you'll have to marry her.

114
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,660
What if Miss Su is not willing to marry you?

115
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,360
Even if she isn't willing to marry me,

116
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,380
I'll help her anyway.

117
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,910
Now that I've promised her,

118
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,700
I won't go back on my word.

119
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,500
But if you help her,

120
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,000
you won't be able to live for long.

121
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,260
Over these years,

122
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,420
the State of Sha has been living on the State of Tianqi.

123
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,420
Our people have been living in the abyss of suffering.

124
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,660
As long as Youlian is able to awake the Dragon Emperor,

125
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,620
the State of Tianqi will be in danger.

126
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,860
Then our State of Sha can have a new start.

127
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,480
Your Highness,

128
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,540
you don't have to put your life in danger.

129
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,750
I've made up my mind.

130
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,820
You don't have to persuade me.

131
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,660
But who Miss Su values is Li Xuan.

132
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,510
She's never had a thing for you.

133
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,710
I think it's not worthwhile for you to do this for her.

134
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,750
Facing the general situation,

135
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,230
how could I be immersed in love?

136
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,030
Something is wrong.

137
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,390
Something is wrong.

138
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,750
Something is wrong.

139
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,150
There're so many soldiers coming to the Academy in a sudden.

140
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,100
What's going on?

141
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,140
Report to you, Your Highness.

142
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,140
I take the order of His Majesty

143
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,780
to catch the important criminal, Li Xuan.

144
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,260
What?

145
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,190
How dare you?

146
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,420
Do you wanna catch him in front of His Highness?

147
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,260
I can't disobey the order of His Majesty.

148
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,980
You...

149
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,660
Bring Li Xuan out.

150
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,700
Lord Zi.

151
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,820
Bring Li Xuan out.

152
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,860
Lord Zi.

153
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,540
Li Xuan is badly injured.

154
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,310
If His Majesty calls in him, I'm afraid...

155
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,550
As the Nation-protecting Master,

156
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,380
he not only hasn't taken the responsibility for protecting the Clan of Human Being

157
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,660
but let the siren of the Clan of Kunwu go into the mysterious land,

158
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,300
which caused the death of the people in the Academy.

159
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,420
So,

160
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,720
no matter what will happen in the end,

161
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,100
he should be made accountable.

162
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,900
Lord Zi,

163
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,260
please think over it.

164
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,780
He's your disciple.

165
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,020
Lord Zi.

166
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
I'll go with them.

167
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,100
Bring Li Xuan who's guilty here.

168
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,060
Xuan.

169
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,980
As the Nation-protecting Master of Tianqi,

170
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,660
you betrayed our Clan of Human Being

171
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,460
because of the siren of the Clan of Kunwu,

172
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,300
which ruined the Moyun Ancient Academy of hundreds of years

173
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,460
and led to the death

174
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,900
of the innocent disciples of Moyun Academy

175
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,360
and the people in the city.

176
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,300
Li Xuan,

177
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,320
what do you think you deserve?

178
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,700
Father, please don't get angry.

179
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,620
That crafty siren of Kunwu is too crafty.

180
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,300
She disguised herself as a human being and sneaked into the Academy.

181
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,180
All of us were cheated by her.

182
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,280
But Li Xuan hasn't betrayed the Clan of Human Being.

183
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,700
Second Brother,

184
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,940
the thing has been where it is now.

185
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
Why are you still defending Li Xuan?

186
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,220
Are you

187
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,260
his partner?

188
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,180
Do you betray our Clan of Human Being either?

189
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,180
You...

190
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,540
Your Majesty,

191
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,700
it's all my fault that I fail to discipline Li Xuan at ordinary times,

192
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,820
which has developed his arrogant and wilful character.

193
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,620
Your Majesty,

194
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,880
he's always supremely badly behaved

195
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,180
but he values love and duty.

196
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,900
He wouldn't have betrayed the Clan of Human Being

197
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,980
and done harm to his fellow disciples

198
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,810
for a woman.

199
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,540
Please investigate it clearly, Your Majesty.

200
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,260
Enough.

201
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,900
Your Majesty.

202
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,220
Li Xuan

203
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,500
won't be absolved.

204
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,180
If someone intercedes for him,

205
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,390
he'll be penalized the same as him.

206
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,089
Father.

207
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,540
Father,

208
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,060
in my opinion,

209
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,180
we've got the incontrovertible evidence of guilt that Li Xuan colluded with the siren of Kunwu,

210
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,860
so we don't have to continue the interrogation.

211
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,940
Why not give the order to kill him directly

212
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,460
to comfort the souls of the victims?

213
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,820
Your Majesty, please punish Li Xuan severely

214
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,660
to comfort the souls of the victims.

215
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,860
To comfort the souls of the victims

216
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,580
Guards.

217
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,260
Yes.

218
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,140
Father.

219
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,540
Wei'er,

220
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,760
do you forget what I said just now?

221
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,140
No, I don't.

222
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,150
Whoever intercedes for him

223
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,420
will be penalized the same as him.

224
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,550
Why are you still interceding for him?

225
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,540
Father,

226
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,780
since I came to the Academy,

227
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,780
I've been with him every day.

228
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,260
I know clearly who he is.

229
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,140
It's impossible for him to collide with the Clan of Kunwu

230
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,340
and betray the Clan of Human Being.

231
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,220
I hope father could discover the minutest detail in everything.

232
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,820
What an impressive act!

233
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,340
Second Brother,

234
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,990
it's a pity that you're not a woman.

235
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,460
If you were a woman,

236
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,740
I would suspect whether

237
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,270
you have a thing for Li Xuan.

238
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,400
The thing has been where it is now.

239
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,180
Why are you still defending Li Xuan?

240
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,500
Those with discerning eyes can know clearly

241
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,460
that Li Xuan was exploited

242
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,190
by the siren of the Clan of Kunwu

243
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,340
while Crown Prince is pressing on at every stage

244
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,070
to kill him as soon as possible.

245
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,220
I wanna ask you

246
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,420
whether you have your own intentions.

247
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,620
You're framing me up.

248
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,400
What intentions could I have?

249
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,020
Everyone knows you have a feud with Li Xuan.

250
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,180
And you were beaten by him for several times.

251
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,820
I'm afraid you've had a grudge against him for long.

252
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,280
You're talking nonsense.

253
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,220
Father,

254
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,820
please don't believe the one-sided statement of Loong Wei'er.

255
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,980
He...he must be a partner of Li Xuan.

256
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,620
And he's already been disloyal.

257
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,620
You're the one who has been disloyal.

258
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,620
Shut up.

259
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,060
Guards.

260
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,620
Take Li Xuan away.

261
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,120
Choose an auspicious day to decapitate him.

262
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,620
Wait a sec.

263
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,980
Li Shude,

264
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,420
what are you gonna do?

265
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,860
Your Majesty,

266
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,080
there's an old saying that

267
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,020
failing in disciplining a son is the fault of a father.

268
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,180
Now, Li Xuan has made such a towering crime

269
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,380
that cost the lives of innocent people.

270
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,460
I'm the father of Li Xuan.

271
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,820
I should fulfil the compelling obligation.

272
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,180
But Your Majesty,

273
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,100
for the sake that I've been fought for the State of Tianqi

274
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,260
and I'm loyal to you in my lifetime,

275
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,700
I beg you

276
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,820
not to kill Li Xuan

277
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,500
and to leave the last inheritor for the Li Family.

278
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,020
Your Majesty,

279
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,380
I'm willing to die to show my appreciation.

280
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,340
Li Shude, you're...

281
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,980
Your Excellency Li. Your Excellency Li. Your Excellency Li.

282
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,640
Don't do it.

283
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,540
It's...It's...

284
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,700
It's...

285
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,500
Your Excellency Li. –He's...

286
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,460
Father.

287
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,860
Father.

288
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,940
Father.

289
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,660
Xuan,

290
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,830
actually, your mother,

291
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,500
your mother

292
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,540
is the best woman.

293
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,740
It's I who owe a debt of gratitude to her.

294
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,260
It's my fault.

295
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,260
Father.

296
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,540
You don't hate me, do you?

297
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,700
It's...

298
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,660
Why?

299
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,980
Why would it happen?

300
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,700
He's gonna rebel. He's gonna rebel. Guards, come to protect His Majesty.

301
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,420
Catch him.

302
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,620
He's gonna rebel.

303
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,140
Your Majesty, I'm late.

304
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,180
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

305
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,940
Lord Zi, finally, you're here.

306
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,260
Have a look at the Nation-protecting Master you recommended to me.

307
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,700
I'm here for him.

308
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,700
Your Majesty,

309
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,900
you can't kill

310
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,660
the Nation-protecting Master.

311
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,100
Why can't I?

312
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,500
If it hadn't been because of him,

313
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,560
the city wouldn't have been in chaos.

314
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,980
I didn't notice the siren of the Clan of Kunwu had sneaked into the Academy,

315
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,540
I should take the responsibility.

316
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,540
If Your Majesty wants to punish someone,

317
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,220
I'm willing to incur the penalty for Li Xuan.

318
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,140
Now the city is in chaos.

319
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,340
If there's a rumor that Li Xuan has betrayed the Clan of Human Being,

320
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,700
it'll make the people more anxious,

321
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,860
which might finally lead to a huge turbulence.

322
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,020
Then

323
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,580
then in your opinion,

324
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,510
I have to let him go, don't I?

325
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,900
In my opinion,

326
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,100
Li Xuan did make a huge mistake,

327
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,420
but General Li

328
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,220
has atoned for the crime of his son  with his life.

329
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,100
Now,

330
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,420
the Clan of Kunwu is about to pick up a fight against us,

331
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,660
the imperial court is in an urgent need of talents.

332
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,900
Why not put Li Xuan in prison

333
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,360
to reflect on himself?

334
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:39,080
Then he might be able to make contributions to the state to atone for his crime later.

335
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,260
That's it?

336
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,060
Wouldn't it be too kind to him?

337
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,980
Your Highness, what about going on an expedition with me

338
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,980
to fight again the Clan of Kunwu?

339
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,740
I...

340
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,900
Enough.

341
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,540
Now that

342
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,020
Lord Zi has given his advice.

343
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,740
Guards.

344
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,620
Yes.

345
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,180
Put Li Xuan in prison.

346
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,340
Yes.

347
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,540
Li Xuan.

348
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,180
Childe Li.

349
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,540
Nation-protecting Master.

350
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,300
What's wrong with you?

351
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,740
Do you go deaf or become a fool?

352
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,540
Okay. Okay. Okay.

353
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,660
We won't be able to provoke him.

354
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,420
Don't do it.

355
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,840
What are you scared of?

356
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,020
He's nobody now.

357
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,700
He used to bully people

358
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,100
in the name of the Nation-protecting Master.

359
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,340
But now,

360
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,820
he's merely a prisoner.

361
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,780
What else could he do to us?

362
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,910
I'm not scared of you at all.

363
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,300
I...

364
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,580
Who is it?

365
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,660
I'm bowing to you, Your Highness.

366
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,520
I'm bowing to you, Your Highness.

367
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,540
Open the gate.

368
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,740
Yes.

369
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,700
Li Xuan,

370
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,070
I'll persuade father to release you in a few days.

371
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,750
You should stay here with ease these days.

372
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,380
Besides,

373
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,020
I'll take care of the funeral of General Li

374
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,380
in person for you.

375
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,540
You don't have to worry about it.

376
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,820
Look,

377
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,510
take care of him carefully.

378
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,020
If I find you bully him,

379
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,420
I won't let you go so easily.

380
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,220
Yes. Yes. Yes.

381
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,060
I'll take good care of him.

382
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,500
Your Highness II, please go back.

383
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,060
His Majesty doesn't wanna meet you.

384
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,460
Your Highness II, don't...

385
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,420
Eunuch,

386
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,820
we're in the face of the strong enemy.

387
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,700
I have something important to report to father.

388
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,340
Please pass on message for me again.

389
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,540
It's...

390
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,740
Okay.

391
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,420
I'll do it for you again.

392
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,900
If His Majesty still refuses to meet you,

393
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,700
please don't hassle me anymore.

394
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,100
Thank you, Eunuch.

395
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,000
He hasn't left yet, has he?

396
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,420
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

397
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,980
Your Majesty,

398
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,060
His Highness II said he had something important to report to you.

399
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,540
I think

400
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,140
he's really urgent.

401
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,100
You pass on the message for him so activity.

402
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,420
Has he given you any rewards?

403
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,470
You're wise, Your Majesty.

404
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,260
His Highness II did give me a great thing.

405
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,870
Please have a look at it, Your Majesty.

406
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,620
You're bribed by

407
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,540
such a little thing.

408
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,660
Do you wanna meet him, Your Majesty?

409
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,380
Let him in.

410
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

411
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,180
Your Highness II,

412
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,380
hurry and come in please.

413
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,510
His Majesty is waiting for you inside.

414
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,000
Thank you so much, Eunuch.

415
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,300
I am not able to make Li Xuan die this time.

416
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,820
It's all the fault of Zi Ji.

417
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,940
He became entangled in it.

418
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,900
Li Xuan has made such a big mistake.

419
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,620
Even though he's still alive, he's useless.

420
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,020
We don't have to be scared of him.

421
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,700
Next,

422
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,220
you'll have to suppress the Second Prince

423
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,900
and not let him win the trust of His Majesty again,

424
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,100
which will be enough.

425
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,380
I've tried so hard to beat him.

426
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,020
Why would I let him be strong easily?

427
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,420
Right?

428
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,260
Report.

429
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,380
What's up?

430
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,660
I'm reporting to you, Your Highness.

431
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,460
His Majesty

432
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,260
called in the Second Prince just now.

433
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,100
What?

434
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,980
Are you sure?

435
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,020
Yeah.

436
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,460
I witnessed it by myself.

437
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,580
The Second Prince went to the imperial study.

438
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,180
Is father in his dotage?

439
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,320
How could he call in Loong Wei'er?

440
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,460
Your Highness, you have to be cautious about your word.

441
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,500
Someone might be listening in the corners of the wall.

442
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,860
Where is it?

443
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,820
Why should I be cautious?

444
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,140
You'd better figure out something to help me

445
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,580
deal with Loong Wei'er

446
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,380
instead of reminding me to be cautious over and over.

447
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,510
What idiots you are!

448
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,540
He has more talented subordinates than I have.

449
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,820
I get it.

450
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,660
The reason that he wanted to go the Academy so much

451
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,260
is because he wants to woo and buy over talents.

452
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,660
Then,

453
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,780
Your Highness,

454
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,380
why not send out invitations

455
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,540
to attract the talents all over the world

456
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,580
to work for you?

457
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,560
You'll have to take care of it.

458
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,260
No matter how much it will cost,

459
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,180
you have to find

460
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,710
the best talents for me.

461
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,580
Yes.

462
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,380
Hurry up.

463
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,580
I'll go do it for you.

464
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,380
Hurry up.

465
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,920
I'm kneeling down to you, Father.

466
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,260
I'm here to report something important to you.

467
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,620
I failed to notice that

468
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,900
the siren of the Clan of Kunwu had sneaked into the Academy,

469
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,230
which is my negligence.

470
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,980
But the mistake is made

471
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,780
and now the Clan of Kunwu is coming to look for trouble.

472
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,340
If you don't take action,

473
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,180
it'll be harder for us to control the situation.

474
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,260
Are you here to tell me this?

475
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,660
What I wanna say is that

476
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,820
I'm willing to lead someone to catch Su Youlian

477
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,060
to atone for my crime.

478
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,540
Can you make it?

479
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,140
I know that Su Youlian has strong supernatural power.

480
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,860
If I pick up a toe-to-toe fight again her,

481
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,580
I won't be able to beat her.

482
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,420
But if you allow me to catch her

483
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,940
with someone else,

484
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,910
I promise I will definitely catch Su Youlian.

485
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,380
Who do you want?

486
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,020
Li Xuan.

487
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,900
His Majesty has promised to release Li Xuan, hasn't he?

488
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,140
How is the funeral thing of General Li going?

489
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,500
Don't worry, Your Highness.

490
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,420
The corpse of General Li was put in a coffin yesterday.

491
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,540
The mourning hall was prepared well at night.

492
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,260
As long as Li Xuan worships him after he's released from prison,

493
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,900
General Li can be laid to rest.

494
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,820
Well done.

495
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:44,980
Well,

496
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,900
have you heard any news of Su Youlian recently?

497
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,380
I made an inspection tour of

498
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,710
each gate this morning,

499
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,220
I haven’t heard that Su Youlian went out of the city.

500
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,140
I think she's hiding somewhere in the city.

501
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,060
As long as she's still in the city, it'll be easier for us to find her.

502
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,780
I'm worrying about that

503
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,260
if Li Xuan isn't  willing to help you catch Su Youlian,

504
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,520
what should we do then?

505
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,110
Will you easily let the foe

506
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,389
who causes the death of your father go?

507
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,679
But the foe is also the beloved of Li Xuan.

508
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,580
What if he is in a moment of weakness

509
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,179
and doesn't want to kill her?

510
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,020
Then half of my plan would be successful.

511
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,280
Your Highness.

512
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,340
Open the gate.

513
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,300
Yes.

514
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,860
You can leave now.

515
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:56,900
Yes.

516
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
Father has promised to release you.

517
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,420
Go with me.

518
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,260
Li Xuan,

519
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,630
His Highness is talking to you.

520
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,500
Bainian,

521
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,380
you can also leave.

522
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,060
Li Xuan,

523
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,180
go with me.

524
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,820
I know you're sad,

525
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,740
but you could do nothing hiding here,

526
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,500
which will change neither the fact that Su Youlian took advantage of you

527
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,140
nor

528
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,260
General Li died due to it.

529
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,300
Li Xuan,

530
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,020
there isn't much time left for us.

531
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,900
The city is in chaos

532
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,740
and plenty of innocent people are being slaughtered by Su Youlian.

533
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,700
Do you wanna stay in the cell

534
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,780
being a douchebag for a lifetime?

535
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,540
Shouldn't you do anything for those innocent people as well as you father

536
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,340
to make up for your fault?

537
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,220
This is the favourite painting of the master.

538
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,950
Young Master, you can burn it to master in person.

539
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,540
Allow me.

540
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,310
The lady is so gorgeous.

541
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,500
Who's she?

542
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,120
The painting isn't one

543
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,140
that master

544
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,100
usually appreciates

545
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,340
Maybe it's mixed in

546
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,740
when the servant brought the paintings here.

547
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,420
Shunzi,

548
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,480
where do you get the painting?

549
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,740
I'm reporting to you, Steward Li.

550
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,580
I took it from the study of master.

551
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,640
I didn't notice I had brought it here.

552
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,400
Is Steward Li in there?

553
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,700
I'm the steward of the Cui Family.

554
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,900
Please come out.

555
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,340
Steward Li,

556
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,700
it's what our madam asked us to send here.

557
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,620
Please have a check

558
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,060
whether there's something missing.

559
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,580
What do

560
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,780
these things mean?

561
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,800
These betrothal presents

562
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,680
were sent by our master in person.

563
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,140
Our madam said

564
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,740
the engagement to Childe Li

565
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,180
didn't count anymore.

566
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,060
There's no relationship between

567
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,820
the Cui Family and the Li Family from now on.

568
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,260
So these things...

569
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,660
You...

570
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,660
It's fine.

571
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,820
I haven't expected the Cui Family would do this to us.

572
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,980
It's your family who begged to make an engagement

573
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,540
to our childe at the beginning.

574
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,340
Now our master has just died,

575
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,860
you're coming to...

576
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,380
Get out. Get out. Get out.

577
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,380
Goodbye.

578
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,380
Li Xuan,

579
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,260
you can observe mourning for you father at home.

580
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,990
I'll come to you some other day.

581
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,860
I won't bother you today.

582
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,540
Goodbye.

583
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,180
When will we take action?

584
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,260
What?

585
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,380
To catch the people of Kunwu.

586
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,680
The deployment has been going on.

587
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,180
You wake up.

588
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,700
How about you? Do you feel better?

589
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,660
It's great.

590
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,140
What's in your hand?

591
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,460
I've seen you holding it these days.

592
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,180
Your Highness.

593
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,180
What's up?

594
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,220
It's okay. Spill it out.

595
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,980
The city is in chaos.

596
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,300
They wanna catch Miss Su everywhere.

597
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,220
I've heard that

598
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,580
the disciples of the Moyun Ancient Academy

599
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,340
were killed by the people of Kunwu.

600
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,260
Besides,

601
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,780
they have been slaughtering in the city.

602
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,220
It's impossible.

603
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,060
The Dragon Emperor was sealed in the Moon-fall Formation.

604
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,720
As I'm the Saintess, they're not able to seal me.

605
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,620
But the spiritual power of the people of Kunwu

606
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,860
has been sealed.

607
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,300
That's why they're suppressed by human beings everywhere.

608
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,220
Now, among the people of Kunwu,

609
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,620
no one is strong enough to do these evil things in the Moyun Ancient Academy.

610
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,740
Does anyone wanna

611
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,780
make the Clan of Kunwu a scapescgoat?
