Episode 28

4
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,780
Lord Zi.

5
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,460
Lord Zi.

6
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,500
Lord Zi.

7
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,200
Youlian,

8
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,680
go awake the Dragon Emperor.

9
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,960
Li Xuan, you...

10
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,560
Hurry up.

11
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,640
Otherwise, we might die in vain.

12
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,120
Su Youlian, stop.

13
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,480
Stop.

14
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,520
It's great.

15
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,520
Come on, open your mouth.

16
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,140
I'll check your teeth.

17
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,480
It's great.

18
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,880
Do you feel painful?

19
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,440
Not anymore.

20
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,760
Good boy.

21
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,160
Come here.

22
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,600
Look.

23
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,640
Look. Look.

24
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,520
Look.

25
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,280
It's great.

26
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,560
Look. It's the Dragon Emperor.

27
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,720
The seal on the Dragon Emperor has been broken.

28
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,120
Our people of the Clan of Kunwu can be saved.

29
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,120
We're welcoming you, Your Majesty.

30
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,290
Your Majesty, please don't kill them.

31
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Let's go.

32
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,280
Youlian.

33
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,440
Youlian.

34
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,440
Youlian.

35
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,200
Master.

36
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,480
You brat.

37
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,240
I thought...

38
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,680
I thought you wouldn't take care of me anymore.

39
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,200
Stop talking.

40
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,720
I'm about to heal you.

41
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,720
You brat.

42
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,760
At that time,

43
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,320
I did something wrong.

44
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,640
Could you forgive me?

45
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,600
At that time,

46
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,960
I thought I was

47
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,400
powerful enough

48
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,920
to seal the Dragon Emperor

49
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,960
with the blood of your mother.

50
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,420
But I wouldn't have expected that

51
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,360
the power of the Dragon Emperor was so formidable.

52
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
In the end, an accident happened.

53
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Don't waste your strength anymore.

54
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,760
It won't work.

55
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,880
Child,

56
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,080
could you forgive me?

57
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,400
It's fine. It's fine.

58
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,640
How could one forgive the person who killed his mother?

59
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,000
In the future,

60
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,960
I won't be able to stand by your side.

61
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,760
You have to...

62
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,320
You have to

63
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,040
take good care of yourself.

64
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,280
I'll never forgive you.

65
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,160
Master.

66
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,600
Your Majesty, eat something.

67
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,400
Your Majesty.

68
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,360
I've been ruling the state for decades.

69
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,080
I didn't expect I would end up like this.

70
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,720
Your Majesty,

71
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,980
please have something, more or less.

72
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,040
It won't be good for you to suffer from starvation.

73
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,520
Your Majesty, listen.

74
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,640
Is there anything happening outside?

75
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,200
It's His Highness II who is coming to save us, isn't it?

76
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,400
How could Wei'er come to save me?

77
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,000
I treated him badly in the first place.

78
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,240
Father,

79
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,400
please forgive me for coming to save you so late.

80
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,200
Wei'er.

81
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,920
It's my son, Wei'er.

82
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,840
Wei'er.

83
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,800
Wei'er.

84
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,960
Are you coming to save me?

85
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,640
Certainly.

86
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,280
Hurry and open the door. Release me.

87
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,400
Wei'er.

88
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,480
Father, I can release you.

89
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,560
But you have to promise me one thing.

90
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,120
What's it? Spit it out.

91
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,120
As long as I can achieve it,

92
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,720
I'll promise you anyway.

93
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,370
Allow me to succeed to your throne.

94
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,000
From now on, the State of Tianqi will be ruled by me.

95
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,120
And you'll be the retired emperor.

96
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,940
You'll be taken good care of and enjoy your old age in peace.

97
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,560
I promise you.

98
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,440
The crown prince is a jerk. He deserves a death.

99
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,480
You're supposed to succeed to the throne.

100
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,160
As long as you release me,

101
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,480
I'm willing to be a retired emperor,

102
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,480
which is great for me.

103
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,360
Thank you, Father.

104
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,320
Who are you?

105
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,880
Father, you can't recognize me, can you?

106
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,320
Wei'er?

107
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,320
How could it be?

108
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,080
How could you be a woman?

109
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,680
Have a good look at me.

110
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,840
What on earth am I, a man or woman?

111
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,040
Your...

112
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,680
Your Highness II,

113
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,760
you're actually a woman.

114
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,320
It's...

115
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
It's impossible.

116
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
It's impossible.

117
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,440
You're my son.

118
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,960
Well,

119
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,360
you've deceived the emperor and ignored everyone else.

120
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,420
You're rebelling.

121
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,480
Father, you must wanna ask me

122
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,920
how I'm able to hide the truth from everyone over the years.

123
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,349
Take them away.

124
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,200
Hurry and take them away.

125
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,060
Take them away.

126
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,280
Take them away.

127
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,119
What?

128
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,680
Father, are you frightened?

129
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,560
It's the poisonous stuff

130
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,600
that made me become a man.

131
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,720
Over the years,

132
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,240
I've been suffering from toxic baths countlessly.

133
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,920
Over and over,

134
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I felt a pain that made me want to die.

135
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,920
Do you get it?

136
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,080
I told myself,

137
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,280
one day,

138
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,960
I would finally let my father know

139
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,920
how ridiculous he was

140
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,780
to do such a stupid and cruel thing

141
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,120
merely because of an absurd prediction

142
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,120
in those day.

143
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,200
You're all my own flesh and blood.

144
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,560
How could I hurt you?

145
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,720
I did it because of the prosperity of the state.

146
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,000
Father, tell me now

147
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,800
whether a princess has saved the state or destroyed it.

148
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,690
You've saved the state.

149
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,530
You've saved the state.

150
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,240
Wei'er.

151
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,120
I'm

152
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,520
sorry.

153
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,680
Please forgive me.

155
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,200
I've been waiting for this day for eighteen years.

156
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,840
From now on,

157
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,480
I'm the master of my own future.

158
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,600
I finally let my father

159
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,600
feel the same pain I suffered.

160
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,120
But

161
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,520
why I do not feel happy

162
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,080
after I've accomplished my wish?

163
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,920
Mother, I'm hurt. Mother.

164
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,400
Mother.

165
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,160
Yunshan.

166
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,960
I'm sorry.

167
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,360
I didn't take good care of you

168
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,320
and I hurt you instead.

169
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,360
I'll come to company you.

170
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,920
I won't let you die alone.

171
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,480
Why are you lying next to me?

172
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,040
Yunshan,

173
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,410
how could you come back to life?

174
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,160
You didn't die, did you?

175
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,600
What are you talking about?

176
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yunshan, it's great. You're alive.

177
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,200
I...

178
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,360
I took some

179
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,640
poison just now.

180
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,640
What...

181
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,840
what's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?

182
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,520
I took some poison.

183
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,280
That poison

184
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,040
will work in an hour. There's an hour left.

185
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,200
What do you mean an hour?

186
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
That poison will work...

187
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,360
...in an hour.

188
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,920
What should I do? What should I do?

189
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
You...you should throw a punch at me.

190
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,680
Throw a punch at me.

191
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,200
Help beat it out of me. Beat it out of me.

192
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,040
Throw a punch at my belly.

193
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,200
Beat the poison out of me.

194
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,840
I'll be fine, if you beat it out of me.

195
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,320
Throw a punch at my belly. Hurry and throw a punch at my belly

196
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,280
Throw a punch at my belly.

197
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,160
I shall beat the poison out of you?

198
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,840
Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.

199
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,000
Beat the poison out of me.

200
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,930
Come on. Beat me.

201
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,600
Hurry and beat me. Come on.

202
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,920
God blesses you, Your Majesty.

203
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,200
God blesses our Clan of Kunwu.

204
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,360
It's so lucky. Your Majesty has been sleeping for ten years,

205
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,610
but your spiritual power is as strong as it used to be.

206
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,680
It's awesome.

207
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,080
God blesses you, Your Majesty. God blesses our Clan of Kunwu.

208
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,730
Now that Your Majesty has woken up,

209
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,540
it's time to take our revenge.

210
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,200
Exactly.

211
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,320
Our people of Kunwu have been biding our time for ten years

212
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,520
and we've been surviving for ten years.

213
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,530
It's the perfect time to pull ourselves together

214
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,530
to take revenge on the Clan of Human Being.

215
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,370
Exactly.

216
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,720
Your Majesty, I'm about to organize a crack troop.

217
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,960
Then we can ruin the State of Tianqi

218
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,280
and kill all of human beings.

219
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,140
Your Majesty, we'll obey your order. Your Majesty.

220
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,580
Call all the people of our clan together.

221
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,970
And we'll return to the place of Kunwu.

222
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
Your Majesty,

223
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,080
you mean we're going back, aren't we?

224
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,700
We won't take our revenge on the Clan of Human Being?

225
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,480
You are right.

226
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,560
But among all the people of our Clan of Kunwu,

227
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,960
who can swallow

228
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,840
the disgrace of the past ten years?

229
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,920
Yep.

230
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,920
My hatred of the Clan of Human Being

231
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,520
is as profound as yours.

232
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,320
But if we take revenge on them

233
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,120
and kill human beings,

234
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,640
they will come to take their revenge on us,

235
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,840
as long as there's one human being left.

236
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
The chaos would be endless.

237
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,040
Our people of Kunwu will never live a peaceful life.

238
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,800
Now,

239
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,400
there are thousands of things waiting to be done for our Clan of Kunwu,

240
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,320
and our people are living in destitution.

241
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,050
Revitalizing our Clan of Kunwu

242
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,680
is our priority.

243
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,370
Exactly.

244
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,760
His Majesty is right.

245
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,880
We'll obey what you said, Your Majesty.

246
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
From now on,

247
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,080
there shouldn't be any contact

248
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,240
between our Clan of Kunwu and the one of Human Being.

249
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,200
Yes.

250
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,960
It's so great that

251
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,120
His Majesty could put down the hatred

252
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,980
and doesn't take revenge on the Clan of Human Being.

253
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,080
You hate to see the battle between the Clan of Human Being and our Clan of Kunwu, don't you?

254
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,400
Only a fool would like to witness a war and calamity.

255
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,600
The peaceful coexistence is great, isn't it?

256
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,880
You know how perfect

257
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,000
my life in the Ping An Village is.

258
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,200
The people there get along with one another

259
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
and they hold themselves aloof from the world.

260
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,440
If all the people of both the Clan of Kunwu and Human Being can get along well with each other

261
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,770
as the ones who live in the Ping An Village,

262
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,720
how wonderful the world will be!

263
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,280
But the Dragon Emperor has ordered we're not allowed to contact the people of the Clan of Human Being.

264
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,720
What happened in the Ping An Village

265
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,120
wouldn't occur anymore.

266
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,640
Well,

267
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,220
do you think of Li Xuan?

268
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,360
If you wanna be with Li Xuan,

269
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,890
you'd better leave now.

270
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,960
Otherwise, when we return to the place of Kunwu,

271
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,720
it won't be easy for you to meet one another.

272
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,360
You mean,

273
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,680
if I do wanna be with Li Xuan,

274
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,530
will it be regarded as a betrayal of Kunwu?

275
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,440
You should ask yourself a question like this,

276
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,560
whether you still wanna be with him,

277
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,940
even though you have to betray Kunwu.

278
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:09,160
[Tomb of Respected Master Lord Zi]

279
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,320
Li Xuan, we have to go.

280
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,000
Li Xuan, Lord Zi has rested in peace.

281
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,600
Don't bury yourself in the deep sorrow.

282
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,720
I wanna be alone.

283
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,440
You can leave now.

284
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,560
Young Master,

285
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,000
please receive my condolences.

286
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,240
What did you say?

287
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,600
I don't wanna go back to the place of Kunwu

288
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,120
with Your Majesty.

289
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,720
Why?

290
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,730
Because I have someone I can’t let go of

291
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,680
The son of Qingsheng and the human being.

292
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,960
Yes.

293
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,610
He has the blood of the Clan of Human Being in his vein.

294
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,480
As a Saintess of Kunwu,

295
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,660
if you wanna be with a human being,

296
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,740
how will the people of our Clan of Kunwu think about you?

297
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,240
All I want

298
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
is to live with the one I love.

299
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,250
Please allow me to achieve what I want.

300
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
I can let you go.

301
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,360
But you have to leave behind the Saintess Mark.

302
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,370
Your Majesty, don't do this to her.

303
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,060
It's no less than killing her.

304
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,840
Only a Saintess of our Kunwu

305
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,040
can have the Saintess Mark.

306
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,600
Youlian,

307
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,320
it's not late for you to regret your decision.

308
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:26,850
Youlian,

309
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,080
you have to ponder over it.

310
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,600
Once your Saintess Mark is removed,

311
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,260
even an immortal won't be able to save your life.

312
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,720
As a Saintess of Kunwu,

313
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,200
my mission has been accomplished.

314
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,440
In the rest of my life, I wanna live for myself.

315
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,520
I promise you.

316
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,650
Youlian.

317
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,560
Youlian.

318
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,160
Youlian.

319
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,080
Youlian.

320
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,240
Youlian.

321
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,280
Youlian.

322
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
Youlian.

323
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,520
Su Youlian.

324
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,120
Youlian.

325
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,760
Su Youlian.

326
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
Li Xuan.

327
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
I love you so much.

328
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,480
I thought you had gone.

329
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,240
I'll never leave you behind.

330
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,720
You wake up.

331
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,240
I thought I would have died.

332
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,170
Do you wanna go find Li Xuan?

333
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,760
Now you can go.

334
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,230
Why don't I feel the pain at all?

335
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,080
Don't feel relieved too soon.

336
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,230
I've used some medicine

337
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,040
to relieve your pain temporarily

338
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,840
and help you continue your life,

339
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,880
but it won't last long.

340
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,880
You mean I would die anyway.

341
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,560
Being got rid of the Saintess Mark,

342
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,080
no Saintess can keep alive.

343
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,900
Then I'd better hurry and go find him.

344
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,280
Wait a sec.

345
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,150
Give your Saintess Stone to me.

346
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,000
Saintess Stone?

347
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,199
I intend to give it back to its owner.

348
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,480
Thank you.

349
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,400
Youlian.

350
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Youlian.

351
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,480
Mirror Moon Lake?

352
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,120
Why do you bring me here in a sudden?

353
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,240
Youlian,

354
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,560
let's go find the Elder of the Book of Heaven, shall we?

355
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,000
Do you miss him?

356
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,400
Yes, I do.

357
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,600
Okay.

358
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,810
I'll accompany you wherever you wanna go.

359
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,080
Come on. Hurry up.

360
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,010
It's over there.

361
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,920
Mentor. Mentor. Mentor.

362
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,960
Mentor. Mentor. Mentor.

363
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,240
Mentor.

364
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,480
What do you want?

365
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,560
We want the book.

366
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,960
I mean, you guys

367
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,840
look listless.

368
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,320
Cheer yourselves up.

369
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,120
Yes.

370
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,640
Yes. Yes. Yes.

371
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,720
You guys are poorer

372
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,200
than your predecessors,

373
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,860
which disappoints me so much.

374
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,480
After you get admitted into the Academy,

375
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,320
you'll have to be serious.

376
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,520
Okay. Sure.

377
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,060
Mentor in Chief Xie is coming.

378
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,160
Look at the nerd.

379
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,160
You're a nerd.

380
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,020
Hey, Cui Pianran. Cui Yanran.

381
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,640
Wait and see.

382
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,720
Idiot. Nerd.

383
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,040
Stop running.

384
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,760
Changqing.

385
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,440
You can leave.

386
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,400
Your Highness, the propitious time has yet to come.

387
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,160
I said leave. Do as I said.

388
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,440
Yes.

389
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,720
Have they left yet?

390
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,120
Yeah.

391
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,000
Why don't you lift my red cloth?

392
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,600
What a nerd!

393
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,200
Yunshan, you look so pretty today.

394
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,400
I'm always pretty!

395
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,840
Who are you?

396
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,200
I'm Xiao Fengming.

397
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,160
I'm your husband.

398
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,320
If I draw a painting

399
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,380
of what you're now,

400
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,200
and sell the painting of a handsome man having a bath

401
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,760
in the market,

402
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,730
I'll be able to earn a big sum of money, won't I?

403
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,440
I'm just kidding.

404
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,720
Don't worry.

405
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,040
I won't let anyone else see what you look now.

406
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,570
To tell you a piece of good news,

407
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,680
your younger sister, Yunshan, has been healed.

408
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,050
And she's got married with that nerd, Xiao Fengming.

409
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,400
Your father and mother seem to like him pretty much.

410
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,560
And they intend to cultivate him to be the emperor-to-be.

411
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,560
You'd better recover as soon as possible.

412
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,000
Or else, you're not gonna be able to succeed to the throne.

413
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,420
I have another piece of good news.

414
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,560
The Dragon Emperor has led all his people

415
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,920
to return to the homeland of Kunwu, and they're about to rebuild their home.

416
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,120
Now all is at peace.

417
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,400
As for Youlian,

418
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,080
she disappears with Li Xuan.

419
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,480
I can't tell you where they are,

420
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,240
but I can promise you

421
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,400
they do live a happy life.

422
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,880
You'll bless them, won't you?

423
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,840
It seems they all live a good life outside.

424
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,800
Yeah.

425
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,720
So do we. Right?

426
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,760
We can see how they are when we miss them.

427
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,760
But that old man

428
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,690
always acts like a chatterbox,

429
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,080
which is too annoying.

430
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,920
You brat,

431
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,840
you're speaking ill of me behind my back again.

432
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,960
I'm not.

433
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,040
I strengthened the swing just now.

434
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,210
You two are here.

435
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,860
Have a try to see whether it's strong enough.

436
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,040
Go.

437
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,440
Send me a message when you need me.
