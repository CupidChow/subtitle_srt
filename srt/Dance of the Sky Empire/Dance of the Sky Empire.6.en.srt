1
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,870
Dance of the sky Empire

2
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,870
Episode 6

3
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,000
You are supposed to be in your best years,

4
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,440
but you have become a courtesan.

5
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,800
It's so pathetic.

6
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,910
God is jealous of such a beauty like you.

7
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,030
Are you ready, Jing?

8
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,170
Everyone is waiting for you, Jing.

9
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,800
Jing?

10
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,360
Changqing, are you asleep?

11
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,030
Not yet.

12
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,160
I can't sleep either.

13
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,690
You know what I'm thinking?

14
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,000
Miss Su.

15
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,160
How do you know that?

16
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,080
Because I'm thinking about her too.

17
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,600
What?

18
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,200
You are thinking about Miss Su?

19
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,960
Do you have a crush on her?

20
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,390
I'm just wondering

21
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,160
why Cui Pianran did harm to Miss Su.

22
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,980
If we didn't get there in time,

23
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,390
I'm afraid Miss Su

24
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,670
would have been dead.

25
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,079
Indeed.

26
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,190
I can't help feeling there's something weird behind this.

27
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,320
Who is that?

28
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,200
Xiao Fengming?

29
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,110
Xiao Fengming?

30
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,920
Xiao Fengming knows fighting skills?

31
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,040
What is going on?

32
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,040
Changqing!

33
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,500
Your Highness!

34
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,440
No!

35
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,640
Come out.

36
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,230
No.

37
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,480
Xiao Fengming, please come out of there.

38
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,110
Princess Yunshan, I…

39
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,480
Xiao Fengming,

40
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,960
I'm going to kill you.

41
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,760
Stop!

42
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,440
Pervert!

43
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,510
Stop!

44
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
-Stop! -You pervert!

45
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,340
How dare you peep at Her Highness in her bath!

46
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,010
Pervert!

47
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,510
Fengming, oh Fengming,

48
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,320
I didn't expect you were this kind of man!

49
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,390
You came to peep at her when she was taking a bath!

50
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,550
I, I didn't.

51
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,070
It's a wrong accusation.

52
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,790
You didn't?

53
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,390
What were you doing here if you didn't do it?

54
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,480
I was sleepwalking.

55
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,790
I've got sleepwalking disorder.

56
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,650
Sleepwalking?

57
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,510
Yes.

58
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,640
Still trying to get out of it?

59
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,120
I'm going to kill you now!

60
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,760
Wait a minute please.

61
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,500
Princess Yunshan,

62
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,720
I do have sleepwalking disorder.

63
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,320
I can't sleep well ever since childhood.

64
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,200
Whenever I sleepwalk,

65
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,790
I don't know what I'm doing

66
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,830
or where I am.

67
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,110
My neighbors

68
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,510
can prove it.

69
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,200
Look, Yunshan.

70
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,159
Calm down.

71
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,270
He claims that he has sleepwalking disorder.

72
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm going to ask around and find out the truth tomorrow morning.

73
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,790
If he does have that, we can let him go.

74
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,760
If he doesn't, we can kill him at any time.

75
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,640
Princess Yunshan,

76
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,390
I'm absolutely not that despicable.

77
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,040
I won't believe that.

78
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,390
Kill him.

79
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,020
He deserves it.

80
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,920
He already deserves a death penalty for peeping at you when you were taking a bath.

81
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,520
Moreover,

82
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,040
whether he was intentional or not,

83
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,100
his life is worthless in the first place. Just kill him.

84
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,920
I don't kill people indiscriminately.

85
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,000
You're right!

86
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,460
It won't be too late if we find out the truth before killing him.

87
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,110
Get out!

88
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,150
Get out of here!

89
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,840
After we find out the truth, you'll be doomed.

90
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,670
Hurry up!

91
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,549
Your Highness?

92
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,770
What are you guys doing?

93
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,030
Explain yourself.

94
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,880
While you clearly knows fighting skills,

95
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,110
why did you pretend that you didn't?

96
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,150
What are you up to?

97
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,470
I don't know fighting skills.

98
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,880
Why didn't you dodge?

99
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,350
I…

100
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,880
Because I couldn't.

101
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,960
Still pretending…

102
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,670
Changqing!

103
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,650
Not in the head!

104
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,790
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

105
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,520
No!

106
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,710
Don't hit me!

107
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,520
Don't hit me in the head!

108
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,230
Don't hit me! Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

109
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,110
No!

110
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,590
Young Master,

111
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,760
judging from his behavior,

112
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,190
I think he really doesn't know how to fight.

113
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,080
You really don't know fighting skills?

114
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,080
I really don't!

115
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,000
It's impossible.

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,080
How could you hold up so long fighting him?

117
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,400
How can I know?

118
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,320
I have sleepwalking disorder!

119
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,880
Is it possible that he knows fighting skills

120
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,670
only when he's sleepwalking?

121
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,440
This is so strange!

122
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,450
Your Highness,

123
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,790
are you really going to let him off?

124
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,670
Haven't you had him checked already?

125
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,730
He does have sleepwalking disorder.

126
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,390
Since he didn't mean to do it,

127
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,760
I certainly won't make him pay for this.

128
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,870
Your Highness, you're so magnanimous.

129
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,340
He's not so dumb after all.

130
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,320
He could tell that he'd annoy you,

131
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,640
so he stayed out of your way.

132
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,350
But,

133
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,150
you have to watch out for him.

134
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,080
Who knows

135
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,790
what he will do next time?

136
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,200
If he dares do it next time,

137
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,110
I will definitely not let him off.

138
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,330
You're right, Your Highness.

139
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,960
Lord Zi,

140
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Qingtian City is in total chaos now.

141
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,380
The Qilin incident must be tackled as soon as possible.

142
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,400
Since Li Xuan caused this,

143
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,350
let him take care of it.

144
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,670
This is not trivial.

145
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,710
Li Xuan doesn't have what it takes

146
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,280
to bring Qilin down.

147
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,910
If he doesn't try, how do we know what will happen?

148
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,470
Li Xuan was born the Nation-protecting Master under heaven's command.

149
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,640
It's his duty and destiny to

150
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,640
protect the human clan.

151
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,230
The end of the ten-year period is coming soon.

152
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,080
And he's the only one who can save Tianqi.

153
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,670
So, let this Qilin be his test.

154
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,470
Yes.

155
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,910
Hey,

156
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,030
I thought it was Mentor Xuan Ming's class.

157
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,830
Why did Mentor in Chief Xie come?

158
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,550
Good day, Mentor in Chief Xie.

159
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,600
Sit down please.

160
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,320
I came here to discuss with you all

161
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,730
something important.

162
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,430
Last night, the ancient Qilin from Moyun Ancient Academy was

163
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,280
released from Qianyuan Pavilion

164
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,150
and killed many courtesans in a brothel,

165
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,470
causing complete chaos

166
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,110
and public panic.

167
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,770
Were the victims all brothel courtesans?

168
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,200
Exactly.

169
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,100
Several girls were killed last night alone.

170
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,470
How incredible this ancient Qilin is such a shameless old man!

171
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,350
The first place he went after the breakout was a brothel.

172
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,280
Pianran, let's stay out of it.

173
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,110
Be quiet.

174
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,440
It's not the time for chatting.

175
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,510
The Tianqi Emperor has been notified about

176
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,400
the chaos caused by the ancient Qilin.

177
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,960
His Majesty is in a rage

178
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,470
and has ordered our Moyun Ancient Academy to

179
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,440
capture him in three days.

180
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,110
Lord Zi is currently in practicing in seclusion.

181
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,150
We are the only ones

182
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,110
who can do the job now.

183
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:07,760
What?

184
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,760
He wants us to capture the Qilin?

185
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,520
And we must complete it in three days?

186
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,000
It's said that he has lived for thousands of years

187
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
and has strong magical power.

188
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,670
How can ordinary beings like us deal with him?

189
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,030
Go capture him if you can.

190
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,910
I won't do it.

191
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,760
Li Xuan,

192
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,910
what do you say?

193
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,200
Now that Qingtian City is in danger,

194
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,440
as the Nation-protecting Master, it's my duty to capture it.

195
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:38,840
But…

196
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,550
Good!

197
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,470
That's what I need to hear from you.

198
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,280
Since you, the Nation-protecting Master, have promised us,

199
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,200
the capture of Qilin is entrusted to you.

200
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,590
Within three days,

201
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,200
I hope you can re-seal the ancient Qilin.

202
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,550
Wait, Mentor in Chief!

203
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,030
The decision is final.

204
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,710
Thank you, on behalf of the citizens.

205
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,440
If you need any help,

206
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,550
Moyun Ancient Academy's disciples are

207
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,150
at your command.

208
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,000
Li Xuan,

209
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,280
you're commendable.

210
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,790
Good for you, Li Xuan.

211
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,190
You're amazing, Li Xuan.

212
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,030
What do we do?

213
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,030
Yeah.

214
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,320
Don't do it.

215
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Li Xuan is doomed.

216
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,880
I won't do it.

217
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,400
All the odds are against him.

218
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,200
Yeah.

219
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,230
His face turned pale.

220
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,000
Li Xuan, I'll join you.

221
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,720
Bian Lingcheng?

222
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,550
I…

223
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,370
I'm studying the strategies against the Qilin.

224
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,200
Bian Lingcheng!

225
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,200
Count me in. I'm going too.

226
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,280
Count me in.

227
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
And my sister too.

228
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,450
I'm not going. Who said I'd go?

229
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,910
Come on. The Qilin is running amok now.

230
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,150
As the disciples of Moyun Ancient Academy,

231
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,440
it's absolutely our mission to capture the Qilin.

232
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,200
I know.

233
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,030
The point is…

234
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,520
The point is I must prepare for the Assembly of States.

235
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,910
And I still haven't practiced several movements well.

236
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,520
Look.

237
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,760
There's this

238
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,760
and…

239
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,790
and this.

240
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,110
So, I can't do it.

241
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,590
Can I join you guys?

242
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,590
You?

243
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,840
You're so weak.

244
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,690
You can't even kill a chicken.

245
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,370
Xuan, I can make magical battle circles.

246
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,910
Oh really?

247
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,550
Magical battle circles?

248
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,790
I'm going as well.

249
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Yunshan? Welcome!

250
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,110
Our team is just in need of a fairy

251
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,910
with beauty and wisdom like you.

252
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,790
Welcome!

253
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,110
Welcome!

254
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,400
Guys,

255
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,030
this is exactly the moment for us to

256
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,520
show our competence.

257
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,710
Let's accomplish

258
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,440
the mission together, shall we?

259
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,170
I won't do it.

260
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,710
Well…

261
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,500
Count me in.

262
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,210
I, I need to practice dancing.

263
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,670
Bye.

264
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,620
-I have stuff to do. -I have stuff to do. -Count me in.

265
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,150
What…

266
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,470
Why are you all gone?

267
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,110
Wait for me.

268
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,670
-I'm not going to do it. -Let's go. -Let's go.

269
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,200
Hey, you people

270
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,410
are truly friends!

271
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,840
You kept saying it was your duty to protect the empire.

272
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,840
And now, you all just run so quickly.

273
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,320
Come on!

274
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,420
Never mind.

275
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,080
It's just suicide anyway.

276
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
It doesn't matter how many of us die.

277
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,580
What is this place?

278
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,710
What are we doing here?

279
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,640
Baihua Pavilion.

280
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,300
We're here to track the Qilin.

281
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,000
Why must I wear a man's suit?

282
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,570
You jerk, I'm not going to do that.

283
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,730
Don't forget this.

284
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,410
You and I released the Qilin together.

285
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,960
Don't worry.

286
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,680
With me by your side, you can take advantage of anyone,

287
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,040
but no one can take advantage of you.

288
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,760
Let's go.

289
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,069
It's been a while, Miss Zhang.

290
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,930
Your business is still thriving.

291
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,040
It's thanks to you gentlemen's patronage.

292
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,349
To what do I owe this honor of your visit?

293
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Mr. Li, the girls have practiced several songs

294
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,470
and have been waiting to sing them for you.

295
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,920
This… gentleman looks not so familiar.

296
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,420
It's your first visit?

297
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,800
I…

298
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,350
It's his first visit to Qingtian City.

299
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,680
I'm showing him around.

300
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,930
It's really my first time to see such a pretty gentleman.

301
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,650
Alright, Miss Zhang, I've got important questions to ask you.

302
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,350
-Mister. -How pretty you are!

303
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,430
Let's have some fun.

304
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,690
Is it your first visit?

305
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,280
-Li Xuan! Li Xuan! -Alright…

306
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,430
-Alright…

307
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,280
Don't act like you haven't seen a man before.

308
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,110
Let him go.

309
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,040
Don't go.

310
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,190
Look how they frightened the little boy.

311
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,280
The girls just loved him.

312
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,520
Miss Zhang,

313
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,830
I heard that many girls of the city died,

314
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,590
including Baihua Pavilion courtesans, right?

315
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,560
Don't bring it up, Mr. Li.

316
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,680
What really happened?

317
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,760
God knows.

318
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,520
It was like, a beautiful girl was there

319
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,920
as usual,

320
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,690
and then she turned into bones in an instant.

321
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,400
Did those girls who died have anything in common?

322
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
What could they have in common?

323
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,390
Baihua Pavilion's girls are all

324
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,310
just pretty.

325
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,570
OK, Miss Zhang.

326
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,350
Please show me the roster.

327
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,400
OK?

328
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,680
OK.

329
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,760
Inside!

330
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,590
What happened?

331
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,000
Don't look.

332
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,680
Another person got murdered?

333
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,160
It's OK. I'm not afraid.

334
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,160
Let me take a look.

335
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,280
Are you sure?

336
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,040
Youlian!

337
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,340
Changqing.

338
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,190
How was it? Have you found anything?

339
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,640
I can't figure out several things.

340
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,310
Oh, how are you?

341
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,230
I'm fine.

342
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,520
You can't figure out several things?

343
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,800
What are they?

344
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,400
I can't figure out

345
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,530
why the Qilin ate brothel courtesans.

346
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,310
Didn't Miss Zhang say that

347
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,230
the courtesans were pretty?

348
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,140
In terms of looks, you look much better than they do.

349
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,250
It's getting late. Let's go back to the academy.

350
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,190
Hui from Baihua Pavilion?

351
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,280
Hui?

352
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,000
Bing from Chunfeng Garden?

353
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,560
Why did he choose them among all the girls?

354
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Goal!

355
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,070
Can you take it seriously?

356
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,710
This Qilin jerk

357
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,920
is vicious,

358
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,000
but he's got taste.

359
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,950
All these girls are pretty.

360
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,560
You know them all?

361
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,760
Of course.

362
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,310
I know

363
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
every pretty girl in Qingtian City!

364
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,920
OK.

365
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,640
Tell me.

366
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,230
What did they have in common?

367
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,710
Pretty!

368
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,280
Tell me what I don't know.

369
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,000
And…

370
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,310
They all had

371
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,520
voluptuous curves.

372
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,680
All of them were top-notch hotties.

373
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,950
You're so…

374
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,640
Voluptuous curves?

375
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,800
I see.

376
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,500
What have you figured out?

377
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Well, last time I saw that old Qilin,

378
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,070
he looked like a handsome gentleman.

379
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,490
It turns out he's an old womanizer!

380
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,470
Darn it!

381
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,280
It's outrageous.

382
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,470
When I capture that old Qilin,

383
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,230
I'm going to cut him into pieces

384
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,880
to avenge my pretty girls.

385
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,610
What's so funny?

386
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,310
Li Xuan, look at him.

387
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,240
What's so funny?

388
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,520
Xuan!

389
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,590
Xuan, are you in bed now?

390
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,160
Xiao Fengming?

391
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,940
Why did he come in the middle of the night?

392
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,680
What kind of scribble is this?

393
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,590
I can't read it.

394
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,520
Xuan,

395
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,230
this is the Octagonal Magical Battle Circles I have practiced for years.

396
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,890
There are the methods to contain the Qilin in it.

397
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,830
Mr. Feng, I know I can barely fight.

398
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,200
If you bring me along,

399
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,560
I will be your burden.

400
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,400
But if you acquire this Heaven-Earth Hexagonal Magical Battle Circle,

401
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,640
you can contain him.

402
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,280
It'll help you.

403
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Mr. Xiao, let me sort it out.

404
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,160
It took even you

405
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,170
so many years to practice this sort of chart,

406
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,620
but you want us to learn it in a day?

407
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,400
What kind of idea is this?

408
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,310
W-Well, I didn't think about that.

409
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,680
What do we do?

410
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,680
Are you afraid of death?

411
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,560
No.

412
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,920
Join us.

413
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,950
OK.

414
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,940
This ancient Qilin is so evil.

415
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,430
Everyone wants him dead.

416
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,760
As a man of Tianqi, this is my obligation.

417
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,040
That is excellent!

418
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,640
Your magic battle circle is going to

419
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,500
boost our combat effectiveness.

420
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,800
Well,

421
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,310
that being said,

422
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,920
how do we

423
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:13,040
lure this old Qilin out?

424
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,160
I have an idea.

425
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,800
Li Xuan,

426
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,080
are you sure your idea is going to work?

427
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,350
Are you done yet?

428
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,590
Hurry!

429
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,190
Almost done. What's the rush?

430
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,890
-After you. -Don't push me. You first.

431
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,600
You! Go ahead. You go first.

432
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,830
You go first.

433
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,920
Just go.

434
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,850
Fengming looks pretty.

435
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,470
Changqing is… handsome.

436
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,590
You're a little bit ugly,

437
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,730
but that womanizer Qilin will definitely fancy you.

438
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,190
Don't say that.

439
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,470
Oh,

440
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,190
that Heaven-Earth Hexagonal Magical Battle Circle requires six people.

441
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,710
But there're only the four of us.

442
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,770
That's not enough.

443
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,800
I can fight.

444
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,310
So can we.

445
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,830
I don't think girls should do it.

446
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,110
That womanizer loves curves.

447
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
Do you have those?

448
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,690
We don't have those?

449
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,290
What are you talking about?

450
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,260
It seems Mr. Li is sure about the victory.

451
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,520
You still have the heart to frolic around.

452
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,560
Don't we have you both now?

453
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,560
So,

454
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,160
Li Xuan really has an idea?

455
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,230
Yes.

456
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,430
The disciples said so.

457
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,680
But I don't know what exactly it is yet.

458
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,310
In that case,

459
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,640
let's wait and see.

460
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,760
If Li Xuan can capture this ancient Qilin

461
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,560
in three days,

462
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,830
Lord Zi is right about him.

463
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,760
Mentor in Chief.

464
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,710
Mentor in Chief, Prince Mu is here.

465
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,400
That's great.

466
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,640
Please invite him in.

467
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,470
Yes.

468
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,800
Sirs, your disciple is reporting in.

469
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,640
Please skip the formalities, Your Highness.

470
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,200
The hexagon of heaven and earth,

471
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,830
infinity of universe,

472
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,360
make a capturing net.

473
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,350
Cast!

474
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,680
The hexagon of heaven and earth,

475
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,330
infinity of universe,

476
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,910
make a capturing net.

477
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,800
Cast!

478
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,160
The hexagon of heaven and earth,

479
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,590
infinity of universe,

480
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,230
make a capturing net.

481
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,310
Cast!

482
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,430
Why are you standing here?

483
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,880
You're pretending to be melancholy?

484
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Is the magical battle circle ready?

485
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,350
Not yet. No rush.

486
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,880
Look at you.

487
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,760
You do look like a real girl now.

488
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,160
Had I not known you're a man,

489
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,710
I'd been fooled by you.

490
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,280
Y-You're pretty as well in a girl's dress.

491
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,170
The circle is ready.

492
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,560
Let's do this.

493
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,520
I'm so worried about the disciples.

494
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,470
Youlian.

495
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,470
Youlian.

496
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,470
Is Li Xuan's idea going to work?

497
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,800
Let's trust him.

498
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,190
Changqing, keep dancing.

499
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,070
Keep dancing.

500
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,760
How is it? Surprised?

501
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,150
Excited?

502
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,760
It seems successful.

503
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:42,000
So, he's the ancient Qilin?

504
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,800
But he doesn't look anything special.

505
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,870
What ancient Qilin?

506
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,670
How scary they described him to be!

507
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,670
It turns out he just looks ordinary.

508
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,840
An ancient animal is very cunning.

509
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,949
Let's be cautious.

510
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
Xuanxuan!

511
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,600
It's a misunderstanding.

512
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,060
It's a misunderstanding.

513
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,320
Youlian!

514
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,040
Let go. Let…

515
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,320
Xuanxuan!

516
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,320
Are you OK?

517
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,520
I'm fine.

518
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,560
This magical battle circle is of the superior divinity level.

519
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,360
But my spiritual power is too low.

520
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,490
I can't contain him.

521
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,710
Watch out!

522
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,800
Xuanxuan,

523
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,630
maybe we should retreat.

524
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,210
I must not retreat.

525
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,600
I released him.

526
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,130
I'm responsible for this.

527
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,200
I'm going to kill you!

528
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,360
X-Xiao Fengming!

529
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,000
Brother?

530
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:50,870
Get out of here.
