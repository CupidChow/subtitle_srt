2
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,860
Dance of the Sky Empire

3
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,860
Episode 25

4
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,460
Mu,

5
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,539
have you made up your mind

6
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:58,070
that you do wanna marry her?

7
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,860
Mother,

8
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,460
the ceremony is about to begin.

9
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,260
It'll be too late to talk about it with me, won't it?

10
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,540
Miss Su is not a person of our State of Sha,

11
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,780
so I'm kinda worried.

12
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,980
Allow me.

13
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,740
But I've found that

14
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,540
since Miss Su promised to marry you,

15
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,220
you look much happier.

16
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,140
It's true.

17
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,740
His Highness has made great effort,

18
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,740
which seems to be worthwhile.

19
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,860
Batou.

20
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,700
Go check

21
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,040
whether Princess Mu needs

22
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,390
something else.

23
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,579
If there's, give her what she wants.

24
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,620
Princess Mu is coming.

25
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,380
Great.

26
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,300
Great. She's so chic.

27
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,220
Great. Great.

28
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,060
Great.

29
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,420
Great. Great. Great.

30
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,020
I have a way to

31
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,310
make it obey you,

32
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,200
which is to marry me

33
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,000
and become my wife.

34
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,300
Marry you?

35
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,060
Besides,

36
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,030
we should also do

37
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,920
what a couple has to do.

38
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,100
Princess Mu,

39
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,300
it's time to dress up.

40
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,900
Prince Mu is waiting for you.

41
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,660
Something is wrong.

42
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,390
Prince Mu, something is wrong.

43
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,620
Why are you shouting?

44
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,160
Take your time.

45
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,580
Princess Mu is missing.

46
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,820
Well, Guest,

47
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,140
enjoy yourself.

48
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,760
It's the wedding day of our Prince Mu.

49
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,100
Everything is available at a discount.

50
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,740
Your...

51
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,500
Childe.

52
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,380
You can leave.

53
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,540
Childe, you're so generous.

54
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,460
It's too much.

55
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,140
Our childe has asked you to leave.

56
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,710
Save your nonsense.

57
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,240
Your Highness,

58
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,460
as you expected,

59
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,550
Li Xuan went to the imperial palace and took Su Youlian away.

60
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,740
He can't forget her.

61
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,540
I've told you

62
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,300
who he values is always Su Youlian.

63
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,660
So you don't have to...

64
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,300
Shut up.

65
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,220
Have a seat.

66
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,620
I don't dare.

67
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,340
I said have a seat.

68
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,760
Your Highness,

69
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,100
what should we do then?

70
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,300
Wait.

71
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,740
Wait?

72
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,880
Your Highness,

73
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,820
don't worry.

74
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,980
I've sent people to search for the princess all over the city.

75
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,860
And ordinary people won't be able to

76
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,940
hurt the princess because of her exquisite kung fu.

77
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,700
I'm afraid the one took her away this time

78
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,460
wouldn't be anyone mediocre.

79
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,520
You know who the one is?

80
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,260
Is the one Li Xuan?

81
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,820
If it's Li Xuan, there will be something wrong.

82
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,580
Li Xuan hates the princess too much.

83
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,660
I'm afraid...

84
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,380
Send more people to find them

85
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,620
as soon as possible.

86
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,460
Yes.

87
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,500
Let me go.

88
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,940
Let me go.

89
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,270
Let me go.

90
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,380
I won't.

91
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,180
Let me go.

92
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,460
I won't.

93
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,580
Li Xuan.

94
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,180
Don't waste your effort.

95
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,140
Do you think you can fight against me now?

96
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,500
Why do you take me here?

97
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,020
You wanna kill me, don't you?

98
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,220
Do it.

99
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,940
Kill you?

100
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,880
Won't it be too nice to you?

101
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,620
Give it back to me.

102
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,070
Don't you wanna awake the Dragon Emperor?

103
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,540
I will never let you do that.

104
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,260
Stand still.

105
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,420
Well,

106
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,870
now you can go enjoy the wedding night with Yu Fengmu.

107
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,060
You...

108
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,340
You...

109
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,920
Your Highness,

110
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,220
it's too late.

111
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,300
What about having a rest first?

112
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,700
Have you got any news?

113
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,900
Someone witnessed the princess and Li Xuan

114
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,820
headed towards the Liang River.

115
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,940
I think we would get some clues soon.

116
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,910
Keep searching.

117
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:54,900
Yes.

118
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,900
If you refuse to eat it, it'll be fine.

119
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,100
You'll get starving.

120
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,860
Before I succeed in awaking the Dragon Emperor,

121
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,790
I won't let myself starve to death.

122
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,460
Do you think you'll be able to steal anything from me

123
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,980
as you used to do?

124
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,680
What do you mean steal?

125
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,260
The Saintess Stone was robbed of me

126
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,420
by you.

127
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,580
You're acting so bold and straightforward.

128
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,240
Did the token of the Nation-protecting Master also belong to you?

129
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,720
Su Youlian, you'll use

130
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,020
unscrupulous divisive tactics

131
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,880
to achieve your goals, won't you?

132
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,460
Including taking advantage of others, stealing, robbing

133
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,590
and hurting others.

134
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,260
Or else people of your Clan of Kunwu always do things like this...

135
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,660
...are born to be an expert in these things.

136
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,710
I did take advantage of you before.

137
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,820
It's all my fault.

138
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,500
But I have to take back

139
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,720
the Saintess Stone today.

140
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,420
Youlian.

141
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,900
Youlian.

142
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,020
Su Youlian.

143
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,460
Su Youlian.

144
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,980
Su Youlian.

145
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,780
Su Youlian.

146
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,260
Su Youlian.

147
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,140
Su Youlian.

148
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,860
Come on.

149
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,860
I'll take you to see a doctor.

150
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,700
I don't mean to cheat you.

151
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,900
Stop talking.

152
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,380
I do...

153
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,420
...I really love you very much

154
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,580
What?

155
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,580
I do...

156
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Lady,

157
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,820
do you know how far

158
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,060
it is to the next town?

159
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,740
The town?

160
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,220
It's far away from here.

161
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,880
It's more than ten miles away.

162
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,180
What a long distance!

163
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,020
The lady you're carrying

164
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,060
seems to be badly hurt.

165
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,070
Can you heal her?

166
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,020
Certainly not.

167
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,340
But my master can.

168
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,360
Brother Li,

169
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,880
wait here for a moment.

170
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,860
You can come in when I call you.

171
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,580
Master,

172
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,820
I'm coming.

173
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,100
Master,

174
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,190
see. I have taken back a lot of herbal medicine today.

175
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,020
Master,

176
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,460
you must be tired.

177
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,020
Do you have a favor to ask me?

178
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,900
Nothing can be hidden from you.

179
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,100
I won't save them.

180
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,620
I said

181
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,020
I wouldn't save the one who's not a native.

182
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,260
Ask them to leave.

183
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,940
But the girl is dying.

184
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,060
You can't see her dying without saving her.

185
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,920
As long as you promise to save her,

186
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,940
I'll do anything that you ask me.

187
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,140
Even you ask me

188
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,900
to die for her.

189
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,940
Why do I ask you to die?

190
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,700
I'm begging you.

191
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,100
Please.

192
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,140
Brother Li.

193
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,640
Brother Li.

194
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,100
Master,

195
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,300
see how miserable they are.

196
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,760
Please save them, Master.

197
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,060
I said I wouldn't save them.

198
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,140
Ask them to leave.

199
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,620
You wake up.

200
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,060
Are you a person of the Clan of Kunwu?

201
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,590
Your fever has gone.

202
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,100
Have a rest first.

203
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,900
I'll get you a bowl of water.

204
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,900
Where's Youlian?

205
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,740
Youlian.

206
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,500
Why are there so many people of the Clan of Kunwu

207
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,230
and the ones of the Clan of Human Being?

208
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,060
Thank you.

209
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,420
[Ping An Village]

210
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,720
Why are you coming?

211
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,580
How is she?

212
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,750
Has she woken up?

213
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,980
She's badly hurt.

214
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,100
My master said

215
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,340
it'll take a while for her to wake up.

216
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,220
You don't have to worry too much.

217
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,300
My master said she'll be safe.

218
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,150
Does the word of your master count?

219
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,580
My master...

220
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,900
my master is the best doctor near here.

221
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,960
Do you think whether his word counts?

222
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,620
It'll be fine. Don't worry about her anymore.

223
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,900
Hurry and go have a rest first.

224
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,360
Your injury isn't healed.

225
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,820
Don't disturb the recuperation of Miss Su.

226
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,260
Well,

227
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,180
what on earth is the place?

228
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,980
Why are there so many people of the Clan of Kunwu?

229
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,380
What are they doing here?

230
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,180
They don't intend to do anything.

231
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,180
What they want is to live a good life.

232
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,670
Hurry and go have a rest.

233
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,180
Let me go inside and have a look at her, will you?

234
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,700
My master said no.

235
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,750
He is the one who is going to save her

236
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,300
I know nothing about

237
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,100
how Youlian is now.

238
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,140
Thank you, Sister Saintess.

239
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,540
Thank you, Sister Saintess.

240
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,820
Thank you, Sister Saintess.

241
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,580
Thank you, Sister Saintess.

242
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,760
Sister, you're so beautiful.

243
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,940
Thank you, Sister.

244
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,940
Thank you, Sister Saintess.

245
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,740
Sister Saintess is so beautiful.

246
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,940
Sister Saintess is the most beautiful.

247
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,420
Sister. Sister.

248
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,360
Sister is the most beautiful.

249
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,780
Run slow.

250
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,500
Sister.

251
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,940
Be careful.

252
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,980
The brother is not a bad guy.

253
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,980
You don't have to be scared of him.

254
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,060
My dad said

255
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,580
except the human beings in our village,

256
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,550
all of the others have bad intentions towards us.

257
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,550
Then you can go play over there.

258
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,940
Come here. Come here. Come here. Hurry and have a seat.

259
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,740
You're well behaved.

260
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,740
Sure.

261
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,040
Do you feel better?

262
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,940
I feel much better

263
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,460
when I see them.

264
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,900
Li Xuan,

265
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,260
can you imagine how happy I'm?

266
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,180
I thought I wouldn't have a chance to

267
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,100
see so many people of my clan.

268
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,740
I thought they would be drifting

269
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,590
from place to place.

270
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,560
I don't find there's a group of people

271
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,739
who live a good life here

272
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,300
until I arrive.

273
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,139
There're no human beings who are oppressing them.

274
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,940
They can only live a good life

275
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,380
in such a small place

276
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,270
without going anywhere else,

277
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,940
but for them,

278
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,650
it's a heaven of peace and happiness, isn't it?

279
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,300
Hold it.

280
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,170
Thank you.

281
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,409
You're right.

282
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,110
Now that you know the people of the same clan mean so much to a person,

283
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,940
why did you hurt

284
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,199
so many innocent people at that time?

285
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,180
What?

286
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,060
Don't tell me

287
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,420
the schoolmates who died in the Academy

288
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,670
as well as the people in Qingtian City weren't killed by you.

289
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,340
Li Xuan, what are you talking about?

290
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:15,980
Yep.

291
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,910
What am I talking about?

292
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,700
I won't believe in you anymore.

293
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,590
Your people of the Clan of Kunwu are born to be crafty.

294
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,820
Li Xuan,

295
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,740
believe it or not,

296
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,700
I'll admit

297
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,580
what I've done.

298
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,340
All I want is

299
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,980
to save the Dragon Emperor

300
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,960
from beginning to end.

301
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,460
I have no reason to kill other innocent people.

302
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,380
What's more,

303
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,500
since the plan of saving the Dragon Emperor

304
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,700
was hindered by you,

305
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,220
Yu Fengmu and I have been killing ourselves escaping from you.

306
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,150
How could we go back to kill people?

307
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,700
It's impossible.

308
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,400
All these people were killed by the one of the Clan of Kunwu.

309
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,660
And the Dragon Emperor has been sealed.

310
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,580
Tell me

311
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,340
except you,

312
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,580
who else could kill

313
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,680
so many people overnight?

314
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,620
Xiao Fengming.

315
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,140
Xiao Fengming?

316
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,000
Do you think I'll believe you?

317
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,780
Li Xuan,

318
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,100
I'm not lying to you.

319
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,630
Do you remember he always sleepwalks?

320
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,270
It's not because of his somnambulism.

321
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,420
It's because he's been manipulated by the demon spirit of the Dragon Emperor.

322
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,350
But at that time,

323
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,140
the spiritual power wasn't strong enough

324
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,800
so that he would only be manipulated when he was sleeping soundly.

325
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,700
I mean it.

326
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,460
Is it because of this reason

327
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,340
that the magic arts of him become more powerful

328
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,740
when he is sleepwalking?

329
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,500
If you don't believe me,

330
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,950
you can go ask Loong Wei'er.

331
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,620
He's always well-informed,

332
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,280
since he has sources all over Qingtian City.

333
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,540
He must know the truth.

334
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,460
Sure.

335
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,480
Okay. I'll go ask him for sure.

336
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,580
Take this one.

337
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,620
Thank you.

338
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,460
Okay.

339
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:43,900
It's yours.

340
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,740
Thank you.

341
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,560
It's yours.

342
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,780
Take it.

343
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,660
Li Xuan,

344
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,120
have a look at them.

345
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,470
They're not that horrible.

346
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,270
As long as you can set aside prejudice,

347
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,260
your Clan of Human Being and our Clan of Kunwu

348
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,460
can get along well with one another.

349
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,260
Besides,

350
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,630
I've promised the people of my clan

351
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,440
that I would awake the Dragon Emperor

352
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,470
and find back our own homeland.

353
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,700
So even you

354
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,280
won't be able to stop me this time.

355
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,340
Sister Saintess,

356
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,460
could you have dinner with us?

357
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,980
Li Xuan, I hope you could believe me.

358
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,060
And you wouldn't stop me.

359
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,710
Let's go.

360
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,260
Let's have dinner.

361
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:16,900
Come on.

362
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:19,860
Well, here you are.

363
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,620
Thank you.

364
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,660
Come on.

365
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,100
Have it.

366
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
You're starving, aren't you?

367
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,220
Well, hurry and have the bowl of congee.

368
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,780
Nope. I don't want it.

369
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,020
I made it especially for you.

370
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,340
It's delicious.

371
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,060
I mean it. It's delicious.

372
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,060
Come on.

373
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,780
Have it.
