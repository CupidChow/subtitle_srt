[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,870
Dance of the Sky Empire

3
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,870
Episode 14

4
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,490
Su Youlian.

5
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,310
Wake up.

6
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,440
Where is Li Xuan?

7
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,950
What are you doing?

8
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,310
Can't you see that she is still weak?

9
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:51,910
Weak?

10
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,590
Maybe she's weak, but she came back.

11
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,550
But we can't find any trace about my Xuan.

12
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,270
Li Xuan!

13
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,630
Li Xuan!

14
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:58,870
Youlian.

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,160
You finally woke up.

16
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,550
We were worrying sick!

17
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,910
Youlian.

18
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,910
You and Li Xuan disappeared for a whole day.

19
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,550
We were so scared.

20
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,800
A whole day?

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,290
Where is Li Xuan now?

22
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,360
Su Youlian.

23
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,280
Didn't you go into the Secret Realm together?

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,960
Where is Li Xuan?

25
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,960
Tell me!

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Su Youlian.

27
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,110
Su Youlian, where's Li Xuan?

28
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,079
Su Youlian.

29
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,030
Bian Lingcheng!

30
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,750
Didn't they come back together?

31
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,600
Where's Li Xuan?

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,800
How can you have the cheek to ask me?

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,720
If it were not for you,

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,360
Li Xuan wouldn't have gone missing!

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,290
I'm telling you,

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,970
if anything happens to him,

37
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,240
I will make you pay for it!

38
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,030
Get lost!

39
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,829
I wasn't targeting Li Xuan!

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,600
Keep it with you.

41
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,079
Don't let go no matter what happens.

42
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,830
Youlian.

43
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
Youlian.

44
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,710
Move on with your life out there.

45
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,090
Because I can't get out.

46
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,390
But

47
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,880
I will always miss you in here.

48
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,140
I will always miss you.

49
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,110
So soon?

50
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,040
I can be killed,

51
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,140
but I won't be insulted by you!

52
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,320
All his tendons and bones are broken.

53
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,370
I am surprised that you didn't die.

54
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,480
You're really tough.

55
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,830
That little monk, such a brat.

56
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,230
I didn't expect him to hit me so hard.

57
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,720
How about now? Can you move?

58
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,640
You're good, old man.

59
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,800
Why can't I move now?

60
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,390
Don't stop.

61
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,550
Just stay like this.

62
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,760
You deserve it.

63
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,040
Stinky old man.

64
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,159
I wonder,

65
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,120
you know how to deal with that little monk, right?

66
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,000
Why would I know that?

67
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,320
I never fought against him before.

68
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,320
But aren't you the famous Elder of the Book of Heaven?

69
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,000
There is something that even you have no answer to?

70
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,230
But there is something that can't be said out loud.

71
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,110
You shall never leak the secret of Heaven.

72
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,510
Fine.

73
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,230
Wangcai.

74
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,880
Wangcai.

75
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,880
Just wait for me.

76
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,270
I will bring you with me next time I try to break through the Secret Realm.

77
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,510
If we are lucky,

78
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,040
we can get out together.

79
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,550
Just leave him alone here

80
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,809
where he'll die alone.

81
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,590
Don't try to take Wangcai with you.

82
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,640
Wangcai is not like you.

83
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,550
It has been with me in this Secret Realm for hundreds of years.

84
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,150
Once it goes out,

85
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,550
it will

86
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,200
turn into ashes in the blink of an eye.

87
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,840
Wangcai, I like you better.

88
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,110
You are not like someone

89
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,480
who starts missing the colorful world outside

90
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,790
when he stays here for only a few days.

91
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,840
How nice this Secret Realm is!

92
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,150
But someone,

93
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,840
while he possesses Eyes of Redframe,

94
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,470
can't see anything.

95
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,790
What did you say?

96
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,140
I didn't say anything.

97
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,030
No, no.

98
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,400
You didn't say anything?

99
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
I know.

100
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,590
Stinky old man.

101
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
I know.

102
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,080
That magic glass bead

103
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,680
can only take one person out.

104
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,550
I don't want to go out alone!

105
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,550
Hold me back!

106
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,710
Hold me back.

107
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,000
Old man, I'm leaving.

108
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,230
When I am done experiencing the world outside,

109
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,960
I will take Youlian back here to keep you company.

110
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,230
You punk.

111
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,110
Just get lost!

112
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,030
Don't think that I will forgive you

113
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,950
just because you said something touching.

114
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,910
Punk.

115
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,810
You should understand by now.

116
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,220
Look at where you stand

117
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,980
and the burn scars on his head.

118
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,760
You brat. You beat me!

119
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,960
And you hit me so many times!

120
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,790
So many times.

121
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,080
This is for hitting me earlier!

122
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,910
This is your punishment!

123
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,930
Hit me if you can.

124
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,880
Hit me.

125
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,520
Hit me, hit me.

126
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,150
You hit me so many times!

127
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,520
Tell me. Where is the exit?

128
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,550
Say it.

129
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,640
Since the bead can only take one person away,

130
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,880
why did you want me to go out?

131
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,110
We agreed that we would always be together.

132
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,670
Li Xuan.

133
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm coming for you.

134
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,880
Why can't this kid heal himself now?

135
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,950
Lord Zi, how is he?

136
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,070
He is lucky and blessed.

137
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,880
Apply the best vulnerary on him and let him rest in bed for a few days

138
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,710
then he should be fine.

139
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,120
What did the Secret Realm do to you guys?

140
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,310
How can he get hurt so seriously?

141
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,040
Youlian.

142
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,590
This is the best medicine in the State of Sha.

143
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,230
I hope it can help him recover.

144
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,760
Thank you.

145
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,290
I will go back and get

146
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,430
the best medicine in my family, too!

147
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,710
Pianran, you're home.

148
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,470
This girl is so rude.

149
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,640
Madam, don't mind.

150
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,430
Lady Pianran must be in a bad mood.

151
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,350
Someone in the academy must get under her skin.

152
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,310
Go get some snacks she likes

153
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,560
to her room.

154
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,640
Yes.

155
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,430
Mother.

156
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,640
Yanran?

157
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,880
Why are you back, too?

158
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,310
One of my classmates got injured.

159
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,470
So I came back to get some good vulnerary

160
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,800
for him.

161
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,880
Go get it.

162
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,000
-I don't want to eat anything.
-Lady.

163
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,730
Take them away. Leave me alone.

164
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,110
What's wrong with your sister today?

165
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,430
Why is she so grumpy?

166
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,590
Did someone in the academy bully her?

167
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,310
No one dares to bully her.

168
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,400
She's the one who bullies other people.

169
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,290
Then why is she so grumpy since no one bullied her?

170
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,160
I am telling you…

171
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,190
So

172
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,520
she has a crush on Li Xuan?

173
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,800
Although Li Xuan is kind of a brat,

174
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,850
he's still the Nation-protecting Master

175
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,190
as well as General Li's son.

176
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,160
I think

177
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,440
they will make a lovely couple.

178
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,120
Don't worry too much.

179
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,920
Since Lord Zi said Li Xuan will be fine,

180
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,800
then he will be fine.

181
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,230
It is said that

182
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,850
it's very dangerous in the Secret Realm.

183
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,710
Did you get hurt?

184
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,760
No.

185
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,640
What about the poison remaining in your body?

186
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,040
Elder of the Book of Heaven detoxified me in the Secret Realm.

187
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,570
Elder of the Book of Heaven?

188
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,680
Just a lovely old man.

189
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,520
How about you?

190
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,950
Why do you look so weak?

191
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,560
I'm fine.

192
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,800
Mu.

193
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,920
You should rest in bed now.

194
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,190
Why did you come out of your room?

195
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,310
Just let me send him the medicine.

196
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,120
What happened to him?

197
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,230
Mu got hurt trying to save…

198
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,110
Yunshan.

199
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,640
Save what?

200
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,280
Nothing.

201
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,650
Li Xuan, you woke up!

202
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,400
Li Xuan woke up.

203
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,310
Why is it you, Xiao Fengming?

204
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,430
It's me! It's me!

205
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,230
Xuan!

206
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,570
If you didn't wake up soon,

207
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,280
Changqing and I would kill ourselves to keep you company.

208
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,190
My hand.

209
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,800
Sorry.

210
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
Are you alright?

211
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,350
Prop me up a bit.

212
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,680
Okay.

213
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,350
Here, slowly.

214
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,400
Young Master.

215
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,040
Xuan!

216
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,530
Your wound doesn't seem to heal so fast as before.

217
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,680
I know, right?

218
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,010
Maybe the injuries got in the Secret Realm

219
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,050
are different than the ones from the world outside.

220
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,400
By the way, we have a class to take.

221
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,430
Let's go!

222
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,040
Yes, it's time for class.

223
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,280
Let's go.

224
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,040
I want to protect Young Master.

225
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,000
You idiot!

226
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,350
He has Miss Su to keep him company now.

227
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,950
No one wants you to be the third wheel. Hurry up.

228
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,680
Let's go.

229
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,190
Come on!

230
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,140
Mu, why didn't you let me tell her?

231
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,000
You risked your life to save her.

232
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,060
But all she can think about is Li Xuan.

233
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,920
It's my own decision to make to save her.

234
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,790
It has nothing to do with her.

235
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But…

236
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,560
Just let it go.

237
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,070
If I fall for someone like you did,

238
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,540
I will definitely confess my love to him.

239
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,160
So

240
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,590
have you fallen for someone?

241
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,040
I'm not sure how I feel.

242
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,070
He is quite dull.

243
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,470
I'm not sure if he deserves my love.

244
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:58,760
Hurry up.

245
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,640
-Come on!
-Don't drag me.

246
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,300
Princess Yunshan, Prince Mu.

247
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,970
Wait for me!

248
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,060
I'm going to class.

249
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,640
Let's go to class!

250
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,710
He is dull, but he's also cute.

251
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,640
Mu!

252
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,680
Sorry, are you okay?

253
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,400
I…

254
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,430
I am fine.

255
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,680
I really thought you would never come back.

256
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,050
I also thought I could never come back.

257
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,560
But I came back anyway

258
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,200
because I am so blessed by Providence.

259
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,900
What happened to you in the Secret Realm?

260
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,190
Why are you injured all over?

261
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,760
Did you upset Elder of the Book of Heaven again?

262
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,950
He hit you again?

263
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,920
How is this possible?

264
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,160
He couldn't love me more.

265
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,310
Why would he beat me?

266
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,470
You are so silly.

267
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,680
Okay, don't cry.

268
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,040
I got out of there alive and kicking.

269
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,190
Cheer up.

270
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,040
Sleep for a while.

271
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,030
My injuries are not serious.

272
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,920
Did you forget that

273
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,960
I have a self-healing function?

274
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,710
You suffered so much for me.

275
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,920
Nonsense.

276
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,800
Don't you remember that

277
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,710
we were officially married?

278
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,160
You are my wife.

279
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,360
Shouldn't a husband do something for his wife?

280
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,230
Dad?

281
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,590
General Li.

282
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,000
Dad, why are you here?

283
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,710
Why am I here?

284
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,470
If I didn't come,

285
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,830
you would throw your life away.

286
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,110
Pack your clothes and go home with me.

287
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,110
Go home?

288
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,710
General Li.

289
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,400
Li Xuan hasn't fully recovered.

290
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,190
I'm afraid he can't travel now.

291
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,830
He's my son.

292
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,070
I know his physique better than anyone else.

293
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,040
Dad.

294
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,190
Can you adjust your attitude?

295
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,110
Youlian was just caring about my health.

296
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,350
Shut up.

297
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,430
Didn't you hear what I said?

298
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,410
Get dressed and go home with me.

299
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
I am not going back.

300
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,470
I'll just stay in bed here for two days and then I'll be fine.

301
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,830
What did you say?

302
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,070
General Li.

303
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,830
Li Xuan.

304
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,570
Listen to your father.

305
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,140
Go home for some recuperation for a few days.

306
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,390
Then you have to come to visit me.

307
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,760
General Li.

308
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,590
Li Xuan was injured because of me this time.

309
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,920
It was all my fault.

310
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,350
Please don't punish him when he arrives home.

311
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,240
What are you talking about?

312
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:25,190
It was not you who made us fall into the Secret Realm.

313
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,880
Don't take the blame.

314
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Well, well, well.

315
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,760
Miss Su, you're good at manipulating people.

316
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,040
My son, who only took

317
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
but never gave,

318
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,760
is willing to sacrifice his life for you.

319
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,350
Dad, you've crossed the line.

320
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,070
I won't go home.

321
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,830
Just go home without me.

322
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,710
You…

323
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
Butler Li, bring a few people here!

324
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,830
Today I will

325
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,280
take him home even if I have to tie him up!

326
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,350
Yes, sir!

327
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,710
I didn't expect that

328
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,470
Li Xuan could break through from

329
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,350
the dangerous Secret Realm.

330
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,160
Now we know that Lord Zi had his considerations

331
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,210
when he chose him as the Nation-protecting Master.

332
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,430
He is really something.

333
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,640
Now we can only hope that

334
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,710
he won't go astray.

335
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,040
Otherwise

336
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,410
the human clan will suffer disasters.

337
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,070
I don't think we need to worry about that.

338
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,190
Li Xuan might act like a rascal,

339
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,470
but he has been kind,

340
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,190
affectionate, and loyal.

341
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,070
He will not harm the human clan.

342
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,830
I should hope so.

343
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,350
By the way,

344
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,280
His Majesty asked you to investigate thoroughly

345
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,190
the remnants of the Kunwu clan.

346
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,710
Do you have any news about it?

347
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,880
I have discovered the whereabouts of

348
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,400
You An, the right-hand man of Dragon Emperor.

349
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,430
According to my intelligence,

350
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,110
there are many remnants of Kunwu Clan

351
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,000
who will come to meet with You An.

352
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,680
I will wait for them to gather together

353
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,720
and arrest them all in one swoop.

354
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,560
Although it's just a weak rabble,

355
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,400
during this special period of time,

356
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,560
we have to stay wary of them.

357
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,040
Where have you been for the past whole day and night?

358
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,520
A day and a night?

359
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,920
I stayed for more than three months

360
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,230
in the Secret Realm.

361
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,880
Why did you say it was just a day?

362
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,800
Secret Realm?

363
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,340
What Secret Realm?

364
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,730
Bloody Icebound Ward.

365
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,590
Bloody Icebound Ward?

366
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,230
Then it made sense.

367
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,190
One hundred days inside the realm equal just one day outside.

368
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,350
You went in there with Li Xuan?

369
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,230
Master, how did you know that?

370
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,800
You wouldn't be able to enter there without a No.1 Token.

371
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,000
Since you went inside with him,

372
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,000
did you get the token?

373
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,680
No.

374
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,590
No?

375
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,680
Did you forget Dragon Emperor?

376
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,350
Did you forget our Kunwu Clan?

377
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,040
I didn't.

378
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,950
But…

379
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,560
But what? Say it!

380
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,920
But Li Xuan saved my life

381
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,710
risking his many times in the Secret Realm.

382
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,830
It'll be so unfair and unkind

383
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,640
if I steal his token now.

384
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,040
Fair and kind?

385
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,310
It's simply foolish

386
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,220
to treat human clan with fairness and kindness!

387
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,830
When they sealed Dragon Emperor's power and locked him up,

388
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,590
had they been fair and kind to him?

389
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,950
When they slaughtered and enslaved our people,

390
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,520
had they been fair and kind to us?

391
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,470
We did want to be kind and fair to them once,

392
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,870
but did the human clan return our kindness?

393
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,000
But Li Xuan is different from them!

394
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,680
You can never really understand a human being.

395
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,280
If you don't do it,

396
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,000
you'll be punished by me.

397
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,070
Slowly!

398
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,400
Ouch!

399
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,160
You little brat.

400
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,160
Stay home

401
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,880
for the next few days.

402
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,430
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

403
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,830
Keep an eye on Young Master.

404
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,590
Yes.

405
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,950
Why bother keeping an eye on me?

406
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,010
I am not a prisoner.

407
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,110
Shut up.

408
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,800
If I let you go out again,

409
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,160
you might get killed.

410
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,650
-Use your…
-Master.

411
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,650
What's the matter?

412
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,310
You have guests coming.

413
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,040
Who are they?

414
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,710
Mrs. Cui has taken her eldest daughter to our mansion.

415
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,830
Take the guests to the main hall.

416
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,710
I'll be there soon.

417
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,640
Yes.

418
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,420
General Li.

419
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,070
Mrs. Cui, sorry for keeping you waiting.

420
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,110
Take a seat.

421
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,070
Mrs. Cui.

422
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,610
To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?

423
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,170
I heard that your son was injured.

424
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,470
My daughter was worried about him.

425
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,220
So she asked me to come together to visit him.

426
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,680
These are some humble gifts from our Cui family.

427
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,230
I hope you like them.

428
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,110
Mrs. Cui, you're so kind.

429
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,400
I wonder how your son is recovering from his injuries?

430
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,000
Thank you for asking.

431
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,160
Although he was seriously injured,

432
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,430
as long as he rests in bed at home for a few more days,

433
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,630
he will recover soon.

434
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,920
I'm glad to hear that.

435
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,800
Li Xuan.

436
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,430
Li Xuan.

437
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,950
Li Xuan.

438
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,520
Li Xuan, are you hurt badly?

439
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,070
I brought the best vulnerary from home.

440
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,930
Come here. Let me apply it for you.

441
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,920
Come on.

442
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,190
Missy, are you kidding me?

443
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,430
Don't you understand it's improper for men and women to have physical contact?

444
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,110
What are you doing?

445
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,920
I'm not trying to take advantage of you.

446
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,470
I just care about you.

447
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,920
I don't want you to care about me.

448
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,120
I am now a married man.

449
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,950
I don't want any other girl's concern.

450
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,920
Li Xuan.

451
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,800
Did you hurt your brain?

452
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,430
When did you get married?

453
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,520
Why do I have to tell you

454
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,560
when I got married?

455
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,350
You…

456
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,360
Forget it. I won't take offence at you.

457
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,600
My son is such a brat.

458
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,120
He just idles about everyday

459
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,909
without thinking about his future career.

460
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:14,469
Just as the saying goes, "Marry and settle down".

461
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,429
A man

462
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,040
has to have a family of his own before he has ambitions on his career.

463
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
Besides,

464
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,929
after he gets married,

465
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,760
he will have a wife to discipline him.

466
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,150
I guarantee he will behave himself

467
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,350
and never be able to idle about anymore.

468
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,000
I already told you that

469
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,120
I am a married man.

470
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,469
I won't marry you.

471
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,760
Just give up, okay?

472
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
Don't try to lie to me.

473
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,710
I'm not that easy to be fooled by you.

474
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,760
Besides,

475
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,800
a marriage is decided by their parents' choice

476
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,040
and dealt with by a matchmaker.

477
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,100
How could this be your choice to make?

478
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,600
First of all, my mom already died.

479
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,389
Secondly, I don't even listen to Ziji,

480
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,670
let alone my father.

481
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,840
You punk!

482
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:53,909
You…

483
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,670
How can you talk nonsense in front of your wife-to-be?

484
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,080
Dad, what wife-to-be?

485
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,360
Stop joking, okay?

486
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,430
Tomorrow

487
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,560
I will take the horoscopes of the two of you

488
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,690
to a fortuneteller.

489
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,910
In a few days

490
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,630
there will be a matchmaker going to the Cui Mansion to propose the marriage.

491
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,320
Am I clear enough?

492
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,360
Clear.

493
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,040
Very clear.

494
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,560
Propose the marriage, you said.

495
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,080
No problem. I agree.

496
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,180
Dad, I know it has been hard for you

497
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,600
and you always wanted to find me a stepmother.

498
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,080
You have my blessing on this marriage.

499
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,950
I will show up at you two's wedding.

500
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,710
-You jerk!
-Changqing!

501
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,430
General Li, communicate, don't get physical.

502
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,800
Don't get physical.

503
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,320
Are you trying to piss me off?

504
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
He's so handsome.

505
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,910
So handsome.

506
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,320
I like him.

507
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,120
What are you looking at?

508
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,950
Why is this man so grumpy?

509
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,910
Let's go.

510
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,740
Don't forget it tomorrow.

511
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,930
Yunshan. Your brother is so handsome.

512
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,400
I know, right?

513
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,320
Yeah! I really envy you.

514
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,800
Do you?

515
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,710
Princess Yunshan.

516
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,890
What are you doing here?

517
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,910
Last time I came in a hurry, so I didn't bring any gift.

518
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,110
This is a pearl I got from the South Seas.

519
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,560
It's just a little something.

520
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,120
I hope you like it.

521
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,870
It's okay. I already have everything I want.

522
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,530
Princess Yunshan.

523
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,710
Why do you always turn me down?

524
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,150
I'm warning you.

525
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,950
Don't show up in front of me again.

526
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,870
Or I'll tell our mentor.

527
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,120
Princess Yunshan and Xiao Fengming

528
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,320
have been dating secretly.

529
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,390
Duke Yu is chasing someone

530
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,320
who's not interested in him at all.

531
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,710
I know, right?

532
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,120
Last time I saw Princess Yunshan

533
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,320
and Xiao Fengming together.

534
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,850
The two looked so intimate.

535
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,760
Really?

536
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,760
You…

537
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,360
Xiao Fengming, are you trying to get killed?

538
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,730
How dare you steal my girl from me?

539
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,520
You…

540
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,840
What are you talking about? I am confused!

541
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,040
And how can you beat me without a reason?

542
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,320
Don't play dumb with me!

543
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,630
Everybody knows about your obscene relationship.

544
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,190
You shameless couple!

545
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,670
Shut up.

546
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,480
Don't insult Princess Yunshan's name!

547
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,360
Yunshan,

548
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,760
you were so harsh on

549
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,520
that young duke named Yu Min.

550
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,430
He's so annoying.

551
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,080
I was already polite to him.

552
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,140
Princess Yunshan!

553
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,660
Princess Yunshan!

554
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,600
Xiao Fengming was beaten up by Duke Yu Min!

555
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,840
Go and have a look!

556
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,670
You dared to do it, but don't have the guts to admit it, right?

557
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,150
What princess of the state of Sha?

558
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,190
I think she's just a shameless maid.

559
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,080
I'll say it again.

560
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,080
You can badmouth me,

561
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,410
but I won't let you insult Princess Yunshan!

562
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,870
What? Do you want to fight back?

563
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,630
How dare you?

564
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,560
I'll teach you a lesson!

565
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,800
Stop.

566
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,840
Princess Yunshan!

567
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,710
This slap

568
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,120
is for your rude marks on me.

569
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,910
This slap

570
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,760
is for you hitting my classmate in my academy.

571
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,600
You…

572
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,670
What are you waiting for? Get lost!

573
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,380
Are you waiting for my third slap?

574
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,390
Okay.

575
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,490
You used your spiritual power.

576
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,600
You bullied me because you guys outnumber me.

577
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,280
I'll get even! Just you wait!

578
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,000
Are you okay?

579
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,260
I am fine. Just some superficial wounds.

580
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,230
I'll take you to apply some vulnerary。

581
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,390
I…

582
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,800
Yu Min was

583
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,650
obviously no match for you.

584
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,850
Why didn't you fight back from the beginning?

585
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,230
I am a student in the academy.

586
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,430
Both of my spiritual power and spells are better than him.

587
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,670
It's really unfair to him

588
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,040
if I fight back.

589
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,080
Also it's against my principle of

590
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,480
never bullying the weak.

591
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,910
You are just stupid.

592
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,710
So you're always bullied by others.

593
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,670
So

594
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,550
why did you fight back later?

595
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,190
He shouldn't have insulted and discredited you.

596
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,520
So

597
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,470
you hit him for me.

598
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,170
He deserved to be punished for his words.

599
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,630
At this time, you forget your principle of

600
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,430
never bullying the weak.

601
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,390
It's not just

602
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,240
spells and martial arts that can hurt people.

603
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,600
Sometimes a venomous tongue is also a sharp weapon.

604
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,670
He used malicious words to hurt people aggressively.

605
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,760
He was not…

606
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,080
Weak.

607
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,320
You're so good at sophistry.

608
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,600
Wait for me here.

609
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,470
I'll be back soon.

610
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,430
Don't go away.
