Dance of the Sky Empire

Episode 13

4
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,340
Youlian.

5
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,900
Grandpa.

6
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,020
Youlian.

7
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,310
It's time for a meal.

8
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,620
Where're you?

9
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,620
Youlian.

10
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,060
Grandpa.

11
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,220
It's time for a meal.

12
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,860
Youlian.

13
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,660
Grandpa.

14
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,780
Youlian.

15
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:21,110
Where're you going? I've been finding you everywhere for long.

16
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,340
Youlian.

17
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,560
What's wrong with you?

18
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,900
Youlian, what's wrong?

19
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,180
Why did you go to the room of the Elder of the Book of Heaven?

20
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,660
Li Xuan,

21
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,380
we'd better leave here as soon as possible.

22
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,940
Why do you mention it in a sudden?

23
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,870
You don't like to stay here, do you?

24
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,630
I don't mean I dislike here.

25
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,980
I mean,

26
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,020
I wanna go back.

27
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,100
Isn't it good to stay here?

28
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,900
I…I wanna stay here for a little longer.

29
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,060
Besides,

30
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,140
well,

31
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,540
it's good to enjoy the time of being a couple, isn't it?

32
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,380
Look at the place,

33
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,020
isn't it better to stay here than at that Academy?

34
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,180
We don't have to have

35
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,700
those boring classes every day.

36
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,700
Besides, that Elder of the Book of Heaven

37
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,220
is so lonely, isn't he?

38
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,260
It's so rare for him to have us

39
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,020
accompany him for a while.

40
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,740
If we leave so soon,

41
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
he'll be miserable again, won't he?

42
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,500
Yep.

43
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,140
But think about it,

44
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,700
there're also lots of people who are worrying about us,

45
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,860
including your father,

46
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,220
our schoolmates

47
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,180
and friends.

48
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,150
They must be worrying about us.

49
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,100
Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,140
I know.

51
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,340
I don't mean we won't go back,

52
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,940
but I just wanna stay here for a little longer.

53
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,060
Isn't it good?

54
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,100
Li Xuan,

55
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,660
I have to go back.

56
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,340
Now.

57
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,660
Okay.

58
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,140
We'll go back.

59
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,860
We've been walking around here for long.

60
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,740
Why can't we find the entrance?

61
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,460
It shouldn't happen.

62
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,580
I remember

63
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,320
we did fall down here that day.

64
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,140
What happened?

65
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,340
It is useless.

66
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,280
What's wrong with you?

67
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,860
I'm fine.

68
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,260
I have to go out.

69
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,380
I have to break through the ward.

70
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,780
I'll help you.

71
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,900
You're over-confident.

72
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,020
You two kids,

73
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,700
you don't take this bloody icebound ward seriously, do you?

74
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,260
How dare you break through alone?

75
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,120
You're making yourselves a big trouble.

76
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,020
Even if I die,

77
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,580
I'll go out.

78
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,060
How naïve you're!

79
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,820
Even if you were to die for several hundred or thousand times,

80
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,260
it would be impossible for you to go out of the ward.

81
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,460
What do you mean?

82
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,460
Make yourself clear, geezer.

83
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,040
One can only get into the mysterious land

84
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,060
without going out.

85
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,700
If you two keep making troubles,

86
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,340
you'll die here.

87
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,460
And you can't blame me for not saving you.

88
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,540
You old bastard, you're the Elder of the Book of Heaven.

89
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,670
You must know how to go out of the place.

90
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,740
To tell you the truth,

91
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,620
for over hundreds of years,

92
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,740
no one

93
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,380
has been able to go out of the mysterious land without getting hurt.

94
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,180
…has been able to go out of the mysterious land without getting hurt.

95
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,380
You two

96
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,260
should go back with me

97
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,140
without hesitation.

98
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,720
How do you feel?

99
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,380
Li Xuan,

100
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,110
I have to try one more time.

101
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,940
We can't try the same thing as we've done earlier.

102
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,740
Wait for me.

103
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,500
I'll go ask that old bastard.

104
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,260
Geezer,

105
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,560
I know you haven't fallen asleep yet.

106
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,460
You're coming.

107
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,820
Spill it out.

108
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,740
How could we go out?

109
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,140
Go out?

110
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,300
How could it be that easy?

111
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,580
What place do you think you're in?

112
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,780
It isn't a place where you can come and go

113
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,380
as you want.

114
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,980
I can cook whatever you want to eat

115
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,020
before I leave.

116
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,380
What do you think?

117
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,120
Stewed pork with brown sauce?

118
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,070
Green pepper fried spare ribs?

119
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,830
Stewed chicken with mushroom.

120
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,860
I think

121
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,200
you can't live a good life without us.

122
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,060
You're speaking too highly of yourself.

123
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,620
I can't live a good life without you, can I?

124
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,140
It's okay. Just to be honest with yourself.

125
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,100
Look at yourself, it's hard for a lonely and miserable elder like you

126
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,620
to stay in a place like this

127
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,940
for over hundreds of years, isn't it?

128
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,780
You do want someone to accompany you.

129
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,780
I've been here alone

130
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,780
for over thousands of years

131
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,540
before you came here.

132
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,520
I've lived a good life, haven't I?

133
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,840
If you did live a good life, why would you wanna keep us here?

134
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,140
If you do wanna leave,

135
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,660
there's a way.

136
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,100
Are you sure, geezer?

137
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,300
grandpa

138
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,700
you're awesome.

139
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,060
You're amazing.

140
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,540
I mean it.

141
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,020
Harder. Harder. Harder.

142
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,420
Harder.

143
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,500
Harder.

144
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,460
It's so comfortable.

145
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,140
Stop flattering me anymore.

146
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,060
I love it though.

147
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,340
It's okay that you wanna leave.

148
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,300
But I have a condition.

149
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,620
You have to exchange

150
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,420
what you value the most with me.

151
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,940
What I value the most?

152
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,340
Do you mean…?

153
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,940
It's not gonna happen. It's not.

154
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,000
I won't exchange Su Youlian with you.

155
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,620
What do you mean Su Youlian?

156
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,100
Am I that shallow?

157
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,300
Then what do you want?

158
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,060
I've heard

159
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,780
that you have the self-healing ability.

160
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,780
Knock it off, geezer.

161
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,460
I live on it.

162
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,740
Nope. It's not gonna happen.

163
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,820
Fine.

164
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,700
I promise you.

165
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,780
I didn't push you, did I?

166
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,840
You didn't push me.

167
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,020
How amazing it is!

168
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,460
Then I'll take it from you.

169
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,700
I have given you what you want.

170
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,980
Can we leave now?

171
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,860
Of course.

172
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,140
Do you have the glass ball

173
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,100
I presented to you on your wedding day?

174
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,380
Of course.

175
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,020
I take it with me all the time.

176
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,420
With it,

177
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,340
you can go out of the mysterious land.

178
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,820
What a tricky geezer you're!

179
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,020
If I had known the glass ball could help us leave here,

180
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,460
I wouldn't have exchanged

181
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,380
my self-healing ability with you.

182
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,420
What did you say?

183
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,740
It's no use blaming me.

184
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,180
If that glass ball weren't roused,

185
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,700
it would be nothing

186
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,180
lying there.

187
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,420
Then how can I rouse it?

188
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,380
Master,

189
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,540
I'll try my utmost to leave here as soon as possible.

190
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,100
And I'll also take the token

191
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,270
to save the Dragon Emperor out.

192
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,900
That's the thing.

193
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,580
It's no wonder that you should force me to marry Su Youlian.

194
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,510
You old bastard.

195
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,060
You brat.

196
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,620
When you are about to leave the mysterious land…

197
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,860
I…

198
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,020
I forgot…

199
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,430
I forgot a really important thing,

200
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,220
which is

201
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,100
that the glass ball

202
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,100
is truly able to bring people out.

203
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,980
But…

204
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,540
but it can only bring one and only out.

205
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,350
What do you mean?

206
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,580
If you let that girl go out,

207
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,180
then you'll have to stay in the mysterious land

208
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,640
accompanying me forever.

209
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,820
If you want to leave,

210
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,300
then that girl will have to stay here

211
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,460
for the rest of her life.

212
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,540
Geezer,

213
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,910
you old bastard,

214
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,820
are you kidding me? Right?

215
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,780
I'm not. –Are you kidding me?

216
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,420
I'm not.

217
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,140
You should have told me earlier.

218
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,740
How come I would forget to tell you such an important thing?

219
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,460
I'm…

220
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,780
I'm…

221
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,540
I'm not kidding for sure.

222
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,540
Who's leaving

223
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,740
while who's gonna stay here?

224
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,940
It's your call to make.

225
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,700
You have another way, don't you?

226
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,140
You must have another way, mustn't you?

227
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,060
If there were another way,

228
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,420
there would be plenty of people

229
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,080
who get out of the place over thousands of years.

230
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,540
Then why would they all

231
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,940
have died in the mysterious land?

232
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,860
I'm always forgetful.

233
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,780
I…

234
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,740
…I always miss the most important part.

235
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,630
Are we doomed not

236
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,820
to leave here together?

237
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,020
Li Xuan,

238
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,510
we should leave here together.

239
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,430
We should leave here together.

240
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,140
Okay.

241
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,220
We'll make it.

242
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:11,619
Are you sure?

243
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,260
We can leave now?

244
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,050
Why?

245
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,290
Grandpa hasn't promised us, has he?

246
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,900
I make it because I'm so smart.

247
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,460
You're showing off.

248
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,290
Let's hurry and go.

249
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,700
Let's go.

250
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,100
Grandpa,

251
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,980
we're leaving.

252
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,860
Thank you.

253
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,700
I'll miss you.

254
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,340
Just go.

255
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,620
Go.

256
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,660
Well.

257
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,860
Well,

258
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,700
we'll miss you.

259
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,860
Let's go.

260
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,700
Go.

261
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,100
You brat,

262
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,620
you do have a great affection for her.

263
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,980
Li Xuan,

264
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,830
we can finally get out of the place.

265
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,660
Why do you look unhappy?

266
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,340
Do I?

267
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,620
Maybe

268
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,980
it's because I'll miss that dog.

269
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,460
I should have roasted it,

270
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,940
but I don't have a chance now.

271
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,340
If you miss Grandpa,

272
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,110
I'll come here with you.

273
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,780
It won't happen.

274
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,660
Well,

275
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,420
drop your blood on it.

276
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,580
What's it?

277
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,060
It's the glass ball

278
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,420
that can make us go out.

279
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,340
Do it.

280
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,900
As long as you do have a thing for one another,

281
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,660
your blood

282
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,340
can rouse it.

283
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,420
It's glittering.

284
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,740
We've roused it.

285
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,700
Then…

286
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,060
then what?

287
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,860
You should hold it carefully.

288
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,190
No matter what happens,

289
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,790
don't loosen your hand.

290
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,500
I'll definitely hold it tight.

291
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,220
Let's go.

292
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,510
What's wrong with you, Li Xuan?

293
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,980
Li Xuan.

294
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,620
Li Xuan.

295
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,540
Now that you're my wife,

296
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,470
I should take the chance to hug you.

297
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,820
In case you don't admit the marriage of us,

298
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,060
when you go out.

299
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,350
You're annoying. You take advantage of me again.

300
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,620
Li Xuan, why can't I step in?

301
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,820
Get out.

302
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,670
Why are you standing still?

303
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,200
Stop laughing. Hurry and get out.

304
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,700
Youlian.

305
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,020
Youlian,

306
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,140
live a good life outside.

307
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,740
What do you mean?

308
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,020
Hurry and get out.

309
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,630
Come on, Li Xuan.

310
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,780
Get out.

311
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,510
What are you going to do?

312
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,020
Look at me.

313
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,700
Look at me.

314
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,980
I can't go out.

315
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,380
But I'll stay here missing you all the time.

316
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,380
I'll miss you always.

317
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,380
Nope.

318
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,660
Get out.

319
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,020
Say something. Get out, please.

320
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,520
Haven't we promised that we would leave here together?

321
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,320
You've just said that you would leave with me, haven't you?

322
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,340
Li Xuan,

323
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,220
don't leave me alone.

324
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,660
Li Xuan, get out.

325
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,900
Li Xuan, you're a liar.

326
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,700
Li Xuan, you lied to me.

327
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,180
The glass ball can bring only one out.

328
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,540
I don't wanna leave anyway.

329
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,260
Hold my hand.

330
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,100
Hold my hand.

331
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,780
Hold my hand

332
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,180
Li Xuan.

333
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,420
Li Xuan.

334
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,220
Brother,

335
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,510
you finally wake up.

336
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,300
Do you feel better?

337
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,470
Has Youlian got out yet?

338
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,220
Brother,

339
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,340
you've been weak since you were a child.

340
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,180
You're able to expend your life due to the Saintess Stone.

341
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,380
You can't do it again.

342
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,340
Prince,

343
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,160
Princess Yunshan,

344
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,140
Miss Su is coming back.

345
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,700
Li Xuan.

346
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,180
It's the Book of Heaven,

347
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,100
which can make people see whatever they wanna see.

348
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,500
Youlian.

349
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,140
Li Xuan.

350
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,740
The Book of Heaven records whatever happens in the world.

351
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,940
Does it record the way to escape from the mysterious land?

352
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,780
It's…

353
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,280
Can I get out of here when I go through the formation?

354
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,740
Why is the door open?

355
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,380
Which brat is in the room?

356
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,380
Geezer,

357
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,460
I found a secret

358
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,620
in the Book of Heaven just now.

359
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,180
It records another mysterious land.

360
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,910
As long as I can break through it, I can leave here.

361
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,110
Do you mean the Tianxiu Formation?

362
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,660
The one who wants to break through the Tianxiu Formation

363
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,220
will die without exception.

364
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,020
It's no use telling you about it.

365
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,190
I would die without exception.

366
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,860
I don't care.

367
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,460
I don't care. It's my only chance.

368
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,470
I must leave here, even if I die.

369
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,580
If you don't wanna die,

370
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,420
live a sober life here

371
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,900
and don't think about going anywhere.

372
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,580
Otherwise,

373
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,820
don't blame me later.

374
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,100
The one who wants to break through the Tianxiu Formation

375
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,140
will be torn limb from limb.

376
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,620
If you do ask for a death,

377
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,740
why not allow me to eat you up?

378
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,940
Do it.

379
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,580
I'd rather die

380
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,620
than stay here.

381
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,600
If you stay here with me in this mysterious land,

382
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,140
you will be an immortal.

383
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,060
But when you get out,

384
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,120
what you can feel is birth, senility, illness and death of the mortal.

385
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,300
If I'm not able to be with my beloved,

386
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,060
I won't be willing to

387
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,420
live a life of a hundred years,

388
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,660
a thousand years or ten thousand years.

389
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,340
Fine.

390
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,900
I won't allow you to break through the Tianxiu Formation.

391
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,700
I won't for sure.

392
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,220
Youlian,

393
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,940
wait for me.

394
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,360
I'll definitely come up with a way to get out.

395
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,590
You went to break through the formation, didn't you?

396
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,820
You got hurt?

397
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,860
You refuse to tell me the location of the formation.

398
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,989
I'll take my time to search for it in the mysterious land.

399
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,060
I'll find it for sure, even if I have to turn the place inside out.

400
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,780
Even though I have to search each inch of the place.

401
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,780
Now you don't have the ability of self-healing.

402
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,580
How many times do you wanna hurt yourself?

403
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,060
You brat.

404
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,860
You brat.

405
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:36,980
You're…

406
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,100
You brat,

407
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,420
I'm willing to tell you the truth,

408
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,130
but the Tianxiu Formation is way too dangerous.

409
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,540
You won't make it.

410
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,460
I don't care whether it's way too dangerous.

411
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,920
As long as I can go out, I'm afraid of nothing.

412
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,210
Fine.

413
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,980
Now that you don't wanna live a sober life,

414
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,780
I'll help you.

415
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,740
Over the several hundred years,

416
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,260
there have been dozens of people who died in the Tianxiu Formation.

417
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,860
You can also be one of them.

418
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,300
You've made a promise.

419
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,960
You can't go back on your word.

420
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,940
You'll lead me the way to the Tianxiu Formation, won't you?

421
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,800
Why do you bring me to the kitchen?

422
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,180
It's here.

423
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,030
The kitchen?

424
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,860
Exactly.

425
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,940
Then why do you think

426
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,220
there are

427
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,500
inexhaustible food materials here?

428
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,060
I get it.

429
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,030
It's the place connected to the world of human being.

430
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,420
That's why there're inexhaustible

431
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,180
food materials here.

432
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,780
Because people send these here.

433
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,940
Not exactly. Not exactly. Not exactly.

434
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,620
But

435
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,940
the basket

436
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,100
is so small.

437
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,620
You idiot.

438
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,180
It's not there.

439
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,420
Nope.

440
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,900
It's here.

441
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,220
It's here.

442
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,550
How about it?

443
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,660
Do you dare to get in?

444
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,740
Of course.

445
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,180
Do it.

446
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,380
Wait a sec.

447
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,900
Have you made up your mind?

448
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,580
Once you step in,

449
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,020
there will be a slim chance of surviving.

450
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,420
The chance of getting out

451
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,380
is way too slim.

452
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,660
Have you finished?

453
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,740
Yeah.

454
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,060
Child.

455
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,940
Little monk.

456
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,020
Your eyes are so big.

457
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,740
Who gave birth to you?

458
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,550
What? Do you wanna have a fight?

459
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,430
I don't beat a child.

460
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,620
Go find your families here.

461
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,660
I'll beat them.

462
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,180
You brat,

463
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,260
if you aren't able to fight against him, you can run away.

464
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,500
Keeping alive is your priority.

465
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,100
The Gate of Life is in the north.

466
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,220
As long as you go through the Gate of Life, you can come back.

467
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,820
It's in the north. The north.

468
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,460
Don't be anxious.

469
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,710
I'll try the melon and tell you whether it's sweet or not.

470
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,380
It's sweet.

471
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,750
You're coming back so soon.

472
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,740
We haven't finished eating up the melon yet.

473
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,020
Old bastard.

474
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,180
He's about to faint.

475
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,140
See, I'm right.

476
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,240
Have you got it?

477
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,540
One who asks for death will all end up like this.

478
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,020
Don't do what he's done.

479
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,700
We'll stop eating the melon.

480
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,100
Help me get him back.

481
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,470
Take him to the room.

482
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,640
Follow me. Come on.

483
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,870
Follow me, Wangcai.

484
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,660
Come on.

485
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,380
You mean,

486
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,340
who the hell is the monk?

487
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,120
How come he's so highly skilled in martial arts?

488
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,590
If the old bastard hadn't saved me out, I would have died.

489
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,000
I'm talking to you.

490
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,860
Could you give me a response?

491
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,060
Eat. Eat. Eat.

492
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,350
Stop eating.

493
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,280
I say, don't eat anymore. Stop it.

494
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,860
Stop eating.

495
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,940
All that you know is eating.

496
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,740
Why haven't I come up with it?

497
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,140
Old bastard.

498
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,860
How could this be?

499
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,380
Hey, old man.

500
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,900
How to untie this?

501
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,260
Youlian.

502
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,300
Youlian, wake up.

503
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,060
Li Xuan.

504
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,940
Youlian.

505
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:58,920
Su Youlian,

506
00:41:59,140 --> 00:41:59,740
wake up.

507
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,870
Where's Li Xuan?

508
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,380
What are you doing?

509
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,740
Haven't you seen she's weak?

510
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,400
She's weak?

511
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,020
She's come back anyhow though she's weak.

512
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,540
But where's Xuanxuan?

513
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,700
Li Xuan.

514
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,060
Li Xuan.

515
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,300
Youlian.

516
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,580
You wake up finally.

517
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,710
We've been worrying about you so much.

518
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,340
Youlian,

519
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,340
Li Xuan and you have been missing for one day and a night,

520
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,980
which scares us so much.

521
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,220
One day and a night?

522
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,500
We're supposed to have stayed in the mysterious land for three months.
