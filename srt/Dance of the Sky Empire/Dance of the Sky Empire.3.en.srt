Do you have a thing for me?

Say it out loud, if you like me.

00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,990
You don't have to touch me all over my body.

8
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,229
You're shameless, aren't you?

9
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,860
Am I?

10
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,280
It's you who touched me all over my body.

Why am I the shameless one?

12
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,900
You're shameless.

00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,229
To be frank, Su Youlian,

14
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,480
don't provoke me anymore.

Raffish.

You failed to get the token, didn't you?

21
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,500
I got an idea.

22
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,420
But when I wanted to search him, he's…

23
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,780
What?

24
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,180
Anyway, Li Xuan is a poor guy.

25
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,900
Master, don't worry.

26
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,700
I'll figure out something else.

Let's go attend it.

You can go first.

31
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,940
I'll go there soon.

I'm gonna attend the welcome party.

what the welcome party really is,

but there must be fun with so many people.

38
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,580
You don't come here for fun.

Why do you catch me here?

42
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,180
Old bastard.

43
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,420
You don't have the nerve to release me, do you?

44

Take it back.

Going into and out of the Mysterious Land without any restraint.

53

You think I've no idea that

54
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,100
the Dragon Emperor of the Kunwu clan is locked in it.

55
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,560
It's good that you know it.

56
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,220
As a Nation-protecting Master,

57
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,820

00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,980
and preventing the curse of Kunwu Saintess from coming true

So,

61
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,940
you should take good care of

62
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,700

63
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,339
Why should I be a Nation-protecting Master?

64
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,019
I've never promised you.

65
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,140
It's…it's you who entrusted position to me.

66
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,980
It doesn't count.

67
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,820
Does it?

68
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,020
I've heard that

69
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,530
you've been making a mess outside

70
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,220
in the name of the Nation-protecting Master.

71
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,020
Okay.

72
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,180
Now that you're not willing to be a Nation-protecting Master,

73
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,900
I'll announce the public tomorrow.

74
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,060
From now on,

75
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,230
you're no longer the Nation-protecting Master of the State of Tianqi.

76
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,300
You

77
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,900
think about it.

78
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,980
Will those who were offended by you

79
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,380
give you a good time?

80
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,460
You…

81
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,620
Master,

82
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,820
it is negotiable.

83
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,260
It's not.

84
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,760
The ten-year term is about to expire.

85
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,860
The Kunwu clan is ready

86
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,360
and waits for a right time to take action.

87
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,340
You should obediently stay in the Moyun Ancient Academy

88
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,740
to learn more magic arts.

89
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,100
Then you'll be able to protect our Clan of Human Being.

90
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,020
Nope. Master.

91
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,750
Listen to me,

92
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,380
it's useless to give it to me.

93
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,060
I'm not able to guard it.

94
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm not qualified.

95
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,560
The public won't trust me.

96
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,840
Haven't you been inquiring about

97
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,860
the news of your mother?

98
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,220
Well,

99
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,620
I promise you.

100
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,340
As long as you obediently stay in the Academy

101
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,860
and guard the token,

102
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,380
you can go anywhere you want

103
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,060
and I won't stop you

104
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,710
when the ten-year term expires smoothly.

105
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,060
Are you sure?

106
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,220
Look at me,

107
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,820
am I cheating you?

108
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,780
Old bastard, we make a deal.

109
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,380
If you do cheat me,

110
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,860
I'll get into the Mysterious Land

111
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,460
and release the Dragon Emperor to kill you all.

112
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,500
The welcome party tonight is such an important occasion.

113
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,830
Why won't you attend it?

114
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,300
Isn't it a great chance for you to make some friends.

115
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,980
I've got admitted by the Academy smoothly.

116
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,440
There's no need to rush to make some friends.

117
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,860
What do you think of Li Xuan?

118
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,780
Not that good.

119
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,900
The State of Tianqi entrusting the Nation-protecting Master to him,

120
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,900
there will be a mess sooner or later.

121
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,470
I think he's someone who can get acquainted with.

122
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,700
Now that Lord Zi can entrust the national security to him,

123
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,170
he can't be a mediocre one.

124
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,740
See. See,

125
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,860
it's lively.

126
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,700
Come here. Come here. This way.

127
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,180
It's over there. Okay.

128
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,260
It's great. It's great.

130

I'm coming.

131
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,060
See.

132

Youlian,

133
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,580
come here.

134
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,460
Where's Changqing?

135
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,540
Why hasn't he come?

136
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,540
I have no idea.

137
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,700
Do you want any?

138
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,580
Yanran, it's so lively here.

139
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,620
Both original students and the newly admitted are together here.

140
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,460
Yeah.

141
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,020
See,

142
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,860
the students over there are two grades higher than us.

143
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,720
And there,

144
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,000
those are one grade higher.

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,460
Are they wearing the uniform of the Academy?

146
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,980
It looks so good.

147
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,060
Mentor has said

148
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,460
we can also wear it later.

149
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,460
Yanran.

150
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,060
Yanran, come here.

151
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,380
Why are you together with the wild girl?

152
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,740
It's too incompatible with your status.

153
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,420
Sister, don't say it to Youlian.

154
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,700
We're schoolmates.

155
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,180
So what?

156
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,440
I can't talk about her just because we're schoolmates?

157
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:08,940
Youlian,

158
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,700
my sister always talks like this.

159
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,260
Please don't mind.

160
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,620
You rascal!

161
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,680
I'll get rid of you for the people.

162
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,310
What are they doing?

163
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,940
They're horsing around.

164
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,740
Girl Schoolmate,

165
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,620
why are you so fierce?

166
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,460
Move away.

167
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,740
How does this small potato provoke you?

168
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,260
He's harassed me.

169
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,299
I…

170
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,020
Harass you? I can't see it.

171
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:35,860
Yeah.

172
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,700
Me either.

173
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,059
I'd rather be punched to death by you

174
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,940
than face such huge humiliation.

175
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay. You'll get what you ask for.

176
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,940
Princess Yunshan.

177
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,420
Why do your Tianqi people have to say so many words before a fight?

178
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,940
Is there any misunderstanding between you two?

179
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,740
What's wrong?

180
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,740
I collided with the princess today.

181
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,940
It's really my fault.

182
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,660
But

183
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,180
the princess said I harassed her on purpose.

184
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,020
I won't admit it.

185
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,300
Your negligence?

186
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,180
We walked on such a broad road,

187
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,580
but you collided with me anyway.

188
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,580
Right. Right.

189
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,580
Right.

190
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,460
She's right. You did it on purpose, didn't you?

191
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,580
Nope.

192
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,540
I… I…

193
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,700
I was reading a book when I was walking.

194
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,060
I was focusing on the book so much

195
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,340
that I collided with the princess.

196
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,500
And my hand touched the princess by accident.

197
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,140
I didn't want to harass her.

198
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,940
Of course you won't admit it.

199
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,640
I won't let you go today, no matter what happens.

200
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,820
Stop it. Stop it.

201
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,980
He said he didn't do it on purpose.

202
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,820
Besides,

203
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,580
who really cares about you?

204
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,300
You…

205
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,300
Okay. Okay. Okay.

206
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,940
It's my fault for sure.

207
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,580
Princess Yunshan is supposed to get angry.

208
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,780
You shouldn't blame Princess Yunshan.

209
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,940
Xiao Fengming,

210
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,940
are you an idiot?

211
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,380
We're defending you.

212
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,880
Why do you talk on her side?

213
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,020
I'm just talking about the thing.

214
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,500
I'm saying sorry to you, Princess Yunshan.

215
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,260
Let's go. Go. Go.

216
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,180
The Crown Prince is coming.

217
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,140
His Highness is coming.

218
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,540
His Highness is coming.

219
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,780
Come here. Come here. Come here.

220
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,310
It has nothing to do with me.

221
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,840
You hurry to come here.

222
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,660
We're bowing to you, Your Highness.

223
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,140
What are you doing?

224
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,060
Haven't I told you

225
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,540
I'm here to enjoy the party with the people?

226
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,100
Why… why are you standing here?

227
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,940
Get out.

228
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,410
Don't be so overcautious, everyone.

229
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:54,860
Rise.

230
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,220
Thank you, Your Highness.

231
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,940
Everyone should move to the middle.

232
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,530
Then we can get closer.

233
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,060
I…

234
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,020
I…

235
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,100
I'm just an ordinary person in a court dress today.

236
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,480
Talking about talent,

237
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
I might go far behind all of you.

238
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,800
We're flattered, Your Highness.

239
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,940
You're the youngest generation of talents

240
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,860
of my Empire State of Tianqi.

241
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,800
The future of the state

242
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,860
is decided

243
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,260
more by you

244
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,260
than me.

245
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,340
The reason that I come here

246
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,460
isn't because of anything else

247
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,620
but to get close with everyone.

248
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,580
Everyone,

249
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,420
enjoy yourselves.

250
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,180
So will Your Highness.

251
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,340
Rise.

252
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,780
See,

253
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,220
our senior sisters and brothers are dancing so well.

254
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,900
I heard that you've been working on it for more than a month.

255
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,740
Are you kidding?

256
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,540
Of course not.

257
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,180
You mean, why is none of our classmates able

258
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,020
to dance on the stage?

259
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,860
There's one.

260
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,980
It's Cui Pianran.

261
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,540
Who is Cui Pianran?

262
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,060
She's Cui Pianran, isn't she?

263
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,740
This one?

264
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,060
Are you kidding? Can she dance?

265
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,140
Of course she can.

266
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,220
She's the best dancer of the Academy.

267
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:34,900
Is she?

268
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,780
Yep.

269
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,110
Schoolmate Cui.

270
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,550
Schoolmate Cui.

271
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,580
What?

272
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,460
I've heard you dancing skills are exquisite.

273
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,340
Am I honored to

274
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,000
see your excellent dance?

275
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,740
Yeah.

276
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,460
We are here to see you dance.

277
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,220
Aren't we?

278
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,110
Dance for us.

279
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,910
Dance for us.

280
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,660
Dance for us.

281
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,500
Right. Right.

282
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,780
Forget it. Forget it.

283
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,500
I won't dance today.

284
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,120
Why? Dance for us.

285
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,050
Schoolmate Cui,

286
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,880
you're a vision with exquisite dancing skills.

287
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,040
You should dance on the stage on behalf of us.

288
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,800
Dance for us.

289
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,120
Yeah. Dance for us.

290
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,400
We all want to see.

291
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,600
Dance for us, please.

292
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,180
Okay.

293
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,220
It's fine.

294
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,300
Since you insist on it,

295
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,540
I will show you.

296
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,300
Great. Great.

297
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,940
Great. Great. Great.

298
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,060
Great. Great.

299
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,300
Great. Great.

300
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,380
Bravo.

301
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:11,940
Bravo.

302
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,300
Bravo. Bravo.

303
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,820
Bravo. Bravo.

304
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,500
Bravo.

305
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,860
Bravo. Bravo.

306
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,220
Bravo.

307
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,980
You deserve the reputations.

308
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,900
Of course.

309
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,900
Miss Cui,

310
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,740
you do amaze us.

311
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

312
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,520
Your Highness,

313
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,270
I've heard Su Youlian, Schoolmate Cui

314
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,020
comes from a frontier city,

315
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,940
but she's expert in singing and dancing.

316
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,940
Could you please allow Su Youlian to dance on the stage

317
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,140
to amaze us?

318
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,580
I can't.

319
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,900
I'm not the best dancer in our city.

320
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,140
Forget it.

321
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,500
Why?

322
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,460
That you refuse to perform

323
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,220
is because you despise your schoolmates

324
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,260
or you don't respect His Highness at all?

325
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:30,660
Yep. Yep.

326
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,820
Have a dance. Have a dance.

327
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,560
Have a dance. Have a dance.

328
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,280
Have a dance. Have a dance.

329
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,220
Have a dance. Dance for us.

330
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,620
You…

331
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,460
Since Miss Cui has mentioned me,

332
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,980
you will show me some respect, won't you?

333
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,820
I…

334
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,830
Forget it. She's so scared.

335
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,230
Don't push her too hard.

336
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,340
Who said I'm scared?

337
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,160
Great. Great.

338
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,180
Great. Great. Great.

339
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,180
She has the nerve.

340
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,040
Great.

341
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,460
Great.

342
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,460
Bravo.

343
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,220
Youlian is dancing so well.

344
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,960
Not exactly.

345
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,820
Just some insignificant skills.

346
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,360
Pianran,

347
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,140
how do you know

348
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,400
that girl can dance so well?

349
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,620
Great. Perfect.

350
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,860
Bravo.

351
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,180
Perfect.

352
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,880
She's dancing so well.

353
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,100
Bravo.

354
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,140
Bravo. Bravo.

355
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,020
Bravo.

356
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,420
Bravo. Bravo.

357
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,020
Bravo. Bravo.

358
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,980
Sister, what are you gonna do?

359
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,859
Move away.

360
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,099
You can dance so well, can't you?

361
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:18,300
I'll wait and see whether you can follow the Lingyun Song.

362
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,760
It's…

363
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,120
Perfect. She's dancing so well.

364
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,580
Why do I feel so familiar with the dance?

365
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,220
Why does it remind me of this?

366
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,180
Is it my illusion?

367
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,380
Bravo. Bravo.

368
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,700
It's said that with only one drum missed of the song,

369
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,430
the whole dance will be ruined.

370
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,300
Su Youlian can make it without any mistake.

371
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,140
Bravo.

372
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,000
Bravo. Bravo. Perfect dance.

373
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,180
Bravo. Bravo.

374
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,580
It's awesome. Great.

375
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,240
She dances so great. Perfect.

376
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,300
Schoolmate Cui, why are you leaving?

377
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,040
Sister, where are you going?

378
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,970
Schoolmate Cui.

379
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,580
Youlian, you dance so well.

380
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,580
Cui Pianran wanted to see you make fool of yourself.

381
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,380
She hasn't expected you hit the stage.

382
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,660
She got so furious.

383
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,820
Miss Su, you dance

384
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,110
was quite beautiful

385
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,940
Your Highness.

386
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,380
The Lingyun Song…

387
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,440
Are you bewitched?

388
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,740
You've been staring at Su Youlian,

389
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,200
since she finished dancing.

390
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,360
Idiot.

391
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,960
I'm looking at that incompetent crown prince.

392
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,900
Are you?

393
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,100
Of course.

394
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,470
I'm going to the loo.

395
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,340
Well, Miss Su,

396
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,140
I propose a toast to you.

397
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

398
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,550
I'm flattered, Your Highness.

399
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,990
Enjoy yourself.

400
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,580
Who?

401
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,070
Who is doing it to me?

402
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,620
Who?

403
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Who is it?

404
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,140
Taking advantage of one

405
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,000
isn't what a gentleman should do.

406
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,080
Unfasten the rope.

407
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,510
Who takes the advantage of my negligence?

408
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,200
It's you, the Crown Prince, isn't it?

409
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,340
Do you think

410
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,500
you can trap me

411
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,480
with a jute bag like it?

412
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,740
Changqing.

413
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,220
Changqing.

414
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,340
Changqing.

415
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,820
Changqing.

416
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,820
Li Xuan,

417
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,940
you'll be dead today anyhow.

418
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,340
Changqing, why are you hiding behind?

419
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,300
Why not take action now?

420
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,500
It's…it's…

421
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,860
To tell you the truth,

422
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,220
the ten-year term of the curse is about to expire.

423
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,300
If you kill me, the Nation-protecting Master,

424
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,140
can you take the responsibility

425
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,520
when the Dragon Emperor wakes up?

426
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,480
Do such a jerk like you qualify for being a Nation-protecting Master?

427
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,350
To be honest,

428
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,070
I'm burying you here to get rid of the evil for the people.

429
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,620
Work harder.

430
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,340
Do it faster.

431
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,220
I can't pick up a toe-to-toe fight with the crown prince.

432
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,620
You're saying so many words when you're about to die.

433
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,660
Come to punch me.

434
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,940
Do you wanna cry?

435
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,600
Weren't you being uncompromising just now?

436
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,380
I wanna cry for you.

437
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,110
Are you out of your mind?

438
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,940
You're being buried instead of me.

439
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,470
Why do you have to cry for me?

440
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,900
Nothing.

441
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,380
I suddenly remember the second prince is about to return to the Qingtian City.

442
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,380
If you kill me in anger,

443
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,620
you might be convicted of

444
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,680
murdering a Nation-protecting Master by His Majesty.

445
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,300
I'm fine with it.

446
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,220
But

447
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,680
the second prince will be able to take such a big advantage.

448
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,580
Let me analyze it for you.

449
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,700
The

450
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,020
death of me

451
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,580
doesn't matter,

452
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,980
but yours matters.

453
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,940
You're the crown prince.

454
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,340
You can't make any mistake,

455
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,060
not a one.

456
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,900
Or half of one.

457
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,020
He's right.

458
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,980
Now, the second brother is about to return to the imperial palace suddenly.

459
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,180
He must return for being a crown prince.

460
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,860
He might have already sent someone to watch me.

461
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,080
Your Highness.

462
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,740
Who?

463
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,340
Changqing.

464
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,900
Miss Su,

465
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,420
why do you come here?

466
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,280
Your Highness.

467
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,270
What do you want?

468
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,220
I'm here to notify you

469
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,620
most of the guests have left at the moment.

470
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,620
The Academy is about to set up a ward,

471
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,020
and any outsider isn't allowed to go in and out.

472
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,740
So

473
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,100
I suggest you should

474
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,900
leave with you guards first.

475
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,780
Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.

476
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,460
I go back before the ward is set up every day.

477
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,040
Otherwise, I'm a dead man.

478
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,110
There's a rule like this, isn't there?

479
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,920
Have you… done enough?

480
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,300
You're… you're…

481
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,620
His Highness is talking.

482
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,480
You should show him some respect.

483
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,780
Li Xuan,

484
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,220
I'll let you go

485
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,260
this time.

486
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,540
Next time,

487
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,100
if I catch you again,

488
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,780
you won't be as lucky as this time.

489
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,380
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

490
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,180
Are you clear?

491
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,260
I'm clear. I'm clear. I'm clear.

492
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,660
I'm clear. I'm clear.

493
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,020
Let's go.

494
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,680
Take your time.

495
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,230
I'll invite you for tea some other day.

496
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,750
We should care for our own business later.

497
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,120
What are you doing?

498
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,460
Haven't you heard me?

499
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,060
Have you forgotten

500
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,940
when you were in the wardrobe last time,

501
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,740
it's I who saved you out?

502
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,830
You're requiting kindness with enmity, aren't you?

503
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,700
It's me.

504
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,180
It's me.

505
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,060
You're killing me.

506
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,350
Are you out of your mind?

507
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,960
I'll shout out.

508
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,580
Help.

509
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,060
Someone, help.

510
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,660
Help.

511
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,100
Keep shouting.

512
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,100
All the people have gone back to dorms.

513
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,300
No one is gonna help you out, even if you shout loud enough.

514
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,380
Loud enough.

515
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,300
Loud enough.

516
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,180
Loud enough.

517
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,140
Help.

518
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,140
It's fine. It's been solid enough.

519
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,670
It has. Stop stepping on it.

520
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,420
How can you release me?

521
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,660
You want me to release you,

522
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,900
which is negotiable.

523
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,960
Give me your number one token.

524
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,620
My number one token?

525
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,060
My number one token?

526
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,180
You…you've almost driven me crazy.

527
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,660
You want the number one token, but why wouldn't you have requested me earlier?

528
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,660
What do you mean?

529
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,430
You merely want a number one token from me.

530
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,260
It's nothing.

531
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,100
You ask for it,

532
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,860
and I'll give it to you.

533
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,260
Do you have to do all this?

534
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,160
I can give it to you now.

535
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,220
Nope.

536
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,740
The number one token is hung on my waist belt.

537
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,500
I'm not able to take it out now.

538
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,820
Or else,

539
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,380
you release me first,

540
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,910
and then I'll give you the token. Okay?

541
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,860
The token is really on your waist belt?

542
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,140
You're not lying to me, Li Xuan?

543
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,340
When do I lie to anyone?

544
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,460
I've never lie to someone.

545
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,420
Dig me out, if you don't trust me.

546
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,340
What else are you doing?

547
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,980
Do you think I'm a fool?

548
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,740
I'm waiting here.

549
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,740
You're gonna die

550
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,340
out of breath

551
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,500
in an hour.

552
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,300
Then I'll dig you out

553
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,940
and take the token away.

554
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,140
That will be perfect.

555
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,940
You're too naïve.

556
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,980
Do you think I'm that silly?

557
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,060
To be honest,

558
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,820
such an important thing like the number one token,

559
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,420
how could I take it with me randomly?

560
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,980
I've hidden it in a secret place

561
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,740
where no one in the world would know except me.

562
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,180
Li Xuan,

563
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,580
tell me where the token is,

564
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,980
and I'll release you.

565
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,540
You release me first,

566
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,020
and I'll tell you where the number one token is.

567
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,460
Li Xuan, if you don't tell me now,

568
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,620
you'll wait for death here.

569
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,750
Okay. I'll tell you.

570
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,780
The token is…

571
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,270
You're awesome.

572
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,860
I put the token…

573
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,580
It's in…

574
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,110
You're awesome.

575
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,900
The token…

576
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,380
The token…

577
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,020
The token…

578
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,780
You're awesome.

579
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,460
Where is the token?

580
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,460
Li Xuan.

581
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,780
You…

582
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,700
you don't play the trick on me.

583
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,100
You're lying to me again.

584
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,380
Li Xuan.

585
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,680
What should I do? What should I do?

586
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,760
He shouldn't have choked, should he?

587
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,460
If he died for real,

588
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,300
no one would know where the token is.

589
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,660
Well,

590
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,100
I remember my master has said before

591
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,100
that artificial respiration

592
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,790
could save someone of sudden cardiac arrest.

593
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,740
What are you doing?

594
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,420
You woke up.

595
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,140
It works.

596
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,820
Were you kissing me secretly?

597
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,620
You were kissing me secretly.

598
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,340
I…

599
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,820
I wasn't

600
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,590
Stop your nonsense.

601
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,739
It's because…

602
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,219
When you were talking,

603
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,420
you suddenly choked.

604
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,739
You stopped talking to me.

605
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,699
So…so…

606
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,980
So you should save your nonsense.

607
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,820
I was not

608
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,179
Are…are you clear?

609
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,139
Yeah.

610
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,300
You were kissing me secretly.

611
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,219
I wasn't.

612
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,540
I understand.

613
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,060
I don't blame you.

614
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:44,659
It's my fault.

615
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,960
Someone who is as handsome

616
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,100
and talented as me

617
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,780
will inevitably attract someone like you.

618
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,860
I totally understand.

619
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,340
It's okay. You can

620
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,960
take advantage of me when I'm too weak

621
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,340
and exhausted

622
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,780
to fight against you.

623
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,660
Do it,

624
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,220
as you want.

625
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,420
You jerk, Li Xuan.

626
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,820
What a jerk!

627
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:31,900
I…

628
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,780
The token.

629
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,860
I'm cheated by him again.

630
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,340
Don't be lazy.

631
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,660
Follow me.

632
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,220
I think

633
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,220
that's it.

634
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,020
Boss…boss is coming.

635
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,380
Come on. Let's go.

636
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,860
Youlian, this way.

637
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,190
This seat is available.

638
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,020
Boss.

639
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,060
Boss.

640
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,940
Xiao Fengming,

641
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,380
haven't I told you to keep away from me

642
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,620
for more than fifteen meters?

643
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,740
But it's the place closest to the outside.

644
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,300
Then you can sit outside.

645
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,300
Boss.

646
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,220
Boss.

647
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,490
Don't call me this way in the Academy later.

648
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,690
Go back to your seats.

649
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,410
Okay, Boss.

650
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,100
Okay, Boss.

651
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,300
Go.

652
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,760
Why hasn't Li Xuan come today?

653
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,660
Youlian,

654
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,220
what dance did you perform yesterday?

655
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,380
It looked pretty.

656
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,180
It did.

657
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,620
Young Master,

658
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,380
do you really wanna provoke the crown prince?

659
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,860
We can have another crown prince,

660
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,590
but there's only one nation-protecting master.

661
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,580
Why are you looking at me?

662
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,980
Why are you looking at me?

663
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,100
Go back. Go back.

664
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,300
Stop it.

665
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
Give me the token.

666
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,300
The token?

667
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,460
What token?

668
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,420
You had made a deal yesterday.

669
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,080
I let you go,

670
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,910
and you would give me the token.

671
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,300
If you hadn't mentioned it, I wouldn't have remembered.

672
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,100
You almost buried me last night.

673
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,940
You…

674
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,300
Yesterday night?

675
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,700
Was there anything that I don't know happening yesterday night?

676
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,960
It's too interesting.

677
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,880
Yesterday night, she almost did…

678
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,540
You're a jerk.

679
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,430
Stand up.

680
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,380
Classmate Li,

681
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,860
it's my seat.

682
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,700
I…

683
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,180
…I get it. I'm leaving.

684
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,860
What a bully!

685
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,380
What are you doing?

686
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:51,980
What?

687
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,500
I didn't do it on purpose.

688
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:07,820
You.

689
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,620
I did it on purpose this time.

690
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,740
You're boring.

691
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,940
The mentor is coming.

692
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,740
Bow to you, Mentor.

693
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,180
Sit down, please.

694
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,140
I'm your professor of national history,

695
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,540
Mentor Xuan Ming.

696
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,820
Today,

697
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,760
I'll talk about the big battle

698
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,440
that happened when the state was founded to you.

699
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,740
Look at it.

700
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,300
In the first year of the State of Tianqi,

701
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,740
there was a big battle between the Kunwu clan and human clan

702
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,140
in the Fengwei Valley.

703
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,800
Over a long period,

704
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,500
the Kunwu clan had ridden roughshod over our human clan.

705
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,540
Besides, the Dragon Emperor of Kunwu was being cruel and violent,

706
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,940
which made our Clan of Human Being live in an abyss of misery.

707
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,260
On the battlefield in the Fengwei Valley,

708
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,390
facing with the cruel Dragon Emperor,

709
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,460
troops of our clan were courageous.

710
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,060
the battle remained deadlocked

711
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,700
due to the inherent spiritual power of the Dragon Emperor, Shi Xingyu.

712
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,980
Later, Lord Zi used his spiritual power to set up a formation.

713
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,980
In the formation,

714
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,820
Lord Zi attacked the Dragon Emperor

715
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,460
by soil, fire and thunder.

716
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,780
Right at the last attack of Lord Zi,

717
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,980
Jiu Ling'er, the Saintess of Kunwu,

718
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,980
transformed to an iced cocoon to protect the Dragon Emperor.
