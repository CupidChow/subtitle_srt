1
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,860
Dance of the sky Empire

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,860
Episode 7

3
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,940
It's almost dawn.

4
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,660
These kids haven't come back yet.

5
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,260
The omens for them aren't good.

6
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,900
I shouldn't have asked them to catch the Qilin.

7
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,800
I have to report to Lord Zi.

8
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,940
Okay.

9
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,620
It's them.

10
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,180
They're coming back.

11
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,020
Mentor, they're coming back.

12
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,820
I'm badly hurt.

13
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,860
The old Qilin is too harsh.

14
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,980
It's done too much.

15
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,700
See how it has badly hurt our Changqing.

16
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,740
Do it gently.

17
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,019
It hurts.

18
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,829
I can't bear it anymore.

19
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,500
Is my face disfigured?

20
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,300
What are you doing?

21
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,180
You can't leave me alone, since I'm badly hurt.

22
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,659
Shall I invite an imperial physician?

23
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:36,180
Xuanxuan, my face is disfigured, isn't it?

24
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,409
Xuanxuan, are you okay?

25
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,020
You're like a monster.

26
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,140
You've fought against that old Qilin quite fiercely,

27
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,460
but now you're almost healed.

28
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,100
What I'm thinking about

29
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,040
is that who's the person appeared yesterday night.

30
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,540
Mentor in Chief Xie.

31
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,660
Mentor in Chief, who is he?

32
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,500
Let me introduce him.

33
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,940
He's Prince Mu from the State of Sha.

34
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,460
You're schoolmates from now.

35
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,980
Batou,

36
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,060
It's the specially-made vulnerary of our State of Sha,

37
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,020
which is especially effective for the wounds caused by ancient mythical creatures.

38
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,540
You can have a try, if you don't mind.

39
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,659
Thank you.

40
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,830
You're welcome.

41
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,580
You can call me A'mu.

42
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,880
You've made an achievement for catching the Qilin.

43
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,710
I'll report to the emperor of the State of Tianqi.

44
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,260
You haven't let Lord Zi down.

45
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,740
And you deserve to be a Nation-protecting Master.

46
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,780
Stop.

47
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,260
It has nothing to do with the position of Nation-protecting Master.

48
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,920
It's I who released the Qilin,

49
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,540
so I'm supposed to lock it back.

50
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,420
No matter what you did it for,

51
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,380
anyway,

52
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,990
as your Mentor in Chief,

53
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,660
what you've done today has greatly satisfied me.

54
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,500
I know you're badly hurt.

55
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,870
I won't disturb you any longer.

56
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,180
Mentor in Chief.

57
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,420
Please introduce me to Yunshan

58
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,659
as well as Miss Su.

59
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,780
You wanna see Su Youlian?

60
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,900
I happened to meet Miss Su once several days ago.

61
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,030
We promised to meet in the Academy.

62
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,740
Mentor in Chief Xie is quite busy.

63
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,260
So I'll lead you the way.

64
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,220
Thank you.

65
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,060
Youlian, do you wake up?

66
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,140
Yeah. Come in.

67
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,860
Youlian,

68
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,820
It's the vulnerary I bring you

69
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,740
from home.

70
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,980
Don't worry about me.

71
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,310
You're also badly hurt.

72
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,900
You should keep it for yourself.

73
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,460
I'll be fine after a few days of rest.

74
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,220
I'm fine.

75
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,380
Your wound is severer than mine.

76
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,740
You'd better apply it.

77
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,100
It was too dangerous yesterday.

78
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,420
I thought we would have died there.

79
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,540
I haven't expected Li Xuan

80
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,380
looks dandiacal and absurd at ordinary times,

81
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:59,420
but he valued feelings and was loyal to friends at the crucial moment.

82
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,140
And he dared to step forward bravely.

83
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,200
Through the thing,

84
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,320
I do change my attitudes towards him.

85
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,460
I'll kill you.

86
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,660
Well,

87
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,600
thanks to that capable person

88
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,420
who appeared in a sudden,

89
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,460
we could finally subjugate the Qilin with his help.

90
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,620
I get it.

91
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,300
You snore, grind your teeth

92
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,980
and talk in your sleep, don't you?

93
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,700
Say it out loud, if you like me.

94
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,900
You don't have to touch me all over my body.

95
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,100
You can do it gently.

96
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,700
Don't look at it.

97
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,200
It's good for your wounds.

98
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,060
Yeah.

99
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,380
Why was he so different from what he usually looks like?

100
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,620
You mean, who on earth was that capable person?

101
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,460
Youlian.

102
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,540
Youlian.

103
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,820
I'm asking you the question.

104
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,910
What did you ask me just now?

105
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,300
I said who was the one appeared yesterday night.

106
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:22,940
Miss Su.

107
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,100
It's you. Why do you come here?

108
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,340
I'm here to visit you.

109
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,780
But every time I meet you, you're injured.

110
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,480
How are you?

111
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
How are the wound?

112
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,740
I'm fine. It's just an injury.

113
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,640
Last time, you said

114
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,820
we would meet soon.

115
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,540
It's true.

116
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,380
I'll also be a student in the Moyun Ancient Academy.

117
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,340
I hope you could take good care of me.

118
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,270
Are you kidding?

119
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,380
Could you have classes with us?

120
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,460
Look at you,

121
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,060
you've talked too much while your wound isn't healed.

122
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,060
What about you?

123
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,180
How is your wound?

124
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:02,940
Mine?

125
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,310
How could an insignificant Qilin hurt me?

126
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,980
Childe,

127
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,780
thanks to you yesterday night,

128
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,700
we could subjugate the Qilin.

129
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,950
I haven't known your name, Childe.

130
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,660
It's the best panacea for an injury made by my master.

131
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,700
I haven't taken it myself.

132
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,500
I give you all.

133
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,140
Could I know your name?

134
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,940
There're only a few pills left.

135
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,060
I'm Yu Fengmu.

136
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,740
You give all to me?

137
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,380
I'm the elder brother of Yunshan.

138
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,300
You're the prince of the State of Sha.

139
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,180
Exactly.

140
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,740
I'm bowing to you, Prince Mu. -Take it.

141
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,220
Okay.

142
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,190
You don't bother to do that.

143
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,740
How is Yunshan?

144
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,140
I'm about to check on her.

145
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,420
Then I'll go with you.

146
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,090
Come in.

147
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,940
Lady Yunshan.

148
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,320
You don't have to move.

149
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,580
Lady Yunshan.

150
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,860
I'm seriously injured,

151
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,140
so I'm not able to keep away from you.

152
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,780
Please forgive me.

153
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,660
I have no idea

154
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,140
why you come here.

155
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,300
You're a nerd.

156
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,820
I…

157
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,380
…I made it for you.

158
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,740
You can

159
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,420
have a taste later.

160
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,020
Well,

161
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,580
both his hands and legs are injured.

162
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,860
How could he eat it?

163
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,150
It's the first time I've made the soup.

164
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,500
I have no idea how it tastes.

165
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,460
Lady, you don't have to do it. Lady, you don't have to do it.

166
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,220
I don't deserve it.

167
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,140
I don't deserve it.

168
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,700
Why don't you deserve?

169
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,790
Open your mouth.

170
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,300
Did I hurt you?

171
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,260
Not exactly.

172
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,220
Does it taste good?

173
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,500
Yeah, yes, it is.

174
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,860
What on earth is it?

175
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,180
It tastes strange.

176
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,640
Then you should have more.

177
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,820
More?

178
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,340
Thank you, Lady.

179
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,780
What do you thank me for?

180
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,380
I'm the one who should say thank you.

181
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,900
If it hadn't been you who saved me yesterday night,

182
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,180
I would have already become a pile of bones.

183
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Nope. Nope. Nope.

184
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,400
You don't have to thank me.

185
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,780
If it was someone else yesterday night,

186
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,900
I would do the same thing.

187
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,460
Xiao Fengming.

188
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,060
Lady Yunshan.

189
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,300
Did…

190
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,260
…did I say anything wrong?

191
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,340
Brother.

192
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,220
You're back.

193
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,580
I'm a big girl.

194
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,920
I'm bowing to you, Your Highness.

195
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,900
Batou,

196
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,900
you seem to have had a good time recently.

197
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,630
You've got pretty much weight.

198
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,580
Your Highness is making fun of me again.

199
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,240
Okay. Don't make fun of Batou.

200
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,180
How are you?

201
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,180
How is your wound?

202
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,020
Have you applied the vulnerary?

203
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,100
Since we have the specially-made vulnerary of our State of Sha,

204
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,560
the wound isn't a big deal.

205
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,260
Brother,

206
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,940
why do you come here so late?

207
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,000
I've been waiting for you for so long.

208
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,380
You're…

209
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,460
I think you're getting bolder and bolder.

210
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,340
Just because you don't satisfy

211
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,860
the marriage that father arranged for you,

212
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,190
you dare to flee to Tianqi without notice.

213
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,220
I won't marry to that

214
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,420
arrogant and incapable man.

215
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,420
Then what kind of man does our little princess

216
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,220
wanna marry to?

217
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,060
I wanna marry to someone who is a hero of indomitable spirit.

218
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,260
Just like you.

219
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,980
I haven't seen you for a few days, while you become so sweet.

220
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,420
But I've heard

221
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,700
yesterday night,

222
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,500
there was one of your schoolmates

223
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,860
who went to save you regardless of his personal danger.

224
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,920
Can this kind of man be your Mr. Right?

225
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,660
I don't wanna marry to a nerd.

226
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,140
In the whole Academy,

227
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,480
I dislike him the most.

228
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,620
Lord Zi,

229
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,660
they got some injuries,

230
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,460
but they succeeded in catching the ancient Qilin.

231
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,380
As you said,

232
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,980
Li Xuan doesn't let you down.

233
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,780
That brat

234
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,339
can be counted as

235
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,670
having made some achievements for me.

236
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,420
Have you found out

237
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,819
what made the mess in the Qingtian City?

238
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,819
Not yet.

239
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,460
I'll keep investigating.

240
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,540
Tell everyone

241
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,980
to be more vigilant.

242
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,700
I've been having an uneasy sense of foreboding recently.

243
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,740
Sure.

244
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,180
Wake up.

245
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,190
Have you taken the pills I gave you?

246
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,220
Yep.

247
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,740
Why are you carrying two bags?

248
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,060
My sister failed to get up again.

249
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,360
She even asked me to finish her homework.

250
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,780
Homework?

251
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,940
Did the mentor assign homework yesterday?

252
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,660
Yeah.

253
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,540
During the days you were injured,

254
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,140
Mentor Xuanming has assigned lots of homework. (Li Xuan: this is my opportunity!)

255
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,620
Brother,

256
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,270
sit here.

257
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,070
I've remained the seat for you.

258
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,420
Good morning, Miss Su.

259
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,400
Good morning, Prince.

260
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,900
Prince Mu is so handsome.

261
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,700
Damned Yu Fengmu.

262
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,940
How dare he show off in front of me?

263
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,860
Brother.

264
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,780
Who can

265
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,820
answer the question?

266
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,380
Bian Lingcheng,

267
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,150
what are you taking?

268
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,420
I'm writing the answer of the question,

269
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,100
Mentor.

270
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,700
It means you've known the answer, haven't you?

271
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,620
Stand up.

272
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,700
Tell everyone your answer.

273
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,300
Come on.

274
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,860
An idiot like you,

275
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,680
I can deal with ten at one time.

276
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,860
One more time.

277
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,540
Men…Mentor.

278
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,670
I say, one more time.

279
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,660
An idiot like you,

280
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,580
I can deal with ten at one time.

281
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,820
You've pissed me off.

282
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,740
…you get out.

283
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,460
Yes.

284
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,380
Why do those words sound like they’re meant for me?

285
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,180
Get out.

286
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,980
In the entire Moyun Ancient Academy,

287
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,860
you don't follow the rules the most.

288
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,020
You're the worst students

289
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,460
I've ever met.

290
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,200
Mentor,

291
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,380
you're wrong if you say so.

292
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,110
If you say so,

293
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,820
you can keep your good student here

294
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,680
until he's old.

295
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,750
Li Xuan, you're…

296
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,140
It's my turn.

297
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,980
I'll get out.

298
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,420
Come back.

299
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,220
What are you gonna do?

300
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,300
What a loon!

301
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,980
What a loon he is!

302
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,180
It's her. It's her.

303
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,300
She's a coward.

304
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,260
It's her.

305
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,500
See. See.

306
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,940
It's her.

307
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,660
What a shame!

308
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,150
She looks like a coward.

309
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,700
What's going on?

310
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,220
Why are they talking about me?

311
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,620
If I tell you the truth, promise you won't get angry.

312
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,880
Because you didn't go to catch the Qilin,

313
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,500
they said you're a coward behind your back.

314
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,500
And you're…

315
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,980
Okay. Stop.

316
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
What the hell do they know?

317
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,040
How can a swallow know of the aims of a swan goose?

318
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,580
Coward. Coward. Coward. Coward.

319
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,260
You're…

320
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,510
Okay. Fine. Let's go to have the class.

321
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,220
He's pointing at me.

322
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,280
It's not a big deal.

323
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,820
Prince Mu, you're awesome.

324
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,950
I'm flattered, Miss Su.

325
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,100
Let me introduce myself officially.

326
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,960
I'm Su Youlian.

327
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,500
You can call me Youlian.

328
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,020
Youlian.

329
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,820
How is your wound?

330
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,310
It's healed.

331
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,540
That's great.

332
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,180
If you fell down when you were gathering herbs on the hill,

333
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,510
I wouldn't have a sedan chair to fetch you.

334
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,140
I feel shy.

335
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:43,980
Well,

336
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,180
you can go on to shoot.

337
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,910
Please go on.

338
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,100
Youlian.

339
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,200
Do you wanna have a try?

340
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,350
You wrist should act like this.

341
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,360
Keep your shoulders flat.

342
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,220
Adjust your hips.

343
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,440
Set your feet shoulder-width apart.

344
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,360
Maintain the posture.

345
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,940
Have a try.

346
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,420
I won't haggle with them.

347
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,020
Who is that man?

348
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,500
He's a newcomer,

349
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,960
the prince of the State of Sha, Yu Fengmu.

350
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,040
The prince of the State of Sha?

351
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,070
Let me have a look at him.

352
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,780
Is the one beside him Su Youlian?

353
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,900
Why do I feel

354
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,620
he's familiar with Su Youlian?

355
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,560
They seem to have known one another long before.

356
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,940
How brilliant Su Youlian is!

357
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,860
She's able to play her cards so well

358
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,920
that all the men are attracted by her.

359
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,110
Let's go.

360
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,480
Let's go check on them.

361
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,660
I…

362
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,360
Maintain the posture.

363
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,260
What a shame!

364
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,590
You're not able to hold the bow firmly.

365
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,140
Stay focused.

366
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,260
Look at the front.

367
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,740
Childe Mu,

368
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,380
I'm also your schoolmate.

369
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,310
I'm Cui Pianran.

370
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,580
Nice to meet you.

371
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,590
Nice to meet you too.

372
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,780
But…

373
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,380
Why do you…

374
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,120
Sister. -I…

375
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,980
You've disturbed us.

376
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,580
You…

377
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,740
Go on.

378
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,360
Good morning, Li Xuan.

379
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,620
I do envy of him.

380
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,100
It's so great to have a good-looking appearance.

381
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,030
All the girls are attracted by him.

382
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,700
I'm afraid Su Youlian

383
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,620
has been fascinated by Prince Mu.

384
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,520
Have you got it?

385
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,060
Sure.

386
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,980
When you're shooting, you have to breathe firmly,

387
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,190
keep your arms flat,

388
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,440
stare at the target

389
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,380
and stay focused.

390
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,060
One more try.

391
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,820
Li Xuan is awesome.

392
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,070
Li Xuan is awesome. Li Xuan is awesome.

393
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,590
The previous arrows were shot perfectly,

394
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:58,940
Prince Mu.

395
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,220
I'm leaving first.

396
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,780
Li Xuan,

397
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,420
why are you here?

398
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,800
You also come here to practice shooting.

399
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,480
I'm passing by.

400
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,740
Passing by?

401
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,700
Why are you holding the bow?

402
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,000
It doesn't matter.

403
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,860
Li Xuan,

404
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,980
are you alright?

405
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,620
What's wrong with him? He acted so strange.

406
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,020
Youlian,

407
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,700
how did Prince Mu and you

408
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,030
get to know one another?

409
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,760
You two seem to be so familiar.

410
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,180
Not exactly. We've just known one another.

411
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,340
He doesn't put on his prince airs at all.

412
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,580
And he's kind.

413
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,580
It's true. He's kind for sure.

414
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,900
You got to know him a few days ago.

415
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,700
How could you know he's kind?

416
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,980
He's really kind.

417
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,950
Well, how could you know it?

418
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,940
Has he carved the two words "good man" on his forehead?

419
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,020
Idiot.

420
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,740
Li Xuan, what's wrong with you?

421
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,300
Are you in a bad mood?

422
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,430
Why do you talk about him like this?

423
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,740
I'm not, Youlian.

424
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,980
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

425
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,580
Stop here.

426
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,270
In the class of archery,

427
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,100
men and women can form a team of two randomly.

428
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,660
Each one can shoot three times.

429
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,540
The one having the highest accumulated score

430
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,420
is the winner.

431
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,420
Let's start.

432
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,060
Go. Go. Go.

433
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,020
Let's start the practice right now. Go.

434
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,780
Let's form a team. Let's form a team.

435
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,460
Xuanxuan,

436
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,260
I'm sorry.

437
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,110
I'm leaving.

438
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,100
Wait for me.

439
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,980
Go. Let's go. Go. Hurry up.

440
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,640
Go. Come on.

441
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,990
I'm coming. I'm coming.

442
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,780
Go.

443
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,820
Well…

444
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,540
-Your shooting skills are terrible.

445
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,660
I have to ponder over

446
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,190
whether to team up with you.

447
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,220
Youlian,

448
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
let's form a team.

449
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,900
Haven't you seen I team up with her?

450
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,600
What you said makes sense.

451
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,100
My shooting skills are terrible.

452
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,020
You shouldn't be encumbered by me.

453
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,550
I'll bother you, Prince Mu.

454
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,110
Let's go over there.

455
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,660
Yunshan, Yunshan,

456
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,300
shall we form a team?

457
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,700
Well, please team up with me.

458
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,620
She's….she's…she's…

459
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:55,980
You…

460
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,700
Nerd.

461
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,200
Let's go. Move. Move. Move. Let's go.

462
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:09,980
Li Xuan,

463
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,460
shall we form a team?

464
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,120
I don't wanna team up with you.

465
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,340
Haven't you seen that

466
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,020
what Su Youlian cares about is him?

467
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,460
She doesn't care about you at all.

468
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,620
He's kind

469
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,780
while I'm not.

470
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,780
Don't disturb me.

471
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,150
There's no one left.

472
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,500
I'm your last choice.

473
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,910
Stop disturbing me.

474
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,860
Let's go.

475
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,940
We're a team.

476
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,140
Li Xuan.

477
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,020
Why are you looking at me?

478
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,180
Put up your arm

479
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,540
like this.

480
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,220
Have a try.

481
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,740
Nice shot.

482
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,980
Thank you, Prince Mu.

483
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,150
What do you thank me for?

484
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,060
You're a good man.

485
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,380
A good man.

486
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,100
There's nothing to be proud of. I can achieve it too.

487
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,420
Li Xuan, look at me.

488
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,500
Do it well.

489
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,620
Sure.

490
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,540
Why do I fall down?

491
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,230
What do you want?

492
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,580
There's a thing.

493
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,540
I can't stand up.

494
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,179
Help me.

495
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,900
Li Xuan.

496
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,699
Did I do it right?

497
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:31,699
Yeah. It's right.

498
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,540
One more time.

499
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,219
Sure.

500
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,219
Haven't you seen she doesn't care about you at all

501
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,739
but Childe Mu?

502
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,260
We did that

503
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,780
just now while she didn't care at all.

504
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:45,940
Go on to practice.

505
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,060
Damned Li Xuan.

506
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,740
Terrible Li Xuan.

507
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,740
What on earth happened to me?

508
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,260
Why do I feel so unpleasant when I saw him doing that?

509
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,900
Master.

510
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,420
Why do you look downhearted?

511
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,860
Do I?

512
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,620
I'm pretty good.

513
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,820
Now your wounds have been healed.

514
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,100
Why don't you take action?

515
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,580
I get it.

516
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,780
Feng Changqing,

517
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,780
has Li Xuan slept?

518
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,420
What are you gonna do?

519
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,500
Play with him.

520
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,660
Why?

521
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,300
You're not allowed to go inside.

522
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,100
Ain't I?

523
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
Is he doing… inside?

524
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,580
Then I must go inside.

525
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,860
Changqing,

526
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,160
what's wrong with you?

527
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,260
I said

528
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,700
you're not allowed to go inside.

529
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,540
You can just say it.

530
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,980
I won't go inside.

531
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,620
You're so annoying

532
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,540
Why do I come here?

533
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,540
I'm here for the token.

534
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,060
I'm…I'm so distracted.
