00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,860
Dance of the Sky Empire

3
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,860
Episode 19

4
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,320
Loong Wei'er.

5
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,440
Buddy.

6
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,130
Don't be mad at me, will you?

7
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,890
If you don't prefer it, I also have a plan b.

8
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,960
Do you mean going out of the city?

9
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,440
Exactly.

10
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,820
Do you think all the wonderful things are

11
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,200
in the city?

12
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,400
Okay. Let's go.

13
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,640
I do wanna go out.

14
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,400
Let's go.

15
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
We're kneeling down to you, Your Highness II.

16
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,680
We're kneeling down to you, Nation-protecting Master.

17
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,540
Your Highness,

18
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,700
do you intend to go out of the city?

19
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,280
Please, stop, Nation-protecting Master.

20
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,320
What's wrong?

21
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,400
It's not me.

22
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,640
They... they did it.

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,640
Report to you, Your Highness.

24
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,480
General Li and Lord Zi have given an order.

25
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,440
We can't disobey it.

26
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Nation-protecting Master is about to go out of the city for pleasure with me.

27
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,440
It'll merely take a few hours.

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,520
Let him go.

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,320
The word of His Highness II doesn't work,

30
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,760
does it?

31
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,360
It's fine.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,920
It won't work.

33
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,320
I'll celebrate your birthday in the Baihua House anyway.

34
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,160
Let's go.

35
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,880
Your Highness II, we hope you can live as long as God,

36
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,640
and have the happiness as immense as a sea.

37
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,240
Your Highness II, we hope you can live as long as God,

38
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,320
and have the happiness as immense as a sea.

39
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,120
Do you wanna stand in front of me and offer birthday congratulations?

40
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,760
Your Highness II, we hope you can live as long as God,

41
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,040
and have the happiness as immense as a sea.

42
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,280
Keep doing it.

43
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,540
I wanna hear it when I'm five kilometers away from here.

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,140
Your Highness II, we hope you can live as long as God,

45
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,160
and have the happiness as immense as a sea.

46
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,760
Your Highness II, we hope you can live as long as God,

47
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,040
and have the happiness as immense as a sea.

48
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,720
Your Highness II, we hope you can live as long as God,

49
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,680
and have the happiness as immense as a sea.

50
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,360
Your Highness II, we hope you can live as long as God,

51
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,200
and have the happiness as immense as a sea.

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,760
Your Highness II, we hope you can live as long as God,

53
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,360
and have the happiness as immense as a sea.

54
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,440
I finally make it.

55
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,680
Your Highness II, we hope you can live as long as God,

56
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,760
and have the happiness as immense as a sea.

57
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,200
Your Highness II, we hope you can live as long as God.

58
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,360
What are you doing?

59
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,520
Nothing.

60
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,560
Let's go.

61
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,640
Jinhuan Residence.

62
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,560
Is it your plan b?

63
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,480
Bring me here to drink liquor?

64
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,520
I'm telling you. Don't belittle the place.

65
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,180
You'll get to know how brilliant it actually is.

66
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,520
Please show your name card

67
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,560
You're a friend of Childe Bian.

68
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,480
Please, come in. Please, come in.

69
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,410
Come in, please.

70
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,000
Come in, please.

71
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,040
Five hundred taels.

72
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,840
Please, this way.

73
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,240
The auction has already started.

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,640
We keep the best place for you.

75
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,760
Six hundred taels.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,720
What does it mean?

77
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,450
Anyone else?

78
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,480
He's the boss of the Jinhuan Residence.

79
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,680
I've heard he's a well-informed source

80
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,160
who's able to get treasures all over the world.

81
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,560
And then he'll sell them out

82
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,720
at auction.

83
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,760
Usually, a higher bidder can get a treasure.

84
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,560
The reason that you bring me here

85
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,440
is to buy a treasure?

86
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,240
Certainly.

87
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,220
It's your birthday today.

88
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,040
I'll have to prepare a treasure for you

89
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,570
to show how much I value you.

90
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
Please, this way.

91
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,400
Have a seat and enjoy the auction.

92
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,360
Okay.

93
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,480
Deal.

94
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,960
Waiter.

95
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,320
I'm coming.

96
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,440
Come here to serve the tea.

97
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,120
Yes.

98
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,200
I'm leaving first.

99
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Everyone.

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,760
The sword is made by the exquisite swordsmith,

101
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,000
Zhao Yilang.

102
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,400
The material he used is the Tianwai Dark Steel,

103
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,920
which is extremely sharp.

104
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,840
There're five bright pearls and gems on the hilt.

105
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,560
It's a rare object for collection.

106
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,200
The base price is ten hundred taels.

107
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,600
You can start bidding.

108
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760
Fifteen hundred taels.

109
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,440
Eighteen hundred taels.

110
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,240
What about it?

111
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,640
Do you like it?

112
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,600
It fits you.

113
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,200
It's good, but...

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,600
Twenty-five hundred taels.

115
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,320
Deal.

116
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,400
What a gaud!

117
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,800
There're so many in the imperial palace.

118
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,400
Pass on it.

119
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,490
Next one. –Okay.

120
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,960
Next one.

121
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,100
A new one is coming.

122
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,000
The painting

123
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,800
was dug from the tomb of the nobility

124
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,200
of the previous dynasty.

125
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,920
It bore the seal of the famous painter,

126
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,120
Immortal Zhen.

127
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,360
It's great. It's great.

128
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,600
It's a rarity.

129
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,240
What's wrong with you?

130
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,400
Nope.

131
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,560
You don't like such a rarity, do you?

132
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
It's a genuine painting of Immortal Zhen.

133
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,920
See. How vividly the figure is painted!

134
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Isn't it good for you to learn?

135
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,880
Shut up.

136
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,730
Are you feeling shy?

137
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
It's okay.

138
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,040
Forty...forty hundred taels.

139
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,600
If you don't like it, we'll...

140
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,760
The first time for five thousand taels.

141
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,000
The second time for five thousand taels.

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,530
Five thousand taels. Deal.

143
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,480
Pass on it.

144
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,640
Let's...let's see the next one.

145
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,440
You show little appreciation of these things.

146
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,280
Boss,

147
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,040
do you have other rarities that are more precious?

148
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Of course.

149
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,560
Well, bring the next one.

150
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,840
He prefers something bizarre.

151
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,890
He did show little appreciation of these things.

152
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,080
Everyone,

153
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,000
the belt you're seeing now

154
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,960
is called Silver Moon Belt.

155
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,280
It's said that the previous owner of the belt

156
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,720
is Princess Qingsheng of the Clan of Kunwu,

157
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,640
who has been dead for many years.

158
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,700
How about this one?

159
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,680
In the battle of the Clan of Human Being and Kunwu that year,

160
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,040
Princess Qingsheng was killed by Lord Zi.

161
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,440
The one she wore then was the Silver Moon Belt.

162
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,760
The base price is fifty hundred taels.

163
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,890
The bidding starts.

164
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,540
Fifty-one hundred taels.

165
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,550
Fifty-two hundred taels.

166
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,150
Fifty-three hundred taels.

167
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,909
It's pretty good.

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,320
But it's for a lady. It doesn't fit you.

169
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,400
Why not?

170
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,400
You like the belt?

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,060
Are you kidding me?

172
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,200
It's for a lady.

173
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,640
Why can't I wear it?

174
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,680
Fifty-four hundred taels.

175
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,160
Fifty-four hundred taels.

176
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,560
Everyone, stop bidding.

177
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,920
Please give the belt to me.

178
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,120
I've married a beautiful

179
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,320
lady recently.

180
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,680
I'm wondering what I shall present to her.

181
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,340
The belt is a perfect present.

182
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,170
Fifty-five hundred taels.

183
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,520
Fifty-five hundred taels.

184
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,360
My wife is a vision.

185
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,360
The belt will fit her the most.

186
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,680
Fifty-six hundred taels.

187
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,240
It's not just you who have a wife.

188
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,320
I have one too.

189
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,120
My wife is more than a vision.

190
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,200
She is a beauty

191
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,800
of beauties.

192
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,160
Why won't you give it to me?

193
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,200
Fifty-seven hundred taels.

194
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,120
Sixty hundred taels.

195
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,760
Sixty-two hundred taels.

196
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,760
Sixty-five hundred taels.

197
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,800
I...

198
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,840
...bid ten thousand taels.

199
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,970
Ten thousand taels?

200
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,120
Master He has bid ten thousand taels.

201
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,920
Who else will bid a higher price?

202
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,410
Twenty thousand taels.

203
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,130
Twenty thousand taels?

204
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,620
This...

205
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,560
this childe has bid twenty thousand taels.

206
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,880
I'm wondering whether you'll present it

207
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,120
to your wife.

208
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Your wife is so lucky.

209
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,080
Of course.

210
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,000
My wife is perfect

211
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,400
except that

212
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,850
she looks like a man.

213
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,440
I hope you won't mind.

214
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,080
What a vision she is!

215
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,760
No wonder you'll spend

216
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,480
twenty thousand taels of gold to get it for her.

217
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,600
Gold?

218
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,450
The first time for twenty thousand taels of gold.

219
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:12,920
Nope.

220
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,210
I think he means silver.

221
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,520
I don't have gold with me.

222
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,080
Deal.

223
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,400
Twenty thousand taels of gold.

224
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,540
It equals all the wealth of my family.

225
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,000
Childe, congratulations.

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,120
The Silver Moon Belt belongs to you.

227
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,720
Have a look at it.

228
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,240
Is it worth twenty thousand taels of gold?

229
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,770
Thank you. I like it so much.

230
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,960
Nope.

231
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,720
Is it worthwhile?

232
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,920
No, it isn't. What a lame thing it is!

233
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,010
Even your mother won't wear it.

234
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,020
You don't wanna pay for it, do you?

235
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,800
Of course not.

236
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,660
Then you can go marry Cui Pianran.

237
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,380
I'll pay for it.

238
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,560
Childe, this is bank notes.

239
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,440
I'm a friend of Bian Lingcheng.

240
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,900
It's the advance payment.

241
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,520
Thank you.

242
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,040
I'm so satisfied with what you've prepared for my birthday.

243
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,600
Do you think it's all?

244
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,640
Have you made other arrangements?

245
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,920
Of course.

246
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,400
I'll let you witness

247
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,400
what the most splendid thing is in the world.

248
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,450
But before that,

249
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,140
I'll have to meet someone.

250
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,900
Shall I go with you?

251
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,920
Nope.

252
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm going to meet a friend.

253
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,280
It won't take long.

254
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,880
Will you leave me here?

255
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,920
Let's go.

256
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,520
It should be here.

257
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Wait for me here. I'll be back soon.

258
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,840
Are you Bai Xiaosheng?

259
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,780
You're here to inquire about the things of your mother.

260
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,920
Have a seat.

261
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,370
Do you know the things of my mother?

262
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,760
Who is she?

263
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,320
How did she die?

264
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,520
Why has my father never told me anything about her?

265
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,880
I can't tell you.

266
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,840
I can't.

267
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,170
I know everything that happened in the world,

268
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,600
but I can't tell you the things of your mother.

269
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Nope.

270
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,080
You have to tell me

271
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,040
everything about my mother today.

272
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,720
You can take the money and tell me the truth.

273
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,160
Or else...

274
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,400
It seems you won't let me go easily,

275
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
if I don't tell you anything.

276
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,640
But the secret can't be revealed.

277
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,400
I can't tell you details,

278
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,920
but I can tell you

279
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,800
where to find what you want.

280
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,760
Where?

281
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,680
Panlong Secret Realm.

282
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,940
Panlong Secret Realm?

283
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,800
Exactly.

284
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,120
There's a sword in the Secret Realm.

285
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,040
If you're able to pull it out,

286
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,440
you'll get

287
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,840
what you want.

288
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,840
Have you finished?

289
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,760
Yes...yes, I have.

290
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,280
Have you just said

291
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,240
to lead me to see what the most splendid thing is in the world?

292
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,040
Let's go.

293
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,040
Go.

294
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,320
Childe,

295
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,660
what you've asked me to do is done.

296
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,890
It's obvious that the guy has believed what I said to him.

297
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,840
Well done.

298
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,560
It's the Quhuang Powder

299
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,760
owned only by the imperial household of the State of Sha,

300
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,420
which can heal your phthisis.

301
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,970
Childe, thanks for saving my life.

302
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,930
You don't have to blame yourself too much.

303
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,850
If you don't do this,

304
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,680
you'll never be able to save the one you want.

305
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,720
I know.

306
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,640
As long as

307
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,920
I make this decision,

308
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,400
I'll never go back to where I am.

309
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,760
Actually,

310
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,280
you have no other option at the very beginning.

311
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,880
Li Xuan,

312
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,480
I'm sorry.

313
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,960
Xiao Fengming,

314
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,780
why you asked me out is that

315
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,200
you have something to tell me, isn't it?

316
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,320
We've been walking around for quite long.

317
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,720
And my feet hurt.

318
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,970
What on earth do you want to tell me?

319
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,320
It's on sale.

320
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,760
Have a look at sachets and accessories.

321
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,240
Look at these little things.

322
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,400
Princess Yunshan, I wanna tell you.

323
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,800
Let's walk around first.

324
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,310
Why?

325
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,280
Thank you.

326
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,369
Please enjoy it.

327
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,849
Hold on, please.

328
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,840
Xiao Fengming,

329
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,480
can't you see clearly?

330
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,200
It's bright.

331
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,520
Why do you light up a candle?

332
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,840
I heard from someone that

333
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,600
lighting up a candle when having a meal will...

334
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,930
help enjoy the meal.

335
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,460
Have a taste, if you don't believe me.

336
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
How does it taste?

337
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,400
Xiao Fengming,

338
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,760
what on earth do you wanna talk to me?

339
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,920
I...I'm starving.

340
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,960
I'll eat the noodles first.

341
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,810
You've finished, haven't you?

342
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,120
Yeah.

343
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,720
Then...

344
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm still starving.

345
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,840
I want one more bowl.

346
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,680
I'll tell you when I'm full.

347
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,480
Boss,

348
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,520
I want one more bowl of noodles.

349
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,320
Okay.

350
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,760
You're supposed to be full now, aren't you?

351
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm full.

352
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,600
I'm not hungry.

353
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,040
I...

354
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,680
I...

355
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,440
I...

356
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,560
Princess Yunshan,

357
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,840
do you like to let off fireworks when you're in the State of Sha?

358
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,560
Of course.

359
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,220
My brother used to set off fireworks with me.

360
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,970
But I haven't let off fireworks

361
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,940
when I came to the State of Tianqi.

362
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,160
That's fine.

363
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
I'll buy all of them.

364
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,200
Okay.

365
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,060
Xiao Fengming,

366
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,360
are you out of your mind?

367
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,000
That's your board expenses of a year.

368
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,720
So what?

369
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,560
You said you like fireworks, don't you?

370
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,440
Not to mention the board expenses of a year,

371
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,560
even if they cost me that of ten years, I'll buy them for you.

372
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,960
Xiao Fengming is out of his mind.

373
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,520
But he looks so cool now.

374
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,160
Here you are.

375
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,520
I said just now I want these and those.

376
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,880
I want them all.

377
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,120
The money you paid

378
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,880
can only afford these.

379
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,820
It's so much money.

380
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,210
That's all I can buy?

381
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,920
Today, there's someone

382
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,080
who has bought almost

383
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,940
all the fireworks in the city.

384
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,600
So my hoard of fireworks is the rare commodity.

385
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,720
Do you want it?

386
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,720
Of course.

387
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,500
You seem to be preoccupied by some troubles.

388
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,320
Do you get the answers

389
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,920
to what you wanna know

390
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,440
from Bai Xiaosheng?

391
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,140
I haven't got the answers,

392
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,600
but I kinda have got some clues.

393
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
If you don't mind,

394
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,560
you can talk about it with me.

395
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,680
Forget it.

396
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,240
You won't understand, even if I tell you it.

397
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,280
Don't blame me for not reminding you in advance.

398
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,800
Those who have the name of Bai Xiaosheng

399
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,560
tend to be swindlers.

400
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,000
You'd better not trust him.

401
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,280
Those princes who live in the imperial palace like you are too tired,

402
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,740
because all that you always think about is to deceive and blackmail one another.

403
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,140
Why do you stand still?

404
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,240
Here we are.

405
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,720
Where?

406
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,840
Go upstairs.

407
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,000
Li Xuan,

408
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,080
they look good.

409
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,080
But

410
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,520
I've got them in the imperial palace.

411
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,200
Thank you anyway.

412
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,880
Well,

413
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,080
I don't ask you to have a look at them.

414
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,080
I want you to look at this.

415
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,040
Yunshan,

416
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,160
do they look beautiful?

417
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,840
Yep.

418
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,960
What on earth do you wanna talk to me?

419
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,040
Yunshan,

420
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,800
I wanna tell you

421
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,680
I like you.

422
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,080
I like you.

423
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,240
I like you.

424
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,160
What did you say just now?

425
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,360
I haven't heard you.

426
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,200
I...

427
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,240
Why does Loong Wei'er look like a girl?

428
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,720
How about it?

429
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,730
You haven't seen it in the imperial palace, have you?

430
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,040
Youlian,

431
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,960
I propose a toast to you.

432
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,560
I wish you would save the Dragon Emperor out successfully

433
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,020
and save the Clan of Kunwu.

434
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,920
Boss.

435
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,060
You're coming, Nation-protecting Master.

436
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,000
Welcome you, Your Highness II.

437
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,680
Where is the private room I've reserved?

438
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,600
Rest assured.

439
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,920
I've already prepared

440
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,520
the private room for you.

441
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,880
This way, please.

442
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,480
Follow me.

443
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,760
Two distinguished guests are coming.

444
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,000
The superior private room is ready.

445
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,320
I'll definitely try my utmost to accomplish

446
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,280
what you've asked.

447
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,680
The private room is here. This way.

448
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,250
What a coincidence!

449
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,610
Both of you are here.

450
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,040
I...

451
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,050
We heard the liquor here

452
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,080
tastes good.

453
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,560
So we specially come here to have a try.

454
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,440
Do you?

455
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,000
Look at you.

456
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,920
I mean, why don't you

457
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,580
ask us to enjoy the liquor with you together?

458
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,280
It's the Huadiao Wine, isn't it?

459
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,810
It does taste great.

460
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,560
Why do you stand still there?

461
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Come here. Enjoy the wine together.

462
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,800
Will we disturb you two?

463
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,360
Of course not.

464
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,600
Haven't you seen how boring they are?

465
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,320
Hurry and come here.

466
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
We'll have more fun with more people.

467
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Will we?

468
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,960
Childe Li

469
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,370
and His Highness II,

470
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,120
it'll definitely be better for us to enjoy the wine together.

471
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:55,960
Boss.

472
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,680
I'm coming.

473
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,320
Bring me another ten jars of Huadiao Wine.

474
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,440
And deliver all of

475
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,940
your best dishes here.

476
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,880
Okay.

477
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,680
I'll deliver them right now.

478
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,000
Ten jars of superior quality Huadiao Wine.

479
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,260
Why do you stand still?

480
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,880
Come here.

481
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,160
Come on.

482
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,010
Let's have a shot together.

483
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,680
Cheers.

484
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,880
Did you see it just now?

485
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,040
What?

486
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,200
The fireworks.

487
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,680
I've let off so many fireworks.

488
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,810
Don't tell me you've seen none of them.

489
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,960
I've seen them.

490
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,760
What do you think? Are they beautiful?

491
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,560
Do you like it?

492
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,920
If you like it,

493
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,520
I'll assign someone to let off it for you.

494
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,840
It's splendid,

495
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,400
but it can merely last in a short while.

496
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,290
Merely in a short while?

497
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,400
It's easy.

498
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,360
I'll get more fireworks

499
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,280
and make them let off fireworks in three days and nights.

500
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,240
Not enough?

501
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,920
What about a year?

502
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,880
You idiot.

503
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,360
Who do you say is an idiot?

504
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,200
The one will know it himself.

505
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,040
Nope. Loong Wei'er.

506
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,960
You...I...

507
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,280
Li Xuan,

508
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,720
I have to go back to the Academy first.

509
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,840
Enjoy yourself.

510
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,040
I'll escort you back.

511
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,800
It's fine. They've left.

512
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
Stop pretending.

513
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,580
Why are you still here?

514
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,570
Have you forgotten that

515
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,520
we're here to celebrate my birthday?

516
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,440
Yeah.

517
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,160
I'm sorry.

518
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,320
I do forget it.

519
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,040
Okay.

520
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,450
I'll drink with you.

521
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,760
I'll have three shots first.

522
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,040
You should drink with it.

523
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,520
I think Li Xuan and Second Prince

524
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,100
are enjoying the wine,

525
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,740
so they won't go to the Secret Realm tonight.

526
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,060
If you worry about him,

527
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,560
you can go have a look.

528
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,080
Don't bother.

529
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,200
Loong Wei'er is companying him.

530
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,050
There won't be anything wrong.

531
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,760
Loong Wei'er,

532
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,520
You should decide whether she's done something wrong.

533
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,920
Why did Su Youlian

534
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,680
do this to me?

535
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,720
I love her so much.

536
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,880
I love her so much and I could do everything for her.

537
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,400
Why did she do this to me?

538
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,640
Say it.

539
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,500
What have you done for her?

540
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,400
I haven't seen it.

541
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,120
Do you know...

542
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,680
do you know why I'm still alive,

543
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,000
though I've been fighting against the crown prince for so many years?

544
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,880
Why?

545
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,400
Because I own the ability of self-healing.

546
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,560
You don't know it, do you?

547
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,320
To tell you the truth,

548
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,160
no matter how badly I'm injured for her,

549
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,800
my body will be healed gradually.

550
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,060
That's why Lord Zi entitled you to the Nation-protecting Master.

551
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,880
You're so gifted.

552
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,600
I'm not now.

553
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,120
What do you mean?

554
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,739
When we were in the Bloody Icebound Ward,

555
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
I exchanged my ability of self-healing

556
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,489
with Elder of the Book of Heaven

557
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,800
to save her.

558
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,710
Don't you find

559
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,719
I've been recovering from the injuries

560
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,380
since I went out of the bottom of the lake?

561
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,080
But it doesn't matter anyway.

562
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,230
Does Su Youlian know it?

563
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,630
Don't tell her the truth.

564
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,480
Don't tell her.

565
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,340
I don't want her to know it.

566
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,400
I'm afraid she would feel as she owes me.

567
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,480
Maybe if she knows it,

568
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,130
she will fall for you again.

569
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,199
Who am I?

570
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,560
I'm the Nation-protecting Master, Li Xuan.

571
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,420
Do I have to play a trick like this?

572
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,080
If I chase after a girl,

573
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,720
I'll let her adore me

574
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,040
wholeheartedly.

575
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,840
I won't play a trick like this.

576
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,400
You're really an idiot.

577
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,240
I think I'm confident.

578
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,200
Do you get me?

579
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,480
I'll have a bet.

580
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,760
I'll definitely get Su Youlian back.

581
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Do you believe me?

582
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,460
Stop drinking liquor.

583
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,040
Stop.

584
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,880
I'm enjoying it. –Stop.

585
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,800
Loong Wei'er,

586
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,000
why do I feel as you're a woman?

587
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,290
I'll go back to the Academy.

588
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,740
Will you go with me?

589
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,290
You can go back by yourself.

590
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,920
I wanna drink the liquor.

591
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
You can leave.

592
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,800
I have to tell you

593
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,920
I'll definitely get Su Youlian back.

594
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,480
Su Youlian,

595
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,400
cheers.

596
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,200
Your Highness II, what...?

597
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,960
Prepare a superior guest room.

598
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,000
Ask a waiter to escort

599
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,600
Li Xuan to the room later.

600
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,980
I'm seeing you off, Your Highness II.

601
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,320
Rest assured.

602
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,600
I'll do as you said.

603
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,080
That boy

604
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,680
is you.

605
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,680
My God,

606
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,900
it's late at night.

607
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,520
Please go back to your room and have a sleep.

608
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,540
Don't fall down from here.

609
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,120
Stop. Stop. Stop.

610
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,760
It's dangerous.

611
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,440
Slow. Slow.

612
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,570
Escort him back.

613
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,160
Hurry up. Hurry up.

614
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,920
Slow.

615
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,800
Nation-protecting Master,

616
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,160
please steady yourself.

617
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,240
Walk slow. Slow.

618
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,760
Walk slow. Slow.

619
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,080
Oh, my God.

620
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,520
Okay. You have to be careful.

621
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,720
Don't let him fall down.

622
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,440
Sure. Sure.

623
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,040
Lady,

624
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,920
why do you come back since you left just now?

625
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,440
It's...

626
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,840
I won't bother you anymore.

627
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,520
Don't go.

628
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,640
Don't go.

629
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,400
Li Xuan,

630
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,400
I'm sorry.

631
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,160
It's all my fault.

632
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,040
It's me who hurt you.

633
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,200
Do you remember

634
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,600
we have had the wedding ceremony?

635
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,360
We slept together on one bed.

636
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,640
We do have a thing for one another.

637
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,560
Why...

638
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,040
why did you say

639
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,040
you don't fall for me in the Truth-telling Formation?

640
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,200
Why?

641
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,640
You have to tell me the truth, since I don't get it.

642
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,920
Tell me the truth. Tell me, please.

643
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,840
Li Xuan,

644
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,090
don't act like this.

645
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,280
It's all my fault.

646
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,080
You're supposed to hate me.

647
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,120
I won't.

648
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,040
How would I hate you?

649
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,160
I can't help loving you.

650
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,640
Tell me

651
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,640
the word you said earlier isn't true,

652
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,440
is it?

653
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,360
You lied to me.

654
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,600
It's not true, is it?

655
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,440
I...
