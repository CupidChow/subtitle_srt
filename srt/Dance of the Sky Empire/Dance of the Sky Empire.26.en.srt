00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,870
Dance of the sky Empire

3
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,870
Episode 26

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,190
Mom, I am so hungry.

5
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,440
Good kid. Wait a moment.

6
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,509
I haven't had porridge for a long time.

7
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,230
I really want to have the porridge.

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,480
No.

9
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,080
It's for the Saintess

10
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,310
and that brother.

11
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,470
Bao. You are the best. Be good.

12
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,750
Wait a few minutes.

13
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,110
Your dad will take you something delicious after he comes back.

14
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,360
OK? Don't worry.

15
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,470
OK.

16
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,470
Be good.

17
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,190
Let's go to see the Saintess.

18
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,240
Let me take you there.

19
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,960
What's it?

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,670
Could it be possible that it's made from barks?

21
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,320
Bad news!

22
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,710
What's wrong? What's wrong?

23
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,190
Bao's dad fell off the cliff

24
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,030
and was just taken out of there.

25
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,830
What?

26
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,020
Where is he now?

27
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,440
He is in the saint doctor's home.

28
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,370
Hurry to see him.

29
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,880
Let's go.

30
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,240
Saint doctor, how is he now?

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,600
Saint doctor, how is his condition?

32
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,030
Yeah. How is he now?

33
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,320
Yeah.

34
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,670
What's wrong?

35
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,550
Don't cry, Bao.

36
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,079
In order to pick these edible wild herbs,

37
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,150
Bao's dad fell off the cliff.

38
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,829
Just to pick these edible wild herbs with bad taste,

39
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,160
he even risked his life.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,550
This is the most delicious food in our town.

41
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,390
Don't talk like this.

42
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,360
Bao.

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,800
Bao. Be quiet. Don't cry.

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,470
This brother talked like this because he didn't know it.

45
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,470
Don't blame him.

46
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
I know

47
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,550
The edible wild herbs are the most delicious food

48
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,480
in Ping'an town.

49
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,670
It was because of me. I said I was hungry

50
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,230
so my dad went to

51
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,160
the back mountain to pick edible wild herbs in the early morning

52
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,070
and fell off the cliff.

53
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,480
Over the last ten years,

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,200
the villagers of Ping'an town have fed on these edible wild herbs.

55
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,440
Now the edible wild herbs are nearly dying out.

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,040
They can only make a living by eating the barks.

57
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,550
Bao.

58
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,270
Bao.

59
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,830
Bao. Be good.

60
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,270
The porridge is cold.

61
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,110
Let me take you to heat it up. OK?

62
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,730
Go ahead.

63
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,790
Let's go.

64
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,640
Be quiet. Bao.

65
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,550
Stop crying.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,230
Saint doctor.

67
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,440
How is he now?

68
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,110
He is likely to wake up.

69
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,510
But I'm afraid he will lose his legs.

70
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,360
Do you have any other ideas?

71
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah.

72
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,390
But the cost is too high,

73
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,830
regardless of the consequence.

74
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,110
Tell me!

75
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,600
There is a hairyvein agrimony at the bottom of the Longya Mountain.

76
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,790
According to the record in the medical book,

77
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,480
hairyvein agrimony can be used to continue the broken bones.

78
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,440
OK. I'm going there now.

79
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,790
So am I. We can go with you.

80
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,670
The cliff is bottomless with thick black fog.

81
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,600
Most people who ever went there never came back again.

82
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,440
But now he…

83
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,300
Let me go there.

84
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,610
In order to treat me,

85
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,480
you used the last edible wild herbs

86
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,810
to make porridge for me.

87
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,920
If it hadn't been so,

88
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,600
such an accident wouldn't have happened.

89
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,720
Li Xuan. You…

90
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,510
Don't worry.

91
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,000
The cliff is difficult for you to climb.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,200
But it's a piece of cake to me.

93
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,350
Don't treat it lightly.

94
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,080
Take it easy!

95
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,750
Wait for my good news.

96
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,270
Childe Li.

97
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,000
The cliff is very dangerous. You must be careful!

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,920
Don't worry.

99
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,780
The rope is broken.

100
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,360
Hurry to tell the Saintess.

101
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,680
I'm going to tell her.

102
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,830
Childe Li.

103
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,320
Chide Li.

104
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,350
What did you say?

105
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,700
The rope is broken.

106
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,670
How is Li Xuan?

107
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,350
Calm down.

108
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,750
The rope is broken in the middle.

109
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,950
We're not sure how high the cliff is.

110
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,790
If he was approaching the bottom at that time,

111
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,320
maybe he would be safe according to his skill.

112
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,790
I'm going to look for him.

113
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,960
I know you're worried about him.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,830
What about this?

115
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,230
Let's put another rope.

116
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,200
If he still doesn't come up at 11 p.m.,

117
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,730
then let's come up with an idea to save him. OK?

118
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,550
No.

119
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,450
I can't wait so long.

120
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,440
Saintess.

121
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,350
It's time to send this letter.

122
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,350
Yes. Your Highness.

123
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,680
I'm going to send it now.

124
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,640
Your Highness. Someone sent a letter here just now.

125
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,549
It was for you.

126
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,350
[Please go to Lanxin Restaurant to have a talk with me.]

127
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,320
[I have something important to discuss with you.]

128
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,200
[Please spare some time to see me.]

129
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,400
Get out of the palace with me.

130
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:57,960
Yes.

131
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,030
Your Highness. Prince Mu comes.

132
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,200
Invite him in.

133
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,400
Yes.

134
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,440
Prince Mu. Come in, please.

135
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,790
Prince Mu. Long time no see.

136
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,320
How are you?

137
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,910
It's said that you just got married.

138
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,080
I should have gone to your palace to congratulate in the flesh.

139
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,030
But under the order of my father,

140
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,880
I came with 50 thousand picked troops stationed in the border

141
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,520
to catch the Kunwu siren Su Youlian.

142
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,450
So it's not convenient for me.

143
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,480
I sincerely hope you can excuse me.

144
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,230
You and Li Xuan have let go of Su Youlian

145
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,440
under the watchful eyes of people.

146
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,590
The emperor of Tianqi didn't punish you

147
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,080
but allowed you to dispatch 50 thousand picked troops.

148
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,910
The emperor of Tianqi

149
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,520
really trust you deeply.

150
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,440
It's certain that you know

151
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,550
my father feared the Kunwu clan very much,

152
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,000
especially the Kunwu Saintess.

153
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,900
Straight to the point.

154
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,670
Clearly there is nothing I can hide from you.

155
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,760
Since it is so,

156
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,550
I will tell you directly.

157
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,790
You are building the frontier defense

158
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,760
with a large number of troops in Shiye city

159
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,150
to prevent the connection with the border of Tianqi.

160
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,520
Seemingly, you have prepared

161
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,470
to fight against Tianqi.

162
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,400
Since you have prepared well,

163
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
why not cooperate with me?

164
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,760
Cooperate?

165
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,880
Yeah.

166
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,880
Kunwu is ready for a battle.

167
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,080
Tianqi is also in a chaos.

168
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,480
All the people feel worried and scared.

169
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,400
If we cooperate with each other to fight against the State of Qingtian,

170
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,860
it's the best time to control the situation.

171
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,930
Tell me your requirement.

172
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,760
It's simple.

173
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,820
I just want you to lend me 30 thousand picked troops.

174
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,000
30 thousand.

175
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,640
As long as you lend me 30 thousand picked troops

176
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,110
to help me throne,

177
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,640
I will sign the treaty of alliance with you immediately,

178
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,960
returning all the territory in the south of Shiye city

179
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,910
which used to belong to the State of Sha.

180
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,000
Besides, we two countries can

181
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,160
live in peace with mutual benefit.

182
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,960
Is that all?

183
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,230
If I can also

184
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,200
ensure the safety of Su Youlian,

185
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,880
I'm wondering if you think

186
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,880
it's a good business.

187
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,710
[The alliance between Long Wei'er, the prince of the State of Tianqi,and Yu Fengmu, the prince of the State of Sha.]

188
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,470
[The State of Sha lends Long Wei'er 30 thousand picked troops]

189
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,350
[to help Long Wei'er to counterattack the State of Tianqi to throne smoothly.]

190
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,100
[After making it,]

191
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,400
[the State of Tianqi will return the territory in the south of Shiye City which used to belong to the State of Sha.]

192
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,760
[Besides, we two countries other can live in peace with each with mutual benefit.]

193
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,880
If you can believe me,

194
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,880
I'm sure to

195
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
take Su Youlian to you safely

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,550
in two days.

197
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,590
I believe you.

198
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,040
Here is a report.

199
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,550
What's up?

200
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,470
The crown prince has usurped the throne.

201
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,080
What?

202
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,910
The crown prince has usurped the throne.

203
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,470
Yes.

204
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,010
Go to check it again.

205
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,790
Yes.

206
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,220
How could the crown prince be so capable?

207
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,240
It's Xiao Fengming.

208
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,790
I'm afraid you don't know

209
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,230
Xiao Fengming is controlled by the demon spirit of the Dragon Emperor.

210
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,490
He is not only powerful

211
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,760
who can't be conquered by anybody,

212
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
but also has a bad temper.

213
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,790
Previously, the deaths in Qingtian city

214
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,230
were caused by him.

215
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,760
Unexpectedly, the demon spirit is so powerful.

216
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,960
Is there a way to deal with him?

217
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,470
Yes.

218
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,520
What's it?

219
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,730
Wake up the Dragon Emperor.

220
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,030
As long as the Dragon Emperor is woken up, the demon spirit will disappear.

221
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,640
The world will be in peace again.

222
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,440
You want to help Su Youlian to wake up the Dragon Emperor, right?

223
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,610
You have to make a choice between the Dragon Emperor and the demon spirit.

224
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,090
If you choose to indulge the demon spirit,

225
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,440
even though I lend you picked troops to get the Qingtian city under your control,

226
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,320
I'm afraid you still can't get the throne.

227
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:48,030
If you choose to cooperate with Youlian

228
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,850
to wake up the Dragon Emperor, the result will be different.

229
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,400
Though the Dragon Emperor hates the human clan bitterly,

230
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,550
for the sake of your saving him,

231
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,920
as well as the meditation by Youlain and me,

232
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,760
probably the result won't be bad.

233
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,230
What do you think?

234
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,470
How can you make sure that

235
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,470
I'm not finding trouble for myself

236
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,750
by helping Su Youlian save the Dragon Emperor?

237
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,960
It's up to you

238
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,000
to have a bet or not.

239
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,960
You also have Li Xuan to help you, right?

240
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,760
Li Xuan?

241
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,230
You have known it, right?

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,960
Long long ago, it was said that

243
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,440
Kunwu used to be a good clan.

244
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,670
Its first Saintess fell in love with the ancestor of human clan,

245
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,960
punished by the god,

246
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,790
so Kunwu became the present situation.

247
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,920
Later the Kunwu clan always had wars with the human clan.

248
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,840
The first Saintess and the ancestor of human clan sacrificed with their lives

249
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,700
and took an oath

250
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,960
that only the offspring of the Kunwu clan and human clan

251
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,350
could have supreme power in this world

252
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,080
to pacify the wars.

253
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,230
After the deaths in the Academy,

254
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,960
Li Xuan's power has improved by leaps and bounds.

255
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,350
I thought Youlian was beaten by him

256
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,320
because she showed mercy to him.

257
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,040
Think it over carefully.

258
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,200
Li Xuan's mother is always a mystery.

259
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,520
Maybe you have got the answer early.

260
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,060
I can help Su Youlian wake up the Dragon Emperor.

261
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,400
I'm here to

262
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,960
say thanks to you instead of Youlian.

263
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,000
No need.

264
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,280
I am just curious that you have done so much for her,

265
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,970
is it possible for you to get her heart?

266
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,150
Kunwu's rope is really unreliable!

267
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,080
Gosh!

268
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,910
It's too bad!

269
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,310
Qingmiao didn't tell me what the hairyvein agrimony looks like.

270
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,200
Do I need to take all of them?

271
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,230
It's so strange here.

272
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,680
What's this?

273
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,590
Xuan.

274
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,640
Xuan.

275
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,590
It's really hard for me to find you.

276
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,190
Come to me.

277
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,470
Let me look at you carefully.

278
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,680
Xuan. You have grown up.

279
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,070
Childe Li.

280
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,160
He got down from here.

281
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,430
Li Xuan.

282
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,470
Childe Li. Childe Li.

283
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,230
Li Xuan.

284
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,470
Li Xuan.

285
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,560
Are you there?

286
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,640
Li Xuan. I am Su Youlian.

287
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,280
Li Xuan. Can you hear me?

288
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,280
Li Xuan.

289
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,800
Li Xuan.

290
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Saintess. Saintess. Saintess.

291
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,660
Don't be silly.

292
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,400
Don't forget your identity.

293
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,800
Saintess.

294
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,470
Let me go.

295
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,380
Thank you for seeing us off. Go back quickly.

296
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,950
Get up.

297
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,950
Get up.

298
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,400
You saved my dad.

299
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,110
I show my respect to you.

300
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,680
Get up.

301
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,010
You must take care of your dad and you.

302
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,920
It's too late. Time to go.

303
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,070
Miss Dan, thank you.

304
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,760
Miss Su, I will miss you, too.

305
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,230
Go back home.

306
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,520
Bye.

307
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,310
Don't worry. Prince Mu.

308
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,070
Anyone who is supposed to appear will turn up sooner or later.

309
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,560
How do you know that Li Xuan will come back?

310
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,190
They come.

311
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,590
Prince Mu.

312
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,280
Did he bully you?

313
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,310
No. I'm fine.

314
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,800
Don't worry. Prince Mu.

315
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:26,920
I've told you

316
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,160
Li Xuan won't bully your princess.

317
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Prince Mu.

318
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,090
Let's have a talk in another place.

319
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,070
OK. That's what I am thinking.

320
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,310
Don't forget

321
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,280
they are real couple with a wedding ceremony.

322
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,190
So what?

323
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,000
Not only did I have a wedding ceremony,

324
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,130
but also I had a wedding night with her.

325
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,110
You always want to

326
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,960
get back you lost memory, right?

327
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,330
What do you want to say?

328
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,070
At present, only Yu Fengmu

329
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,030
can control the saintess stone.

330
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,240
If you irritated him,

331
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,040
would he still help you?

332
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,190
Think it over.

333
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,190
Are the lanterns beautiful?

334
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,190
Common people

335
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,700
specially lit them for our marriage.

336
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,880
It's a pity that

337
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,230
we may let them down.

338
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,400
Youlian.

339
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,640
I have something to tell you.

340
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,020
I have found a way to change the owner of the saintess stone.

341
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,760
Really?

342
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,430
Yes.

343
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,960
What can I do for you?

344
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,460
You just need to answer me a question.

345
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,880
We have gone through so much,

346
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,520
but you only have Li Xuan in your heart, right?

347
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,000
Yes.

348
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,810
I only have him in my heart.

349
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,880
So it is.

350
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,040
Prince Mu.

351
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,920
I'm sorry.

352
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,880
No need.

353
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,320
No need to say sorry.

354
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,680
I let you down.

355
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,760
It's too late.

356
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,270
Go back to have a rest.

357
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,060
Come to see me in the saint hall tomorrow.

358
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,110
Prince Mu.

359
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,100
On behalf of the whole Kunwu clan, thank you.

360
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,170
Your Highness.

361
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,070
The Princess has been back.

362
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,710
Why are you still unhappy?

363
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,160
Batou.

364
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,430
Ask the common people

365
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,190
to put away the flowers and lanterns tomorrow.

366
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,950
How could it be?

367
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,400
These are the common people's

368
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,070
best wishes for you.

369
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,310
Your Highness. What are you going to do？

370
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,150
Do you still remember

371
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,820
the other way to change the owner of the saintess stone?

372
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,190
You want to…

373
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,330
Your Highness.

374
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,800
You want to make her the owner of the saintess stone unnaturally.

375
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,470
What can you do?

376
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,310
I have the saintess stone.

377
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,800
It can only save my life.

378
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,930
But if I give it to Youlian,

379
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,950
it can not only save our country from a siege

380
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,760
but also save the whole Kunwu clan.

381
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,800
Besides,

382
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,110
it used to belong to Kunwu.

383
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,330
Your Highness.

384
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,400
Maybe others don't know it, but I know

385
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,080
the saintess stone has been protecting you all the time..

386
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,920
You have been weak since you were young.

387
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,230
For several escapes from death,

388
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,560
it was this saintess stone that saved you.

389
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,160
The saint doctor has reminded

390
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,190
not to change the owner of the saintess stone.

391
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,230
Now

392
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
for a woman who doesn't love you,

393
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,370
you even risk your life.

394
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,140
I don't agree with you.

395
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,590
I have made the decision.

396
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,670
Don't talk about it anymore.

397
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,830
Master. Did you hear it?

398
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,830
I'm going to get the saintess stone soon.

399
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,040
We'll be most likely to wake up the Dragon Emperor this time.

400
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,710
Where have you been these days?

401
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,310
It's a long story.

402
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,640
Above all…

403
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,230
Who's that?

404
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,950
It's me. Li Xuan.

405
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,560
It's so late. Why didn't you go to sleep?

406
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,920
I'm worried that you may be hungry.

407
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,050
So I want to give you some night snacks.

408
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,280
I'm not hungry.

409
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,430
How could it be?

410
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,360
Even so, you have to take some food.

411
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,560
Eat it.

412
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,800
Do you have something to tell me?

413
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,950
No.

414
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,760
No?

415
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,920
No

416
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,940
Then you can leave now.

417
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,010
It's too late. I'm going sleep.

418
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
Indeed I have something to tell you.

419
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,950
Tell me.

420
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,470
I am the same.

421
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,160
I am the same.

422
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,310
What's the same?

423
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,640
Fool.

424
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,280
Li Xuan.

425
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,160
You eavesdropped the conversation between Prince Mu and me?

426
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,690
Is the moon bright tonight?

427
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,920
I'm wondering how Wei'er is now.

428
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,680
Is everything going smoothly?

429
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:22,800
My eyelid has been twitching these days,

430
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,170
feeling something would happen.

431
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,560
Don't worry.

432
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,190
Wei'er is wise. She has the situation in her hand.

433
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,760
Everything is under her control.

434
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,400
You're right.

435
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,800
But it's a big event.

436
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,760
I'm just afraid in case…

437
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,040
It has been such a situation.

438
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,680
It's useless thinking more.

439
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,800
These years,

440
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,070
because of the identity of a woman,

441
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,880
she has suffered much.

442
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,490
If she can't stand out bravely,

443
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,110
I'm afraid she will

444
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,560
live a painful life.

445
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,070
I'm useless.

446
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,920
I can't help her.

447
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,880
Lord.

448
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,160
[I have persuaded Prince Mu to lend me 30 thousand picked troops.]

449
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,310
[I'm going back to pacify the rebellion immediately.]

450
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,640
Good.

451
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,310
Wonderful!

452
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,710
What happened?

453
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,430
Sister.

454
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,610
You really have good daughter.

455
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,640
Wei'er has successfully persuaded Prince Mu

456
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,010
to lend her 30 thousand picked troops.

457
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,560
Besides, the royal city is in a chaos now.

458
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,920
It's natural for us to pacify the rebellion.

459
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:50,950
Really?

460
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,160
Yes.

461
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,300
Thank you for the God's bless.

462
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,700
Just wait to see it.

463
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,190
It's obvious that Wei'er will make a great contribution this time.

464
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,070
Prince Mu.

465
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,110
Prince Mu.

466
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,260
Your Highness.

467
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,400
Your Highness. Your Highness.

468
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,400
Your Highness. Open the door.

469
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,430
Your Highness.

470
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,110
Open the door. Your Highness.

471
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,830
Your Highness.

472
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,600
Youlian.

473
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,320
Prince Mu. Look.

474
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,630
Why are you so weak?

475
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,600
I'm OK.

476
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,120
The saintess stone belongs to you now.

477
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,000
On behalf of the Kunwu clan, thank you for your great help.

478
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,000
Stand up.

479
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,880
It's useless saying thanks.

480
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,910
No matter how many thanks you say,

481
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,870
it can't get back...

482
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,600
Batou.

483
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,690
What can't get back?

484
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,120
It's nothing.

485
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,870
He just thinks that

486
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,080
it's a pity that the saintess stone can't belong to our country any more.

487
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,760
It just came back to its original owner.

488
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,840
Take it seriously.

489
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,040
I'm here to tell you

490
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,850
I won't see you off since you have recovered.

491
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,370
Welcome, my honorable guest.

492
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,600
Come in, please.

493
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,200
Why doesn't she turn up yet?

494
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,360
Take it easy.

495
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,860
Could it be that

496
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,920
you're worried that she is cooped up by Yu Fengmu?

497
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,670
Li Xuan.

498
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,280
As for the restoration of your memory,

499
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,000
have you considered it carefully?

500
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,660
There is nothing to consider.

501
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,040
It's just the restoration of my memory.

502
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,230
I just want to say...

503
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,530
How is it going? Have you got it?

504
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,630
Can it really help me restore my memory?

505
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,720
Can it really help me restore my memory?

506
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,840
I just learned it from the ancient books.

507
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,500
Have a try and you will know it.

508
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,000
I can have a try.

509
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,430
Let's go.

510
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,840
Li Xuan.

511
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,730
I hope you can accept your identity with a peaceful mind.

512
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,560
Are you well-prepared?

513
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,120
Thank you, dad.

514
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,980
Mom. How beautiful the floral lanterns are!

515
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,630
You like this one

516
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,120
or that one?

517
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,280
Mom. Buy some fireworks.

518
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,060
Hurry up. Hurry up.

519
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,870
Quickly.

520
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,950
Be careful.

521
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,210
Mom. I want fireworks.

522
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,360
Xuan. How many do you want?

523
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,280
Five.

524
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,390
OK.

525
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,950
Here you are, Xuan.

526
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,810
Thank you, dad.

527
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:37,800
Xuan. Xuan.

528
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,840
Don't be afraid.

529
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,470
I won't.

530
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,870
I don't want to see her.

531
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,800
Look. Who is she?

532
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,120
Look. Who is she?

533
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,760
It's mom.

534
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,430
It's mom.

535
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,130
Xuan.Don't be afraid. Xuan. Don't be afraid.

536
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,840
Let me hug you.

537
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,100
It's so beautiful.

538
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,950
Be careful.

539
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
Be careful.

540
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:49,910
Mom.

541
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,630
Your face is so dirty.

542
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,710
I'm hungry.

543
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,950
I'm hungry.

544
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,710
I'm going to cook your favourite cakes.

545
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:08,870
OK.

546
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,530
Let's go.

547
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,560
Come here.

548
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,870
Xuan. Have some cakes.

549
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,320
Mom.

550
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,760
I have cooked something delicious for you.

551
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,230
You have made rapid progress today.

552
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,390
So tasty!

553
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,040
Thank you, mom.

554
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,390
You piggish!

555
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,600
Come

556
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,860
to have some water.

557
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,040
Brother.

558
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,520
Mom.

559
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:06,930
I don't believe it.

560
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,430
Li Xuan.

561
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,470
Li Xuan.

562
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,800
Li Xuan.

563
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,190
He killed my mom.

564
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,230
He killed my mom.

565
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,020
I am a member of the Kunwu clan.

566
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,560
He killed my mom.

567
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,220
I am a member of the Kunwu clan.

568
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,530
I am a member of the Kunwu clan.

569
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,040
Leave him alone to calm himself down.
