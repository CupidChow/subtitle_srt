00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,860
Dance of the Sky Empire

3
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,860
Episode 27

4
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,280
I belong to the Kunwu clan.

5
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,600
I belong to the Kunwu clan.

6
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,560
Leave him alone to calm down himself.

7
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,740
You old man.

8
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,500
Are you playing tricks on me?

9
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,780
I can control the bells.

10
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,440
But how can I control the wind?

11
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,500
I won't wait. I want to practice it now.

12
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,060
Brat.

13
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,060
I will give you two hours.

14
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,380
You must make some achievements.

15
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,620
Don't let me down.

16
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,980
It sounds like I can make it by listening to your words.

17
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,660
You bad man.

18
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,770
Master. Don't come here.

19
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,470
It's too dangerous.

20
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,459
I'm using great spiritual power

21
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,750
to control them.

22
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,220
I'm afraid you'll be hurt by it.

23
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,380
I'm nearly injured.

24
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,820
Master. Don't come here.

25
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,500
Get out of here.

26
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,830
Leave me alone. Master.

27
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,100
Be careful.

28
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,300
Don't. Master.

29
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,860
I told you not to get close.

30
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,190
Why didn't listen to me?

31
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,220
Where are you going, master?

32
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,700
Master.

33
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,620
Master.

34
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,820
You bad old man!

35
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,780
Brat. What are you doing?

36
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,260
Nothing.

37
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,940
You...

38
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,659
You did nothing? You...

39
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,140
Master. You are serious?

40
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,860
Brat.

41
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,100
Do you know they are my best wine?

42
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,659
You ruined them.

43
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,640
My wine.

44
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,060
Master. Assassin!

45
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,460
Master. Stop it.

46
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,940
Didn't you beat me enough during the day?

47
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,140
How could you come to my house to beat me?

48
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,340
Catch it.

49
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,580
You want me to take poison to commit suicide, right?

50
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,540
Brat.

51
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,860
Your face is black and blue.

52
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,960
Apply this medicine on your face.

53
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,550
What's wrong with you, master?

54
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,620
Are you morally ashamed,

55
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,400
feeling guilty about treating me like this?

56
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,230
There there! I forgive you.

57
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,100
I...

58
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,070
I am so angry that I want to twist off your head.

59
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,700
Brat.

60
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,980
Master. Wait a moment.

61
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,820
What's up?

62
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,780
Master. I always want to ask you a question.

63
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,940
With so many people to choose,

64
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,900
why did you just choose me to be the Nation-protecting Master?

65
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,760
Could it be that

66
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,320
you have done something guilty about me?

67
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,380
Tell me

68
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,040
your guilty deed about me.

69
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,740
OK.

70
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,580
Listen.

71
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,440
You take my kindness for granted.

72
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,380
Brat.

73
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,020
Miss Su. Please go back.

74
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,100
Our prince don't see guests today.

75
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,510
I 'm going to leave for the State of Tianqi.

76
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,340
I want to say thanks and

77
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,020
goodbye to Prince Mu.

78
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,060
I don't know

79
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,440
when we can meet again.

80
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,660
Miss Su.

81
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,470
You'd better set off immediately.

82
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,200
Don't meet our prince any more in the future.

83
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,480
Is there anything wrong with him?

84
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,420
He's OK.

85
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,190
There is nothing wrong.

86
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,620
Our prince just doesn't want to see you.

87
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,220
Hurry to go now.

88
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,120
I won't see you off.

89
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,460
OK.

90
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,140
Your Highness. Miss Su has got out of the city.

91
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,340
She leaves and I can feel relieved now.

92
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,790
It's time for you to take medicine.

93
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,060
Youlian.

94
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,660
Prince.

95
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,780
Prince.

96
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,500
Prince.

97
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,060
Prince.

98
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,740
Prince.

99
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,670
I'm going back to save the Dragon Emperor.

100
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,140
Will you stop me again?

101
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,910
The Dragon Emperor is my uncle.

102
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,260
In order to protect him,

103
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,240
My mother gave up her life.

104
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,220
How can I prevent you?

105
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,700
Thinking of the past,

106
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,060
I was tricked by Lord Zi like a fool.

107
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,270
He lied to me that the Kunwu clan was guilty of a capital crime

108
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,300
Now I know

109
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,160
it was him who had committed the most serious crime.

110
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,940
It's 30 li from here

111
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,420
to Qingtian City.

112
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,160
I won't go with you after arriving there.

113
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,780
Then where are you going?

114
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,900
I have my own thing to do.

115
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,940
Long Wei'er. Long Wei'er.

116
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,910
You want to do something that makes me blurred again, right?

117
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,100
So what you want to make clear from me?

118
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,700
Report.

119
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,980
What's up?

120
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,960
Someone broke into the military camp, saying to see Childe Li.

121
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,340
Xuan.

122
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,440
I haven't seen you for a long time.

123
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,260
Come here.

124
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,940
Xuan. Keep away from her.

125
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,860
Su Youlian. You siren.

126
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,630
Pianran.

127
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,380
Put away your sword.

128
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,140
Li Xuan.

129
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,060
You're still protecting her?

130
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,700
Have you forgotten those classmates wronged to death?

131
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,300
Yeah.

132
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,660
She didn't do that.

133
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,180
Li Xuan.

134
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,460
Are you bewitched by this syren?

135
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,420
Indeed she didn't do that.

136
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,900
It was Xiao Fengming

137
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,420
who hurt people in the city and the Academy.

138
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,820
Xiao Fengming?

139
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,540
How could it be possible?

140
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,740
It's ridiculous!

141
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,300
Exactly speaking, it was the demon spirit of the Dragon Emperor who did that.

142
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,960
Xiao Fengming is just a puppet

143
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,780
controlled by the demon spirit.

144
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,320
No wonder he urged the crown prince to usurp the throne.

145
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Usurp the throne?

146
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,609
Is the crown prince in power now?

147
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,220
I have got the information early.

148
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,550
Now you should correct yourself by calling him His Majesty.

149
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,290
Although he has proclaimed himself emperor,

150
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,890
actually it was Xiao Fengming that is in power.

151
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,230
Now Qingtian City is in a chaos.

152
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,020
Common people become destitute and homeless.

153
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,260
Even those who oppose him

154
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,990
were killed by him ruthlessly.

155
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,220
Moyun Ancient Academy has also been destroyed.

156
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,420
Even Lord Zi was cooped up in the Academy

157
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,380
with his life and death unknown.

158
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,940
Lord Zi. What's up?

159
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,220
Get out of the city immediately.

160
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,140
The further, the better.

161
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,000
Lord Zi.

162
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,420
What happened?

163
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,380
The world has changed.

164
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,220
Big event will take place.

165
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,580
If we leave, Lord Zi, you are alone.

166
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,860
Don't worry about me.

167
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,380
Get out of here right now.

168
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,580
Leave.

169
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,220
Lord Zi guarded Moyun Ancient Academy by himself

170
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,620
and we escaped in chaos.

171
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,460
Qingtian City is a living hell now

172
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,340
with killings

173
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,400
and refugees everywhere.

174
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,380
They are just innocent people!

175
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,020
You!

176
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Finally you come!

177
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,780
Take my order.

178
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,740
Heavy thunder!

179
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,860
Most of your spiritual power has been lost

180
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,590
by sealing the Dragon Emperor.

181
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,220
Are you sure you can still deal with me?

182
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,140
Are you afraid?

183
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,380
Take it easy.

184
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,700
I won't kill you now.

185
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,780
I will make you feel

186
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,900
the pain of captivity.

187
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,060
Don't talk nonsense.

188
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,100
All the fires.

189
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,510
Come to stop the arrogance.

190
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,040
Based on your ability,

191
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,990
indeed you can't deal with him.

192
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,580
So we must hurry back

193
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,580
to save Lord Zi.

194
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,460
When I am not here,

195
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,830
unexpectedly so many thing have happened in Qingtian City.

196
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,790
Have you decided what to do?

197
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,300
I hope he is still alive.

198
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,200
Only in this way

199
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,980
can I ask him by myself

200
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,310
why he killed my mother.

201
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,500
Brat.

202
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,500
Finally you come.

203
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,100
Kunwu siren?

204
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,020
Li Xuan.

205
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,260
You...

206
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,580
Youlian. Go to the living room.

207
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,060
The token is likely to be in the wine bottle.

208
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,190
I will go there soon.

209
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,780
Li Xuan.

210
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,980
I got it.

211
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,460
Li Xuan.

212
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,460
Li Xuan.

213
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,020
You belong to the human clan.

214
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,020
How can you act in collusion

215
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,980
with the Kunwu siren?

216
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,420
Human clan?

217
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,260
Lord Zi, having lied for so many years,

218
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,460
don't you feel bored?

219
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,920
Why do you look at me like this?

220
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,540
Are you guilty?

221
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,620
These years, you have tried every means to erase my memory

222
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,460
and prevented me from mentioning my mother.

223
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,460
You're just afraid of today, right?

224
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,940
You... You have restored your memory?

225
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,020
Yeah.

226
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,020
Not only did I restore my memory,

227
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,540
but also I know who killed my mother.

228
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,700
It's true.

229
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,340
Your mother

230
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,900
was killed by me by mistake.

231
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,380
The Moon-fall Formation can only suppress the Dragon Emperor for the time being.

232
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,380
If I want to seal the Dragon Emperor,

233
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,510
I must use the blood of the royal family of the Kunwu clan.

234
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,980
The Formation was set up that day.

235
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,580
It was easy to kill the Dragon Emperor that day.

236
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,790
But your mother risked her life at the last moment

237
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,420
to withstand my last blow.

238
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,020
Sister.

239
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,620
I did it for the whole human clan.

240
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,020
For the human clan?

241
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,180
The human clan and the Kunwu clan could have been in peace with other.

242
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,820
It's you.

243
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,740
It's you

244
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,710
who feared the power of the Kunwu clan.

245
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,900
So you took advantage of my father to kill my mother

246
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,430
to seal the Dragon Emperor.

247
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,740
I didn't do wrong.

248
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,380
The most powerful should be respected. The fittest survives.

249
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,260
It was destined that there would be a battle between the human clan and Kunwu clan.

250
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,100
If the Dragon Emperor hadn't been dead, he would have enslaved the human clan eventually.

251
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,620
How could the common people live a peaceful life?

252
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,820
The most powerful should be respected.

253
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,180
You are always narrow-minded

254
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,870
to guess the Kunwu clan,

255
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,300
causing killings.

256
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,060
In the battle that year,

257
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,940
there were numerous deaths of the Kunwu clan and human clan.

258
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,020
Now the demon spirit is also killing the innocent people in Qingtian City.

259
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,860
All of them is caused by you.

260
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,990
Is this the result you want?

261
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,180
Is it what you called a peaceful life?

262
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,260
OK.

263
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,380
Li Xuan.

264
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,750
If you want to kill me

265
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,390
to revenge for your mother,

266
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,140
just go ahead.

267
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,220
Take action.

268
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,460
Brat.

269
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,060
You stole the wine fermented with osmanthus flowers to cure my wound.

270
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,300
Aren't you afraid that after I recover,

271
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,540
I will force you to practice Kung fu more severely?

272
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,300
Hearing that you are ill,

273
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,900
I was happy at first.

274
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,700
Several days later,

275
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,780
I found I felt uncomfortable

276
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,720
without you chattering around me every day.

277
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,140
Brat.

278
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,060
Brat.

279
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,740
Brat.

280
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,820
Give me the saintess stone.

281
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,060
I can forgive you.

282
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,840
Just as expected, you are not Xiao Fengming.

283
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,700
How could I be that rubbish?

284
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,220
If he is rubbish,

285
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,500
you are just a parasite worse than rubbish.

286
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,620
You are just a Saintess.

287
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,940
How dare you speak so rudely to me?

288
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:31,940
Youlian.

289
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,100
Are you OK?

290
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,230
I'm fine.

291
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,740
Your Highness. The Academy has been in a chaos.

292
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,980
Just as you've expected,

293
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,240
Xiao Fengming has been contained by Li Xuan and Su Youlian.

294
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,540
Your Majesty.

295
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,900
Your Majesty.

296
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,580
Your Majesty. Bad news.

297
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,220
Your Majesty.

298
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:54,900
Kill...

299
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,940
They are rushing in to kill us.

300
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,460
Your Majesty.

301
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,860
Your Majesty.Where are you?

302
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,060
Your Majesty.

303
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,900
Why are you shouting in a hurry?

304
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,670
Your Majesty. The second prince is rushing in to kill us.

305
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,389
Where is Xiao Fengming?

306
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,820
Ask him here now.

307
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,900
I didn't see him. Your Majesty.

308
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,130
The second prince is breaking in full fury.

309
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,190
I'm afraid Xiao Fengming has escaped

310
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,469
seeing the situation is unfavorable.

311
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:26,900
Escape?

312
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,170
Then why are you still here?

313
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,420
Take people to fight with them.

314
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,380
It's too late.

315
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,580
The rebel forces have besieged the whole royal palace.

316
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,380
They're approaching here soon.

317
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,170
Your Majesty. Take care.

318
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,670
Where are you going, crown prince?

319
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,110
Long Wei'er.

320
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,460
How dare you be so rude in front of me?

321
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,260
You you you...

322
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,780
You also gather so many troops.

323
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,260
Do you want to rebel?

324
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,140
You... you... you...

325
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,580
What do you want to do?

326
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,340
What do you want to do?

327
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,500
I am the imperial throne.

328
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,060
You traitors!

329
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,260
Let me go.

330
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,420
Let me go.

331
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,140
Let me go.

332
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,100
I can give you a chance.

333
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,780
Repeat what you said just now.

334
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,100
I said

335
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,780
since you like the throne so much,

336
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,340
I could give it to you.

337
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,920
Give the throne to you.

338
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,940
What do you think?

339
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,500
Give?

340
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,100
You're right.

341
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,390
I can give the throne...

342
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,100
I can return the throne to you.

343
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,960
You should have been the emperor.

344
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,460
Brother.

345
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,380
Brother.

346
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,420
We're brothers.

347
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,140
You can't kill me.

348
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,220
Brother.

349
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,060
You forced father to abdicate to usurp the throne, which is treacherous.

350
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,420
How can I let go of you?

351
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,340
No no no.

352
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,140
I was forced by Xiao Fengming to do that.

353
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,980
Please forgive me, brother.

354
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,910
I know I am wrong.

355
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,700
Please forgive me, brother.

356
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,020
Take him who is disobedient to his father

357
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,060
away.

358
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,860
Lock him up forever.

359
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,620
Your Highness. I've found His Majesty.

360
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,820
He has been cooped up in the cold palace.

361
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,620
It was you who killed many classmates

362
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,900
in Moyun Ancient Academy, right?

363
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,100
So what?

364
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,700
Since you are here,

365
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,780
die with her.

366
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,900
Why do you come?

367
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,380
Coming here by yourself,

368
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,350
you're really unfriendly.

369
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,420
You are over-confident!

370
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,220
Set up the Formation.
