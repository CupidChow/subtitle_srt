1
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,860
Dance of the Sky Empire

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,860
Episode 9

3
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,520
Have you never doubted her identity?

4
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,500
There's no doubt.

5
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,860
Many people want to have the number one token.

6
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,820
So it is.

7
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,620
However,

8
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,420
Miss Su is so persistent in it.

9
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,220
Have you ever seen another one except her?

10
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,950
What do you want to say on earth?

11
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,020
Kunwu.

12
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,380
Brother.

13
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,940
Brother.

14
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,940
Wake up!

15
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,659
What's up?

16
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,500
Brother.

17
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,900
You want me to have a sister-in-law, right?

18
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,340
Nonsense.

19
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,580
Good!

20
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,480
Wonderful!

21
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,340
Awesome!

22
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,460
Good!

23
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,180
Wonderful!

24
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,220
Excellent!

25
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,820
Wonderful!

26
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:49,659
Brilliant!

27
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,540
Awesome!

28
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,530
Unexpectedly, there is

29
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,740
such an extraordinary dancer in Tianqi.

30
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,500
Good!

31
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,680
Emperor Liang.

32
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,220
Are you convinced now?

33
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,980
I'm sincerely convinced.

34
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,340
Tianqi State

35
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,040
deserves the first place.

36
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,740
My son.

37
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,540
You really did a good job.

38
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,740
Thank you, father.

39
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,900
It's credited to Miss Su.

40
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,380
I can't make a merit of it by myself.

41
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,140
You have made great progress,

42
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,820
knowing to be modest.

43
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,300
Good.

44
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,620
I really have a good mood today.

45
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,020
You must be rewarded.

46
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,980
It's my responsibility

47
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,960
to win glory for Tianqi State.

48
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,940
I don't want any reward.

49
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,300
I just hope the Tianqi State

50
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,460
can be prosperous

51
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,000
and peaceful forever.

52
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,440
Wonderful!

53
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,900
Good!

54
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,060
Good!

55
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,740
Miss. Su.

56
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,190
Say thanks to His Majesty and back off.

57
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,900
Your Majesty.

58
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,740
I want to ask you for something.

59
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,580
How bold Su Youlian is!

60
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,300
She even dares to ask His Majesty for reward.

61
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,700
What reward do you think she wants?

62
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,300
Rewards

63
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,420
such as gold, silver and jewelry.

64
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,220
She comes from the countryside.

65
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,060
Really?

66
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,860
But I think

67
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,590
she wants to enter the secret area.

68
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,420
Enter the secret area?

69
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,380
Miss. Su.

70
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,460
I will reward you anything you want.

71
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,180
Just back off.

72
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,620
It was His Majesty who said to reward me just now.

73
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,620
As for your reward,

74
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,380
I will go to ask for it later.

75
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,540
OK.

76
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,060
Just tell me what reward you want to have.

77
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,220
Your Majesty.

78
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,580
Su Youlian.

79
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,420
I...

80
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,600
It's a rare chance.

81
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,620
Think it over.

82
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,140
What do you want?

83
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,980
You want a golden hair clasp.

84
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,580
I want a golden hair clasp, Your Majesty.

85
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,500
I...

86
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,660
You want a golden hair clasp.

87
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,120
I want a golden hair clasp.

88
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,700
Your Majesty.

89
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,500
You want a golden hair clasp.

90
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,000
I want a golden hair clasp.

91
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,419
OK.

92
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,220
It's just a golden hair clasp.

93
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,110
No need to repeat so many times.

94
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,620
OK.

95
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,700
I will reward you with it.

96
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,780
Why are you still standing there?

97
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,780
Back off.

98
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,700
Thank you, father.

99
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

100
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,620
What're you doing?

101
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,940
This hair clasp is rewarded by His Majesty.

102
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,060
Why did you break my plan?

103
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,260
What plan?

104
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,740
You danced,

105
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,700
showed off

106
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,820
and get rewarded.

107
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,140
What else do you still want?

108
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,470
Don't pretend any more.

109
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,780
Why do you want the number one token?

110
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,700
Su Youlian.

111
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,640
Your Highness.

112
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,900
Just now at the party,

113
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,860
why didn't you expose Su Youlian directly?

114
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,860
As long as her identity of being the Kunwu clan is exposed,

115
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,380
we can accuse the crown prince of

116
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,980
colluding with the Kunwu clan.

117
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,980
Then he won't have any chance to be favored again.

118
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,640
I just returned to the palace.

119
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,420
If Her Majesty and His Majesty are arrested one after another,

120
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,500
is it too showy for me to expose my ability?

121
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,340
His Majesty must become suspicious.

122
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,220
Moreover,

123
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,740
we just suspect Su Youlian's identity

124
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,430
without certain evidence.

125
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,990
If I plunge into action,

126
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,300
the crown prince might have something on me.

127
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,380
If so, I would be accused of slandering the crown prince.

128
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,510
Then the loss would outweigh the gain.

129
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,980
What if Su Youlian is really sent here to

130
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,580
save Shi Xingyu?

131
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,220
I'm afraid Tianqi State would be in a state of chaos.

132
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,980
Not merely Tianqi

133
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,140
but the whole human clan.

134
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,820
Childe. The guest comes.

135
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,820
Invite him in.

136
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,340
Mother.

137
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,900
It's a pity that

138
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,140
you didn't attend the party.

139
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,200
You didn't see that

140
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,140
how unhappy Concubine Xie

141
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,860
and Long Wei'er looked.

142
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,150
Unexpectedly, Long Wei'er

143
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,780
wants to take the place of you.

144
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,200
She really overestimates her strength.

145
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,230
Speaking of knowing His Majesty's thoughts,

146
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,780
how could the bitch

147
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,460
compare with me?

148
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,780
Thank you, mother.

149
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,820
You need to be more prudent later.

150
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,380
The position of the crown prince

151
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,180
can't be changed by them.

152
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,740
Prince Mu.

153
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
Your Highness.

154
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,460
Sit down, please.

155
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,060
Please.

156
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,500
Your Highness. I'm wondering

157
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,460
why you ask me here today.

158
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,140
I invite you here

159
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,580
to cooperate with you.

160
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,020
You're kidding.

161
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,460
I'm just the prince of Sha State.

162
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,300
How could I cooperate with you?

163
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,300
I'm convinced that Sha State

164
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,260
wouldn't like to be attached to Tianqi forever.

165
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,820
Neither would

166
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,500
you.

167
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,980
Am I right?

168
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,780
Obviously, you

169
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,820
wouldn't like to be inferior to others.

170
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,540
What about...?

171
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,580
Your Highness.

172
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,100
How to cooperate?

173
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,220
Sister.

174
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,780
It would be wonderful if you were with me.

175
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,140
I'm useless,

176
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,980
failing to get the token.

177
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,780
Sister.

178
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,780
Youlian.

179
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,540
Sister.

180
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,180
Youlian.

181
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,460
Prince Mu.

182
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,420
Why are you here?

183
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,460
I just returned from the palace.

184
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,820
It's the Assembly of States today.

185
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,780
It's so bustling so I come out.

186
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,830
You also like the busy atmosphere.

187
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,260
Being away from home,

188
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,180
I feel lonely sometimes.

189
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,540
Only in this busy atmosphere

190
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,420
can I feel a little warm.

191
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,940
But it's not

192
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,980
as good as in my hometown.

193
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,220
The sight stirs up your feelings.

194
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,140
You just miss your hometown.

195
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,740
Let me take you to a place.

196
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,800
Where are we going?

197
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,310
Look for your hometown.

198
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,740
Youlian.

199
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,380
How is your hometown like?

200
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,460
With flowers blooming like a piece of brocade,

201
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,060
in different seasons,

202
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,160
there are different flowers fluttering in the air.

203
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,180
Girls wear rainbow-colored dancing dresses

204
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,580
dance among the flowers,

205
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,700
which is very beautiful.

206
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,620
But it's totally different here

207
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,020
from my hometown.

208
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,140
Prince Mu.

209
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,940
Didn't you say that you would take me to look for my hometown?

210
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,540
Why do you take me here?

211
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,640
Youlian. Look.

212
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,900
Although we are in different situations now,

213
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,340
the sky over us

214
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,020
is still the same.

215
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,060
Yeah.

216
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,580
When I was young, I often

217
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,220
stood on the top of the mountain to watch stars in the sky with my sister.

218
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,980
She also told me stories.

219
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,099
Sister.

220
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,859
Why are there so many stars in the sky?

221
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,339
It's said that after the people of our clan die,

222
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,099
they will become stars hanging in the sky.

223
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,780
Will all of us die?

224
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,460
Someday I will pass away.

225
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,700
If you miss me,

226
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,740
I am just the biggest and brightest star in the sky.

227
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,540
Sister.

228
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,700
You won't die.

229
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,620
You will live forever.

230
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,020
You will stay with me forever.

231
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,940
Tell me

232
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,540
if people will become stars after they die.

233
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,020
Maybe.

234
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,340
Then the brightest one must be my sister.

235
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,020
Sister.

236
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,100
How are you doing there?

237
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,980
Have you ever missed me?

238
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,220
Thank you for taking me here.

239
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,740
Let's hurry back to the Academy.

240
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,200
Otherwise it'll be too late. Then the boundary will be closed.

241
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,260
Ok.

242
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,300
Stop.

243
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,300
Who are you？

244
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,790
Subordinate of General Wu,

245
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,140
ordered to send the captures of the Kunwu clan

246
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,660
to Qingtian State.

247
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,380
Go to have a check.

248
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,300
There is nothing wrong.

249
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,360
Open the city gate.

250
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,660
Open the city gate.

251
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:44,950
Hurry up.

252
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:45,860
Quickly.

253
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,660
Go.

254
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,470
Hurry up.

255
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,070
Quickly.

256
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,780
Got it?

257
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,940
Hurry up.

258
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,260
You old man.

259
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:53,860
Get up.

260
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,580
Get up.

261
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,460
Get up.

262
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,190
Quickly.

263
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,860
Hurry up.

264
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,940
get up. Get up.

265
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,110
Don't play dead.

266
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,020
Get up.

267
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,900
Get up.

268
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,900
Quickly.

269
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,420
Get up.

270
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,260
Get up.

271
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,350
Don't play dead.

272
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,220
Quickly.

273
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,020
Got it?

274
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,900
Hurry up.

275
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,980
Got it? Hurry up.

276
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,820
Get up.

277
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,740
Hurry up.

278
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,700
Go.

279
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,980
Go. Go.

280
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,700
Get up.

281
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,580
Hurry up.

282
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,740
Got it?

283
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,100
Go.

284
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,140
Hurry up.

285
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,460
Get up.

286
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,340
Hurry up.

287
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,270
Youlian.

288
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,100
What are you doing?

289
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,900
Let me go.

290
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,980
Calm down. They are captures of the Kunwu clan.

291
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,740
I know. So I will save them.

292
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,340
Get up.

293
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,620
Even though you want to save them,

294
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,940
how could you appear like this?

295
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,900
If you are exposed,

296
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,940
what can you do?

297
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,780
You know my identity?

298
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,900
I don't care who you are.

299
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,380
In my eyes,

300
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,430
you're just Su Youlian,

301
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,060
my good classmate,

302
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,580
my good friend.

303
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,260
Believe me!

304
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,830
We Sha State doesn't advocate to oppress the Kunwu clan.

305
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,140
In my opinion,

306
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,740
there is no difference between the Kunwu clan and human clan.

307
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,060
Get up.

308
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,260
Get up.

309
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,220
Get up. Go.

310
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,740
Hurry up.

311
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,780
Stop.

312
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,060
Let them go.

313
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,820
Otherwise none of you can leave here alive.

314
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,190
We're ordered by General Wu

315
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,180
to send the captures of Kunwu away.

316
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,220
Who are you?

317
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,460
I'm here to kill you.

318
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,620
Fight.

319
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,580
You are

320
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,100
a member of the Kunwu clan.

321
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,390
Don't come here!

322
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,070
Don't come here.

323
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,620
Don't come here.

324
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,980
Otherwise I will kill him.

325
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,340
Let go of him.

326
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,340
I won't kill you.

327
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,940
If you don't stop, I will kill him really.

328
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,100
General.

329
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,180
General.

330
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,460
No need to care about me.

331
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,900
Go to save the children.

332
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,180
If you keep going, I will kill him.

333
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,460
Don't care me.

334
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,070
Don't come here.

335
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,310
Don't come here.

336
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,380
Kill them.

337
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,660
General You.

338
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,980
Saintess.

339
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,420
I pay my respect to you, saintess.

340
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,500
Why are you here?

341
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,660
I thought you had been dead like others.

342
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,380
Saintess.

343
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,740
At present,

344
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,420
there are few

345
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,060
people of the Kunwu clan

346
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,380
still left.

347
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,340
It's not suitable to talk here.

348
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,340
Let's find a place

349
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,860
to settle down first.

350
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,580
Be careful. It's hot.

351
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,820
Thank you.

352
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,060
Have some water.

353
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,900
Be careful.

354
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Don't get choked.

355
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,860
Be careful It's hot.

356
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,580
Be careful.

357
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,860
Is it enough?

358
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,300
Thank you.

359
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,660
Be careful. It's hot.

360
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,100
Be careful.

361
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,220
Don't choke

362
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,300
Be careful. It's hot.

363
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,460
Saintess.

364
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,180
Let me do it.

365
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:58,900
OK.

366
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,620
Prince Mu.

367
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,740
Thank you for your help today.

368
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
It's my pleasure.

369
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,660
But

370
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,040
it's a pity that

371
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,940
we just saved a few people.

372
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,260
In the world,

373
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,660
there must be many of your compatriots

374
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,860
still suffering.

375
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,780
Prince Mu.

376
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,600
I still have a reasonable demand.

377
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,940
You want to

378
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,900
send them out of the city?

379
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,900
They are from my clan.

380
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,300
I must save them.

381
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,500
OK.

382
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,140
I can help you.

383
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,660
Is everything here?

384
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,380
I t seems so little.

385
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,580
All is here.

386
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,340
They are all of your daily use.

387
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,140
The lord asked me to tell you

388
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,700
to stay in the Academy

389
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,900
because recently it's not peaceful outside,

390
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,100
especially at night.

391
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,300
What happened?

392
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,300
It's said that the prisoners of Kunwu clan

393
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,180
were looted.

394
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,060
Youlian.

395
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,860
Youlian.

396
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,980
I got some cakes from my family.

397
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,580
I will send some to you later.

398
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,320
No, thanks.

399
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,340
Just keep them for yourself.

400
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,260
You are hurt.

401
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,180
It's nothing.

402
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,660
Maybe I was hurt carelessly

403
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,580
when I was practicing Kung fu just now.

404
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,580
Is it serious?

405
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
Nothing serious.

406
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,700
It'll be fine after I wash it.

407
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,460
Rest early.

408
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,460
So strange!

409
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,300
She practiced so late and even got hurt.

410
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,920
How hateful the human clan is!

411
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,780
Unexpectedly they slaughter our compatriots like this.

412
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,900
Devils!

413
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,260
When the Dragon Emperor comes into life,

414
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,620
they will die.

415
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,860
The most important thing now is to get the

416
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,110
to save the Dragon Emperor.

417
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,740
Sorry, master.

418
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,980
I didn't do it well.

419
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,880
By now, I still haven't got the token.

420
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,980
Li Xuan is a stumbling block.

421
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,340
You must get rid of him.

422
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,540
Master.

423
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,860
You mean...

424
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,420
Right.

425
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,940
He has broken our plan many times.

426
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,700
Can you guarantee that

427
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,830
he won't make trouble for us next time?

428
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,020
Master.

429
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,060
You told me

430
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,820
not to act recklessly.

431
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,900
If we rashly kill Li Xuan,

432
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,220
the whole Qingtian city must be in a chaos.

433
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,220
If the human clan looks into it,

434
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,060
it's certain that they will find I am the murderer.

435
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,020
At that time, not only can't we save the Dragon Emperor,

436
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,880
but also we may get involved in it.

437
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,620
Do you really

438
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,100
have a crush on him?

439
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,950
So you don't have the heart to kill him.

440
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,740
I don't.

441
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,820
I just think

442
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,780
it's not in the situation that he must be killed now.

443
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,140
Woman's soft nature.

444
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,500
Look at those compatriots of the Kunwu clan

445
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,940
who are slaughtered.

446
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,320
To save the Dragon Emperor

447
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,340
and the compatriots of the Kunwu clan

448
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,460
is the only purpose of us.

449
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,220
If you don't have the heart to do it

450
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,860
and miss the chance,

451
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,470
can you shoulder the responsibility?

452
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,660
Or are you willing to see your compatriots

453
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,460
being oppressed by the human clan?

454
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,900
I am not.

455
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,460
I just

456
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,140
think the most important thing now

457
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,660
is to send the compatriots that we saved today out of the city.

458
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,660
Of course it is.

459
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,820
But Li Xuan needs to be killed sooner or later.

460
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,120
Your Highness.

461
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,220
You helped Miss. Su

462
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,180
to save the captures of the Kunwu clan,

463
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,860
which is really too dangerous.

464
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,700
Don't forget

465
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,580
our purpose this time.

466
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,980
We're here to help her save the people of her clan.

467
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,500
By helping her, we are just helping ourselves.

468
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,140
Later,

469
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,550
we will also help Youlian to save the Dragon Emperor.

470
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,380
I can't make her adventure by herself.

471
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,540
It must make the people in the city alert.

472
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,420
If anything goes wrong,

473
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,660
I'm afraid

474
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,620
it won't end smoothly.

475
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,900
I will arrange it then.

476
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,150
Seems like she is really angry with me.

477
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,460
Must I kill Li Xuan

478
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,620
to save my companion?

479
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,340
Xiao Fengming is an idiot.

480
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,270
I wonder why he always avoids me recently.

481
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,780
Why?

482
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,980
Tell me why.

483
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,500
Since he is an idiot,

484
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,020
why bother missing him?

485
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,700
I don't.

486
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,860
Idiot.

487
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,460
It seems to be him.

488
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,340
He looks strange.

489
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,060
It's nearly midnight.

490
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,960
Why doesn't he go back to the dormitory to sleep?

491
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,860
Where is he going?

492
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,420
Is he sleepwalking again?

493
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,740
Let's go to have a look.

494
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,739
Xiao Fengming

495
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:14,940
This way?

496
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,380
Or this way?

497
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,699
Why does he disappear suddenly?

498
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,820
Let's look for him from different directions.

499
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,260
Go to check there.

500
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,620
I will go this way.

501
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,780
Your Highness, I can't let you take risk alone.

502
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,820
There is nothing dangerous.

503
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,659
Go ahead.

504
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,139
Xiao Fengming

505
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,340
Xiao Fengming

506
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,940
Is that you?

507
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,020
Xiao Fengming

508
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,140
Don't scare me.

509
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,940
Xiao Fengming.

510
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,740
Is that you?

511
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,460
Xiao Fengming.

512
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,220
I told you not to scare me.

513
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,480
Your Highness.

514
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,480
Your Highness.

515
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,100
Xiao Fengming is here.

516
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,170
Hurry up here.

517
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,700
Come here. Ying.

518
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,660
Why does he sleep here?

519
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,370
Why?

520
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,060
Let's go.

521
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,140
Go.

522
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,220
Xiao Fengming.

523
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,480
Your Highness.

524
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,980
It's Xiao Fengming.

525
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:33,860
Idiot.

526
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,140
Wake up.

527
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,580
Princess Yunshan.

528
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,740
What's up?

529
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,070
Come in, please.

530
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,780
Stop.

531
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,260
Where to sit?

532
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,420
Go to...

533
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,620
My god.

534
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,020
I sleepwalked again.

535
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,940
Xiao Fengming. Awesome!

536
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,780
You...

537
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,900
You sleepwalked to Her Highness's residence.

538
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,780
I sleepwalked.

539
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,180
Of course I don't know where to go.

540
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,220
Sorry.

541
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,260
Sorry.

542
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,700
Looking for him the whole night,

543
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,790
unexpectedly he is sleeping here.

544
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,980
You look for him

545
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,020
and he looks for you.

546
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,220
Gossip.

547
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,740
Your Highness.

548
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,220
Li Xuan, are you OK?

549
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,500
You seldom attend class

550
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,740
but ask us to have lessons in the early morning.

551
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,780
Are you OK?

552
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,700
Brother Xiao.

553
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,100
Apologize to her.

554
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,740
Let's go.

555
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,500
Youlian.

556
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,100
Prince Mu.

557
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,140
Why is he here again?

558
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,780
As annoying as a fly.

559
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,700
Li Xuan.

560
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,100
Do you know

561
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,260
the prisoners of the Kunwu clan were looted last night?

562
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,140
And then?

563
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,100
Come here and I will tell you.

564
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,860
No.

565
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,260
You have to come here.

566
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,990
You are the nation-protecting master. Let's go.

567
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,700
Last night, my father sent people here to tell me that

568
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,380
some people of the Kunwu clan

569
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,700
were hidden outside the city secretly.

570
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,940
Is it true?

571
00:38:59,220 --> 00:38:59,940
Even so,

572
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,660
why could your father tell you?

573
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,180
He is afraid that my sister and I may go out to have fun.

574
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,420
Listen. Li Xuan.

575
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,300
Don't go out these days.

576
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,300
Perhaps

577
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,700
the people of Kunwu clan

578
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,700
might take action these days.

579
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,940
Is that all?

580
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,870
OK. I'll be back.

581
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,060
Li Xuan.

582
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,060
I'm serious.

583
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,580
You mustn't go out of the city.

584
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,910
Really there are people of the Kunwu clan.

585
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,260
Prince Mu.

586
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,880
Do you think what she said is true?

587
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,380
How many people were caught?

588
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,420
And who saved them?

589
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,220
Both were clear to us last night.

590
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,900
If really there are some people hidden outside the city,

591
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,380
your compatriots must have told you last night.

592
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,740
What if Uncle You'an

593
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,300
doesn't know it, either?

594
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,420
Cui Pianran wouldn't talk with

595
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,180
Li Xuan about the Kunwu clan for no reason.

596
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,710
Be careful not to be tricked

597
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,220
Let me inquire about it first

598
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,350
and then make a plan.

599
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,880
It's sensible.

600
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,940
Thank you. Prince Mu.

601
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,980
It's my pleasure.

602
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,420
Youlian.

603
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,660
I know

604
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,740
you are angry with me because of the event in the Assembly of States,

605
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,200
so you are alienated from me intentionally.

606
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,620
Actually I can apologize to you.

607
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,940
As for my identity,

608
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,670
I have to take my face into consideration.

609
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,620
Here is a chance.

610
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,340
Youlian, I'm coming.

611
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,260
Youlian.

612
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,230
Your book almost felt down.

613
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,140
You dead fly!

614
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,420
Youlian.

615
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,310
Don't believe this hypocrite!

616
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,500
How terrible!

617
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,350
Here you are.

618
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,340
Look out later.

619
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,860
It's my fault.

620
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,820
Never mind.

621
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,260
I'll be careful later.

622
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,580
Is it true?

623
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:16,940
Youlian.

624
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,580
Don't believe him.

625
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,430
He is not sincere to you.

626
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,740
I am sincere.

627
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,100
Youlian.

628
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,140
Wonderful!

629
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,660
No. Youlian.

630
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,820
No.

631
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:34,820
My heart

632
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,060
is aching.

633
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,100
You're right, Mentor.

634
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,030
It's right to teach the Kunwu clan.

635
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,660
Yeah!

636
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,500
Teach them.

637
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,300
Teach them!

638
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,310
There there.

639
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,020
Be quiet.

640
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,420
Though the Kunwu clan is weak now,

641
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,340
we can't relax our vigilance.

642
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,140
As for this point,

643
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,060
you must remember it.

644
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,340
Is it true that you two...?

645
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,420
See it?

646
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,860
You feel sad, right?
