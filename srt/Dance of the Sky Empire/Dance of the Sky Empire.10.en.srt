00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,870
Dance of the Sky Empire

3
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,870
Episode 10

4
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,950
You see that?

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,400
Are you hurting inside?

6
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
Get lost.

7
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,190
Hear my last words.

8
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,539
I'll go out on a limb and guess that

9
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,160
Su Youlian must have her eye

10
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,080
on Prince Yu Fengmu for his royal status.

11
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
That's why she...

12
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,290
I told you to go away.

13
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,320
Li Xuan.

14
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,780
What are you doing?

15
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,360
I'm going back to sleep.

16
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,190
Sleep?

17
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,910
You're supposed to listen carefully

18
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,750
in my class.

19
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,520
Your class makes me sleepy.

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,450
I'd better go back to sleep instead of sleeping here.

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,600
You!

22
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,110
How dare you!

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
What I'm lecturing on

24
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,360
is the trick against Kunwu clan.

25
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,360
How could you do your job well as Nation-protecting Master

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,270
to protect human clan

27
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,610
if you don't listen in my class?

28
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,110
Kunwu clan

29
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,440
is nothing to be scared of.

30
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,190
You!

31
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,600
Stop right there.

32
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,630
Li Xuan.

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,240
How could you say something like that

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,970
as Nation-protecting Master?

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,630
Fine.

36
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,480
You think you can handle Kunwu clan easily?

37
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,390
The fugitives from Kunwu clan arrested outside the city yesterday

38
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,270
got hijacked.

39
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,490
His Majesty ordered to arrest

40
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:01,160
the Kunwu fugitives and the accomplices.

41
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,830
If you're so confident in yourself,

42
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
I'll let you guard

43
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,280
the city gate from today.

44
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,240
You can't let slip anyone of them.

45
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,330
And you who were stirring up just now.

46
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,520
Go with him.

47
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,240
Be careful.

48
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,160
Easy.

49
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,520
Here, easy.

50
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,160
Be careful.

51
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,390
Your Highness.

52
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you so much.

53
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,410
It's all right.

54
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,440
Easy.

55
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,680
Scarred Head.

56
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,750
Give me a hand.

57
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,440
Your Highness.

58
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,220
You may get yourself into trouble

59
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,200
for rescuing the Kunwu clan.

60
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,019
Kunwu and the State of Sha have been getting along well.

61
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,490
Now they're in trouble.

62
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,480
How can we just stand by and do nothing?

63
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,829
You're just too kind.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,950
Okay, stop it.

65
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,270
Come and help.

66
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,530
Your Highness.

67
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,610
I'm sorry for making you the trouble.

68
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,320
It's okay.

69
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,260
Don't listen to Scarred Head.

70
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,950
It's not easy to get

71
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,350
so many people out of the city.

72
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,270
The plan is to meet the lord of Yaohui City.

73
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,140
Hiding them in the wagon train

74
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,320
can avoid being noticed.

75
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,320
But Li Xuan is

76
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,930
guarding the city gate today.

77
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,780
We are sent to guard the city gate.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,480
But why still so many soldiers here?

79
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,880
What are they doing here?

80
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,270
Go ask him.

81
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,600
Him?

82
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,000
Just give it up.

83
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,720
Don't waste the time.

84
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,760
Don't drag me and Feng Changqing into this.

85
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,720
Let's go.

86
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,550
Boring.

87
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,000
It's so good.

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,510
We can finally go home.

89
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,760
Yes! We can go home now!

90
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,270
It's so good!

91
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,230
Relax.

92
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,070
I'm here.

93
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,070
Hold on.

94
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,640
We need to do a check.

95
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,550
What's going on?

96
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,640
The city gate checking.

97
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,320
General, thanks for the hard work.

98
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,200
This is Prince Mu's carriages.

99
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,100
We're heading to Yaohui City.

100
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,750
Here's the check-out document.

101
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,880
[Documents for customs clearance]

102
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,159
Oh, His Highness.

103
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,110
Please.

104
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,830
Thank you.

105
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,040
Clear.

106
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,470
Wait a minute.

107
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,880
You can't leave now.

108
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,350
You're Miss Cui.

109
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,670
General,

110
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,640
this is how you do your work?

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,270
You just let them go without a check.

112
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,790
Mentor in Chief Xie did not send us here

113
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,450
for doing what you just did.

114
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,720
I...

115
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,790
This is the prince of the State of Sha.

116
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,600
Miss Cui.

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,730
The general has given us the permission to leave.

118
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,640
Prince Mu.

119
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,960
Since you're escorting loads of silver and gold to Yaohui City,

120
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,520
why bring Su Youlian?

121
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,909
What's the relationship between you?

122
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,230
Oh,

123
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,280
is she your new princess-to-be?

124
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,000
This is a private business.

125
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,150
Do we have the obligation to tell you?

126
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,670
Prince Mu,

127
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,890
Su Youlian is a suspected target.

128
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,320
Since now you're connected,

129
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,670
I'll show no mercy then.

130
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:08,840
Search them.

131
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,790
Yes, madam.

132
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,230
How dare you!

133
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,150
Scarred Head.

134
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,280
We are just doing our job.

135
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,640
I don't care.

136
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,790
No one can

137
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,910
search Prince Mu's carriage.

138
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,640
Your boxes seem to have living things in there.

139
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,170
Miss Cui.

140
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,280
Get out of my way.

141
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,710
Li Xuan.

142
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,710
Give it to me. I'll break it into pieces.

143
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,550
No.

144
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,470
Su Youlian.

145
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,840
The sword is yours.

146
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,790
Then I'll take it up with you.

147
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,320
Stop it.

148
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,010
Li Xuan.

149
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,280
You are still defending her.

150
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,610
Why can't you just admit that you like her?

151
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,280
What told you that?

152
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,350
I want to remind you that

153
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,150
we're not here

154
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,840
for a sword today.

155
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,400
Thanks for the reminder.

156
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,150
I found the boxes were strange just now.

157
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,200
There are even noises coming out from there. You must have heard it too.

158
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,880
Miss Cui.

159
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,440
It was the cat making the noises.

160
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,200
The cat?

161
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,230
Nothing else?

162
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,000
No.

163
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,210
The rest are goods.

164
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,150
You may go now.

165
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,550
Yes.

166
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,520
Prince Mu's carriage is not searched yet.

167
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,120
Do you think anyone is qualified to search Prince Mu's carriage?

168
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,840
Of course not.

169
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,030
He is the Prince.

170
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,910
How can anyone search his carriage?

171
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,840
Li Xuan.

172
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,590
You are the Nation-protecting Master.

173
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,280
Yes.

174
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,790
So I'll search it myself.

175
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,110
Do you have to do this?

176
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,230
Yes.

177
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,710
Li Xuan.

178
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,550
You want to beg me?

179
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,310
You should go beg him.

180
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,170
Has Mr. Li found anything?

181
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,550
Well,

182
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,210
I didn't find anything.

183
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,030
But

184
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,230
are you in a hurry for a date?

185
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,310
Since you didn't find anything, just let us go.

186
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,280
Us?

187
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,620
You just met him for a few days.

188
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,440
Li Xuan.

189
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,840
Li Xuan.

190
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,230
Soldiers.

191
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,400
Clear.

192
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,350
Li Xuan.

193
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,080
You really search everywhere?

194
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,960
Let them go.

195
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,320
Clear.

196
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,790
The class is so boring.

197
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,640
Ying, I need a towel

198
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,960
to clean my face

199
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,550
and clear my head.

200
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,410
Your Highness, you must be very tired.

201
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't know what's so good

202
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
of General Wu De.

203
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,900
Why betrothing you to him?

204
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,710
Otherwise we don't even need to sneak out

205
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,550
here in Mo Yun Academy to suffer.

206
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,320
You mean coming here with me

207
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,200
is a suffering for you?

208
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,150
I dare not.

209
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,590
I just find that after you came here to the State of Tian Qi,

210
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,520
your hair and skin are not better than before.

211
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,970
Maybe it's because you're not bathing in milk anymore.

212
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,590
Really?

213
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,000
Yes.

214
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,000
What else can I do?

215
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,790
Instead of marrying the ugly guy,

216
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,590
I'd rather live and die in Mo Yun Academy.

217
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,520
Your Highness, what kind of man do you want to marry in the future?

218
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,200
I will marry

219
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,080
a real big hero.

220
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,110
Like...

221
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,880
How can I think of the nerd?

222
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,880
You mean someone like Prince Mu?

223
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,670
Yes.

224
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,230
Just like my brother.

225
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,640
Good-looking,

226
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,570
and skillful in martial arts.

227
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,910
But is there another Prince Mu

228
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,350
on earth?

229
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,400
Ying, who is it?

230
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,280
Just a servant.

231
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,710
Your Highness.

232
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,890
Your Highness.

233
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,080
Someone sent an invitation

234
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,200
hoping to see you.

235
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,200
Who?

236
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,200
[Yu Min]

237
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,880
The son of some Duke.

238
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,440
No.

239
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,550
Your Highness.

240
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,230
It's just a meeting.

241
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,960
What if the little duke

242
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:07,280
happens to be the Mr. Right you're looking for?

243
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,800
Really?

244
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,800
It's just a meeting.

245
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,560
We have nothing to lose.

246
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,160
Yeah.

247
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,230
Well...

248
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,470
Where is

249
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,950
this little duke?

250
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,640
He's waiting at the pavilion in the academy

251
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,589
for you.

252
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,040
Let's go.

253
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,190
Let's go meet him.

254
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,020
Your Highness.

255
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,500
Is that man there the duke?

256
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,640
He looks quite handsome

257
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,830
from here.

258
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,230
I'm afraid he's attractive looking from afar

259
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,160
but disappointing when taking a closer look.

260
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,950
Let's go.

261
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,040
Are you the little duke?

262
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,680
This guy seems so familiar.

263
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,190
It's him.

264
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,110
I'm Yu Min,

265
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,520
the son of the Princess of the State of Tian Qi and Duke Yu.

266
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,250
Nice to see you, Your Highness.

267
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,710
It's you.

268
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,160
Your Highness, you still remember me.

269
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,230
Shameless womanizer.

270
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,560
How can I forget you?

271
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,590
Emm...

272
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,680
Your Highness, I think you get me wrong.

273
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,280
Princess, your prettiness

274
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,430
makes me can't stop admiring.

275
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,640
Go admire others.

276
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,810
Don't show up in front of me again.

277
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,470
Your Highness.

278
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,330
Your Highness.

279
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,680
Please hear me out.

280
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,310
Get out of my way.

281
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,760
I don't want to hear a word.

282
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,640
I'm doing this because

283
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,070
I really have affection for you.

284
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,000
Are you getting out of my way or not?

285
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,260
Your Highness.

286
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,040
-I'll show you no mercy -Is she being bothered?

287
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,350
if you don't go away.

288
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,550
No, it's impossible.

289
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,280
How can she be bothered?

290
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Xiao Fengming.

291
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,350
I get it.

292
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,160
No, come over here.

293
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,400
You just said that you had affection for me.

294
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,400
There's not just you who have affection for me

295
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,110
in this world.

296
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,190
This childe

297
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,040
confessed his feelings for me ahead of you.

298
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,560
I...

299
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,560
You?

300
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,400
What's wrong with him?

301
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,160
He's the one

302
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,280
who fought hard

303
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,870
so we could defeat Kylin.

304
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,090
And look at his appearance.

305
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,920
He's way more handsome than you.

306
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,430
A big hero with such good looks

307
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,160
and great martial art skills

308
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,470
deserves to like me.

309
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,070
No.

310
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Sir, sir...

311
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,280
The praise is far more than I deserve.

312
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,070
Let me explain.

313
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:15,760
Shut up now.

314
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,350
You just pissed him off.

315
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,000
Look at them.

316
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,310
Princess Yunshan.

317
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,800
Why are you making jokes on me?

318
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,160
I...

319
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,640
I'm not making jokes on you.

320
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,760
Look at the princess.

321
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,560
Look at them. They must be a couple.

322
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,760
They must be a couple.

323
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,880
You saw what was happening.

324
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:42,310
If I hadn't said that, he would have kept bothering me.

325
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,560
But you shouldn't have used me

326
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,160
to degrade the childe.

327
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,590
Her Highness was complimenting you just now.

328
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,920
Don't forget yourself.

329
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,950
Her Highness

330
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,760
had never complimented other men like that

331
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,800
except Prince Mu.

332
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,520
Don't kiss and tell.

333
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,710
You...

334
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,830
You...

335
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,640
You are...

336
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
The master's saying is so right.

337
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,350
"Girls and small-minded people are hard to get along with."

338
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,010
I'll go on sweeping the floor.

339
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,000
Look, he's being shy.

340
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,160
Look at him.

341
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,590
Ying.

342
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,560
Girls and small-minded people. What's that?

343
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,680
Was he saying that I'm small-minded?

344
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,710
Your Highness, take it easy.

345
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,590
The nerd is just so ungrateful.

346
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,040
Let's ignore him.

347
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,350
Ungrateful nerd!

348
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,880
Thank you, Saintess and Prince Mu.

349
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,920
We appreciate your great kindness.

350
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,400
Rise, everyone.

351
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,860
Rise, General You.

352
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,360
Thank you, Saintess.

353
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,420
You don't need to kneel down to me.

354
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,920
It's my destiny

355
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,280
to save people of Kunwu clan.

356
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,570
General You' An.

357
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,400
I'll leave it to you

358
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,950
to protect these people now.

359
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,120
Please save Dragon Emperor.

360
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,800
Only if Dragon Emperor wakes up,

361
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,920
will Kunwu clan have to chance to rise again

362
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,190
and be reborn.

363
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,760
Don't worry.

364
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,530
No matter what the cost is,

365
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,110
I will save Dragon Emperor.

366
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,310
Thank you, Saintess.

367
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,940
Do you think Li Xuan

368
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,560
found them?

369
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,800
Soldiers.

370
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,040
Clear.

371
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,460
You're still thinking about Miss Su?

372
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,600
Since you think her suspicious,

373
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,120
why didn't you test her out?

374
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,000
So Li Xuan already knows

375
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,920
who you are?

376
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm not sure.

377
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,310
If he knew my identity,

378
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,290
he wouldn't have let us go.

379
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,110
Li Xuan is very cunning.

380
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,920
We have to keep on guard against him.

381
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,160
Since the clan matter is settled,

382
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,160
the top priority now is to get the token.

383
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,310
I see.

384
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,520
Hurry up.

385
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,920
Wait for me.

386
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,640
Hurry, hurry.

387
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,350
It's true.

388
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,450
Yes. It's true.

389
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,350
I saw it.

390
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,710
I saw it with my own eyes.

391
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,230
Yes. We all saw it.

392
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,350
I'm wondering when they started.

393
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,830
Right.

394
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,230
They started long ago.

395
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,430
There's no sign of it.

396
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,400
That's not right.

397
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,930
They are keeping it from us.

398
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,710
Hello.

399
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,430
What are you laughing about?

400
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,560
We are laughing about how good you are.

401
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,640
Xiao,

402
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,400
You really impress me.

403
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,350
I didn't know that

404
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,640
you could hook up with Yunshan.

405
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,310
I

406
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,920
am jealous.

407
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,830
Bian,

408
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,900
you can't make up these nonsense.

409
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,400
I'm making it up?

410
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,470
You were behaving so intimately with each other yesterday at the pavilion.

411
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,590
These classmates

412
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,830
all saw that.

413
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,110
Am I right?

414
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,430
Yes.

415
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,440
That's right.

416
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,920
We were not behaving intimately.

417
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,710
We...

418
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,830
It's hard to explain.

419
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,070
No?

420
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,110
I knew it from the start that you two were different with each other.

421
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,190
Don't tell me that you don't have

422
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,400
at least a little feeling for Princess Yunshan.

423
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,590
How could I have feelings for Princess Yunshan?

424
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,560
Okay.

425
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
You have to swear.

426
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,000
I, Xiao Fengming will

427
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,660
never like Princess Yunshan.

428
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,490
Princess Yunshan.

429
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,560
Cui.

430
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,350
You...

431
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
I...

432
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,410
I don't need you to like me.

433
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,350
Yunshan, our classroom is over there.

434
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,830
You mess up with

435
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,350
the wrong person.

436
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,760
You!

437
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,270
You don't even deserve me, okay?

438
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,710
Yunshan.

439
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,470
Bro,

440
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,040
good job.

441
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,710
Good.

442
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,210
You're doing very well.

443
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,190
Now I'll repeat the key points.

444
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,640
You need to sink your breath to the dan tian.

445
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,920
Stay focused.

446
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,560
Do not get distracted.

447
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,070
Use your mind and spiritual power

448
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,830
to control the floating brush.

449
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,590
Very good.

450
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,830
Nice.

451
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,920
Keep it up.

452
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,920
[Kind]

453
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,800
[Qian]

454
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,430
Very good.

455
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,830
Mento in Chief, look.

456
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,710
I did it.

457
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,590
I did it.

458
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,110
I finally did it.

459
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,190
Look at

460
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,230
what the nerd did.

461
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,070
That's so silly.

462
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,110
Right.

463
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,190
Okay, stop laughing.

464
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,830
I told you

465
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,680
to stay focused.

466
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,140
Don't get distracted.

467
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,880
Or your efforts will be wasted.

468
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,070
Come on.

469
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,800
Start over, everyone.

470
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,370
Mento in Chief Xie,

471
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,190
your class is so boring.

472
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,710
Li Xuan.

473
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,210
What's the matter with you again?

474
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,640
I have an idea.

475
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,410
It can cultivate our spiritual powers

476
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,520
and be more interesting than your class.

477
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,190
Good.

478
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,280
Please tell.

479
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,190
We can have a Spiritual Ball Match.

480
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,760
The winners can rest for half a day.

481
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,830
And the losers

482
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,710
should clean the whole academy.

483
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,710
What do you think?

484
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,000
Good.

485
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,930
It's a good idea.

486
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,310
I haven't played ball for a long time.

487
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,350
I can't wait.

488
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,400
Okay.

489
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,560
Since you're all very interested,

490
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,830
let's do it.

491
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:48,880
Great.

492
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,520
Great.

493
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,310
Let's go.

494
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,040
Let's go get changed.

495
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,590
Go.

496
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,880
Go, go, go.

497
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,800
Youlian, let's go back to the dorm and get changed.

498
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,400
Come on.

499
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,350
No.

500
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,040
Why?

501
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,070
Spiritual Ball Match is very interesting.

502
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,710
I think we can have a try.

503
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,200
I don't know the rules. I don't think I should join.

504
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,310
Okay, I'll go get changed then.

505
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,570
You can think about it.

506
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,710
Su Youlian.

507
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,310
What?

508
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,590
Don't you want the No.1 Token?

509
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,820
You join the match.

510
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,580
If you win, I'll give it to you.

511
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,110
Are you being serious?

512
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,430
Of course.

513
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,470
It'll be so easy to win you.

514
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,920
You can't team up with him.

515
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,470
Why?

516
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,110
No reason.

517
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,570
If you want to get the token,

518
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,830
don't count on him.

519
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,520
Fine.

520
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,600
I won't count on him.

521
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,160
It's just so easy to win you.

522
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,230
Good luck.

523
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,830
Now let me announce the rules.

524
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,350
There will be two teams in the match

525
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,830
with six at most in each team.

526
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,810
The participants are allowed to move freely

527
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,000
within the spiritual ward I created.

528
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
People outside the court can't use spiritual power to affect the match.

529
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,110
There's no specific restriction in the match.

530
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,190
But I'll call the foul if there's a malicious wounding.

531
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,990
Worst offenders will be suspended from the match.

532
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,280
The position of the goal is fixed

533
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,800
and the goal is rotating regularly.

534
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,040
Ball holders can scores one point for shooting the ball into the goal.

535
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,560
The team with higher scores will be the winner.

536
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,070
The match will last for the duration of a burning joss stick.

537
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,160
Each team has one chance to call a halt.

538
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,830
Okay.

539
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,470
The match is about to begin.

540
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,190
It's not a normal ball.

541
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,870
You can't manipulate it easily.

542
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,160
Xuan.

543
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,070
It's so tiring.

544
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:18,760
Xuan.

545
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,240
Why are we doing this?

546
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,880
We're asking for troubles.

547
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,710
Bian Lingcheng.

548
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,040
Don't just stand there.

549
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,520
No, no, no.

550
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,470
Don't.

551
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,710
Why are standing there?

552
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,430
Throw the ball.

553
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,000
I...I can't.

554
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,000
Pass it to me.

555
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,910
Li Xuan's team scores one point.

556
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,830
Good. Great.

557
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,040
Youlian, don't be upset.

558
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,909
It's just the beginning.

559
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:10,170
We still have chances.

560
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,230
Su,

561
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,760
I'm sorry.

562
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,280
I'm holding our team back.

563
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,909
I don't even know what you're scared of.

564
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:22,230
It's just a spiritual ball.

565
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,230
The ball moves.

566
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,800
I can't control it.

567
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,150
If you can't control it, just hit it.

568
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,040
I...

569
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,050
The spiritual ball is like human.

570
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,580
It bullies the weak and fears the strong.

571
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,389
Enough, Yunshan.

572
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,429
Stop judging him.

573
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:39,190
Li Xuan seems to be a study slacker,

574
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,239
but he's doing quite good in kicking the ball.

575
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,239
The match continues.

576
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,520
Let's go on.

577
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,670
Catch it.

578
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,470
Well done. Amazing.

579
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,760
So great.

580
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,690
Youlian, are you alright?

581
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,680
Are you okay?

582
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,320
It was a mistake.

583
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,760
A mistake?

584
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,630
Can I slap you by mistake?

585
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,040
You were breaking the rules.

586
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,150
Forget it, Yunshan.

587
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,010
This is a match.

588
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,760
It's a fair bump.

589
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,430
If you break the rules again,

590
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,120
I will substitute you for someone else.

591
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,560
Li Xuan.

592
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,300
How is your team doing?

593
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,380
Are you doing okay?

594
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,870
We can stop here.

595
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,470
Why?

596
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,520
We will go on.

597
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,950
Li Xuan.

598
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,360
You'd better get your teammate under control.

599
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,150
If she plays tricks again,

600
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,430
I'll show no mercy to her.

601
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,320
The match continues.

602
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,040
Let's go.

603
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,390
Are you okay?

604
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,800
I don't believe that I can't control the ball.

605
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,670
For the token, I have to win.

606
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,040
Xuan.

607
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,360
Is the ball going crazy?

608
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,760
It's going mad suddenly.

609
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,360
Su Youlian.

610
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,410
Let go of your hands.

611
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,160
You'll get yourself killed.

612
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,870
Youlian, be careful.

613
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,840
Youlian.

614
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,160
Youlian.

615
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,000
Su.

616
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,600
Are you okay?

617
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,520
Come.

618
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,520
Get up.

619
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,390
Come on.

620
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,810
Are you okay?

621
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,530
Youlian, how are you feeling?

622
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,390
Timeout.

623
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,280
I need a rest.

624
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,690
Are your legs alright?

625
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,320
It's okay.

626
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,120
I'm really okay.

627
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,630
How are you doing?

628
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,430
This way.

629
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,040
Okay.

630
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,190
The spiritual ball is so hard to control.

631
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,850
The more strength I use, the more it fights back.

632
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,320
The spiritual ball is Lord Zi's treasure.

633
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,190
Of course it's not easy to control.

634
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,600
I think they are bound

635
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,760
to lose.

636
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,840
Youlian.

637
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,710
You're hurt.

638
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,430
Why don't we just give up?

639
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,950
No, I won't give up.

640
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,280
The match continues.

641
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,280
Su Youlian.

642
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,290
Why do you want the token so badly?

643
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,580
If it goes on like that,

644
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,400
she may get herself killed.

645
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,910
Xiao Fengming, hurry.

646
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,520
Okay.

647
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,690
What are you doing?

648
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,800
Are you okay?

649
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,120
I'm okay.

650
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,710
You're amazing.

651
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,710
You couldn't even score a goal within such a close distance.

652
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,560
That's brilliant.

653
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,280
Idiot.

654
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,630
I think you should

655
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,710
stop struggling.

656
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,710
You can't even control the ball.

657
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,430
Let's stop.

658
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,910
You can't win.

659
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,140
Why should we stop?

660
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,330
The game is just getting started.

661
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:59,760
Okay.

662
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,910
Turns out it need spiritual power to

663
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,970
buffer the impact of spiritual ball.

664
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,630
Youlian, be careful.
