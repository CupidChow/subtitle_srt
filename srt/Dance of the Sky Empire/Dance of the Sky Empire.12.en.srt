00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,830
Dance of the sky Empire

3
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,830
Episode 12

4
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,550
Is it tasty?

5
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,360
Yes, very tasty.

6
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,480
But it is a bit bland.

7
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,810
Do you know I cooked all these dishes for Youlian?

8
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,670
I have saved her life.

9
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,880
Why can't I eat these dishes as a reward?

10
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,740
I deserve some gratitude, right?

11
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,640
Can these fill up your stomach?

12
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,720
Eat this, too.

13
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,040
If they are not enough, I will cook more for you.

14
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,130
These are enough for me.

15
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,190
Delicious!

16
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,960
So yummy!

17
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,860
Did you cook all these?

18
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,750
It is unexpected to you, right?

19
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,150
What do you think of them?

20
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,320
Don't you think I am awesome?

21
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,360
Come closer.

22
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,740
Hurry to dig in.

23
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,360
The dishes are getting cold.

24
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,670
Come on.

25
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,159
Eat more.

26
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,480
Hurry to taste them.

27
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,070
Come on.

28
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,830
Eat this.

29
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,200
Are you all right, grandpa?

30
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,670
You naughty lad!

31
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,550
Grandpa.

32
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,830
Well,

33
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,600
do you really know everything?

34
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,270
You don't believe?

35
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,670
People address me as the Elder of the Book of Heaven

36
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,070
in respect.

37
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,670
Grandpa.

38
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,950
Well,

39
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,070
I have one question for you.

40
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,320
Could you please answer it?

41
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,720
No.

42
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,830
The god's design can't be divulged.

43
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,200
Moreover, I am a principled person.

44
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,200
Though I am a principled person ,

45
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
I can break rules for you this time.

46
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,460
I will take one question from you.

47
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,640
Go ahead.

48
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,000
You need not tell me your question.

49
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,480
I know what it is.

50
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,670
So yummy! So palatable!

51
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,230
You want to ask me about the lass, right?

52
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,040
She has a thing for you, too.

53
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,760
Re-really?

54
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,670
Then she and I…

55
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,210
Fill my bowl with rice.

56
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,320
It's done.

57
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,370
Please enjoy it.

58
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,670
This rice is well cooked.

59
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,790
It is neither soft nor hard.

60
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,600
It is quite to my taste.

61
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,880
I will take another question from you.

62
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,760
Is she

63
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,110
my own kind?

64
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:37,669
Mr. old man.

65
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,970
Why are you in a trance?

66
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,430
Yes, she is your own kind.

67
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,550
Really?

68
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,320
She is my kind.

69
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,750
Did you misjudge her?

70
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,670
I,

71
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,470
I have never misjudged anyone.

72
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,280
I just know it.

73
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
I just know that the damn Long Wei'er

74
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,690
has deceived me.

75
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,890
Su Youlian couldn't be one member of the Kunwu Clan.

76
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,470
You brat!

77
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
What are you muttering to yourself?

78
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,110
So delicious!

79
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,030
I am full.

80
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,590
Go fetch me a cup of tea.

81
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,070
Can't you do it yourself?

82
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,350
If you don't do it for me,

83
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,880
you will regret.

84
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,150
Have you fed my Wangcai?

85
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,670
Oh, poor kiddo!

86
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,440
Oh, kiddo!

87
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,030
Who is it?

88
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,910
What are you doing?

89
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,110
My heart aches for this poor baby.

90
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,080
She was born last night. Because she is a baby girl,

91
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,080
her father didn't like her and wanted to abandon her.

92
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,760
Look!

93
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,030
Her mum entrusted someone to escort her out,

94
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,550
but they ran into the robbers on the way.

95
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,550
This baby is really pathetic.

96
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,500
You have been watching this for the whole night?

97
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,790
Tell me.

98
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,000
She is very cute, right?

99
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,840
Being cute is useless.

100
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,140
She was not in luck.

101
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,640
At birth, her family was partly dispersed and partly dead.

102
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,040
It is not sure whether she can grow up or not.

103
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,080
If I could raise her, I would not be so sad.

104
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,350
Look at her little hands and feet.

105
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,440
I want to touch them so much.

106
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,550
That is simple.

107
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,520
I will bring her to you.

108
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,640
This happened 18 years ago.

109
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,910
She should be a young woman now.

110
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,000
Are you out of your mind?

111
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,660
Why are you watching what happened 18 years ago?

112
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,180
I am just looking back on the past.

113
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,710
If you were a baby,

114
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,470
I would be so happy.

115
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,910
Are you insane?

116
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,150
Why do you want to raise a baby so much?

117
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,880
What is wrong with that?

118
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,640
She is cute indeed.

119
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,280
But you can't get one baby

120
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,350
out of nowhere.

121
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,880
You can't bring her here, either.

122
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,910
You can't give birth to a child, right?

123
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,000
I do want to raise a child,

124
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,800
but it need not to be my blood.

125
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,000
If not, how?

126
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,350
Get married.

127
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,640
You geezer, did you say that seriously?

128
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,100
You want us to get married?

129
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,640
Yes, I do.

130
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,150
I also want you to give birth to a child.

131
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,550
Giving birth to a child is the top priority.

132
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,150
I got it.

133
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,890
You want to use us to fulfill your wish.

134
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,230
Why did you put it that way?

135
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,960
This Land of Mystery belongs to me.

136
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,350
I make the call.

137
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,280
But…

138
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,640
But what?

139
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,550
Brat.

140
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
Tell me.

141
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,080
Do you want to marry her?

142
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,470
I got it.

143
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,970
Needless to say, you do.

144
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,790
Lass.

145
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,200
Babe.

146
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Do you want to

147
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,640
get married with him?

148
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,110
I,

149
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,230
I can't.

150
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,110
What?

151
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,080
I beg your pardon.

152
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,350
Grandpa.

153
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,350
Such is the case.

154
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,000
You see,

155
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,880
marriage is a big event in one's life.

156
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,760
She is a girl.

157
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,910
She should be given time to think about it.

158
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,440
Why need she think about it?

159
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,710
It is such a simple thing.

160
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,000
We are the only three people here.

161
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,110
If you don't get married with him,

162
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,570
I will be your only choice.

163
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,520
When I was young.

164
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,550
I was also handsome

165
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,880
and charming.

166
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,590
If you are really not into this guy,

167
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,110
I can consider marrying you myself.

168
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,080
Well.

169
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,840
You have to make do with me.

170
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,840
Stop! Stop!

171
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,440
I can't bear to listen any more.

172
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,320
That is insane!

173
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,440
I call you grandpa every day.

174
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,150
How can you covet my girl?

175
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,710
I am worried she won't fall for you, brat.

176
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,640
Wake up!

177
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,590
Even if she is not into me, it's impossible that she is into you.

178
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,150
Enough!

179
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,080
Stop talking.

180
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,080
Lass,

181
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,850
make your decision now.

182
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,080
Which of us will you marry,

183
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,400
him or me?

184
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,790
I…

185
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,640
I…

186
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,640
I, I will pick neither of you.

187
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,790
What did you say?

188
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,960
How about…?

189
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,790
I am in charge here.

190
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,400
This is my place.

191
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,960
Grandpa, what are you doing?

192
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,030
Put him down quickly.

193
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,090
Do you believe that

194
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,280
I will eat you two right now?

195
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,670
Li Xuan.

196
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,210
I will obey you.

197
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,350
I agree, all right?

198
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,030
You agree to marry him?

199
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,840
Yes, I agree.

200
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,030
Will you regret?

201
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,200
No, I won't.

202
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,590
Will you keep your word?

203
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,710
Yes, I will.

204
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,080
Li Xuan,

205
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,150
are you all right?

206
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,080
You geezer,

207
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,940
why are you still so impulsive at such an old age?

208
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,010
If a child is not obedient,

209
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,440
the most likely reason is lack of beating.

210
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,670
You see.

211
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,340
After I gave you a beating,

212
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,440
the lass learned to behave better.

213
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,760
Congratulations!

214
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,720
You shall get married in two hours.

215
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,320
Two hours?

216
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,580
I can't wait that long.

217
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,470
Silly boy.

218
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Lift up the veil.

219
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,920
Hurry to stir it up.

220
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,560
There are no outsiders here.

221
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,290
You need not stand on ceremony.

222
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,050
Usually, a newly-married couple is left alone for this.

223
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,800
In your presence, I won't do it.

224
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,190
OK. I got it.

225
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,710
I will leave.

226
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,640
I am off.

227
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,040
Are you nervous?

228
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,920
No, I am not.

229
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,280
Anyway…

230
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,070
Brat,

231
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,190
try harder.

232
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,430
You'd better make her bear a lot of kids for me.

233
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:06,070
Then my efforts won't end up in smoke.

234
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,120
Anyway, we playacted to deceive the grandpa.

235
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,400
Are you two trying

236
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,230
to deceive me?

237
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,700
What are you doing?

238
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,530
I am doing as you said

239
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,090
to deceive the grandpa.

240
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,040
The old man

241
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,280
is listening to our commotion.

242
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,040
Young man,

243
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,830
good job!

244
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,110
Well, well.

245
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,230
Wangcai!

246
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,560
Wangcai! Wangcai! Wangcai!

247
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,880
Come back.

248
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,280
It is too close

249
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,280
to their bed there.

250
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,230
You are too young

251
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,280
to go there.

252
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,310
Come back.

253
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,230
Let's listen here.

254
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,160
Wangcai.

255
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,160
Let's leave.

256
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,000
We should not disturb them.

257
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,760
I am not your wife.

258
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,280
You are wearing the bride's garment.

259
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,430
We have performed the wedding ceremony.

260
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,290
How can you say you are not my wife?

261
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,310
I hate you doing this.

262
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,960
I will make you hate me more.

263
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,350
Prince,

264
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,800
have you found

265
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,590
a way to rescue Miss Su?

266
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,540
If Miss Su really can't come back,

267
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,550
as for what to do next,

268
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,590
shall we develop new plans?

269
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,230
I believe Youlian.

270
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,350
I won't allow anything bad to happen to her.

271
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,500
If she is still not back tomorrow,

272
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,160
I will force an entrance into the Land of Mystery.

273
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,020
You want to break into that place?

274
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,920
Darling, since you want to touch me,

275
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,520
I am very happy to cooperate.

276
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,230
Who is your darling?

277
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,360
We have slept in the same bed.

278
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,400
You can't abandon me after a night.

279
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,560
Now I am yours.

280
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,520
You must be a good wife to me.

281
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,160
So I see you two have got out of bed.

282
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,590
Hurry up! Come Quickly!

283
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,120
Hurry to look at this!

284
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,000
Also,

285
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,920
look at the swing.

286
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,520
It can fly very high.

287
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,400
It is great fun.

288
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,310
How do you like it?

289
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,560
Don't you think it is great?

290
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,090
Grandpa, we are grown-ups.

291
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,310
We won't play on it.

292
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,190
I didn't make it for you.

293
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,400
You wish.

294
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,800
Brat.

295
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,000
Did you sleep with her last night?

296
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,590
Did you get her pregnant?

297
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,000
Is she carrying a baby girl or a baby boy?

298
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,230
Yes, she is pregnant.

299
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,400
That is wonderful!

300
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,000
Hurry to give birth to the baby.

301
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,330
It can't be done so soon.

302
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,000
Uh,

303
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,230
You should know the pregnancy will last for 10 months.

304
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,590
Is that true? I don't care.

305
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,590
On that day, you promised me that

306
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,310
you would have a baby born upon getting married.

307
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,710
You said there would be many babies.

308
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,400
Now you told me I would have to wait.

309
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,560
No, I can't wait.

310
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,190
Yes, I promised you indeed.

311
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,350
But it's nature's law that the pregnancy takes 10 months.

312
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,950
Even if you urge me, I can do nothing.

313
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,590
If you two join hands to deceive me,

314
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,880
I will eat you.

315
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,920
Hurry up! Hurry up!

316
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,310
Well,

317
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,430
We need energy to have a child born.

318
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,920
Let's go have the child born. Let's go.

319
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,180
Your words make sense.

320
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,400
Wait up.

321
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,400
Brat,

322
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,190
when you got married,

323
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,950
I didn't give you a wedding present.

324
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,520
Today I will give you this glazed ball.

325
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,920
It has been my precious carry-on for many years.

326
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,920
Look!

327
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,830
Accept my kindness to you.

328
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,590
Handle it with care.

329
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,360
You naughty boy!

330
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,650
Princess Yunshan!

331
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,590
Princess Yunshan!

332
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,560
Hurry to check it out!

333
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,800
Prince Mu has got into trouble.

334
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,600
What happened

335
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,840
to my elder brother?

336
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:41,880
Let's go check it out.

337
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,940
Hurry! Chop-chop!

338
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,610
Shake a leg!

339
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,070
Let's go.

340
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,590
Go.

341
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,090
Elder brother.

342
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,680
Elder brother.

343
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,070
Elder brother, what are you doing?

344
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,830
Stop shouting.

345
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,760
He is trying to blaze a trail into the Land of Mystery.

346
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,800
The Land of Mystery.

347
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,520
If he does that forcibly, he will be hurt by the spirit energy

348
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,590
and may lose his life anytime.

349
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,560
Elder brother, get down from there.

350
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,490
Hold your horse!

351
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,640
Changqing,

352
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,400
are you out of your mind?

353
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,260
Elder brother!

354
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,070
What are you thinking about?

355
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,430
Do you think

356
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,520
we will really have a child of our own?

357
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,160
Do you want to have one or not?

358
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,190
I, I won't tell you.

359
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,880
Let me try this.

360
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,000
Take care.

361
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,560
You are not doing it correctly.

362
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,470
Let me teach you.

363
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,160
Come on.

364
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,730
Hold it this way.

365
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,430
Add some salt.

366
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,950
You added too much.

367
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
What should we do?

368
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,280
We must figure out a way quickly.

369
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,140
Elder brother!

370
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,190
No, you can't.

371
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,950
Don't be rash.

372
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,110
We don't have enough spirit energy.

373
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,560
If we go there recklessly, we will court death.

374
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,620
I can't watch them die doing nothing.

375
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,280
Then what should I do?

376
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,430
Hurry up! Hurry!

377
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,160
How are you doing?

378
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,000
Changqing! Elder brother!

379
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,660
Changqing!

380
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,230
Elder brother!

381
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,040
Your Highness!

382
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,560
Your Highness.

383
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,760
How are you now? Are you all right?

384
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,590
How are you now?

385
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,310
Lord Zi.

386
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,710
Changqing! Your Highness!

387
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,710
Are you all right?

388
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,110
How are you, Your Highness?

389
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,970
Your Highness!

390
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,170
Your Highness!

391
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,830
Take care! Be careful!

392
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,830
Be careful! Be careful!

393
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,520
Elder brother, are you all right?

394
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,350
I am fine.

395
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,160
Is there anything we can do except watching?

396
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,880
Lord Zi.

397
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
What should we do?

398
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,490
Yes. What should we do?

399
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,310
Lord Zi, do you have any solution?

400
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:37,950
Right. Is there anything we can do?

401
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,810
Reckless move!

402
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,830
For centuries, whoever entered the Land of Mystery failed to come out.

403
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,430
It is a very dangerous place.

404
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,760
You knew that clearly, but you still did this.

405
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,800
Do you want to get yourself killed?

406
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,590
Help them back hurriedly to heal their wounds.

407
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,230
OK. Yes, sir.

408
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
Come on. Stand up.

409
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,520
Take care.

410
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,430
Mind your step.

411
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,560
Take care.

412
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,110
Look out.

413
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
Be careful.

414
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,160
Brat.

415
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,190
There are so many places for you to set foot on,

416
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,280
but you just broke into the bloody icebound ward.

417
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You are on your own this time.

418
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,920
Being outside here,

419
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,350
I can do nothing to help you.

420
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,120
You geezer!

421
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,820
Didn't you say this is a toy for the child?

422
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,870
What are you doing on it?

423
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,730
Yes, it was made

424
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,190
for the child.

425
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,600
I am testing it to see whether it is safe.

426
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,929
I don't want my great grandson to get hurt.

427
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,389
Brat.

428
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,469
Do you want to give it try?

429
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,600
Brat.

430
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,960
Hold onto it tightly.

431
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,190
You geezer!

432
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,470
Help!

433
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,760
Get me off this!

434
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,840
You geezer!

435
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,360
Put me down!

436
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,800
It is not very safe.

437
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,890
It still needs improving.

438
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,760
Wangcai.

439
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,520
Go get it.

440
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,980
Elder brother.

441
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,090
Elder brother.

442
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,230
Well.

443
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,440
How come he is still in a coma?

444
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Don't be anxious.

445
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,120
Lord Zi said that

446
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,760
they consumed too much spirit energy,

447
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,630
but they would come round soon.

448
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,560
You are learned.

449
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,470
Could you, can you figure out a way?

450
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,910
Could you try to figure out a way

451
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,170
to help him come round?

452
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,710
Changqing.

453
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,430
You must get well.

454
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,840
You must get well, bro.

455
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,720
Grandpa. It is time for meal.

456
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Grandpa.

457
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,520
Don't be lazy!

458
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,800
Work hard!

459
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,760
Hurry!

460
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,150
Hurry!

461
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,150
Work!

462
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,360
Hurry!

463
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Rise to your feet!

464
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,840
Hurry!

465
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,080
Rise to your feet!

466
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,440
Do your work!

467
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,390
Hurry!

468
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,600
No.

469
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,910
Outflank them! Don't let them run away!

470
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:15,470
Hurry!

471
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,230
Stop!

472
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,150
Stop!

473
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,950
Stop!

474
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,210
Don't run! Stop!

475
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,230
Chase them!

476
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:22,870
Stop!

477
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,000
Stop them!

478
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,950
Stop!

479
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:25,800
Stop!

480
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:26,750
Stop running!

481
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:27,760
Stop running!
