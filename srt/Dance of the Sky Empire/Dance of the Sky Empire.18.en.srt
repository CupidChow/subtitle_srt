Prince Mu.

5
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,479
Are you so close now?

6
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,630
Do you forget

7
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,009
that you're still my wife?

8
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,160
The marriage thing is just acting.

9
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,720
Why do you entangle me?

10
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,320
Getting married with me is just acting?

11
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,510
Is the kiss under the lake

12
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,880
also acting for you?

13
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,750
Answer my question.

14
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,880
Yes.

15
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
It's just acting.

16
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,270
It's not real.

17
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,830
You're lying.

18
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,960
Li Xuan,

19
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,230
Cui Pianran is the one who has engaged with you.

20
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,960
Now that you've already been a couple,

21
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,820
you shouldn't come to me anymore.

22
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,440
What do you mean she and I are a real couple?

23
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,670
The marriage of her and me is not real.

24
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,270
How could we be a real couple?

25
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,060
You yourself know the truth in your mind.

26
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,600
You should make yourself clear.

27
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,630
Cui Pianran stayed in your room

28
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,760
overnight that day.

29
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,280
All the people in the Academy have known it.

30
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,440
Tell me the truth.

31
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,720
Why you're so close to Yu Fengmu

32
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,530
is that you're jealous of what happened between Cui Pianran and me, isn't it?

33
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,880
You're saying nonsense.

34
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
I'm saying nonsense?

35
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,780
Then why are you blushing?

36
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,159
I swear to God

37
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,570
there's no romance between her and me.

38
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,040
Nothing has happened.

Xuanxuan.

40
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,670
Schoolmate Bian, ease up.

41
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,670
Why should I?

42
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
You talk to him in person.

43
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,570
I'm sorry, Schoolmate Li.

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,760
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,510
Why do you have my token?

46
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,550
I have no idea.

47
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,200
Maybe I took it unconsciously

48
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,480
when I was sleepwalking yesterday night.

49
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,000
You know I will always do something strange

50
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,950
when I'm sleepwalking.

51
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,930
I can't control myself.

52
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,270
I think you covet

53
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,550
the esoterica of magic arts in the mysterious lands.

54
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,670
I do wanna read the esoterica, but…

55
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,440
See.

56
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,230
You've admitted.

57
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,920
Hurry and tell the truth.

58
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,440
I…

59
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,350
Who on earth was the girl with you yesterday night?

60
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,720
I do have no idea.

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
I mean it.

62
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,350
It's fine.

63
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,040
I won't look into it anymore.

64
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,070
But If you come to steal my stuff

65
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,500
when you're sleepwalking next time,

66
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,550
I'll definitely teach you a lesson. Are you clear?

67
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,920
Yes. Yes.

68
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,159
I'm clear. I'm clear. I'm clear.

[Yanxi Hall]

70
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Your Highness II,

71
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,510
His Highness has held a feast specially for you

72
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,070
to celebrate your triumphant return.

73
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,110
He invites you to the
Eastern Palace.

74
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,950
Our prince was injured when he wiped out the Clan of Kunwu.

75
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,320
He hasn't been cured.

76
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,440
He's gonna head for the Academy to ask Lord Zi to heal him.

77
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,070
I'm afraid he wouldn't…

78
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,830
What?

79
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,550
His Highness wants to

80
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,510
reward Your Highness II with the feast sincerely.

81
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,160
Will Your Highness II refuse the kindness of His Highness

82
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,760
due to your military merits?

83
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,830
How dare you?

84
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,440
Now that brother is so kind to me,

85
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,040
I'll definitely attend the feast.

86
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
Lead the way.

87
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,950
Please.

88
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,390
Your Highness, you're injured.

89
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,720

Your Highness II, please.

92

Now that brother invites me to the feast,

93
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,510
why isn't he here?

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,880
His Highness is changing clothes in his bedroom.

Your Highness II, please wait for him patiently.

96
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,940
If you don't have any other question, I'll leave first.

97
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,160
In my opinion,

98
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,110
the Crown Prince tries to flatter you for no reason.

99
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,970
He must have some bad intentions.

100
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,000
Your Highness, the liquor…

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,730
Don't worry.

102
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,070
Although my lame brother is pretty silly,

103
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,270
he won't dare to poison me

104
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,070
in his palace.

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,610
I'm just worrying about your health.

106
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,600
Go check

107
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,550
how soon the Crown Prince will come.

108
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,440
Yes.

109
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,320
His Highness has ordered that

110
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,720
no one is allowed to leave here

111
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,440
without his permission.

What do you mean?

What if my prince doesn't wanna wait any longer?

Please don't hassle us, Your Highness II.

Nowadays, His Majesty values you so much.

Why do you have to suffer this here?

124

while the Crown Prince could be the one tomorrow.

129
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,150
How could the talent and morality of the Crown Prince

be compared with yours?

131

How could father not know

what we've known?

133

But why hasn't he abolished the Crown Prince and appointed a new one?

Your Highness, what do you mean?

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,530
We don't have to come into a conflict with him.

136
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,350
He's still the Crown Prince

Yes.

144
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,110
His Highness II is extremely arrogant

and domineering due to his military merits.

146
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,590
He forgets you're the Crown Prince

go back to our mansion.

When do I tell you I wanna go to your place?

162

You have to go with me.

163
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Today, my mother has found the best dressmaker in the Qingtian City

164

to make the wedding clothes for us.

So you have to go to my place.

Do you hear me?

169
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,230
I won't marry you.

170
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,320
It's what His Majesty has assigned.

171
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,590
Do you wanna disobey the imperial instruction?

00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,550
Li Xuan.

173
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,670
Xuanxuan doesn't have a thing for you.

174
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,880
You won't be happy even if you force him to marry you.

175
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,670
Let it go. Let it go.

176
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,710
You'd better change your mind as soon as possible.

177
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,470
To be honest,

178
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,080
I'm tired of a sweet relationship.

179
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,550
I do wanna force him.

180
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,740
Your Highness.

181
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,110
As long as you order us, we'll break through the palace.

182
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,440
The guards outside the door

183
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,770
won't be able to stop us.

184
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,000
It seems His Highness

185
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,440
has made up his mind to hassle me.

186
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,860
Stand still. Stand still.

187
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,110
Stop.

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,840
Move away.

189
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,580
What are you doing?

190
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,170
Do you wanna stage a revolt?

191
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,440
Do you know what the place it is?

192
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,990
Put your spears away.

193
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,520
Second Brother,

194
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,790
your subordinates don't follow the rules, do they?

195
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,670
How dare they hurt my guards?

196
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,350
Brother,

197
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,200
you finally appear.

198
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,230
What…

199
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,710
what do you mean?

200
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,710
Do you mean

201
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,760
I haven't treated you well?

202
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,590
Nope.

203
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,800
Brother holds a feast for me,

204
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,520
so I have to attend.

205
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,150
But you've made me wait for quite a long time without showing up

206
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,880
and you don't allow me to leave.

207
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,160
What do you wanna do?

208
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,280
Do I?

209
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,590
How could it happen?

210
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,810
Who of you dares to discourage Second Prince?

211
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,440
I'm reporting to you, Your Highness.

212
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,110
Some persons must have acted on their own.

213
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,280
I'll teach them a lesson later.

214
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,370
But it's Second Prince who picked up the fight first.

215
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,840
What are you saying?

216
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,280
Are you trying to drive a wedge

217
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,940
between Second Prince and me?

218
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,880
No, I'm not.

219
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,150
Back off.

220
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,640
Second Brother,

221
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,700
have you heard him?

222
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,520
It's my subordinates who acted absurdly.

223
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,760
It's not what I intended to do.

224
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,320
So,

225
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,350
it's I who misunderstand you.

226
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,790
I'll leave first.

227
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,080
Since you're here,

228
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,540
why do you hurry to go back?

229
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,910
Our discussion hasn't been over yet.

230
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,960
Back off.

231
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,110
You should back off too.

232
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,670
Do you wanna go against my instruction?

233
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,110
Bainian,

234
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,000
back off.

235
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,770
Second Brother,

236
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,130
I won't blame you

237
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,550
for misunderstanding me.

238
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,200
But I'm the Crown Prince,

239
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,080
and I'm also your elder brother.

240
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,840
How could you pick up a fight in my palace?

241
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,210
Do you know superiors and inferiors?

242
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,150
If what happens today spreads,

243
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,440
how will the public regard me?

244
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,000
Then what

245
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,350
do you wanna do?

246
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
You think?

247
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,840
It's I who fail to discipline my subordinates well.

248
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,040
So they offended you.

249
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,400
Please forgive me.

250
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,200
What did you say?

251
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,760
I can't hear you.

252
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,030
Don't go too far.

253
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,030
What's your attitude?

254
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,780
Guards.

255
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,760
Catch him.

256
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,840
Yes.

257
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,710
What are you doing?

258
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,970
You're staging a revolt, aren't you?

259
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,550
Come back.

260
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,280
Stand up.

261
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,230
Why do I raise you all?

262
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,700
You can't even fight against one person.

263
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,010
He's so awesome, isn't he?

264
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,520
It's great that we've broken through the palace.

265
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,230
Otherwise,

266
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,900
if the Crown Prince found you're a woman,

267
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,480
we would have a big trouble.

268
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,349
It's he who should feel lucky.

269
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,470
If he finds out

270
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,589
I've been disguised myself as a man

271
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,760
for so many years,

272
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,680
do you think

273
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,640
I'll allow him to keep alive to see the sunshine of tomorrow?

274
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,460
You're right, Your Highness.

275
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,470
Hold my hand.

276
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,000
It's so hard for you

277
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,400
to suffer from

278
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,560
soaking in the medicated bath on your birthday.

279
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,280
Compared with being hated by my father

280
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,760
as a daughter,

281
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,690
suffering from soaking in the medicated bath

282
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,310
isn't a big deal.

283
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,590
It's His Majesty who is so silly.

284
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,830
He even believed the word of the fortuneteller.

285
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,710
He believed that a princess would do harm to the fortune of a state,

286
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,280
so he intended to send all the princesses into exile.

287
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,190
Stop it.

288
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,950
Don't mention

289
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,110
the history anymore.

290
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,760
You can leave first.

291
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,430
I'll do the following part

292
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,640
by myself.

293
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,070
Yes.

294
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,190
I'm leaving.

295
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,950
Xuanxuan,

296
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,900
I saw Loong Wei'er come back to the Academy just now.

297
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,800
He finally shows up.

298
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,710
Let's go.

299
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,000
Loong Wei'er,

300
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,240
you look decent at ordinary times.

301
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,520
I haven't expected you're so uninhibited privately.

302
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,720
You even brought a woman to the Academy.

303
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,350
Since I've found out your secret,

304
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,760
you'll have to do

305
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,590
whatever I say later.

306
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,040
But

307
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,920
it's not the proper time for me to go inside.

308
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,040
Wei'er,

309
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,750
who allowed you to wear a flower?

310
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,170
Hold out your hand.

311
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,160
Your hand.

312
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,190
I've told you

313
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,830
not to touch girls' accessories.

314
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,350
Don't touch girls' accessories.

315
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,520
Why don't you follow what I said?

316
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,040
Why?

317
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,850
How could you disobey my word?

318
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,430
Why?

319
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,920
Why don't you follow what I said?

320
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,920
Why?

321
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,430
I get it.

322
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,710
Wei'er.

323
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,950
Mother, I'm so scared.

324
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,190
I don't wanna have the shower.

325
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,000
It must be painful.

326
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,430
Poor Wei'er.

327
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,800
I'm forced to do it.

328
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,590
Why are you a woman?

329
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,400
Only the Toxic Bath

330
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,840
can let you become a man temporarily in the world.

331
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,680
It can help deceive the public.

332
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,350
Mother, I feel painful.

333
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,950
Mother, it's too painful.

334
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,430
Mother.

335
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,160
Who's it?

336
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,470
It's me. Li Xuan.

337
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,830
Li Xuan.

338
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,680
Why does he come to me?

339
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,350
You're inside. I'm coming in.

340
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,640
Don't come in. Wait.

341
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,380
I'll open the door for you.

342
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,960
What took you so long?

343
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,160
Why do you come to me?

344
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,190
Visit you.

345
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,880
Who allows you to come in?

346
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,410
Come out.

347
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,350
Get out.

348
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,190
Li Xuan.

349
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,470
Don't you hear me?

350
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,190
I said get out.

351
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,400
What are you looking for?

352
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,560
Don't you hear me?

353
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,880
I said get out.

354
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,830
It's impossible.

355
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,800
I did see a woman in your room.

356
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,560
I said get out.

357
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,880
You brat.

358
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,800
Tell me the truth.

359
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Are you hiding a woman in your place?

360
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,220
Who allows you to touch me?

361
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,880
Why not?

362
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,420
Why can't I touch a man?

363
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,640
I don't like it.

364
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,000
You wanna argue over it, don't you?

365
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,800
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

366
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,910
I won't touch you anymore. Okay?

367
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,230
I'll count three numbers. If you don't loosen your hand,

368
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,350
I won't be nice to you.

369
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,070
One.

370
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,280
Two.

371
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,230
You suck.

372
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,350
You wake up.

373
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,800
Your loud snore

374
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,280
awoke me.

375
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,710
It's impossible.

376
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,110
I've never snored.

377
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,470
How do you feel?

378
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,160
Much better.

379
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Why do you

380
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,960
come to me so urgently tonight?

381
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,370
Listen to what you're saying.

382
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,020
We're so close, aren't we?

383
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,680
We fought against the Qilin together.

384
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,110
We fought against the Clan of Kunwu.

385
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,880
We're close friends who have gone through fire and water.

386
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,640
Can't I visit you when I don't have anything urgent?

387
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,470
Come to the point.

388
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,330
I'm sorry. I wanna ask you a favor.

389
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,160
Say it.

390
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,470
You know the wedding day of Cui Pianran and me

391
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,710
is coming soon.

392
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,400
I want you to send a message to His Majesty for me

393
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,930
to call off the engagement.

394
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,260
You have the military merits, don't you?

395
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,460
Why don't you beg my father in person?

396
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,160
Well,

397
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,760
I can do it by myself.

398
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,280
The time when I'll be awarded according to my contributions isn't coming

399
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,230
while my wedding day is coming.

400
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,470
Listen.

401
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,880
We're so close, aren't we?

402
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,830
Besides, I've been nursing you for quite long.

403
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,710
Could you do me a favor?

404
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,110
I can promise to beg my father for you.

405
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,310
But

406
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,040
I have one condition.

407
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,710
Please say it.

408
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,000
It's my birthday today.

409
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,710
Are you kidding me?

410
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,560
Why haven't you told me earlier?

411
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,760
I wish you can have the happiness as immense as the Eastern Sea and live as long as the southern mountain.

412
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,590
That's it?

413
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,880
It's almost dawn.

414
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,470
Your birthday is almost past.

415
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,600
Then you can still celebrate it for me.

416
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,640
Show me your sincerity.

417
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,640
Show me whether it's worthwhile

418
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,430
to beg my father for you

419
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,470
to withdraw his order.

420
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,110
No problem.

421
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,800
Wait a sec.

422
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,830
I don't want…

423
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:08,640
I get it.

424
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,830
To keep a low profile.

425
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,030
To keep a low profile.

426
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,920
What?

427
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,160
Celebrate a birthday?

428
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,360
Keep your voice down.

429
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,430
Loong Wei'er didn't want others to know.

430
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,470
Xuanxuan,

431
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,400
I mean, does Loong Wei'er have a …?

432
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,880
You idiot.

433
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,400
He's a man.

434
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,280
So am I.

435
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,520
What do you think?

436
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,640
How will you celebrate the birthday for him?

437
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,880
That's why I come to discuss it with you.

438
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
You know this kind of thing the most.

439
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,820
Help me figure out something.

440
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,760
It will work for girls

441
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,350
but for boys,

442
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
it's not proper.

443
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,040
I don't care.

444
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,330
Whatever can do.

445
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:06,160
The most important thing is to show my sincerity.

446
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,830
Allow me.

447
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,860
You should keep the secret for me.

448
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,310
Don't you know who I am?

449
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,590
Don't worry.

450
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,400
I heard from Bian Lingcheng

451
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,040
that Li Xuan spent a lot on fireworks and lanterns

452
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,880
all over the city today.

453
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,530
Are the fireworks he bought

454
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,290
used on the wedding day of Cui Pianran and him?

455
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,830
Think about it. On the wedding day,

456
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,280
the whole city will be lit up by the flaring fireworks and lanterns.

457
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,160
Then the people in the city can see it.

458
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,280
How enviable it is!

459
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,520
Su Youlian must have been so regretful.

460
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,920
You guys,

461
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,000
what are you talking about?

462
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,600
We're not talking about you.

463
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,160
Youlian,

464
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,920
don't take their word seriously.

465
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,470
Exactly.

466
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,110
You haven't had a thing for Li Xuan anymore.

467
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,310
Don't care about him.

468
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,400
She's leaving.

469
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,920
Why does she act so strange?

470
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,460
Please, Childe Li.

471
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,560
Have a look.

472
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,560
Fireworks are not enough. Send ten times of them here.

473
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,230
Okay. Okay.

474
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,040
This one is pretty good.

475
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,920
Okay. Okay.

476
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,470
And send more lanterns

477
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,160
here.

478
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,520
Sure. Sure. Sure.

479
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,290
Give me the map.

480
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,880
This place.

481
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,470
Here.

482
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,280
And here.

483
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,270
Get the three places into a line.

484
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,040
I'll let the people all over the city

485
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,400
see the fireworks when they look up.

486
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,760
Nation-protecting Master, don't worry.

487
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,220
We promise we'll make the full preparation.

488
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,070
Besides,

489
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,630
the way I pass through

490
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,470
will be lit up by lanterns.

491
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,560
Okay. Okay.

492
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,350
Okay.

493
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,580
Rest assured. We'll prepare it well.

494
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,560
And this one.

495
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,800
Who chose it?

496
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,560
Move it away immediately.

497
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,690
I don't wanna see it.

498
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,880
Hurry up. Hurry up.

499
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,070
Su Youlian.

500
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,920
Now that you're here,

501
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,280
why not come in?

502
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,230
I'm…

503
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,040
I'm passing by.

504
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,430
Passing by?

505
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,590
You're supposed to be having a class

506
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,710
in the Justice Hall, aren't you?

507
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,240
How come you're passing by?

508
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,430
I…

509
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,870
Do you think these lanterns are beautiful?

510
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,750
Loong Wei'er would like them, wouldn't he?

511
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,710
Loong Wei'er?

512
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,130
That guy would like them, wouldn't he?

513
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,050
But I think only girls might be fond of these things.

514
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,800
Why do you prepare it for Loong Wei'er?

515
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,160
It's for celebrating his birthday.

516
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,040
He wanted me to prepare for him.

517
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,890
Keep a low profile.

518
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,280
Xuanxuan.

519
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,880
Xuanxuan.

520
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,760
I've fully planned for you.

521
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,400
Do what I've written

522
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,190
on the paper one by one,

523
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,450
which will be perfect.

524
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,680
You deserve your reputation.

525
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
How is it?

526
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,370
We have to go out of the city, don't we?

527
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,590
Does it mean I can find Bai Xiaosheng

528
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,050
to inquire about the situation of my mother?

529
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,280
You've been worrying about the situation of your mother over the recent years.

530
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,350
Your father and Lord Zi

531
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,280
don't allow you to find Bai Xiaosheng outside the city.

532
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,710
You can finally get the chance,

533
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,710
taking advantages of Loong Wei'er.

534
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,710
It seems

535
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,880
no one can stop you from going out of the city this time.

536
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,350
Thank you.

537
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,520
Su Youlian is here.

538
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,640
How come you're not having a class

539
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,350
but come to find Xuanxuan?

540
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,000
I…

541
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,920
It's fine. It's fine.

542
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,310
You don't have to answer my question.

543
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,190
In my opinion,

544
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,760
it will be better for you two to distance one another.

545
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,950
Otherwise,

546
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,190
you might hurt Xuanxuan's heart again.

547
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,720
What are you talking about?

548
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,470
What?

549
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,220
You've forgotten what you suffered.

550
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,110
Okay.

551
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,070
When you're hurt at that time,

552
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,470
don't come to me anymore.

553
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,310
Bian Lingcheng.

554
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,240
Bian Lingcheng.

555
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,400
Wait for me.

556
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,469
What's up?

557
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,239
What do you want to say to me?

558
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,469
You said

559
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,560
Li Xuan has been worrying about his mother all the time.

560
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,230
Why?

561
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,000
Why do you wanna know it?

562
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,280
How come you care about him again?

563
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,360
To tell you the truth,

564
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,600
there's no need for you to do so.

565
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,000
Your concern means

566
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,040
too much for my friend.

567
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,080
Okay. Okay. Okay.

568
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:37,520
Don't act like that.

569
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,800
You look as I'm bullying you.

570
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,520
Bian Lingcheng,

571
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
could you please

572
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:49,949
tell me what the story is?

573
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,889
Why do Lord Zi and General Li

574
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,179
not allow him to go out of the city?

575
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,000
It's

576
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,320
a long story.

577
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,840
You mean

578
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,800
Li Xuan wants to know

579
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,520
the truth of his mother's death so much in these years

580
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,800
But General Li and Lord Zi

581
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,120
refuse to tell him the truth

582
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,250
for certain reason.

583
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,560
You're right.

584
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,080
They're being mysterious all the time.

585
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,870
Li Xuan has been suffering a lot

586
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,910
for the thing of his mother over these years.

587
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,870
He's able to go out of the city this time. And he can ask Bai Xiaosheng

588
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,600
about what happened that year.

589
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,400
I'm warning you.

590
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,190
Although I tell you the story of Li Xuan,

591
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,470
you're not allowed to hook up him.

592
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,270
Otherwise, we won't be able to be friends anymore.

593
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,230
Rest assured.

594
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,520
He and I

595
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:40,910
Are impossible

596
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,600
Okay.

597
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,060
Does it taste good?

598
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,600
Eat slowly.

599
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,120
What are you staring at?

600
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,320
Nothing.

601
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,950
Nothing?

602
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:24,950
Nothing.

603
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,710
What I see from your eyes

604
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,670
is jealousy.

605
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,320
You don't have to feel jealous of them.

606
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,390
You have Princess Yunshan, don't you?

607
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,950
Yeah.

608
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,320
The relationship between Princess Yunshan and you has been ambiguous for quite a long time.

609
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,980
Have you confessed your love?

610
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,670
You know that

611
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,280
she's Princess Yunshan

612
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,710
while

613
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,520
I'm nobody.

614
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,470
How can I confess my love to her?

615
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,080
Nope. What do you have to look down upon yourself?

616
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,190
Now that you've got admitted by the Moyun Ancient Academy,

617
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,050
you'll be the pillar of the state.

618
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,190
Do you know it?

619
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,120
You deserve her, don't you?

620
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,870
His word makes sense somehow.

621
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,360
Besides,

622
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,470
even a blind person

623
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,390
can see the romance between you two.

624
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,000
Now

625
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,120
what you should do is confess your love to her.

626
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,120
As long as you confess your love to her,

627
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,650
what others can do is envy of you in the future.

628
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,380
Confess my love to her?

629
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,800
How?

630
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,490
You're really a nerd, aren't you?

631
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,040
I'm wondering why Princess Yunshan

632
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,360
would have a thing for a nerd like you.

633
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,560
I mean,

634
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,840
the…the book doesn't teach me how to confess my love.

635
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
Schoolmate Bian,

636
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,590
you're an expert in this.

637
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,560
Why not teach me anything?

638
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,800
The key to confess your love

639
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,150
is to find a romantic timing.

640
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,000
A romantic timing?

641
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,010
For example,

642
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,580
when you're having a meal,

643
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,000
you can light up a candle.

644
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,280
The candlelight is flickering.

645
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
Through the candlelight,

646
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,520
you're looking at her

647
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,710
while she's looking at you.

648
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,910
Both of you have a thing for one another.

649
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,360
Then you can say you love her at the moment,

650
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,820
which is a perfect timing.

651
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,280
Lighting up a candle when having a meal can be a perfect timing for confessing love.

652
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,560
There's another unique skill.

653
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,320
What's it?

654
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,600
Anyway,

655
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,320
girls always fall for a man who's generous to them

656
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,450
and can spend all of his money for them.

657
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,890
You have to remember

658
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,320
there're only three words that girls want to hear,

659
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,980
which is not "I love you" but "My treat, please".

660
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,080
My treat, please?

661
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,370
Remember

662
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,730
you can't be closefisted at that moment.

663
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,640
Do you know it?

664
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,740
I'd better go do more cleaning

665
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:39,930
to earn more money.

666
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,000
What a genius I am!

667
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,420
Your Highness,

668
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,800
have you heard that?

669
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,390
I have no idea what Li Xuan is planning.

670
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,150
He spent a lot of money on buying the lanterns in the city.

671
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,600
Now he's decorating the city with all these lanterns.

672
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,670
How strange it is!

673
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,230
He doesn't wanna get married with Cui Pianran, does he?

674
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,950
Then why is he doing it?

675
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,290
Your Highness,

676
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,280
you wanna go out, don't you?

677
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,080
Loong Wei'er,

678
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,390
are you ready?

679
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,800
We should get going.

680
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,190
I've been waiting for you for long.

681
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,910
Let's go.

682
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,320
Li Xuan,

683
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,900
where do you wanna take our prince to?

684
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,630
Well, Bainian,

685
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,840
you should arrange the Twenty-four Papers of the National History

686
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,040
which I newly bought.

687
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,470
I'll read them when I come back in the evening.

688
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,430
Let's go.

689
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,430
Loong Wei'er, I'm telling you

690
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,760
that I've spent quite a lot on today's celebration.

691
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,190
I promise you'll never forget.

692
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,710
Will I?

693
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,280
Then I'll wait and see.

694
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,040
I promise.

695
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:58,840
Let's go.

696
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,320
How is it?

697
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,430
Are you surprised?

698
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,080
Here?

699
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,670
To tell you the truth,

700
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,640
it's the most exciting place

701
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,670
in the Qingtian City.

702
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,470
All the beauties aren't supposed to

703
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,830
do business during daytime.

704
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,090
But thanks to me, it's open now.

705
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,840
This way.

706
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,230
I'm telling you

707
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,840
he's my best friend.

708
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,700
You should…

709
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,710
You don't have to introduce him, Childe Li.

710
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,150
Come on. Come to my place.

711
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,670
I'll play the Melody of White Feathers Garment for you.

712
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,710
-Childe.
-Li Xuan.

713
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,150
Why is your skin so tender?

714
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:49,800
Li Xuan.

715
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,800
She's right.

716
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,560
Li Xuan.

717
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,630
Li Xuan.

718
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,630
Having a handsome appearance is amazing, isn't it?

719
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,030
Is he more popular than I?

720
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,600
Waiter.

721
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,320
Bring me a pot of liquor

722
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
and some dishes.

723
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,250
Okay, Childe Li.

724
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,470
Childe.

725
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,320
Stop, Childe.

726
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,190
Stop, Childe.

727
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,330
Childe, what are you doing?

728
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,910
He's tiny but powerful.

729
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,840
Does it the "I'll never forget" mean?
