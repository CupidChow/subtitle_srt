[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,860
Dance of the sky Empire

3
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,860
Episode 1

4
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,740
Mother!

5
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,820
Mother!

6
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,060
Though people of our Kunwu clan have divine power,

7
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,960
we've never thought of

8
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,460
bullying the human clan.

9
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,380
Yet, you

10
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,820
keep invading our territory.

11
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,700
Since you don't want to live at peace with us,

12
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,620
our entire clan will fight against you.

13
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,660
Elder brother!

14
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,320
Qingsheng!

15
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,820
Mother!

16
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,060
don't leave Xuan'er behind.

17
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,980
Elder brother!

18
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,340
Elder brother!

19
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,780
Mother!

20
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,540
Younger sister!

21
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,880
Snow Illuminating Trick.

22
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,120
As the 19th Saintess of

23
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,700
the Kunwu clan,

24
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,140
I, Jiu Ling'er,

25
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,300
swear to the Heaven at the cost of my life that

26
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,620
in ten years,

27
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,190
the Dragon Emperor will wake up

28
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,620
and the human clan will be wiped out.

29
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,980
I'm gonna kill you!

30
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,020
I'm gonna kill you!

31
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,660
I'm gonna kill you!

32
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,860
Let go of me!

33
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,060
Let go of me!

34
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,020
I'm gonna kill you!

35
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,660
I'm gonna kill you!

36
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,380
I'm gonna kill you!

37
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,140
Kill you!

38
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,780
Let go of me!

39
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,700
Let go of me!

40
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,340
Let go of me now!

41
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,580
Xuan'er!

42
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,380
Save some strength.

43
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,300
This is the Dragon Lock.

44
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,980
No one but me can unlock it.

45
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,420
I'm going kill you!

46
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,650
I'm going kill you with my own hands!

47
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,420
Xuan'er, shut up!

48
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,620
Lord Zi,

49
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,980
please feel relieved.

50
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,300
If you spare his life,

51
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,140
I promise

52
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,620
I will keep him under control.

53
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,940
What about you?

54
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,540
Don't you hate me?

55
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,700
Since he was born,

56
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,500
we've known that

57
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,420
this day will come.

58
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,220
Lord Zi!

59
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,700
Lord Zi,

60
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,780
I swear in the name of my father

61
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,980
if he ever causes trouble

62
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,310
and harms the human clan in the future,

63
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,380
you can take my life.

64
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,909
Lord Zi, please show mercy and spare his life.

65
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,340
I can let him live,

66
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,340
but I have one condition.

67
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,140
As long as you can spare his life,

68
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,500
I can agree to anything.

69
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,790
I'll take him as my apprentice.

70
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,420
Father,

71
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,820
stop talking to him!

72
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,740
That bastard

73
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,420
- killed my mother. – Xuan'er!

74
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,020
You!

75
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,260
I'll kill him at the cost of my life.

76
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,900
Lord Zi!

77
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,980
No!

78
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,740
Let me go!

79
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,340
I'm going to kill you

80
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,940
Mother!

81
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,780
Xuan'er.

82
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,300
It's the auspicious time.

83
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,620
The crowning ceremony for crown prince is about to start.

84
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,500
The officials may come in now.

85
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,100
Your Highness!

86
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,700
There's still an hour ahead.

87
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,140
Rise.

88
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,140
Thank you, Your Highness!

89
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,960
Your Highness,

90
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,180
I've transferred all the guards

91
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,980
to encircle the city ring upon ring.

92
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,220
However powerful Li Xuan is,

93
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,800
he won't be able to come in.

94
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,700
Li Xuan has many wicked ideas.

95
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,180
Do you think

96
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,420
you can stop him?

97
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,460
Your Highness, you mean…

98
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,740
In this way,

99
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,380
even if Li Xuan really comes,

100
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,580
he won't find you.

101
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,070
Your Highness, you're so wise!

102
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,950
Your Highness, you're so wise!

103
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,380
The first prince suddenly asked us

104
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,340
to find some maid garments of large sizes.

105
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,780
We've searched through the warehouse

106
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,940
only to find a few garments.

107
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,140
Right! Right!

108
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,300
Luckily, we've found them.

109
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,230
Otherwise, we'll all be punished.

110
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,180
Right.

111
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,380
Stupid as Li Xuan is,

112
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,900
he certainly won't know

113
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,460
I've come up with such a brilliant idea.

114
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,260
Well,

115
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,020
he must be searching the four sedan chairs.

116
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,840
Which sedan chair is the first prince in?

117
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,220
What do you think?

118
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,020
Isn't my idea brilliant?

119
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,820
Fruits.

120
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,140
What a pity!

121
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,740
Today I still have to attend the crown ceremony,

122
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,300
so I can't witness how frustrated he is

123
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,620
with my own eyes.

124
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,480
Otherwise,

125
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,560
I can really work off my anger, right?

126
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,080
Fruits.

127
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,420
Actually,

128
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,520
it's not so hard to see Li Xuan.

129
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,420
What a fool!

130
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,500
He wants to witness my frustration,

131
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,560
but his idea sucks.

132
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,620
Li Xuan!

133
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,260
Take him away.

134
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,920
Let go of me!

135
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,900
What time is it now?

136
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,820
Right! Right!

137
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,660
The auspicious time is about to pass.

138
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,260
Right. Why isn't he here yet?

139
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,820
How can this be?

140
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,380
Unbelievable!

141
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,020
What time is it now?

142
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,700
If the ceremony can't be held in time,

143
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,180
His Majesty will be furious.

144
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,460
Well,

145
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,060
is everything all right?

146
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,140
What time is it now?

147
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,860
Your Majesty,

148
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,940
it's the auspicious time,

149
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,500
but the first prince

150
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,790
hasn't shown up yet.

151
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,860
Why don't you send guards to find him?

152
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,180
I've already sent guards,

153
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,740
but…

154
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,300
Report!

155
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,940
Report!

156
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,580
Your Majesty,

157
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,500
His Highness…

158
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,340
His Highness…

159
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,860
Speak out! How is he?

160
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,220
Your Majesty,

161
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,300
His Highness

162
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
is missing.

163
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,540
What?

164
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,980
Missing?

165
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,900
According to the guards on duty,

166
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,360
His Highness is probably…

167
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,230
…abducted by Nation-protecting Master Li Xuan.

168
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,300
Well…

169
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,180
Li Shude,

170
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,000
what a good son you've raised!

171
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,310
Your Majesty, don't worry.

172
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,310
I'll definitely bring back the crown prince safely.

173
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,180
What a brat!

174
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,220
He causes trouble every day.

175
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,820
Youlian,

176
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,900
we've arrived.

177
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,620
Master,

178
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,280
is this Qingtian City?

179
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,740
It's been ten years.

180
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,380
The Dragon Emperor has been trapped inside the Moyun Ancient Academy of Qingtian City

181
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,060
for ten years.

182
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,020
Youlian,

183
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,780
you're the only Saintess of our Kunwu clan.

184
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,180
Our hope to save the Dragon Emperor

185
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,020
and rejuvenate our clan

186
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,260
rests on you.

187
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,140
Master, don't worry.

188
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,900
I won't let you down.

189
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,420
In future,

190
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,980
I'll transform into a swift and portable sword

191
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,500
to protect you,

192
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,060
but keep in mind that when you enter the ancient academy,

193
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,460
you must be extra careful.

194
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,500
Ziji, the old guy,

195
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,140
has set the ward in the ancient academy,

196
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,800
so I can't show up and help you.

197
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,220
I see.

198
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,220
The ten-year period is expired.

199
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,060
The human clan must be afraid of

200
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,880
the curse cast by the Spiritual Queen back then,

201
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,880
so it won't be easy for us to get in.

202
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,180
What should we do?

203
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,380
Master,

204
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,520
how come my ears have changed?

205
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,500
What about my eyes?

206
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,660
Have they also changed?

207
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,020
Yes, they have.

208
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,460
Your Saintess mark is also gone.

209
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,580
Master,

210
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,820
I must have my mark.

211
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,300
Without the Saintess mark, I'm no longer the Saintess.

212
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,220
Take it easy.

213
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,500
I've just hidden the features indicating your identity

214
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,740
as a member of the Kunwu clan temporally.

215
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,900
But do keep in mind that

216
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,940
the Saintess mark will come out when it meets water,

217
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,060
so you must be extra careful

218
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,020
when you're with the human.

219
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,420
Understand?

220
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,340
I see.

221
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,940
Good.

222
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,700
Let's enter the city.

223
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,500
It's too slow.

224
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,260
I've got things to attend to.

225
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,260
We all are.

226
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,740
Right.

227
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,740
Who's that?

228
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,020
That's Li Xuan.

229
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,180
He's the last apprentice of Ziji

230
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,800
and the Nation-protecting Master of our Tianqi State.

231
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,500
The Nation-protecting Master.

232
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,860
Then he must be powerful.

233
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,300
It is said that

234
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,260
he can handle the Dragon King of the Kunwu clan

235
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,660
to protect our human clan,

236
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,920
but I don't know whether it's true or not.

237
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,700
How can he

238
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,420
handle our Dragon King?

239
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,980
Now that the guards are searching the city

240
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,300
to look for the missing crown prince,

241
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,700
let's hurry up and leave.

242
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,180
Xuanxuan, good for you.

243
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,619
To transfer their attention,

244
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,750
you even dare abduct the crown prince!

245
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,710
He's probably used to that.

246
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,500
I've beaten him up a lot

247
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,819
since childhood.

248
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,460
Xuanxuan,

249
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,260
are you sure your father won't find out that we're leaving the city?

250
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,260
If he finds out,

251
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,819
we're done.

252
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,819
Let me tell you.

253
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,540
Whether we can get out successfully or not

254
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,260
solely depends on your acting skills.

255
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,500
I believe in you.

256
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,740
You!

257
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,340
Come here for a check.

258
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,980
OK.

259
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,660
Check.

260
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,100
Come here. Come here.

261
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,860
That's all.

262
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,060
You may go.

263
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,660
Go.

264
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,020
OK. It's done.

265
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,260
Go.

266
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,660
Let me see.

267
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,740
Look, officer…

268
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,950
Come here, that one behind. Come here.

269
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:00,740
Open it.

270
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,420
Master,

271
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,400
have you seen that mirror?

272
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,500
Yes.

273
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,420
I didn't expect Ziji to set such a barrier.

274
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,700
What a cunning fox he is!

275
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,860
That mirror is called Xuyu Mirror.

276
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,500
It can make the people of the Kunwu clan show their true appearances.

277
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,630
Miss, what's wrong?

278
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,500
The magical instrument I gave you can only deceive the public,

279
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,100
but it can't fool the mirror.

280
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,580
You.

281
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,070
Come here for a check

282
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,420
Master?

283
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,220
Maybe you should leave the city first and figure out a way later.

284
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,740
No way!

285
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,340
Tomorrow is the exam day.

286
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,740
If we don't get in today, there's no chance.

287
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,060
What're you waiting for?

288
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,580
There're so many people lining behind you.

289
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,340
Hurry up!

290
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,260
I…

291
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,540
Can't you understand me?

292
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,260
I can. I can.

293
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,260
I'm coming.

294
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,410
Hurry up!

295
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,230
I'm done! I'm done!

296
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,060
What to do now?

297
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,100
Make way! Make way!

298
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,020
It's the plague!

299
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,460
Make way! He died from the plague!

300
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,260
If you're infected, your hands and feet will rot!

301
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,020
Make way!

302
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,060
Make way!

303
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,260
Stop!

304
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,820
Who's on that?

305
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,140
My father.

306
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,840
What happened?

307
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,350
He died from the plague.

308
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,740
He's dead?

309
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,100
What a silly son!

310
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,400
My entire family died yesterday.

311
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,140
Your entire family died?

312
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,140
Yes.

313
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,640
I haven't heard there's a plague in the city.

314
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,900
Stop!

315
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,440
When did you go over there?

316
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,380
Have you looked into the mirror?

317
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,420
Yes, I have.

318
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,980
I just came from over there.

319
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,340
These officers have seen that.

320
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,540
I haven't.

321
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,140
Go back to the mirror

322
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,200
for another check.

323
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,340
Haven't you heard me?

324
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,900
Officer,

325
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,540
something's wrong with him.

326
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,500
How can anything go wrong with a dead man?

327
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,300
Right! How can anything go wrong with a dead man?

328
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
In my opinion, something's wrong with you.

329
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,030
Officer, you should check her.

330
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,820
I just heard you say

331
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,710
your father passed away. When?

332
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,460
Yesterday.

333
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,300
Yesterday?

334
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,900
It's so hot. He's been dead for one day and one night.

335
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,700
How come the corpse doesn't attract any flies?

336
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,500
Right.

337
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,780
Right, there aren't any flies.

338
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,380
Look, aren't those flies.

339
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,940
I can't get rid of them.

340
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,380
The corpse must be stinky.

341
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,940
Officer, my father was infected with plague.

342
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,220
If you don't believe me, you can lift the cover and have a look.

343
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,420
Officers over there,

344
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,180
please lift the cover and have a look.

345
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,780
Officer, please lift the cover and have a look.

346
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,480
Hurry up and go!

347
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,870
I'll lift the cover.

348
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,060
Keep a distance! Keep a distance! Keep a distance!

349
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,940
So scary.

350
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,300
Is this your father?

351
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,500
Adopted father,

352
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,460
you died so miserably!

353
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,900
Why did you leave me alone?

354
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,950
Adopted father,

355
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,980
you were the last of your family,

356
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,380
but now you're also gone.

357
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,830
Adopted father,

358
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,620
you died so miserably!

359
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,540
He looked like the man in the picture.

360
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,300
Adopted father,

361
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,100
you died so miserably!

362
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,540
Isn't that Mr. Li?

363
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,540
Mr. Li?

364
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,780
Adopted father,

365
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,200
how come the picture looks a bit like you?

366
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,140
Adopted father!

367
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,140
The corpse moves! The corpse moves! The corpse moves!

368
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,220
It's so scary! This…

369
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,900
Right.

370
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,620
He's not dead.

371
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,780
Is he really alive?

372
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,390
What's going on?

373
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,340
It's so scary!

374
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,180
It's a trick.

375
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,180
It's not real.

376
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,660
What a fool! Let's go!

377
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,420
Catch them.

378
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,620
Stop!

379
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,060
Stop him!

380
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,300
Stop!

381
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,340
Stop!

382
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,060
Mr. Li, stop!

383
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,460
- Stop! - Those in front,

384
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,300
stop Mr. Li! Hurry up!

385
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,500
Mr. Li!

386
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,780
Don't let him get out of the city.

387
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,500
Finally, I can leave the city.

388
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,420
This time,

389
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,260
I wonder who can stop me!

390
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,780
I'm out!

391
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,740
Why?

392
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,940
Who is that?

393
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,660
Xuanxuan.

394
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,420
What a brat!

395
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,160
You want to run away again!

396
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,420
Stinky old man, I knew it's you.

397
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,500
Let go of me! I want to go out.

398
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,900
If I let you leave,

399
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,140
how embarrassed I will be?

400
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,220
Let go of me! I don't care!

401
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,060
Let go of me!

402
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,580
Stinky old man!

403
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,180
Stinky old man, let go of me!

404
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,660
As the Nation-protecting Master, I order you to let me go!

405
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,220
Please let me go!

406
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,220
Look at him!

407
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,180
Bian Lingcheng, help!

408
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,110
Bian Lingcheng!

409
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,580
I'm invisible! Invisible! Invisible!

410
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,860
I'm invisible! Invisible! Invisible!

411
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,980
Bian Lingcheng, help!

412
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,860
I'm invisible! Invisible!

413
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,700
I'm invisible! Invisible! Invisible!

414
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,900
What? You disloyal bastard!

415
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,660
Fine, I won't leave you alone.

416
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,900
Master,

417
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,190
he's my accomplice.

418
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,660
He instigated me!

419
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,300
Catch him now!

420
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,340
Master!

421
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,300
Lord Zi,

422
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,720
I'll tie myself up.

423
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,140
No need to bother you.

424
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,300
Let go of me!

425
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,640
Why do you tie me up?

426
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,500
Li Xuan,

427
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,760
I'm coming for you!

428
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,580
My dear brother!

429
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,300
I'm coming!

430
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,260
Li Xuan,

431
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,220
you should at least wait till I changed my clothes

432
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,460
to bury me.

433
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,700
Li Xuan,

434
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,300
come out!

435
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,060
I order you

436
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,500
to release me now!

437
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,110
Otherwise, I'll kill your entire family.

438
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,980
Kill…

439
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,620
There're bugs!

440
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,300
Feng Changqing!

441
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,420
There're bugs! There're bugs!

442
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,700
Release me now!

443
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,760
Your Highness!

444
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,980
Your Highness!

445
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,340
Your Highness!

446
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,540
I'm here!

447
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,220
I'm here!

448
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,500
Feng Changqing, stop…

449
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,140
Hurry up!

450
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,830
Hurry up!

451
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,070
Feng Changqing!

452
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,100
Feng Changqing!

453
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,700
Your Highness!

454
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,430
Your Highness! Your Highness!

455
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,980
Can you still recognize me?

456
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,620
What're you looking at! Keep digging!

457
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,500
Yes!

458
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,420
Hurry up! I'll look for the tools. Hurry up!

459
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,380
Where are you going?

460
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,980
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

461
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,380
Well, someone should stay by my side.

462
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,100
There're really bugs here.

463
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,000
How dare you talk back?

464
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,820
Look at what you've done!

465
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,820
You bastard!

466
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,860
You not only abducted the crown prince and ruin the crowning ceremony,

467
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,120
but acted recklessly in front of Lord Zi.

468
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,340
If Lord Zi gets sick because of what you did,

469
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,740
I'll skin you alive.

470
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,700
Father,

471
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,220
that stinky old man is more energetic than I am.

472
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,940
He won't die.

473
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,620
Feel relieved.

474
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,220
You!

475
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,700
How dare you talk back?

476
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,340
I can stop talking back.

477
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,940
Take me to Bai Xiaosheng.

478
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,860
I want to ask him about my mother.

479
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,910
Father, what're you thinking?

480
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,780
There's only one hit left? Will you hit me or not?

481
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,340
Hurry up!

482
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,030
I feel so scared seeing you holding the stick!

483
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,060
How dare you leave the city?

484
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,060
Let me tell you. Don't even think about it!

485
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,820
Guards!

486
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,620
Lock young master and that young man surnamed Bian

487
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,740
into the wood shed.

488
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:46,540
Yes!

489
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,540
Watch them carefully.

490
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,580
Without my permission,

491
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,020
no one can release them.

492
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,180
- Yes! - Yes!

493
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,180
Lord Zi.

494
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,860
I wiped out his memory

495
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,420
after the war which happened years ago.

496
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,700
I didn't expect that

497
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,460
he still remembers the past.

498
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,500
What he remembers are fragments of the past.

499
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,940
But after all, I owe him.

500
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,540
Never mind.

501
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,420
It's useless mentioning the past.

502
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,540
The annual exam of the ancient academy will be held tomorrow.

503
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,020
As the Nation-protecting Master,

504
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,260
he shoulders great responsibility,

505
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,820
so he must be admitted into the ancient academy.

506
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,020
Lord Zi, don't worry.

507
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,340
Even if I have to tie him up,

508
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,900
I'll get him into the ancient academy.

509
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,340
Lord Zi, let's talk inside.

510
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,820
We should increase surveillance at the city gate.

511
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,580
The ten-year period is about to expire.

512
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,820
We must guard against

513
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,660
the disaster which is about to come.

514
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,980
But over the past ten years,

515
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,980
the Kunwu clan has taken no actions.

516
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,260
The curses cast by the Saintess of Kunwu

517
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,100
all come true.

518
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,940
You can't take it lightly.

519
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,140
Yes.

520
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,100
What're you thinking?

521
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,860
I wonder whether my father

522
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,350
failed my mother or not.

523
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,940
Otherwise, how come he dares not mention her?

524
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,500
Stop making assumptions.

525
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,300
Maybe your father doesn't want to mention your mother

526
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,830
because he doesn't want to remember the pain.

527
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,300
Xuan'er,

528
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,020
you said you often dream of your mother.

529
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,340
Haven't you seen

530
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,220
how she died in your dreams?

531
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,380
Every time I dreamed of her,

532
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,070
she was covered with blood.

533
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,540
I clung to her and asked her what on earth had happened.

534
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,070
Then she just disappeared.

535
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,460
What on earth happened back then?

536
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,300
Why did these adults keep silent?

537
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,750
I asked my father several times

538
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,660
at the risk of being punched.

539
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,540
However,

540
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,240
he can't explain clearly.

541
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,300
Well,

542
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,620
am I a loyal friend?

543
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,940
Of course.

544
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,670
I haven't forgotten what happened at the city gate just now.

545
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,420
Well, that girl was to blame

546
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,620
for what happened then.

547
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,300
Right.

548
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,900
How come I didn't think of her?

549
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,620
I'll definitely catch her.

550
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,380
Now that we're trapped here,

551
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,700
how can we catch her?

552
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,870
How come Changqing is not here yet?

553
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,060
What takes you so long this time?

554
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,460
Impressive!

555
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,540
They are the guards of your mansion.

556
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,500
Can't you be gentle?

557
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,660
Spread! Spread your tail!

558
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,900
Spread! Spread!

559
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,020
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

560
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,500
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

561
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,100
Bravo!

562
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,580
Bravo!

563
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:47,980
First-class porcelain.

564
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,180
Come and have a look.

565
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,430
Come and have a look. First-class porcelain.

566
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,860
Porcelain?

567
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,680
What's this place?

568
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,100
Do you know?

569
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,020
This time, the admission exam of Moyun Ancient Academy

570
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,740
is the largest among the recent ten years.

571
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,540
It is said that

572
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,820
many royal and noble descendants will take part in the exam.

573
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,420
Right.

574
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,420
It is said that anyone ranks first in the exam

575
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,140
can become the apprentice of Ziji,

576
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,620
thus gaining respect from the world.

577
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,980
If I rank first in the exam,

578
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,900
I can choose

579
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,300
whichever lady I like.

580
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,300
Watch me!

581
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,700
I'll definitely rank first in the exam.

582
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,740
Look!

583
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,620
There's actually

584
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,740
such an unparalleled beauty in the Qingtian City.

585
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,700
Is she also here to take part in the exam?

586
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,220
Well, you may not know her.

587
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,780
She's Cui Pianran,

588
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,740
the eldest daughter of Minister Cui.

589
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,340
The lady beside her in plain clothes

590
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,580
is Cui Yanran,

591
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,800
the second daughter of Minister Cui.

592
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,540
Miss,

593
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,830
our restaurant is fully occupied.

594
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,340
There's really no table left.

595
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,100
May you

596
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,820
go to another restaurant?

597
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,860
What did you just say?

598
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,300
You should be honored that

599
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,340
our lady wants to eat here.

600
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,500
How dare you drive us away?

601
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,900
That's not what I mean,

602
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,940
but today…

603
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,380
Miss Cui, eat with me.

604
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:12,940
Miss Cui!

605
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,400
Miss Cui, come and join us.

606
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,900
Miss Cui, please do us the honor of joining us.

607
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,860
Come to our table. Eat with us.

608
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,430
Miss Cui,

609
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,340
sit with us.

610
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,680
Sit with us.

611
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,500
Sit with us.

612
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,740
Miss Cui, sit here.

613
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,380
Do us the honor of joining us.

614
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,260
We've also got places here.

615
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,060
Miss Cui!

616
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,620
Miss Cui! Miss Cui!

617
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,260
Miss Cui, please join us!

618
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
Join us! Miss Cui.

619
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,420
I'll sit here.

620
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,260
You! Go away!

621
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,940
Yanran, sit here.

622
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,980
Well,

623
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,150
I haven't finished eating yet.

624
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,020
You actually asked me to go away.

625
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,260
That's not right.

626
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,780
Juan'er.

627
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,820
What're you doing?

628
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,620
Elder sister,

629
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,700
there're so many people here.

630
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,700
Let's go and eat at home.

631
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,860
I want to eat here today.

632
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,220
Step aside.

633
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,260
What about this?

634
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,420
I'll finish eating as soon as possible.

635
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,060
Then I'll leave my table to you.

636
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,380
Is that OK?

637
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,740
What a nerd!

638
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,420
How come you're so talkative?

639
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,460
Juan'er.

640
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,140
Here's the money.

641
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,350
Eat somewhere else.

642
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,140
Go away now!

643
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,580
Don't stay here to ruin our lady's mood.

644
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,520
How can you abuse your power and bully me?

645
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,620
So what?

646
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,420
So what?

647
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,540
We bullied you. So what?

648
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,500
So what?

649
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,300
Why do you hurt me?

650
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,100
Who's so unreasonable?

651
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,980
The Cuis are so impressive!

652
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,540
In the broad daylight,

653
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,380
you actually let out

654
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,980
vicious dogs to bite others.

655
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,300
It seems that

656
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,580
the family tradition of the Cuis is not so admirable.

657
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,020
Who the hell are you?

658
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,580
Judged from the way she dressed,

659
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,340
she appears to be the princess of the State of Sha.

660
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,340
I heard she's also here to take part in the admission exam of the Moyun Ancient Academy.

661
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,420
Your father is just a minister.

662
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,989
How dare you use his power to bully others?

663
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,219
What a joke!

664
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,620
Oh, my God!

665
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,100
There're also performers here.

666
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,890
Make way!

667
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,330
Thank you!

668
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:16,700
Awesome!

669
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,180
How skilled and powerful!

670
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,100
Miss.

671
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,380
Miss.

672
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,580
Are you OK.

673
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,580
Come on.

674
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,140
Get up.

675
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:55,940
Miss,

676
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,580
you two are awesome!

677
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,780
How dare you mock me?

678
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,300
I

679
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,260
should tip you, right?

680
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,700
Who should I tip?

681
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,740
What do you mean?

682
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,140
Do you think I am a beggar?

683
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,140
I don't.

684
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,240
I thought you're performers.

685
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,780
Your Highness, thank you for helping me.

686
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,460
Please accept my heartfelt thanks.

687
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,140
No need.

688
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,340
No, I should thank you.

689
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,460
According to the books,

690
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,820
the kindness of dripping water should be reciprocated by a gushing spring.

691
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,780
Your Highness, I'll definitely

692
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,580
repay your kindness today.

693
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,340
I said no need. Just leave.

694
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,100
Your Highness, you're really kind.

695
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,060
If everyone in the world

696
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,340
is as open-minded and tolerant as you are,

697
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,220
the world is bound to be peaceful and prosperous.

698
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,540
Are you done?

699
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,020
I've got one more sentence to say to you.

700
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,060
You want to repay my kindness, right?

701
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:44,820
Fine.

702
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,260
Now promise me one thing.

703
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,660
Let alone one thing,

704
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,340
as long as I can do it,

705
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,820
I'll go through fire and water

706
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,700
for you.

707
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,340
Then listen to me carefully now.

708
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,700
From now on, I want you to

709
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,300
stay five zhang away from me

710
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,520
and never talk with me. Are you clear?

711
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,740
This…

712
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,540
Well,

713
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,020
don't you want to repay my kindness?

714
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,100
Yes, I do.

715
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,140
I'll follow your requirement.

716
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,540
See you.

717
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,260
Five zhang.

718
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,670
Where's my spiritual instrument?

719
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:24,980
I see.

720
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,820
You stole my spiritual instrument,

721
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,980
so I lost.

722
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,900
Elder sister,

723
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,790
stealing spiritual instrument is a big deal.

724
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,220
I don't think she's a thief.

725
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,340
Thief or not, we'll know after we search her.

726
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,110
Juan'er,

727
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:38,980
search her.

728
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,700
What? What're you doing?

729
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,100
Make way! Make way!

730
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,500
The Nation-protecting Master is here!

731
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,580
The Nation-protecting Master is here.

732
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,300
Li Xuan, you're here.

733
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,700
Isn't this Miss Cui

734
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,630
who claims to be the No.1 beauty of the Qingtian City?

735
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,420
I heard you want to search her, right?

736
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,260
Yes.

737
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,740
She stole my spiritual instrument,

738
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,820
so I was utterly defeated.

739
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,660
What?

740
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,300
Really?!

741
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,700
As the Nation-protecting Master,

742
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,500
I'll definitely do you justice.

743
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,940
You're the Nation-protecting Master?

744
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,540
Of course.

745
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,980
Terrific!

746
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,140
Then everything will be easier later.

747
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,700
What do you want?

748
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,620
In the broad daylight,

749
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,780
you actually dared steal things

750
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,060
in front of me,

751
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,700
the Nation-protecting Master!

752
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,820
Unbelievable!

753
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,700
I didn't steal from her.

754
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,020
Stop quibbling about it.

755
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,100
I really didn't!

756
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,860
Stop!

757
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,660
I told you I really didn't steal from her.

758
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,320
Changqing,

759
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,760
help her remember.

760
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,660
Yes.

761
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,020
Elder sister,

762
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,080
how can you leave that girl to Li Xuan?

763
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,020
He's the No.1 young ruffian in the Qingtian City!

764
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,780
She pissed me off first.

765
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:06,940
Where are you going?

766
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,380
I'm going back to them.

767
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,860
You don't even know where they are.

768
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,060
How can you find them?

769
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:11,860
Let's go.

770
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,460
I…

771
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,580
Go!

772
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,780
Help!

773
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,700
What's going on?

774
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,340
You!

775
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:18,900
Help!

776
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,620
Li Xuan, the Nation-protecting Master and the most handsome man in the Qingtian City

777
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,220
is abducting an innocent girl.

778
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,380
Help, please!

779
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,820
Bastard!

780
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,940
He can't even spare a little girl.

781
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,900
Thank God you're not a woman.

782
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,180
If you're a woman,

783
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,620
I'm afraid your young master

784
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,660
would have long…

785
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,780
I'm just kidding! Don't take it seriously.

786
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,900
Why do you tie me up?

787
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,060
Why?

788
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,300
To search you of course.

789
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,460
I really didn't steal from her.

790
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,180
Whether you stole from her or not,

791
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,780
I'll know after I search you.

792
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,260
Don't come near me!

793
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,420
Let me tell you.

794
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,980
I'm going to search

795
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,860
every inch of your body.
