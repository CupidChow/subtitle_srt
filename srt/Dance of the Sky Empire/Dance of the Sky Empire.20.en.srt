2
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,800
Dance of the Sky Empire

3
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,800
Episode 20

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,950
You lied to me.

5
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,039
It wasn't what you really wanted to say, right?

6
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,830
I…

7
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,230
Nation-protecting Master.

8
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,870
Nation-protecting Master.

9
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,240
Nation-protecting Master.

10
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,000
Wake up.

11
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,750
It seems that you had a sweet dream.

12
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,480
The why did you wake me up?

13
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,910
Look outside.

14
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,160
What's the time now?

15
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,390
If you keep sleeping, it will be dark.

16
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,880
I've been sleeping for such a long time?

17
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,550
You…

18
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,600
Just get washed to clear your mind.

19
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,550
Could it be that

20
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,230
it was a dream last night?

21
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,950
Su Youlian.

22
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,920
Don't remain impatient.

23
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,040
Remember that

24
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,770
you still bear the responsibility of saving the Kunwu clan.

25
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,270
Lord Zi.

26
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,600
Lord Zi. Lord Zi.

27
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,760
Bad news.

28
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,000
It's too late.

29
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,230
What's happened?

30
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,350
Lord Zi.

31
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,170
Something serious happened. Come out quickly.

32
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,850
Lord Zi. Go to save Li Xuan, please.

33
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,720
What trouble did he make?

34
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,760
Today he went out of the city with the second prince.

35
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,159
Unexpectedly, they met some Kunwu people.

36
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,670
Whether they're alive or not is unknown.

37
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,400
You must save Li Xuan this time.

38
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,000
Is what he said true?

39
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,790
Hurry up.

40
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,080
Quickly.

41
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,030
He went inside.

42
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,350
I have to go now.

43
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,670
Hope you can make it this time.

44
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,400
Prince Mu.

45
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,000
Thank you for helping me all the time.

46
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,320
We're friends. No need to say thanks.

47
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Youlian.

48
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,790
Hope we can meet again.

49
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,520
Certainly.

50
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,430
This is the Dragon Secret Realm, right?

51
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,960
So deserted.

52
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,050
Sword of the nation-protecting master.

53
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,910
If I pull the sword,

54
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,710
is it really likely for me to get the clues of my mother?

55
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,000
Li Xuan.

56
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,440
long Wei'er.

57
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,960
Why are you here?

58
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,110
You're really careless.

59
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,470
Entering such a Secret Realm,

60
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,550
how couldn't you know that you're followed?

61
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,400
You follow me?

62
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,400
I'm afraid that you'll be cheated.

63
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,260
So I follow you here to have a look.

64
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,790
It's so empty here

65
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
with a sword only.

66
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,080
I'm afraid it can't be so simple.

67
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,440
So what?

68
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,790
Wait.

69
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,250
Have you ever thought that

70
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,770
someone had bribed Bai Xiaosheng

71
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,760
and intentionally deceived you to enter this Formation

72
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,200
with the purpose to make you pull up the sword?

73
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,470
Who could do this?

74
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,840
My suspect

75
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,650
has never been changed.

76
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,280
Long Wei'er.

77
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,840
I've told you many times.

78
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,670
I know Su Youlian.

79
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,890
She is not so mean as you think.

80
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,100
She is not that kind of person.

81
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,030
This is…

82
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,790
Dragon Emperor.

83
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,320
Su Youlian.

84
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,520
Youlian.

85
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,280
Why are you here?

86
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,760
As

87
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,910
the 20th Saintess of the Kunwu clan,

88
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,810
I show my respect to you, Dragon Emperor.

89
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,000
Impossible.

90
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,520
Impossible.

91
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,330
You're always lying to me, right?

92
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes.

93
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,060
You took away my token, right?

94
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,880
Yes.

95
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,610
What about Bai Xiaosheng?

96
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,470
I did it.

97
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,550
So…

98
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,640
So

99
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,990
there isn't any information about my mother here, right?

100
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,240
You deceived me here

101
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,170
to help you pull up the sword to save the Dragon Emperor, right?

102
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,230
Yes.

103
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,490
Su Youlian. You're so selfish.

104
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,550
Do you know how many times Li Xuan

105
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,880
has risked his life for you?

106
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,320
It turned out that you tricked him,

107
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,030
took advantage of him to relieve the seal

108
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,550
and forced him to be guilty for the State of Tianqi

109
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,670
and the human clan.

110
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,210
How can you bear to do it?

111
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,640
I…

112
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,110
I have no choice.

113
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,080
Li Xuan.

114
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,790
I'm sorry.

115
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,590
I heard Su Youlian asked you for the number one token several times.

116
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,710
Have you ever suspected of her identity?

117
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,760
No need to suspect.

118
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,420
Many people want to get the number one token.

119
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,520
So it is.

120
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,000
As for someone

121
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,080
so persistent like Miss Su,

122
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,810
have you ever seen another one?

123
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,690
What do you want to say on earth?

124
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,110
Kunwu.

125
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,730
I should have suspected of you early.

126
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,290
I should have suspected of you early.

127
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
You can leave.

128
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,099
I don't want to injure you.

129
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,000
Ok.

130
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,170
Give me the Saintess Stone.

131
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,280
Kill him.

132
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,310
Kill him.

133
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,110
Kill him.

134
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,480
No, I can't. Master.

135
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,280
Master.

136
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,040
Are you sure

137
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,570
Li Xuan and the second prince were taken here by the Kunwu clan?

138
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,330
The Young Master told me

139
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,190
to stop you returning to the Academy quickly.

140
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:16,880
You.

141
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,230
Brat!

142
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,920
It's really mischief.

143
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,710
Li Xuan.

144
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,160
Hold on.

145
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,760
Do you want to be killed by her?

146
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,400
Su Youlian.

147
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,760
Are you crazy?

148
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,800
He has no self-healing power now.

149
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,040
Where is your self-healing power?

150
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,280
Previously you could

151
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
get out of the Bloody Icebound Ward,

152
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,520
because Li Xuan gave his self-healing power

153
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,380
to the Elder of the Book of Heaven.

154
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,640
Take it.

155
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,030
No matter what happens, don't loose your hand.

156
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,230
I can't go out.

157
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,190
Yet

158
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,060
I will stay here missing you all the time.

159
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,190
I will miss you all the time.

160
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,190
Master.

161
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,190
Li Xuan.

162
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,800
No.

163
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,310
We Kunwu clan

164
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,680
just want to live a peaceful life

165
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,430
like the human clan.

166
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,640
Why

167
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,760
do you act like this?

168
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,530
You just perform your duty.

169
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,520
And I perform mine.

170
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,350
Master.

171
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,680
Don't kill her.

172
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,880
Brat!

173
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,520
She tricked you so hard.

174
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,560
How could you still protect her?

175
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,680
Li Xuan.

176
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,280
Master.

177
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,190
Li Xuan.

178
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,920
This is the Moon-fall Formation that sealed the Dragon Emperor.

179
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,040
Affected by the Saintess Stone,

180
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,110
it has been loosened

181
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,280
It's certain that Xiao Fengming will like it

182
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,140
when he sees it.

183
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,880
Classmate Xiao.

184
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,810
It's so late. Where are you going?

185
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,640
Is it possible that he is sleepwalking?

186
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,310
I don't think so.

187
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,350
Maybe he wants to go to princess Yunshan's room

188
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,080
to watch her bathing secretly.

189
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,310
Classmate Xiao. You…

190
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,970
Did you hear any noise?

191
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,430
No.

192
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,190
Your Highness.

193
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,070
The pouch is nearly finished.

194
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,130
Go to bed early, OK?

195
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,950
Look.

196
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,560
It'll be finished soon.

197
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,310
There seems something wrong.

198
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,570
Let me go to have a look.

199
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,810
Your Highness.

200
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,640
Your Highness. Be careful.

201
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Help!

202
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,070
Help!

203
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,800
Eventually I don't need to live for the sake of remaining alive

204
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,000
in this fool's body.

205
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,040
Go away.

206
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,150
Who are you?

207
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,950
Why are you in my body?

208
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,150
I am the Dragon Emperor of the Kunwu clan.

209
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,230
It's your honor

210
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,120
to be my residence.

211
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,690
The Dragon Emperor of the Kunwu clan.

212
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,560
Impossible!

213
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,120
Clearly he has been sealed

214
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,650
in the icy cocoon by Lord Zi.

215
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,760
I'm his demon spirit.

216
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,040
It's not so easy

217
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,910
to trap me.

218
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,560
Demon spirit?

219
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,150
When did you enter my body?

220
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,680
Catch me!

221
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,930
You can't catch me.

222
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,360
Stop. You…

223
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,760
You can't catch me.

224
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,230
Wait for me.

225
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,190
I get you.

226
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,150
Be careful.

227
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,120
Xiao Fengming.

228
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
What's wrong with you?

229
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,190
Xiao Fengming. Are you OK?

230
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,420
What happened?

231
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,360
Mentor. Xiao Fengming is asleep.

232
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,000
Help him up.

233
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,000
It turns out that each time I sleepwalk

234
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,280
and become powerful,

235
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,230
it's you who are making trouble.

236
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,080
You know too much.

237
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,000
From now on,

238
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:49,190
there isn't Xiao Fengming in this world.

239
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,450
What are you doing?

240
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,320
What's wrong with you?

241
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,150
What happened?

242
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,430
Killing.

243
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,800
Killing.

244
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,080
Killing.

245
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,320
Killing.

246
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,120
Who is killing?

247
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,630
No.

248
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,800
I can't say it's Xiao Fengming.

249
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,520
Xiao Fengming wouldn't have done this.

250
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,450
Absolutely not.

251
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,840
Tell me.

252
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,120
Who is killing?

253
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,360
Tell me.

254
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,670
I… I don't know.

255
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,360
Killing?

256
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,640
Mentor in Chief.

257
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,360
Why are so many classmates dead?

258
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,750
It's dangerous to stay here.

259
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,320
Let's go.

260
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,840
Youlian.

261
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,480
No matter what happened in the Academy,

262
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,600
it has nothing to do with you now.

263
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,440
We have to leave here at once.

264
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,000
Let's go.

265
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,170
Mentor in Chief Xie.

266
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,390
who on earth did it?

267
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,520
The power of the Kunwu clan

268
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,760
is widely divergent with that of us human clan.

269
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,160
According to the wounds,

270
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,950
it must be the Kunwu clan that did it.

271
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,910
I'm going to find Lord Zi now.

272
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,150
Be careful.

273
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,120
Your Highness. You are back.

274
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,660
Your Highness.

275
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,800
Get on the carriage.

276
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,160
How terrible!

277
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,520
Who is so cruel

278
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,900
killing so many people in a night?

279
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,120
It must be Su Youlian.

280
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,560
Lord Zi said

281
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,470
Su Youlian was a spy sent by the Kunwu clan.

282
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,710
Failing to arouse the Dragon Emperor,

283
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,000
so she had a slaughter.

284
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,630
You must have made a mistake.

285
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,560
How could it be? Look.

286
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,150
Were they really killed by Youlian?

287
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,670
Young Master.

288
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,470
It's my fault.

289
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,280
If it hadn't been for me,

290
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,230
they wouldn't have been dead.

291
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,320
Actually,

292
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,240
you are not to blame for all.

293
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,000
Lord Zi.

294
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,430
the most urgent is to find her first

295
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,600
in case she keeps on slaughtering for revenge.

296
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,670
Inform

297
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,070
to lock the city door.

298
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,430
Spare no pains to search and catch the Kunwu siren.

299
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,190
Yes.

300
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,040
Lord Zi.

301
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,360
Lord Zi.

302
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,280
Princess Yunshan, Prince Mu

303
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,230
and Xiao Fengming

304
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,230
are all missing.

305
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,150
Lord Zi.

306
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,950
Prince Mu and Princess Yunshan can protect themselves.

307
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,520
But Xiao Fengming is weak.

308
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,390
I'm afraid he is in danger.

309
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,280
Send people to look for them.

310
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,000
Yes.

311
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,560
Su Youlian.

312
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,190
Why are you so cruel?

313
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,560
Young Master.
