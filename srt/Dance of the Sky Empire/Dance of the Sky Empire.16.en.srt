00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,870
Dance of the Sky Empire

3
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,870
Episode 16

4
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,830
What is that?

5
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,760
That is the Lovers' Bridge

6
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,960
which leads to the mountain over there.

7
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,960
The Lovers' Bridge?

8
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,640
Is the Lovers' Bridge

9
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,800
for lovers only?

10
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,440
Well, according to the legend,

11
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,630
there used to be a young couple

12
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,550
where the boy lived in this mountain

13
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,079
and the girl lived in the mountain over there.

14
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,390
Separated by the mountains, they didn't get to see each other.

15
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,190
In order to see his crush

16
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,829
and for the convenience of the residents of the mountain villages,

17
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,960
the boy decided to cut wood and build a bridge

18
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,690
connecting the two mountains.

19
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,320
With the bridge being built,

20
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,560
did they get to see each other every day?

21
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,550
Building a bridge

22
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,110
is easier said than done.

23
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,270
The boy called for the joint effort of the mountain residents.

24
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,000
However, the rulers thought it was ridiculous

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,270
and wouldn't offer help.

26
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,400
The boy had to cut wood and build the bridge all on his own.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,160
However, one afternoon,

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,440
it started to rain cats and dogs while he was building the bridge.

29
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,160
He fell off the cliff by accident

30
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,020
and his body has never been found.

31
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,390
In honor of this boy

32
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,880
and to compensate for not offering help,

33
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,960
the villagers then decided to

34
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,910
finish the bridge building.

35
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,270
The girl remained unmarried all her life

36
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,520
to honor him.

37
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,829
It's a sad story.

38
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,110
Why couldn't lovers be together?

39
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,240
This is life.

40
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,880
However, as long as a couple cross that bridge together,

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
they will get married

42
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,990
and live happily ever after.

43
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,390
Is it true?

44
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:41,550
Of course.

45
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,110
Thus goes the legend.

46
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,050
So, this is the Lovers' Bridge.

47
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,000
Would you like to walk on it?

48
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,350
No, no, no.

49
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,779
Your Highness,

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,510
the bridge is built with vines and planks.

51
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,600
It's old

52
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,610
and rickety.

53
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,810
It's dangerous.

54
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,790
You coward.

55
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,350
Your Highness!

56
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,830
It's dangerous! Please come back here.

57
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,640
No way.

58
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,000
If you're not gonna walk on the bridge,

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,790
you can take the devious route downhill

60
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,120
and wait for me on the mountain over there.

61
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,000
Well,

62
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,440
I…

63
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,440
It seems you'd risk your life to save me

64
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,830
if I fell off the bridge.

65
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,440
You're a princess.

66
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,170
If anything happens to you, I…

67
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,510
Your Highness!

68
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,560
Your Highness! Your Highness!

69
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,440
Tell me,

70
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,110
what will happen

71
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,440
if we cross the bridge together?

72
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,110
Well…

73
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,950
I…

74
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,060
Your Highness,

75
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,320
please wait for me.

76
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,720
Please wait for me.

77
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,440
I have a fear of heights.

78
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,510
Your Highness!

79
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,160
Youlian?

80
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,920
Youlian?

81
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,790
Are you awake? Youlian?

82
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,550
Youlian?

83
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,160
Youlian?

84
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,970
Youlian, are you alright?

85
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,670
You look bad.

86
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,600
I'm fine.

87
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,159
Maybe because I didn't sleep well last night.

88
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:34,880
Perhaps.

89
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,440
You just came back from the Secret Realm.

90
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,670
It takes a few days to recover.

91
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,390
Hurry up! Hurry up!

92
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,320
Hurry up! Hurry up! What happened?

93
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,040
Where are they going?

94
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,640
Well,

95
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,350
that is what I'm gonna tell you.

96
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,480
Li Xuan is back here.

97
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,550
He asked us to gather at the yard,

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,830
saying he has got some great news.

99
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,950
I'm not going. I need to…

100
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,550
Come on. Let's check it out.

101
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,230
-Yanran, I'd…
-Come on, let's go.

102
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,110
I prefer not…

103
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:56,950
Let's go.

104
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,350
What is going on?

105
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,070
What is this about?

106
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,990
Come on, let's go over there.

107
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,490
Have a guess.

108
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,670
I don't know.

109
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,230
Get out of the way.

110
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,390
Get out of the way. Get out of the way.

111
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,230
Get out of the way.

112
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,270
Get out of the way.

113
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,760
What's going on?

114
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,350
Li Xuan,

115
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,720
what is this about?

116
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,600
You said you have an important announcement.

117
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,720
You have kept us waiting so long.

118
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,510
Just tell us.

119
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,600
That's right.

120
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,550
Just tell us.

121
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Come on.

122
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,549
Tell us. Tell us. Tell us.

123
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,710
Be patient.

124
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,510
Someone is still on the way here.

125
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,200
You gotta listen carefully

126
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
when I make the announcement later.

127
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,590
Miss Cui, it turns out it's all about you.

128
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,030
I think I got it.

129
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,030
Really?

130
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,260
You're getting married, aren't you?

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,060
Congratulations!

132
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,550
Congratulations! Congratulations!

133
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,840
Congratulations!

134
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,670
Stop! Stop!

135
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,080
I haven't decided yet.

136
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,840
It's his announcement to make.

137
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,080
She is shy. She is shy.

138
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,030
The heroine is finally here.

139
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,960
What is she doing here?

140
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,280
Su Youlian?

141
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,440
Why is she the heroine?

142
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,280
What's going on here?

143
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,110
What's going on here?

144
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,030
What is she doing here?

145
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,840
That's right.

146
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,000
What's going on here?

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,670
Li Xuan,

148
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,590
what are you doing?

149
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,400
Announce our marriage.

150
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,670
Let go of her

151
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,640
I'm not letting go of her

152
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,280
Li Xuan!

153
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,710
Are you shy?

154
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,230
Well, it's too late to get shy.

155
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,790
Listen,

156
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,520
Su Youlian and I

157
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,420
are married to each other.

158
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,640
Great!

159
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,960
Great!

160
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,150
Are you serious?

161
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,840
That's right.

162
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,470
Li Xuan,

163
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,470
what are you talking about?

164
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,230
Cui Pianran!

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,910
Get down from there!

166
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,550
Don't get up on there.

167
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,210
Let go of me!

168
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,720
Remember, you're a girl.

169
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,840
They must be kidding.

170
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,230
I'm aware

171
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,790
that the announcement,

172
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,610
will break the heart of many young girls.

173
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,400
But it's okay.

174
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,420
I've found the love of my life.

175
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,470
And

176
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
I'll love her for the rest of my life.

177
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,280
So, get over it.

178
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,440
Youlian,

179
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,030
is that true?

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,440
I doubt it.

181
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,350
I doubt it, too.

182
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,640
Me too.

183
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,960
Say something.

184
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,790
Get the token back

185
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,230
and kill him.

186
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,790
Get the token back

187
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,110
and kill him.

188
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,670
Kill him!

189
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,960
Kill him!

190
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,200
No way.

191
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,710
No way.

192
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,230
Li Xuan,

193
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,960
are you sure you are married to Su Youlian?

194
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,760
It seems she didn't

195
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,030
agree with it.

196
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,470
Is that a lie?

197
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,110
Miss Su is pretty and graceful.

198
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,150
It's not a matchmaking

199
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,440
or an arranged marriage.

200
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,030
She is unlikely to marry you.

201
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,710
Exactly.

202
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,470
You're bragging.

203
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,790
You know nothing!

204
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,760
Am I bragging?

205
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,080
Youlian,

206
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,320
tell them

207
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,080
if I'm bragging or not.

208
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,960
Let's listen to her. Yeah.

209
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,000
Take the chance to get the token back

210
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,320
and kill him.

211
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,280
Get the token back

212
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,960
and kill him!

213
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,550
Get the token back and kill him!

214
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,230
Kill him!

215
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,590
I won't do it!

216
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,960
We didn't get married.

217
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,150
It was a lie.

218
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,960
We were faking it.

219
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,890
Li Xuan is bragging.

220
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,610
Li Xuan, you're bragging.

221
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,200
He is not bragging.

222
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,550
Go on with your lie.

223
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,440
Youlian,

224
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,240
what are you talking about?

225
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,500
I didn't get married with you.

226
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,110
And I won't.

227
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,030
Li Xuan,

228
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,470
stay away from me.

229
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,000
Come on.

230
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,470
Youlian,

231
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,480
what's gotten into you?

232
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,640
Are you still nervous

233
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,350
or shy?

234
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,640
Li Xuan, what are you doing?

235
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,030
What are you whispering to her?

236
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,760
Why are you whispering to her in front of us?

237
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,790
That's right.

238
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,320
Tell us.

239
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,520
What's going on here?

240
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,440
Do you still care about

241
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,770
what happened between me and Cui Pianran?

242
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,640
Don't worry.

243
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,200
I'm not gonna marry her.

244
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,760
I swear.

245
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,800
If you don't believe it,

246
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,670
I'll…

247
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,910
Please don't.

248
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,400
I think you two are a good match.

249
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,670
You have my blessing.

250
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,640
Hey,

251
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,520
what are you talking about?

252
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,710
Don't be like that.

253
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
We can talk it out.

254
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,990
What do you want me to say?

255
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,470
I hate you?

256
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,470
I don't like you?

257
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,960
I've never been into you?

258
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,230
Just don't embarrass Miss Su.

259
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,470
What's wrong with you?

260
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,910
Just get off of there.

261
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,150
Exactly.

262
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,480
Come on, ease up a bit.

263
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,000
You…

264
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,810
What are you talking about?

265
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,320
You don't like me?

266
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,150
All you can see is me.

267
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,800
How can you say you don't like me?

268
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,760
Did someone hurt you?

269
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,110
Or did someone ask you to do this?

270
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,760
No one asked me to do this.

271
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,760
No one has hurt me.

272
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,360
I don't have any excuse.

273
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,670
Then look into my eyes and say it.

274
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,470
That's right.

275
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,440
We've been here waiting.

276
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,160
What's going on here?

277
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,760
What happened?

278
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,840
Oh, the perfect timing.

279
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,700
What happened?

280
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,670
Su Youlian,

281
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,710
you said you don't have any excuse.

282
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,230
Then, do you dare to repeat what you said

283
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,080
in the Soul-enchanting and Truth-telling Formation?

284
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,710
What?

285
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,840
The Soul-enchanting and Truth-telling Formation.

286
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,200
The person who enters the formation will become delirious

287
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,440
and tell truth

288
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,200
about everything he or she is asked.

289
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,060
What do you say?

290
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,210
Is that okay for you?

291
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,000
That's right.

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,590
Do you dare?

293
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,350
Do you dare?

294
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,030
Come on, tell us.

295
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,470
Just ignore them.

296
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,640
Alright.

297
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,250
We'll talk about it later.

298
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,880
You're not feeling well. Let's get out of here.

299
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,760
Li Xuan,

300
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,550
what are you doing?

301
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,910
We want Su Youlian to enter the Truth-telling Formation.

302
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,320
Yeah, do you dare to enter the Truth-telling Formation?

303
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,550
Enter the Truth-telling Formation!

304
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,880
The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation!

305
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,880
The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation!

306
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,760
The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation!

307
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,790
The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation!

308
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,880
The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation!

309
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,840
The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation!

310
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:01,550
The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation! The Truth-telling Formation!

311
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,200
What's going on in the Moyun Ancient Academy?

312
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,310
Ever since Li Xuan came here,

313
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,590
the place has a lot of drama going on.

314
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,030
Just get used to it.

315
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,960
What's up today?

316
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,840
Before I came here,

317
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,030
I saw Li Xuan was about to

318
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,080
make an important announcement.

319
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,280
Really?

320
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,350
In that case, we shouldn't be playing chess.

321
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,410
Let's go. Let's go.

322
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,970
Let's check it out.

323
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,880
Lord Zi,

324
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,200
how can you do this to me?

325
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,600
You're cheating because you know you're gonna lose the game.

326
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,119
Su Youlian, enter it.

327
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,760
Come on, enter it. Enter it.

328
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,190
That's right, enter it.

329
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,190
What's taking you so long? Just enter it.

330
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,190
Su Youlian,

331
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,410
who do you think is the most handsome man in the academy?

332
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,880
Yu Fengmu.

333
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,950
Yu Fengmu?

334
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,470
Yu Fengmu?

335
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,920
What kind of question is that?

336
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,680
Let me try.

337
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Su Youlian,

338
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,110
have you ever kissed a man?

339
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,820
That is not a question.

340
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,350
Yes, I have.

341
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,960
With whom? With whom? With whom?

342
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,680
Tell us, with whom?

343
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,400
Come on, tell us.

344
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,560
Then,

345
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,040
with whom?

346
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,470
Only Li Xuan.

347
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Only Li Xuan!

348
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,040
How did you feel when you kissed him?

349
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,310
Does he have very sweet lips?

350
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,400
Cold.

351
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,690
It's cold at the bottom of the lake.

352
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,930
Bian Lingcheng,

353
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,830
what kind of question is that?

354
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,490
That sucks.

355
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,590
That sucks.

356
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,000
You're girls. You don't understand.

357
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,350
You kiss someone

358
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,400
when you have feelings for him.

359
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,710
Su Youlian,

360
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,590
you've kissed

361
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,560
Li Xuan.

362
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,920
You should be responsible

363
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,760
for him.

364
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Will you marry him?

365
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,880
No.

366
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,520
No?

367
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,040
No?

368
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,680
Do you hear that?

369
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,190
Why?

370
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,680
Is there a reason for that?

371
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,800
No.

372
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,310
Su Youlian,

373
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,570
have you ever had feelings for me?

374
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,680
Never.

375
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,250
That can't be true.

376
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,650
That can't be true.

377
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,310
If so,

378
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,430
why did you feel so desperate

379
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,560
outside the Secret Realm?

380
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,350
If so,

381
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,060
why did you risk your life to come back and save me

382
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,210
when you have safely returned to the academy?

383
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,950
Do you dare to say

384
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
that you don't have feelings for me

385
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,800
when you did all this?

386
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,850
I was touched. Does that mean I have feelings for you?

387
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,730
You were touched, is that all?

388
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,470
Why is that?

389
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,000
That can't be true.

390
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,380
That's enough!

391
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,280
Lord Zi is here.

392
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,950
Lord Zi!

393
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,350
Brat,

394
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,070
she has made it

395
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,020
crystal clear.

396
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,040
Why do you keep asking her?

397
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
Do you want to

398
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,640
embarrass me?

399
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,040
Imperial edict!

400
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,400
On your knees, on your knees.

401
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,310
On your knees.

402
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,350
"Minister Cui's daughter Cui Pianran,

403
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,000
is incomparably beautiful

404
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,800
and extraordinarily intelligent,

405
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,400
while Li Xuan the Nation-protecting Master,

406
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,110
a handsome man with dignified bearing,

407
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,470
is a pillar of the state.

408
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,280
Considering that they're a perfect match,

409
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,760
I now order them to choose an auspicious day to get married."

410
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,940
Congratulations,

411
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,430
Nation-protecting Master.

412
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,760
Receive the edict now.

413
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,230
I appreciate His Majesty for bestowing this favor.

414
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,890
I, a humble female official, receive the edict.

415
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,190
Please accept my congratulations, Lord Zi.

416
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,590
Sir,

417
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,920
you must be tired after running this errand.

418
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,590
Please. Let's go to drink tea.

419
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,710
Please.

420
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,230
Oh, no.

421
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,560
These matters are messy enough in themselves,

422
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
and now His Majesty has interfered.

423
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,950
They have really gone out of control.

424
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,640
Li Xuan,

425
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,280
even His Majesty thinks we're a perfect match.

426
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,940
Now you have to marry me even if you don't want to.

427
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,930
That's impossible.

428
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,160
You…

429
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,680
Do you want to disobey the imperial edict?

430
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,070
Li Xuan.

431
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,990
Let's go, too.

432
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,680
Come on, let's go.

433
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,590
Let's go.

434
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,640
We should go now, sister.

435
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,310
Lord Zi.

436
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,760
My good liquor…

437
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,230
Brat,

438
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,430
you've drunk up my good liquor behind my back.

439
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,190
You…

440
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,850
It's not the right way.

441
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,470
You're not drinking it in the right way.

442
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,430
You're literally wasting a divine liquor!

443
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,520
Do you know it?

444
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,310
And you,

445
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,350
you brat.

446
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,040
Why didn't you watch him carefully?

447
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,190
How could you let him do such a thing

448
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,640
that is utterly devoid of conscience?

449
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,710
Lord Zi, you only asked me to protect Young Master,

450
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,920
but you didn't ask me to dissuade him from drinking.

451
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,760
Do you think you're justified?

452
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:01,920
Brat,

453
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,110
stop drinking!

454
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,800
Look at you.

455
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,160
As a mature man,

456
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,000
how come you're behaving like a coward?

457
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,350
What's the big deal of being refused

458
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,080
by that girl?

459
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,470
Is it worth going so far as to binge drink?

460
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,040
You're bringing shame to your master

461
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,840
as well as belittling yourself.

462
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,610
How can you, an old single man,

463
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,040
understand my feeling?

464
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,830
What?

465
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,520
You say I'm an old single man?

466
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,680
What the…

467
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,920
I tell you what,

468
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,350
when I was young…

469
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,070
Forget it.

470
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,760
I'm not in the mood

471
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,280
to recount my past glories.

472
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,040
You two,

473
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,490
get away from me at once!

474
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,560
Brat,

475
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,190
keep the liquor here!

476
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,350
Lord Zi,

477
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,040
let him drink.

478
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,880
Su Youlian!

479
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,280
You big liar.

480
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,470
I hate you!

481
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,040
Su Youlian,

482
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,160
you liar.

483
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,920
Su Youlian!

484
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,950
You're a big liar!

485
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,520
Why

486
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,640
do you say that you've never felt a thing for me?

487
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,280
You liar.

488
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,880
Liar!

489
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,470
How can you

490
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,230
keep lying to me?

491
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,680
How can you say you don't like me?

492
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,560
You say you've never felt a thing for me.

493
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,480
That's impossible.

494
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,110
You must be lying.

495
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,070
Fine.

496
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,920
From now on,

497
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,970
you live your life and I live mine.

498
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,920
I won't like you anymore.

499
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,190
If I go to see you anymore,

500
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,520
or if I still like you,

501
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,280
call me a dog.

502
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,400
Young Master,

503
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,230
this is not Su Youlian.

504
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,920
I don't care!

505
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,470
Li Xuan.

506
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,430
Changqing,

507
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,900
how come he's so drunk?

508
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,640
Li Xuan,

509
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,280
are you okay?

510
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,580
How come you've drunk so much?

511
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,590
Is everything ok?

512
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,080
You've finally come.

513
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,070
Yes, I'm here.

514
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,400
Li Xuan,

515
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,710
you must feel nausea after drinking so much.

516
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,560
Let me take you back to rest.

517
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,280
Come on.

518
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,110
Isn't that Miss Su?

519
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,610
How come she's still here so late at night?

520
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,230
Scarred Head.

521
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,000
Got it.

522
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,640
Prince Mu,

523
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:15,830
this cloak…

524
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,000
Wear it,

525
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,510
lest you catch a cold.

526
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:23,910
Thank you.

527
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,070
Seems that even today's Soul-enchanting and Truth-telling Formation

528
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,880
didn't make you tell the truths.

529
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,070
What I said today is all true.

530
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,400
Then why are you so sorrowful like this?

531
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,640
The Soul-enchanting and Truth-telling Formation doesn't work

532
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,040
on members of Kunwu clan.

533
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,320
You knew that before entering the Formation, I suppose.

534
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,370
There's nothing wrong

535
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,210
for having feelings for someone.

536
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,350
It's just that for Li Xuan,

537
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,950
and you…

538
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,470
It's like this "moon" in the water,

539
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,880
which seems very close,

540
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,400
but which cannot be reached.

541
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,900
Have you ever fallen for someone?

542
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,280
Yes.

543
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,070
But

544
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,110
our relation

545
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,890
is also like this "moon" in the water.

546
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,160
Come on.

547
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,760
Why didn't you obey my order today?

548
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,600
I'm prepared to bear

549
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,870
any punishment, master.

550
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,840
What's the use of punishment?

551
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,040
What I want is the token.

552
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,820
What I want is for Dragon Emperor to be saved.

553
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,580
I will obtain the token for sure, master.

554
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,670
But killing Li Xuan

555
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,080
is what I can't do.

556
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,800
You disappoint me.

557
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,230
Master.

558
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,910
Don't call me master.

559
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,800
If you can’t obtain the token ,

560
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,150
Then don’t call me master

561
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,870
"This chick is quite capable.

562
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,520
Has she really conquered Xuan?"

563
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,190
Youlian,

564
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,630
are you feeling better?

565
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,190
Morning.

566
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,150
I'm fine.

567
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,600
It's Li Xuan who is not fine, right?

568
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,930
He is the one who got refused in public.

569
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,400
But, Youlian,

570
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,650
it's a good thing that you refused him.

571
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,470
The imperial edict has been issued anyway.

572
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,000
He's going to marry a girl named Cui Pianran.

573
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,910
What do you think of my older brother?

574
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,890
He seems to take a fancy to you.

575
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,230
Let's go to have the class now.

576
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,870
We're going to be late.

577
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,600
Go.

578
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,870
Don't mention things that are better left unmentioned.

579
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,150
Why are you looking so weird?

580
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,410
It's you who are weird.

581
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,490
You're holding the book upside down.

582
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,920
Now it's really upside down.

583
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,390
Changqing,

584
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,600
are you packing Xuan's study materials

585
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,060
because he won't attend classes these days?

586
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,040
He's ill.

587
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,150
Is he under the weather?

588
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,060
Is it because he was too tired last night?

589
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,400
No wonder I saw Cui Pianran go out

590
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,290
from his bedroom this morning.

591
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,250
A man and a woman alone in the same room…

592
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,760
Changqing,

593
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,890
you're truly sensible.

594
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,190
Knowing that Xuan went off on some errand last night,

595
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,910
you gave him the privacy he needed

596
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,510
and didn't keep watch on him.

597
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,240
Get away.

598
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,210
Hey, Changqing!

599
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,600
Where are you going?

600
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,470
Why not stay with me a bit longer?

601
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:32,760
Li Xuan.

602
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,870
Feng Changqing said that you have something to say to me.

603
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,230
This is your Eight Characters of Birth Time.

604
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,390
Now I give it back to you.

605
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,470
What do you mean?

606
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,600
Cui Pianran,

607
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,600
don't waste your time on me.

608
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,950
Why?

609
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,230
Is it because of Su Youlian?

610
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,470
Don't you remember what she said yesterday

611
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,470
in the Formation?

612
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,280
She doesn't love you at all.

613
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,560
Why do you have to refuse me for her sake?

614
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,160
It has nothing to do with her.

615
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,970
I'm not marrying you

616
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,930
because you're not the one in my heart.

617
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,080
It's okay. I can wait.

618
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,000
I will be

619
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,960
the one in your heart for sure

620
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,870
after we get married

621
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,670
and live together for some time.

622
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:24,630
Besides, His Majesty has already bestowed marriage on us,

623
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,080
so you have to marry me despite your unwillingness.

624
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,390
Dare you disobey the imperial edict?

625
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,190
I dare not even if you dare.

626
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,430
I'll settle it with His Majesty.

627
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,710
Don't worry.

628
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,670
Your family won't be involved in trouble.

629
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,950
You just need to remember

630
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,810
that I certainly won't marry you.

631
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,630
Li Xuan!

632
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,080
You wretch!

633
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,520
In which aspect am I inferior to Su Youlian?

634
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,040
•	Is there any news about the remnants of Kunwu clan?

635
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,630
Your Majesty,

636
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,230
I have found that

637
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,760
there's one gang of them

638
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,150
gathering somewhere outside the city,

639
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,520
and their fellows who escaped out of the city a few days ago

640
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,130
have already joined them.

641
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:24,280
I beg Your Majesty to allow me to lead troops

642
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,000
and arrest all these remnants.

643
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,120
My son,

644
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,340
it's been a long time since you became the Crown Prince,

645
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,670
and now it's time for you to hone your ability.

646
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,800
I order you to go in person to eliminate

647
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,740
those remnants of Kunwu clan.

648
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:49,040
"Everybody knows the Kunwu clan is ferocious.

649
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,320
Even Ziji the old man might not be their rival.

650
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,870
Won't I be doomed

651
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,080
if I go to fight them?"

652
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,950
Why are you standing in a daze?

653
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,410
Are you unwilling to do it?

654
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,710
Father,

655
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,800
I ought to accept this mission of eliminating

656
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,040
the remnants of Kunwu clan even if it will cost my life,

657
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,470
but as far as I'm concerned,

658
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,730
my second brother is more suitable for this mission.

659
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,080
Why?

660
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,430
His reputation has spread far and wide after contributing

661
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,320
to the elimination of Qilin,

662
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,870
so if he leads troops to track down and arrest those wicked Kunwu guys,

663
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,320
they must be terror-stricken and lose the battle

664
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,560
before it begins.

665
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,630
But you're the Crown Prince,

666
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:30,310
to whom I will pass the throne in the future.

667
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,120
If you put such a crucial mission

668
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,390
in the hands of him,

669
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,670
then won't all the credit go to him?

670
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,080
How will you gain obedience from officials and the people?

671
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,840
Father,

672
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,040
We're brothers-german,

673
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,190
and it's okay even if his contributions surpass mine.

674
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,710
If I can have him as my advisor

675
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,870
after I ascend the throne,

676
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,230
we'll certainly be invincible

677
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,630
across the world through our cooperation.

678
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,760
Good.

679
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,150
Your unselfishness and generosity

680
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,150
are a great comfort to me.

681
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,430
Yunshi,

682
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,830
what's your opinion?

683
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,470
Judging by the ability of His Highness,

684
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,800
it would be a cinch for him to conquer those

685
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,330
wicked guys of Kunwu clan.

686
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,630
That's the deal, then.

687
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,120
Draw up the edict.

688
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,950
The Crown Prince seemed to behave unselfishly,

689
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,480
but it's because he fears this mission.

690
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:36,520
It's a great opportunity for you to win an honor.

691
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,670
Are you sure of success?

692
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,470
Under the current circumstance,

693
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,760
there's no other alternative

694
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,710
than victory.

695
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,670
I always have confidence in you.

696
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,100
You're able to succeed in everything

697
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,670
you want to achieve.

698
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,040
By the way,

699
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,520
I have stayed in the Imperial Palace long enough.

700
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,630
It's time for me

701
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,560
to come back to the Academy.
