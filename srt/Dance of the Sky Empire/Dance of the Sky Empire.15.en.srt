00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,860
Dance of the Sky Empire

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,860
Episode 15

4
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,539
Wait here for me.

5
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,420
I'll be back soon.

6
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,380
Don't leave.

7
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,320
Your Highness,

8
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,810
you're noble,

9
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,620
so you don't have to do it yourself.

10
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,220
Besides,

11
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,660
look at that cock,

12
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,300
it looks so fierce.

13
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,660
It's it.

14
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,980
Your Highness, you're not serious, aren't you?

15
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,540
You…

16
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,800
Your Highness.

17
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,620
Your Highness.

18
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,300
Your Highness. Your Highness. It's there.

19
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,140
That nerd must have made so many achievements in his previous life

20
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,269
that he could be able to have a taste of the soup made by me.

21
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,660
He's so honoured.

22
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,600
Even my father and mother haven't tasted it.

23
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,060
You're back.

24
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,740
What…

25
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,820
…what's it?

26
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,860
The chicken soup I specially prepared for you.

27
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,020
Come on. Have a taste.

28
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,420
Is it also made by you?

29
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,060
Exactly.

30
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,340
I made it for you

31
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,380
in person.

32
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,420
I'm done.

33
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,180
It's also made by her.

34
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,350
It's the first time I've made the soup.

35
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,030
I don't know whether it tastes good or not.

36
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,500
Nope. Nope. Nope. I mean nothing, nothing.

37
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,980
Well,

38
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,580
I made it carefully.

39
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,260
I'll taste it.

40
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,340
I will.

41
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,840
Looking at your expressions,

42
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,220
I feel

43
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,460
it seems to taste bad.

44
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,820
It tastes good.

45
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,860
Great.

46
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,200
Of course, it does.

47
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,500
I made it for you in person.

48
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,700
Why does it…

49
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,780
…why does it taste so bitter?

50
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,980
Princess Yunshan,

51
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,180
there's semen armeniacae amarae in it.

52
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,280
Semen armeniacae amarae?

53
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,470
Isn't it supposed to be ginger slices?

54
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,350
It's semen armeniacae amarae.

55
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,670
What a shame!

56
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,780
I'll pour away the soup.

57
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,740
Stop. Stop. Stop.

58
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,580
Don't waste it.

59
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,500
I can drink it.

60
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,420
Schoolmate Xiao,

61
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,460
what are you doing with Princess Yunshan here?

62
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,540
I'm…I'm sorry.

63
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,100
We…we're doing nothing.

64
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,310
Okay. Okay. You're doing nothing?

65
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,420
Your hands are holding together, aren't they?

66
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,820
Exactly. Your hands are holding together.

67
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,540
Do what I'm doing with him

68
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,240
and what I'm talking to him

69
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,900
have anything to do with you?

70
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,710
If you dare to say a single word,

71
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,220
do you believe I'll gouge your eyes out?

72
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,040
Princess Yunshan, it's fine.

73
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,260
Princess Yunshan has such a bad temper.

74
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,860
If you wanna marry her,

75
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,200
could you stand it?

76
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,020
Mr. Xiao,

77
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,940
you'd better pray for yourself.

78
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,300
They're saying nonsense.

79
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
You don't have to take it seriously.

80
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:58,860
Don't listen to them.

81
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,180
But you should

82
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,790
take what I said seriously.

83
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,380
You're…

84
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,430
Mr. Xiao,

85
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,880
look, she's so fierce.

86
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,820
Princess…Princess Yuanshan,

87
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,260
Classmate Bian is a prankster.

88
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,420
You don't have to mind his words.

89
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,550
Bian Lingcheng,

90
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,440
don't blame me for not reminding you.

91
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,670
If you dare to gossip about us anymore,

92
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,450
do you believe I'll cut your tongue and steep it in liquor?

93
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,180
Okay. Okay. Okay.

94
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,510
I've seen nothing.

95
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,260
I've seen nothing.

96
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,140
You should have a good rest.

97
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,020
I'm leaving.

98
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,780
Thank…thank you so much.

99
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,110
She's made the soup for you.

100
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,380
It…it…

101
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,660
What a pity!

102
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,580
What a pity!

103
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,660
What do you mean?

104
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,350
Do you mean the soup?

105
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,980
I mean Princess Yunshan.

106
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,420
She's such a beauty

107
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,860
but with a poor taste.

108
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,440
How could she have a thing for a nerd like you?

109
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,660
There's no romance between Princess Yunshan and me.

110
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,500
We haven't done anything that is beyond etiquette,

111
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Classmate Bian.

112
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,500
It's no use explaining to me.

113
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,780
The story of you two

114
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,720
has widely spread in the Academy.

115
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,740
I did suspect it earlier.

116
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,720
But when I witnessed what happened between you two.

117
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,900
You do have some means.

118
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,430
It seems I've looked down upon you before.

119
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,600
It's not…it's not…

120
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,430
…it's not what you think of.

121
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,040
It's not what you think of.

122
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,860
I…

123
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,900
Save your explanation.

124
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,500
Well,

125
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,260
we witnessed what was happening just now in person.

126
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,980
Now all of us have the same opinion,

127
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,980
which is fearful.

128
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,980
Even though there's no romance between you two,

129
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,240
no one will believe it.

130
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,990
Do you get it?

131
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,910
Do you get it?

132
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,500
Do you get it?

133
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,060
I'm talking to you. Are you listening to me?

134
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,260
It's the Eight Characters of Miss Cui and your son.

135
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,740
The fortuneteller has said that

136
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,580
the marriage of them is destined.

137
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,700
If your son can marry Miss Cui,

138
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,500
it will guarantee them the peace of a lifetime.

139
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,660
It's great.

140
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,140
Perfect.

141
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,300
What are you doing? Why are you staring at me like that?

142
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,580
It's strange.

143
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,220
It's too strange.

144
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,060
What's strange?

145
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,320
Someone has been acting so strange when she comes back.

146
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,300
Has she?

147
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,780
She becomes prettier.

148
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,420
Youlian is always pretty, isn't she?

149
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,820
You don't get it.

150
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,460
I mean

151
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,660
she's more feminine now.

152
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,340
She's supposed to be feminine.

153
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,260
I mean the romance.

154
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,700
She had a romance.

155
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,900
You mean the romance between Youlian and Li Xuan.

156
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,340
It takes you so long to get it.

157
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,740
Youlian,

158
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,540
there's really a romance between Li Xuan and you, isn't there?

159
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,580
Nope.

160
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,400
Don't listen to his nonsense.

161
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,660
Youlian,

162
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,900
tell me the truth.

163
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,030
Did anything happen to Li Xuan and you?

164
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,820
Why do you two get so close

165
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,180
after going out of the mysterious land?

166
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,400
Look, she's being guilty.

167
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,700
Youlian,

168
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,700
I've heard from Mentor Xuanming that

169
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,340
the mysterious land is so horrible.

170
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,540
Tell us

171
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,780
how the mysterious land is.

172
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,020
Right.

173
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,420
It's not horrible at all.

174
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,180
He scared you,

175
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,780
because he's afraid that you would break through the mysterious land.

176
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,620
Sister.

177
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,540
Lady,

178
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,820
I'm leaving first.

179
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,310
You know I'm your elder sister, don't you?

180
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,140
I think you would have admitted someone else as your elder sister.

181
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,980
Where does the Luhua Cock come from?

182
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,140
Why is it still crowing

183
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,500
when it's getting dark?

184
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,140
Who do you mean is the Luhua Cock?

185
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,860
The Luhua Cock itself knows it clearly.

186
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,180
Okay. Okay.

187
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,860
I won't blame you

188
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,500
since Li Xuan and you are close friends.

189
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,820
Otherwise, he would say, I,

190
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,580
the wife-to-be of the Nation-protecting Master,

191
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,380
am not able to get along well with his close friend.

192
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,060
What do you mean the wife-to-be of the Nation-protecting Master?

193
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,460
What?

194
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,940
My younger sister hasn't told you that, has she?

195
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,500
The woman matchmaker has calculated the Eight Characters of Li Xuan and me.

196
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,740
We'll make an engagement soon.

197
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,040
Youlian, I should have told you about it.

198
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,060
But I…

199
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,300
Stop talking.

200
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,900
I know you did it for the sake of mine.

201
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,100
You must be afraid that someone would get entangled in such a good thing.

202
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,380
Since someone

203
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,260
is so unabashed

204
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,400
that she would do anything she could.

205
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,700
What nonsense are you talking?

206
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,340
How could Xuanxuan marry you?

207
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,740
You…

208
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,660
It's fine. It's fine.

209
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,060
I won't quarrel with you.

210
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,340
You yourself can go to the Li Mansion to find out the truth.

211
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,620
Enjoy your meal.

212
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,240
I'm leaving first.

213
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,620
Youlian.

214
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,540
I…

215
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,220
I want this one and that.

216
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,660
Okay.

217
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,870
Is it enough?

218
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,860
Thank you.

219
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,900
Brother, why are you…

220
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,500
…are you leaving so soon?

221
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,540
Give me some of this one.

222
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:14,940
Okay.

223
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,590
Youlian.

224
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,380
Prince Mu.

225
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,580
You've finished having your meal so soon too.

226
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,910
I saw you go out just now.

227
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,860
I'm worrying about you,

228
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,780
so I follow you.

229
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,580
I'm fine.

230
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,860
Actually, you don't have to

231
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,100
take what Schoolmate Cui has said so seriously.

232
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Li Xuan doesn't have a thing for her.

233
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,340
We all know it.

234
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,550
If you don't believe me,

235
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,860
I'll accompany you to find Li Xuan.

236
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,260
You can ask him directly.

237
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,140
Nope. Nope.

238
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,700
There's no need.

239
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,070
Even if he wants to marry someone else,

240
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,840
it won't have anything to do with me, will it?

241
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,480
We'll sit here.

242
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,000
Xiao Fengming,

243
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,140
where are you going? There are seats here.

244
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,540
I'll…

245
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,620
…I'll sit there.

246
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,500
Sit here as I ask.

247
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,460
Yanran,

248
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,300
what's wrong with Su Youlian?

249
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,180
She didn't give me a response just now.

250
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,580
Give you a response?

251
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,340
Her dream of marrying to someone from a prestigious family is broken.

252
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,940
She wouldn't have the mood to give you a response.

253
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,400
What? What do you mean a prestigious family?

254
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,220
Cui Pianran said Xuanxuan would marry her.

255
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,300
I mean,

256
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,860
Li Xuan would marry her?

257
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,900
I prefer to believe Li Xuan would marry you.

258
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,660
I'm okay with it.

259
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,780
How could you make up such a ridiculous lie?

260
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,040
At ordinary times,

261
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,440
Li Xuan doesn't pay any attention to you at all, does he?

262
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,220
I won't do the same thing as you.

263
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,500
As a princess,

264
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,100
you can even pledge to marry someone without the permission of your parents.

265
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,220
Without the permission of parents and the words of a matchmaker,

266
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,950
I won't say anything like that.

267
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,220
How dare you slander me?

268
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,780
I'm slandering you?

269
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,900
Who else in the Academy

270
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,420
hasn't known the story of Xiao Fengming and you?

271
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,220
As the princess of the State of Sha,

272
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,100
you've created such a scandal.

273
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,860
How dare you clamour here?

274
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,460
See,

275
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,220
you're miffed at my words, aren't you?

276
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,970
Do you believe I'll make you unable to say a single word in the future?

277
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,140
Why do you stop me?

278
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,060
Haven't you heard what she said just now?

279
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,420
I'll teach her a lesson.

280
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,700
Now that they don't believe us,

281
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,140
I will prove it to them.

282
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,819
How…how?

283
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,210
Everyone knows

284
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,940
there are thirteen thousand formation pictures in the Academy.

285
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,099
Mentor said

286
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,220
as long as we could know them by heart,

287
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,349
we would be able to do whatever we want.

288
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,440
Xiao Fengming,

289
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,780
we're just kidding. You don't have to take it so seriously.

290
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,910
I don't care what people talk about me.

291
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,860
But

292
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,740
the gossip

293
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,740
has badly affected the reputation of Princess Yunshan.

294
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,100
So I have to stand out

295
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,580
to prove you're wrong

296
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,940
and prevent the gossip from spreading.

297
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,920
Xiao Fengming,

298
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,460
what are you gonna do?

299
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,140
Take my soul as a weapon and take God as the media.

300
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,500
The moon could know a noble person and the sun would show my will.

301
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,180
Take my soul as a weapon and take God as the media.

302
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,300
The moon could know a noble person and the sun would show my will.

303
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,860
Take my soul as a weapon and take God as the media.

304
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,180
The moon could know a noble person and the sun would show my will.

305
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,710
The moon could know a noble person and the sun would show my will.

306
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,700
Is it the Soul-enchanting and Truth-telling Formation?

307
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,780
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

308
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,500
It's the Soul-enchanting and Truth-telling Formation.

309
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,340
What on earth is it?

310
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,980
I heard the formation would neither hurt nor trap anyone.

311
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,780
The one in the formation will be in a confused state of mind.

312
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,860
He will answer each question he is asked

313
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,900
without lying.

314
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,660
There exists a formation like this.

315
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,020
How could I not know it?

316
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,380
There're so many things you don't know.

317
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,060
You'd better read more books.

318
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,020
What's the big deal?

319
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,260
It's just a lame formation.

320
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,940
I have no idea whether it will work.

321
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,780
Bian Lingcheng,

322
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,020
If you dare, you can go into the formation

323
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,780
to see whether it will work or not.

324
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,820
Am I right?

325
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,300
Yeah. You yourself can go into the formation.

326
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,980
You yourself can go into the formation.

327
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,020
Have a try.

328
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,980
Are you sure that you want me to go into the formation?

329
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,860
Exactly. Exactly.

330
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,020
Go. Go. Go.

331
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,360
You're not afraid I would spill something out, are you?

332
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,260
You'd better not.

333
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,390
We're just kidding.

334
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,230
You ask him. Do it. Do it.

335
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,120
Xiao Fengming,

336
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,340
how many taels do you have?

337
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,600
Where do you hide them?

338
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,260
You ask him this.

339
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,460
I have no tael with me.

340
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,230
I've spent all of them on buying books.

341
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,830
How will you live your life?

342
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,220
Help students do their homework.

343
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,100
Do some cleaning for the Academy.

344
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,260
Will it work?

345
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,580
What lame questions you're asking!

346
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,670
I'll ask him one.

347
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,300
Xiao Fengming,

348
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,020
is there a romance between Yunshan and you?

349
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,060
What a good question it is!

350
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,260
Nope.

351
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,140
It's impossible.

352
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,820
I've heard the conversation between Yunshan and Yumin earlier.

353
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,550
She said she had a thing for you.

354
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,980
She told a lie

355
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,380
because she wanted to get rid of the entanglement of the Duke.

356
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:05,700
Then

357
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,380
if there weren't a romance between you two,

358
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,900
why would you save her out without caring about yourself

359
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,020
in the spiritual ball game?

360
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,620
Yeah. Why?

361
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,620
Yeah. Why?

362
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,620
Why?

363
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,300
We're both schoolmates

364
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,380
and team mates.

365
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,520
I protected her, which was what I was supposed to do.

366
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,660
Nerd.

367
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,460
Nope. There must be something wrong.

368
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,660
There must be something wrong with the formation.

369
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,580
It's because you asked a lame question.

370
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,380
Xiao Fengming,

371
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,700
I have a question for you.

372
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,420
Do you have a crush on Yunshan?

373
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,900
Yes.

374
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,500
I do.

375
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,180
He adores Yunshan.

376
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,460
See.

377
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,700
What a lame question did you ask?

378
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,020
Don't be anxious. Don't be anxious.

379
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,740
It's Xiao Fengming

380
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,700
who wants to prove he's innocent, isn't it?

381
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,460
Xiao Fengming,

382
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,300
you should say it out loud again.

383
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,500
Do you have a crush on Princess Yunshan?

384
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,380
Yeah. Say it out loud.

385
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,220
Xiao Fengming, don't say it.

386
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,740
I do.

387
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:05,940
He does.

388
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,460
He admitted. He said it.

389
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,340
He said he has a crush on Yunshan.

390
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,900
He has a crush on Princess Yunshan.

391
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,700
Have you heard him?

392
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,380
Xiao Fengming has admitted that he has a crush on Yunshan.

393
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,380
Yunshan, what else do you wanna say?

394
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,420
I…

395
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,380
Sister, don't push them anymore.

396
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,460
I don't push them at all.

397
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,120
They ask for the humiliation.

398
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,100
What a Luhua Chicken you're!

399
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,740
Wait a sec. Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

400
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,380
Who do you call Luhua Chicken?

401
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,260
Luhua Chicken.

402
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,060
Nope. I'm wrong. I'm wrong.

403
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,830
Cui Pianran,

404
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,300
how come the affections between a gentleman and lady

405
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,500
turn out to be a scandal in your opinion?

406
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,390
Bian Lingcheng,

407
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,340
you've just heard that

408
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,140
Xiao Fengming admitted his affections for Yunshan

409
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,380
as well as the relationship between them.

410
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,020
I did hear he admitted his affections for Princess Yunshan,

411
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,380
but I also heard

412
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,440
there's no scandal between them.

413
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,620
You can't make a deliberate misinterpretation out of his words,

414
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,280
and make up a story as you want.

415
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,100
Besides,

416
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,860
I believe, among the schoolmates here,

417
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,260
there are quite a few persons who adore Princess Yunshan.

418
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,660
Xiao Fengming has a crush on Princess Yunshan,

419
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,020
which is perfectly normal.

420
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,180
Are all of them

421
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,340
shameless rapists?

422
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,660
You're arguing irrationally.

423
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,300
It's fine.

424
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,020
All of us should remember

425
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,140
we won't make up a story,

426
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,220
and spread gossip,

427
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,020
which will cause misunderstanding.

428
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,740
If a trouble comes to you one day,

429
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,480
what will you do with it

430
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,620
at that time?

431
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,340
Yeah.

432
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,200
He's right.

433
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,340
We're bowing to you, Mentors.

434
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,500
It's the Soul-enchanting and Truth-telling Formation for sure.

435
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,220
Yeah.

436
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,540
I'm bowing to you, Mentors.

437
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,700
You've learnt the Soul-enchanting and Truth-telling Formation,

438
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,180
which means you do work hard

439
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,500
on the study of formations at ordinary times.

440
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,230
Working hard on study is what a student should do.

441
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,340
All of should follow what I'm about to say.

442
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,140
In the future,

443
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,660
you're allowed to neither cause messes in the Academy

444
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,180
nor slander your schoolmates.

445
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,940
If I find someone doing something as I mentioned just now,

446
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,430
he'll be expelled from the Academy

447
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,140
and never be admitted again.

448
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,060
We will remember what you said.

449
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,740
Dismiss.

450
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,820
Let's go. Go. Let's go back.

451
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,140
Buddy,

452
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,280
do you know what you said just now?

453
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,660
You're amazing.

454
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,620
Am I?

455
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,140
You're awesome.

456
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
What?

457
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,140
What did I say?

458
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,260
Why?

459
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,660
You're shocked, aren't you?

460
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,300
But you did say in person that "I have a crush on Yunshan".

461
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,630
All the people in the Academy can prove it.

462
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,540
See, it's him.

463
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,740
I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.

464
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,260
Now I not only ruin the reputation of myself,

465
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,980
but also the reputation and integrity of Princess Yunshan.

466
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,060
I'm done. I'm done.

467
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,700
What do you mean reputation and integrity?

468
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,360
Do the reputation and integrity really matter?

469
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,220
Why not?

470
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,340
When I got admitted by the Academy,

471
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,140
my father warned me repeatedly.

472
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,780
He said

473
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,860
there were members of the imperial house and nobles in the Academy.

474
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,940
And he asked me to conduct myself with dignity.

475
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,940
Do you have to exaggerate that much?

476
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,620
Why do you still not get it?

477
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,190
The word I said earlier,

478
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,380
if I do mean it,

479
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,880
others must think I'm so over-confident

480
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,340
that I wanna chase after a foreign princess

481
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,740
with an ulterior motive.

482
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,700
If…

483
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,540
if I don't really mean what I said,

484
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,300
then others

485
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,180
must think I don't conduct myself with dignity

486
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,060
and I'm mean.

487
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,540
I'm…

488
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,900
Having a crush on Yunshan is fine.

489
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,500
What do you mean it's fine?

490
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,900
It's not. I mean it.

491
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,340
Now I've not only failed to solve the problem

492
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,820
for Yunshan,

493
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,900
but created more trouble for her.

494
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,380
I…

495
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,340
I…

496
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,860
I get to know why Yunshan calls you a nerd.

497
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,380
I won't be able to comfort you.

498
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,380
You'd better take care of yourself.

499
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,300
How could this be?

500
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,980
Handle with care.

501
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
Handle with care.

502
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,580
You two, hurry up.

503
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,540
Okay. Okay. Okay. Just put it here.

504
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,200
Steward Li.

505
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,120
Steward Li.

506
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,600
What are these things?

507
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,900
It's the betrothal presents

508
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,220
that our childe is about to send to the Cui Family.

509
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,380
Betrothal presents?

510
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,140
Yep.

511
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,040
Is Xuanxuan really gonna marry Cui Pianran?

512
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,260
It's true.

513
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,100
That's it.

514
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,940
It sucks.

515
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,900
Xuanxuan is about to encounter a huge trouble.

516
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,860
He's done.

517
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,190
What are you talking about?

518
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,780
Cui Pianran said to Su Youlian that I would marry her?

519
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,780
Exactly.

520
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,780
I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.

521
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,380
Youlian must think

522
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm a womanizer.

523
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,180
I also think so.

524
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,640
When I got to the lobby,

525
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,620
I saw the betrothal presents your father prepared for you.

526
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,860
It's his thought.

527
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,580
He should marry her himself.

528
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,100
But everything is well prepared.

529
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,620
I don't think you could dodge the bullet this time.

530
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,460
Even though they're well prepared, I'll turn the table.

531
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
Just wait and see.

532
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,540
What's urgent now is

533
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,580
that I have to go the Academy.

534
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,980
Don't make yourself a trouble again.

535
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,860
There're lots of guards outside the gate of your mansion.

536
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,700
Have you forgotten that

537
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,660
Changqing was badly injured because of saving you last time?

538
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,060
I could fight for myself.

539
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,020
What?

540
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,300
How?

541
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,040
I mean, don't make me worry about you two anymore, will you?

542
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,540
I come up with a good idea.

543
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,700
A good idea?

544
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,320
Is this the good idea you came up with?

545
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,580
I'm patient, ain't I?

546
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,180
So the idea of mine might be a little immoderate.

547
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:21,940
You…

548
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,660
…you should hurry.

549
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,140
I'm a patient, so I can't move fast.

550
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,740
Gently.

551
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,510
Lift me up with more of your strength, will you? Lift me up steadily.

552
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,700
Hurry up, you two.

553
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,560
You're acting like patients.

554
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,260
Why are you standing still there, Changqing?

555
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,340
Hurry and help me.

556
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,380
I'm sorry,

557
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,020
but I'm a patient too.

558
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,940
Nope.

559
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,780
You…

560
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,540
You…

561
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,220
I'm here.

562
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,380
Where are you?

563
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,020
Come to catch me.

564
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,820
Come on.

565
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,180
You move really fast.

566
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,460
You can't catch me. You can't.

567
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,320
I'll catch you this time for sure.

568
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,220
Wait and see.

569
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,580
Come on.

570
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,340
You do move fast. –Come here.

571
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,220
You'll have to drink liquor, if I catch you.

572
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,060
Your Highness.

573
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,260
Your…Your Highness.

574
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,710
Why do you come here?

575
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,340
The Li Family and the Cui Family are about to be connected by marriage.

576
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,500
Are you sure?

577
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,420
The Li Family and the Cui Family are about to be connected by marriage?

578
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,220
But I've heard

579
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,420
the one Li Xuan has a thing for is Miss Su.

580
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,020
So I think

581
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,580
the marriage won't come true.

582
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,380
It's interesting.

583
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,740
It really is.

584
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,740
Come here.

585
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,420
Li Xuan,

586
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,260
-you fell into the Bloody Icebound Ward last time,
-Your Highness.

587
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,660
but you were still able to come back alive.

588
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,660
This time, you'll have to marry a woman you don't love.

589
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,900
I do wanna know what he intends to do.

590
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,100
Li Xuan,

591
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,460
are you gonna marry Miss Cui?

592
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,260
Youlian.

593
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,340
Who's it?

594
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,020
It's me. Li Xuan.

595
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,460
Come and open the door

596
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,980
Why do you come to the girls' dorm late at night?

597
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,940
I'm coming because I want to.

598
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,470
What about you? Why don't you go to bed so late?

599
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,340
I can't fall asleep.

600
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,190
Because you miss me so much?

601
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,060
Who misses you so much that she fails to fall asleep?

602
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,060
You're annoying.

603
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,340
I'm just kidding.

604
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,510
I'm kidding. You're mad at me, aren't you?

605
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,190
I've heard the marriage

606
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,720
of Cui Pianran and you.

607
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,940
It's not true.

608
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,460
Don't believe her nonsense.

609
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,820
It's the truth.

610
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,180
Yanran has proved it's true.

611
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,710
Yanran has never lied to me.

612
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,220
Yeah.

613
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,460
I admit that my father wants me to marry her.

614
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,740
Listen to me. You should listen to me.

615
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,300
It's his thought

616
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,180
but not mine.

617
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,950
It has nothing to do with me.

618
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,660
I'm married.

619
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,260
We got married and we also performed the formal wedding ceremony.

620
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:37,940
Except you,

621
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,980
I won't marry anyone else.

622
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,660
Who got married with you?

623
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,260
Look at you.

624
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,180
We had been sleeping on the same bed for so many days.

625
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,820
Even though you don't admit that we've got married and performed the formal wedding ceremony,

626
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,220
you have to admit that you jumped into the lake to kiss me.

627
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,350
It's true, isn't it?

628
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,460
Get out, Li Xuan.

629
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,980
You're so shameless.

630
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,900
Youlian,

631
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,800
I won't marry Cui Pianran.

632
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,430
And I intend to announce our relationship to the public.

633
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,340
What?

634
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,200
I'll let everyone know

635
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,900
we've got married.

636
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,760
Then what the Cui Family and my father plan to do will be in vain.

637
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,100
Li Xuan,

638
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,440
having a glance at the girls' dorm is enough.

639
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,540
Wait for my good news.

640
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,420
Changqing,

641
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,660
do you smell anything?

642
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,940
What smell?

643
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,700
The smell of love,

644
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,840
which is awful.

645
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
The smell of love?

646
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,340
I can just smell your jealousy.

647
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,670
Why should I be jealous?

648
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,220
I'm not for sure.

649
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,580
I do want someone to take care of him,

650
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,840
otherwise I'm always worried about him.

651
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,780
I know

652
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,590
what you're worried about.

653
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,700
Don't worry.

654
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,640
Even though I get married,

655
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,300
I'll still take care of you two.

656
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,640
You take care of us?

657
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,820
Without Changqing, you would have been savagely beaten for more times.

658
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,900
Changqing, go.

659
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,590
I'll fetch you crabsticks.

660
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,220
Kneel down.

661
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,580
Kneel down.

662
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,780
Do you know your mistake?

663
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,820
How have I taught you

664
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,820
for these years?

665
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,100
How dare you do anything like that?

666
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,780
You've disappointed me greatly.

667
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,420
Master, I'm sorry.

668
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,670
Do you intend to give up on saving Dragon Emperor?

669
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,430
As well as the entire Clan of Kunwu?

670
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,180
Master,

671
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,100
I don't dare to do that.

672
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,180
You dare to get married with Li Xuan.

673
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,300
What else don't you dare to do?

674
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,260
I think you wanna

675
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,380
betray our clan.

676
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,660
Master,

677
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,940
I've never forgotten what I'm supposed to do,

678
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,000
and I don't dare to.

679
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,030
I won't forget to save the Dragon Emperor.

680
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,260
Okay.

681
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,620
I'll give you the last chance.

682
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,980
When Li Xuan announces your marriage,

683
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,420
you should ask him to give you the number one token

684
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,940
as a betrothal present.

685
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,420
And then

686
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,900
you should kill him.

687
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,300
Kill him?

688
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,260
Stand still.

689
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,090
Turn around.

690
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,310
I have no idea what you're gonna do.

691
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,580
I heard what you said

692
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,660
in the formation yesterday.

693
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,260
There was something wrong with the formation yesterday.

694
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,700
Yeah. I mean there was something wrong with the formation.

695
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,560
Besides, I'm not that exquisite.

696
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,180
When I was in the formation,

697
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,140
I said something wrong.

698
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,100
You shouldn't take it seriously.

699
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,700
There was something wrong with the formation.

700
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,030
Raise your head.

701
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,100
Look at me.

702
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,460
If you were honest and frank,

703
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,820
why would you avoid me?

704
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:31,860
Nope.

705
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,780
Nope?

706
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,100
That's fine.

707
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,780
There aren't important classes today.

708
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,340
When I got to the Qingtian City,

709
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,300
I haven't wandered around.

710
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,460
What about being my guide?

711
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,990
It might be inappropriate.

712
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,340
Why?

713
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,780
Is it because

714
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,140
you have some bad intentions

715
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,550
and you're afraid to expose yourself?

716
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,820
No, I don't. No. No. No.

717
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,710
That's fine.

718
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,900
Let's go.

719
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,020
Follow me.

720
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,300
Lady, have a look.

721
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,860
Do you want one?

722
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,900
See. How well-behaved it is!

723
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,700
Look.

724
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,180
It's pretty cute.

725
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,220
I want this one.

726
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,510
Here you are.

727
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,220
Thank you.

728
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:50,950
Goodbye.

729
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,820
Sugar-coated haws.

730
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,620
Boss, give me one.

731
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,220
Have a taste.

732
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,620
It's so delicious.

733
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,660
Is it sour?

734
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,300
No, it's not.

735
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,110
If it's not sour,

736
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,180
eat it up.

737
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,220
Thank you.

738
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,460
Sugar-coated haws.

739
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,020
Sugar-coated haws.

740
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,360
It's delicious and cheap.

741
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,860
Lady, do you like it?

742
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,060
It's made of first-class jade.

743
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,380
It looks great

744
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,740
on your wrist.

745
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,500
It looks good.

746
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,700
How much does it cost?

747
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,100
It's not expensive. It costs twenty taels.

748
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,420
Twenty taels?

749
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,780
It's so expensive.

750
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,780
How much is it?

751
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,420
It cost thirty taels.

752
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,540
The lame thing costs thirty taels?

753
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,500
Lady,

754
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,670
it's a gold hairpin.

755
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,780
It's not.

756
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,230
It's just a gilt one.

757
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,180
You're an expert in it.

758
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,910
But it's a pity that you don't have money with you.

759
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:20,880
It's cheap.

760
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,980
You'll have to pay only one tael.

761
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,500
One-fifth of a tael. I won't pay more for it.

762
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,220
Okay. Okay. Okay.

763
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,070
You'll have it. You'll have it.

764
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,920
Does it look good on me?

765
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,340
very nice

766
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,080
Why are you stupefied?

767
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,740
Buy it, if it looks good on me.

768
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,200
Thank you, Childe.

769
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,460
Your wife is

770
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,040
so good at bargaining.

771
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,820
It's the highest place in the Qingtian City

772
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,550
where you can overlook the view of the whole city.

773
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,140
It's so beautiful.

774
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,740
That place.

775
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,440
Is that place the Academy?

776
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,780
It's…it's the Academy.

777
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,940
But could you step backward a little?

778
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,020
It's too high.

779
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,060
You mean,

780
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,380
if a man falls down from here,

781
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,660
will he die?

782
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,740
It's the place which is over thirty-three thousand meters high.

783
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,740
If one falls down from here,

784
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,900
he'll almost die…die.

785
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,700
If I fall down from here incautiously,

786
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,500
will you jump with me?
