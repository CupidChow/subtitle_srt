00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,870
Dance of the Sky Empire

2
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,870
Episode 8

3
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,520
What an annoying guy.

4
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,720
What did I come for?

5
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,720
I came to take the token.

6
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,079
Come on!

7
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,420
What are you doing?

8
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,240
Nothing.

9
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,360
Nothing?

10
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,520
Why were you touching me?

11
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,830
I, I just

12
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,550
Just what?

13
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,159
♫Suddenly, your eyes meet mine♫

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,270

Do you like him?

35
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,120
His Highness from State of Sha.

36
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,760
Yes.

37
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,640
I also like Yunshan,

38
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,950
Yanran,

39
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,760
Xiao Fengming,

40
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,880
Bian Lingcheng.

41
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,670
I like everyone in the Academy.

42
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,350
What about me?

43
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,740
You didn't mention me.

44
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,230
What about me?

45
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,770
You are the most annoying one.

56
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,130
What's the matter with me?

57
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,100
Why does my heart beat so fast?

58
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,230
Do I…?

59
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:13,920
Well,

60
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,230
since you aren't in the mood to learn,

61
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,840
that's all for today.

62
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,110
You're free to go.

63
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,090
Yeah! The class is over!

64
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,000
Wait a minute, guys.

65
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,140
I have something to announce.

66
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,600
It has been a while since you came to Moyun Ancient Academy.

67
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,130
There will be a history exam

68
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,000
a few days later.

69
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,390
Only students who pass it can continue to stay here.

70
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,320
Why?

71
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:38,950
Why?

72
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,880
Yes, why?

73
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,350
why?

74
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,480
History is the base of doing research.

75
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,820
After studying here over these days,

76
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,670
if you still gain nothing,

77
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,950
you're not qualified to be students of Moyun Ancient Academy,

78
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,010
let alone becoming

79
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,670
pillars of Tianqi's future.

80
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,790
Crap.

81
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,950
What can we do?

82
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,070
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.

83
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,720
We are to take an exam.

84
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,510
If we fail it, we have to leave.

85
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,110
I'll be happy about that.

86
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,170
That's what I want.

87
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Look at all those on the blackboard.

88
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,350
Oh no. Oh no.

89
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,480
Master only taught me swordsmanship.

90
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,370
I know nothing about the history of Tianqi State.

91
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,830
If I fail the exam,

92
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,670
I have to leave.

93
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,780
If so, it will be impossible to save Dragon Emperor.

94
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,050
Don't worry.

95
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,950
Mr. Xuanming doesn't know magic arts.

96
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,880
As long as we play some tiny tricks,

97
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,700
we will pass the exam for sure.

98
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,350
And

99
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,670
by the way,

100
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,460
never think of using magic arts to cheat.

101
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,440
Besides me,

102
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,640
Mento in Chief Xie will also invigilate the exam.

103
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,470
brother

104
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,550
brother

105
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,960
what should I do?

106
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,230
Stay up to recite.

107
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,500
Xiao Fengming,

108
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,160
I depend on you this time.

109
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,440
What do you mean?

110
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,710
You are so knowledgeable.

111
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,710
History is just a piece of cake to you.

112
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,790
During the exam, you only need to give me...

113
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,790
You know.

114
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,590
No. No. No.

115
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,960
If Mr. Xuanming and Mr. Xie notice that, I will be punished.

116
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,690
Don't worry.

117
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,470
I won't let them know.

118
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,400
What do you want to eat?

119
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,400
You can choose whatever you like.

120
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,230
Choose whatever you like at the canteen.

121
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,090
How about that?

122
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,280
I can choose whatever I like?

123
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Sure.

124
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,470
Youlian,

125
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,400
how will you cope with the exam?

126
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,030
No idea at all.

127
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,550
What are you going to do?

128
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,670
I have no choice

129
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,590
but to go over the lessons.

130
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,520
Me too.

131
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
If I fail the exam,

132
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,670
my father will be upset.

133
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,790
Let's go.

134
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,640
Let's go.

135
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,790
I can barely keep my eyes open.

136
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,960
Yanran, let's go back.

137
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,110
I'm drifting off.

138
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,590
Youlian, will you go with us?

139
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,060
I want to stay here for a while.

140
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,540
Don't stay up too late.

141
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,110
Fine. Fine. Fine.

142
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,640
I'll leave it for tomorrow.

143
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,910
It's too dark outside. I'm scared.

144
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,000
You take me back.

145
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,440
Youlian,

146
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,770
don't you go with us?

147
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,710
I want to stay here for a while

148
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,790
to read books.

149
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,440
Miss Su, see you.

150
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,110
Tianqi State's history is too difficult to learn.

151
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,230
If I knew this before,

152
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,470
I wouldn't come here.

153
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,080
The wine. The night.

154
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,350
It's late now. Why is the light still on?

155
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,760
Let's go.

156
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,670
Everyone,

157
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,870
you must get finished

158
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,000
before this incense burns up.

159
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,330
It's not allowed to talk to each other,

160
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,760
peek others' answers,

161
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,470
let alone cheat.

162
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,640
Mr. Xuanming invited me

163
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,080
to serve as invigilator here today.

164
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
I hope there won't be

165
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,000
magic arts during the exam.

166
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,110
Understand?

167
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes.

168
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,230
Good.

169
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,550
Now the exam begins.

170
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,700
You can get to your answer sheets.

171
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,400
Don't look around.

172
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,350
Li Xuan,

173
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,170
why do you stand up?

174
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,060
I've finished.

175
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,400
Let me see.

176
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
No way.

177
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,670
Naughty boy.

178
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,640
I'm free to go.

179
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,880
Li Xuan.

180
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,910
Mr. Xuanming.

181
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,230
This character differs from that in my state.

182
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,690
I don't know what it means.

183
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,910
Give it to me.

184
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,770
Get out. Get out.

185
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,590
Yunshan,

186
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,470
some characters aren't familiar to you as well, right?

187
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,790
Mr. Xuanming, I can read them.

188
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,520
That's good.

189
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,110
Continue with your test.

190
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,880
Every one of you

191
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,640
has passed the exam.

192
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,960
You can stay here to learn.

193
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,590
Hooray!

194
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,690
Let's go out to drink tonight. It's my treat.

195
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,440
Perfect.

196
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,230
Be quiet. Be quiet.

197
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,000
Everyone,

198
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,000
Moyun Ancient Academy strives to train national backbone.

199
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,790
Hope you can study hard

200
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,200
and won't let the public down.

201
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Yes.

202
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
Thank you, Mento in Chief Xie. Thank you, Mento in Chief Xie.

203
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,350
Well,

204
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,200
you are free to go.

205
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,350
Great!

206
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,080
Hooray!

207
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,150
Let's go.

208
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,790
What's wrong?

209
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,640
It seems that young master is playing the xun.

210
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,910
It's late now. Why does he do that?

211
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,790
Perhaps it's because I'm not with him. So he suffers from insomnia.

212
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,320
He wants me to be with him when he sleeps.

213
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,280
What?

214
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,150
He wants you to be with him when he sleeps?

215
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,310
It's not like what you think.

216
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,880
Do you know what I think?

217
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,190
Young master told me he would have nightmares at midnight.

218
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,000
He would see his mother's tragic death in dreams.

219
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,800
So he wants to talk with someone after waking up.

220
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:09,920
Lord Zi,

221
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,190
do you know how young master's mother died?

222
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,349
Changqing,

223
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,710
do you remember what I told you

224
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,260
to do by Li Xuan's side?

225
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,040
You told me to protect young master.

226
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,190
That's good.

227
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,109
Just do what you should do.

228
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,280
Don't ask

229
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,760
what you shouldn't ask.

230
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,400
Well,

231
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,760
it's late now.

232
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,470
Go back to have a rest.

233
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,160
Yes, Lord Zi.

234
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,880
Do you like him?

235
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,410
His Highness from State of Sha.

236
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,190
Yes.

237
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,760
I also like Yunshan,

238
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,800
Yanran,

239
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,950
Xiao Fengming,

240
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,000
Bian Lingcheng.

241
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,040
I like everyone in the Academy.

242
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,320
What about me?

243
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,520
Why do I always think of Li Xuan?

244
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,710
Go to sleep.

245
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,040
Quickly.

246
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,760
Ma... master.

247
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,590
Have you got the token?

248
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,070
Token...

249
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,230
Not yet.

250
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,760
It's because you are too obsessed with humans' life

251
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,190
and forget all about

252
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,000
the number one token.

253
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,160
No.

254
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,350
It's an important issue. How can I forget it?

255
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,310
Really?

256
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,470
Youlian,

257
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,710
are you in love with

258
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,950
that guy?

259
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,800
What?

260
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,190
How come, master?

261
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,160
I'm not.

262
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,640
That's good.

263
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,800
Remember,

264
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,310
you are irreconcilable with Li Xuan.

265
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,430
If you are in love with him,

266
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,800
everyone in Kunwu clan

267
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,810
will have grudge against you forever.

268
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,520
I'm wiped out.

269
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,640
Every day I practice dancing for

270
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,280
the Assembly of States. My waist aches.

271
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,530
What did you order?

272
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,560
None of your business.

273
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,000
I want to eat that drumstick.

274
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,800
Youlian, Yanran,

275
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,470
here, here, here.

276
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,310
Here, here, here.

277
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,230
Come and have a seat here.

278
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:37,920
Where are you going?

279
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,720
You are enjoying yourself here.

280
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,670
It's a bit cold there.

281
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,760
And,

282
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,680
here you are.

283
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,310
Remember,

284
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,070
you are irreconcilable with Li Xuan.

285
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,400
If you are in love with him,

286
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,470
everyone in Kunwu clan

287
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,840
will have grudge against you forever.

288
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,520
I don't like it. Please leave it to yourself.

289
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,590
No.

290
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,130
I can order a second one.

291
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,040
Have it.

292
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,280
No.

293
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,400
Soup.

294
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,680
Here you are.

295
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,400
Miss Cui,

296
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,140
have you smelt something?

297
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,590
What?

298
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,560
The stinky smell of love.

299
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,350
Xuan,

300
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,680
are you to abandon me?

301
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,880
Get off me.

302
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,950
Have the soup.

303
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,070
I'm full. See you.

304
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,880
Youlian.

305
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,110
Youlian.

306
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,880
What's the matter with her?

307
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,560
It's all your fault.

308
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,520
You should not mention the love stuff.

309
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,400
Where are you going?

310
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,460
Go to find Youlian.

311
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,520
Why? Do you know who is your sister?

312
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,640
Mr. Zhou!

313
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Mr. Zhou comes here?

314
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,590
Mr. Zhou?

315
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,960
What brings him here?

316
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,710
Miss Su.

317
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,290
You asked to meet me?

318
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,400
Yes.

319
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,830
Nation-protecting Master.

320
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,470
By the order of His Majesty,

321
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,310
I bring Miss Cui the clothes of Assembly of States.

322
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,230
Hope it can add luster to your

323
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,950
dance performance.

324
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,880
Thank you.

325
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,430
So exquisite!

326
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,680
Thanks for His Majesty's care.

327
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,800
Please tell His Majesty,

328
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,680
I will dance for the honor of Moyun Ancient Academy,

329
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,310
no,

330
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,710
of our Tianqi State.

331
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,110
That's great!

332
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,610
Assembly of States will be held in 3 days.

333
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,830
How can I learn new dance moves in such a short time?

334
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,290
You are so modest, Miss Su.

335
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,590
His Highness said

336
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,110
as long as you followed what was written in this dance book,

337
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,310
based on your capability,

338
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,880
you would be sure to stand out.

339
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,520
If you can defeat other dancers

340
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,310
from small states at border areas

341
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,920
and take the first place,

342
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,640
my father will give you

343
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,800
whatever you want.

344
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,560
As long as I take the first place at Assembly of States,

345
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,920
I can get the token,

346
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
in which way

347
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,070
Li Xuan won't get hurt as well.

348
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,640
Miss Su.

349
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,110
Please tell His Highness,

350
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,350
I won't let him down.

351
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,190
Yes, Miss Su.

352
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,160
Who is playing the xun?

353
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,520
This piece of music is so familiar.

354
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,430
Why does it stop?

355
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,430
Your Majesty.

356
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,710
Long live Your Majesty.

357
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,400
Have a seat.

358
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

359
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,520
Sweetheart,

360
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,680
have a seat.

361
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,950
But...

362
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,040
It's my order.

363
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

364
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,160
Xuan,

365
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,160
do you know anything of Long Wei'er?

366
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Why does he sit beside His Highness?

367
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,070
Obviously, he is His Highness the Second.

368
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,160
What?

369
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,220
He is His Highness the Second?

370
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,110
The person that is on an equal footing with His Highness

371
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
can only be His Highness the Second.

372
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,710
I didn't know.

373
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,950
Fortunately,

374
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,760
I didn't offend him

375
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,110
at the Academy.

376
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,950
Horn locked by 5-color cloud from State of Nan.

377
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,230
This object gathers the spiritual qualities of 5-color lucky cloud.

378
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,470
It is created in Tianyao Wonderland

379
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,310
according to interactions among 5 elements.

380
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,520
The red and green gems inlaid in it

381
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,310
can lock the spiritual qualities in the horn.

382
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,560
Treasure from Western States

383
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,560
Wine cup made of dragon scales

384
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,880
Nanyang eagle on peony from Nisi State.

385
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,560
Dried coral from Guli State.

386
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,640
Ruyi of His Highness from State of Xiang.

387
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,190
Luminous pearl

388
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,830
from State of Liang.

389
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,230
Enough. Enough.

390
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,430
You can get the lid on.

391
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,050
Did anyone see Su Youlian?

392
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,070
Didn't she come in with us?

393
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,230
I saw her outside just now.

394
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,040
Just a few moments passed. Where did she go?

395
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,710
Where did she go?

396
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,960
Please enjoy the dance performances.

397
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,880
Xuan,

398
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,560
I didn't expect such a small state

399
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,350
have such excellent dancers.

400
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,820
Look at your silly face. Many dancers are better than them.

401
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,250
Yes. They aren't good enough.

402
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,590
After all, Tianqi State has a person who is much better

403
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,590
and prettier than them.

404
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,110
Am I right, Xuan?

405
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,640
Who is that?

406
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Su Youlian.

407
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,000
She dances very gracefully.

408
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,430
If she could take part in

409
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,430
the dance battle for Tianqi State,

410
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,000
we would win for sure.

411
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,010
What a pity.

412
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,040
Shut up.

413
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,520
You are the only person who keeps moaning.

414
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,240
Pianran,

415
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,110
Pianran,

416
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,750
it will be your turn soon.

417
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,830
It's time to make preparations.

418
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,880
Bian Lingcheng,

419
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,280
just wait and see.

420
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,520
Good.

421
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,760
Beautiful.

422
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,840
These dancers are flexible and lithe.

423
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,840
It's truly a feast for eyes.

424
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,800
Tianqi State has always taken the first place

425
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,190
over the past 10 years.

426
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,950
How about the preparations for

427
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,480
the dance battle this time?

428
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,070
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

429
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,760
Miss Cui has made perfect preparations.

430
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,750
and won't let Your Majesty down.

431
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,760
I've also heard of

432
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,710
Miss Cui's dancing skills.

433
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,800
It's not difficult for her

434
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,920
to defeat dancers on the stage.

435
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,110
Miss Cui is as excellent as her father, Minister Cui.

436
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,750
Your Majesty,

437
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,590
you can rest assured.

438
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,530
The first place will belong to our state for sure.

439
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,800
Great!

440
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,430
-Beautiful. -Awesome. -Well done.

441
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,470
It's fantastic.

442
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,440
Good indeed.

443
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,219
Wonderful.

444
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,710
Great!

445
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,909
Great.

446
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,800
Good.

447
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,280
Great.

448
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,670
It's great.

449
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,280
It's my first time to see it.

450
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,800
Yes.

451
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,150
Yes.

452
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:16,950
Great.

453
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,780
Beautiful.

454
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,320
Is everything ok?

455
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,230
Don't worry, Your Highness.

456
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,000
Miss Su is ready.

457
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,600
Dolt.

458
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,950
-Perfect! -Perfect! -Prefect!

459
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,120
Awesome.

460
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,520
However capable you are, there is always someone more capable.

461
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,670
Yes. It's marvelous.

462
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,520
It's my first time to see it.

463
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,430
It's a feast for eyes.

464
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,280
-Wonderful. -Awesome.

465
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,280
-Perfect. -Startling. - Splendid.

466
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,360
It's shocking.

467
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,450
Congratulations to you, Your Highness.

468
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,600
The first place

469
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,190
of this time must belong to Liang.

470
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,040
Thank you.

471
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,090
I'm flattered.

472
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,320
Is this what your perfect preparations mean?

473
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,430
It's...

474
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,120
Your Majesty,

475
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,120
I've heard that dancers of Tianqi State

476
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,720
are the best in the world.

477
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,910
After enjoying today's performance, I think they deserve their reputation.

478
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,710
But

479
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,800
compared with dancers of my state,

480
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,800
they are slightly inferior.

481
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,930
Your Highness, it's too early to say that.

482
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,560
There are so many talented people in Tianqi State.

483
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,230
The performance just now is just a warm-up.

484
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,910
It seems that

485
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,000
Your Highness has prepared a surprise for us?

486
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,150
You'll know that soon.

487
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,120
Well,

488
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,040
I'll wait and see.

489
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,310
This stupid His Highness indeed has something up his sleeve.

490
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,000
You are

491
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,580
truly blood brothers,

492
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,150
both keeping your own counsel.

493
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,560
It's not just us.

494
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,360
What do you mean?

495
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,630
I've heard that Su Youlian wants to get the number one token from you.

496
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,670
Haven't you

497
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,800
suspected her identity?

498
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,260
There is no need to do that.

499
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,910
Many people want the token.

500
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,360
That's right.

501
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,150
But is there

502
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,710
another person

503
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,280
as persistent as her?

504
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,490
What exactly do you want to say?

505
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,560
Kunwu.
