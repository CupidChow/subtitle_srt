1
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,860
Dance of the Sky Empire

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,860
Episode 5

3
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,500
What a beautiful prince!

4
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,579
Your Highness?

5
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,860
I'm fine.

6
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,520
Why does she have such an aura around her?

7
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,940
Could it be...?

8
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,380
Looks like I broke your carriage.

9
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,820
It's OK. I'll just get it repaired.

10
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,340
But why are you alone

11
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,579
in the wild so late at night?

12
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,900
I'm here to collect some herbs.

13
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,140
Collect herbs?

14
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,100
I see you have a head injury.

15
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,260
I have a doctor here.

16
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,260
How about letting him give you a treatment?

17
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,140
No, thank you.

18
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,120
I've collected the herbs.

19
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,620
I'll go back and use them on the wound myself.

20
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,340
Thank you.

21
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:43,860
Good.

22
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,380
Where do you live?

23
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,820
I mean, I'm afraid

24
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,140
it's not appropriate for you

25
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,060
to go back alone so late at night.

26
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,680
Let me give you a ride back.

27
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,660
I...

28
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,300
Sorry to trouble you.

29
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,620
I live in Moyun Ancient Academy.

30
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,710
So you are a student of Moyun Ancient Academy.

31
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,180
I'm a freshman.

32
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,980
Batou , go to Moyun Ancient Academy.

33
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:12,940
Yes.

34
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,460
It's cool inside this carriage.

35
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,700
I've arrived.

36
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,340
I hope you will have recovered from your injury

37
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,180
when I meet you next time.

38
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,780
Will we meet again?

39
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,420
Definitely.

40
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:43,740
That's good.

41
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,220
See you.

42
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,160
Your Highness,

43
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,540
our application for admission has been delivered to Moyun Ancient Academy.

44
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,460
In a few days,

45
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,440
you can be formally enrolled.

46
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,090
It is unexpected

47
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,420
that Su Youlian saved the Crown Prince.

48
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,180
Have you seen the corpses of those people?

49
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,980
By what weapon were they killed?

50
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
I can't tell that.

51
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,820
Their corpses are covered in many tiny wounds.

52
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,280
I've never seen people who died this way.

53
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,220
Do you think

54
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,120
that Su Youlian really helped the Crown Prince?

55
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,100
I don't think

56
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,140
she looks like an expert.

57
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,340
How can we see through

58
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,020
a real expert?

59
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,280
Well, I'll go check

60
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,680
Su Youlian's identity

61
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,220
and see who the hell she is.

62
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,860
No need.

63
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,020
Since she could be successfully enrolled by Moyun Ancient Academy,

64
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,420
that means she has hidden her real identity.

65
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,100
Come here.

66
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,560
Nice coup, Your Highness.

67
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,030
I'm going to make arrangements right now.

68
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,060
Su Youlian is...

69
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,340
Lord Zi, we've checked the academy,

70
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,940
but found nothing.

71
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,220
Lord Zi,

72
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,580
nothing unusual is found in the whole city.

73
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,100
That was clearly the Kunwu Move .

74
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,159
Keep investigating, and don't take it lightly.

75
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,100
Yes.

76
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,820
The Kunwu clan is ready to make trouble.

77
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,420
From tomorrow on,

78
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,180
I'll be practicing in seclusion

79
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,909
and trying my best to enhance the Moon Formation.

80
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,500
Yes.

81
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,260
There was clearly no wound on her head

82
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,590
when she came to my room.

83
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,660
How did she get wounded in the head?

84
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,659
Young Master,

85
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,870
you've turned over several times.

86
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,460
Did you injure Su Youlian today?

87
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,900
No.

88
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,220
Are you sure?

89
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,200
My moves were too fast,

90
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,670
so it's inevitable to get her injured.

91
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,240
You're going out so late at night?

92
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,900
Since you got her injured,

93
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,030
I have to visit her on behalf of you, wouldn't you say?

94
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,460
Where are you going?

95
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,120
It was me that got her injured.

96
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,960
How can I make trouble for you?

97
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,100
I'll take her the medicine myself.

98
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,980
Wait.

99
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,460
Well...

100
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:43,900
You know,

101
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,100
since you got her injured today,

102
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,140
she might bear a grudge against you.

103
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,180
If you go and visit her now, you are asking for trouble.

104
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,540
Forget it.

105
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,790
I'm the one who's got your back.

106
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,300
I have to deal with this for you.

107
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,580
Give me the medicine.

108
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,860
What expression is that?

109
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,790
Why are you looking at me like that?

110
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,060
Young Master, I must say

111
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,980
that we don't need this actually.

112
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,470
We are brothers.

113
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,020
We are supposed to help each other.

114
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,900
I mean,

115
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,620
if you want to meet Miss Su,

116
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,900
just tell me.

117
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,420
It doesn't hurt that much.

118
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,790
What are you doing here?

119
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,600
I'm admiring the moon.

120
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,780
You came to the girls' dormitory so late at night just to admire the moon?

121
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,180
I...I can admire the moon

122
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,340
wherever I want to.

123
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,350
What's this?

124
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,940
A poison that can kill you.

125
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Nonsense.

126
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,220
You...

127
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,820
What the heck do you want to do?

128
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,460
It's good for your wound.

129
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,620
Throw the medicine away.

130
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,380
This is not poison, Master.

131
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,110
Whether it is poison or not,

132
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,420
don't accept anything

133
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,790
that brat gives you.

134
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,860
Why?

135
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,140
I told you,

136
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,020
don't get too close to Li Xuan.

137
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,300
You turned a deaf ear to what I said?

138
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,700
No, I didn't.

139
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,820
But I don't think Li Xuan is a bad guy.

140
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,140
He even

141
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,200
spoke for the Kunwu clan in class.

142
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
You know,

143
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,120
he's the Nation-protecting Master.

144
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,140
The previous Nation-protecting Master

145
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,740
sealed the Dragon Emperor with his own hands.

146
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,660
The Kunwu clan is irreconcilable

147
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,720
with the Nation-protecting Master.

148
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,140
You look happy, Your Highness.

149
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,580
On which day do I look unhappy?

150
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,860
I guess

151
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,020
you are eager to go to Moyun Ancient Academy.

152
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,380
Indeed.

153
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,020
Everyone I should meet is there.

154
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,420
I should go there indeed.

155
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,660
Guys,

156
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,100
you must carefully digest

157
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,380
what I just taught you after class.

158
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,380
Li Xuan,

159
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
could you stop sleeping in my class?

160
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,740
Look at Xiao Fengming,

161
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,140
he always listens to me carefully

162
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,740
and is never absent-minded in class.

163
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,000
Then look at yourself,

164
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,820
if only you can learn a little bit from him!

165
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,780
Fengming looks knowledgeable.

166
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,760
I'm willing to take a back seat, and I'll learn from him.

167
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,420
What the hell is this spell?!

168
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,860
It almost choked me.

169
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,020
You are doing a good job performing this spell.

170
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,580
Next,

171
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,900
take out your own weapons

172
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,300
and try to inject some spiritual power into them

173
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,390
to enhance their offensive power.

174
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,500
Get started.

175
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,000
Which weapon should I inject spiritual power into?

176
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,740
You don't need any of them.

177
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,670
Just never bully other people by outnumbering them.

178
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,740
What weapon will you use?

179
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,380
Changqing.

180
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,260
Changqing?

181
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,980
Come on, take a seat.

182
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,220
I'll bring it here for you.

183
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,660
Just take a seat here.

184
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,940
OK.

185
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,620
Pianran,

186
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,980
why are you dancing in the canteen?

187
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,220
You know what?

188
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,380
I'm going to win glory at the Assembly of States

189
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,220
on behalf of the Tianqi State.

190
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,760
It's worth sacrificing the dinner time.

191
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,619
Don't stop, let's go on.

192
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:11,140
OK.

193
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,030
One, two, go!

194
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,099
Great!

195
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:14,780
Awesome!

196
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,619
Good.

197
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,790
Have you heard that?

198
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,500
What?

199
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,200
His Majesty got to know

200
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,819
that Su Youlian saved the Crown Prince.

201
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,060
At the levee,

202
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,579
His Majesty spoke highly of her

203
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,620
in front of all the officials at court.

204
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,300
Really?

205
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,720
How could this happen?

206
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,620
What a glory it is!

207
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,860
Indeed.

208
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,140
Now all disciples in this academy

209
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,540
admire her so much.

210
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,900
It is unexpected

211
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,060
that a girl from a frontier town

212
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,580
is quite competent.

213
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,540
I'm impressed.

214
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,740
I can't believe that.

215
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,550
Don't you know that?

216
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,860
Even our Nation-protecting Master

217
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,500
treats her with special respect.

218
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,860
You, you mean Li Xuan...

219
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,060
Exactly.

220
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,580
The other day, I saw the two of them...

221
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Stop practicing.

222
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,160
Go have dinner.

223
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,300
Yes!

224
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,780
Anyway,

225
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,580
a girl like Su Youlian, who's endowed with both beauty and talent,

226
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,060
is bound to be popular among gentlemen.

227
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,020
Indeed.

228
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,820
Yeah.

229
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,660
Are you blind?

230
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,460
It was obviously because of your rampage.

231
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,720
How could you blame me?

232
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,180
You are so unreasonable!

233
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,480
This book has been banned.

234
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,260
Stop reading it.

235
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,580
Take it easy.

236
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,460
I won't read it, bye.

237
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,020
The hemostatic herb of the Kunwu clan does work wonderfully.

238
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,820
It takes just one night

239
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,900
for the wound to heal basically.

240
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,860
Youlian?

241
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,060
Youlian?

242
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,180
Youlian?

243
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,800
Someone asked me to deliver a message to you.

244
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,300
A message?

245
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,340
Who is it from?

246
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,620
It's said that it was from Li Xuan.

247
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,340
Thank you.

248
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,020
OK, I'm leaving now.

249
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,820
[I'll meet you at Qianyuan Pavilion.]

250
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,100
What is this guy up to?

251
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,380
Forget it, I'll go take a look.

252
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,580
Youlian!

253
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,540
Are you feeling better?

254
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,380
I'm feeling better, Yanran.

255
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,420
Don't worry about me.

256
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,820
Where are you going so early in the morning?

257
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,940
Li Xuan asked me to go to Qianyuan Pavilion .

258
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,180
I'll go take a look.

259
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,220
Qianyuan Pavilion?

260
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,070
What kind of evil wind is it?

261
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,660
That's weird.

262
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,620
Li Xuan, are you inside?

263
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,940
Of course I'm not.

264
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,500
How could I have spare time

265
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,140
to care about that girl?

266
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,950
Last night I visited her...

267
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,940
Don't listen to him.

268
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,500
Last night, I went to visit her

269
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,100
to make up for Changqing's fault

270
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,380
and his sin.

271
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,620
Really?

272
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,820
Changqing never tells lies.

273
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,640
Come on, Changqing, eat this.

274
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,780
Tell me honestly, Xuanxuan.

275
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,020
Do you have a crush on her?

276
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,700
You know, you are just like that roadside matchmaker surnamed Huang

277
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,980
who believes that everyone has a crush on another person.

278
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,660
Young Master, that matchmaker is surnamed Wang.

279
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,120
And you, I'm not finished.

280
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,100
Stop talking.

281
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,860
Why do you tell everything to him?

282
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,990
Could we keep some secrets between us?

283
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,100
Secrets?

284
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,860
I'm telling you,

285
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,900
can brothers

286
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,020
and friends

287
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,820
talk about

288
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,020
or keep secrets?

289
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,340
There should be no secrets

290
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,900
between good friends or good brothers.

291
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,180
That makes sense.

292
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,660
Young Master,

293
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,020
when Bian Lingcheng visited Baihua Pavilion,

294
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,620
he was caught by Master Bian.

295
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,460
He said he was just taking care of

296
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,190
a girl you'd been patronizing.

297
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,860
What?

298
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,380
No wonder my dad hit me

299
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,940
as soon as I got home that day.

300
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,900
And he asked me to kneel and say something like

301
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,300
"I'll never go to Baihua Pavilion.”

302
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,100
Turns out it was all because of you?

303
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,860
Changqing,

304
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,260
how could you sell me down the river?

305
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,780
Li Xuan,

306
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,900
it was not like what you imagine.

307
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,270
Allow me to explain.

308
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
Take it easy.

309
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,500
Li Xuan,

310
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,060
allow me to explain first.

311
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,720
It was not like what you think.

312
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,020
What are you doing in the canteen, Li Xuan?

313
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,580
Nonsense.

314
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,380
Where else could I be at dinner time?

315
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,510
Something's wrong.

316
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,460
You invited Youlian to Qianyuan Pavilion, didn't you?

317
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,500
Who invited her to Qianyuan Pavilion?

318
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,700
Youlian told me that.

319
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,750
She's already waiting for you at Qianyuan Pavilion.

320
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,740
Qianyuan Pavilion?

321
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,020
Damn it.

322
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,700
Li Xuan?

323
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,140
Li Xuan?

324
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,180
Li Xuan?

325
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,420
That's weird.

326
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,420
Stop wasting your effort, girl.

327
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,180
Who are you?

328
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,460
Are you also a student of Moyun Ancient Academy?

329
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,700
Who I am doesn't matter.

330
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,180
A different aura.

331
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,300
Can you play chess, little girl?

332
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,540
Play what?

333
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,830
My master has never taught me this.

334
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,060
Since you can't play chess,

335
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,190
there's no point in keeping a worthless wretch like you.

336
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,260
These vines were born from my thousand-year spiritual power,

337
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,190
and no one can get rid of them so far.

338
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,300
Soon,

339
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,300
your spiritual power will be drained,

340
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,900
and you will become a pile of bones.

341
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,060
I can do it.

342
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,100
I can.

343
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,100
Really.

344
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,500
I can do it.

345
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,220
What's this? I've never seen it.

346
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,840
Have you made up your mind?

347
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,100
Why do you stare at me like this?

348
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,740
I can't play well if I'm nervous.

349
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,300
Alright.

350
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,630
I won't stare at you.

351
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,910
I won't stare at you.

352
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,260
Play.

353
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,820
Come on, hurry up.

354
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,820
Stop prowling around, will you?

355
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,340
You make me dizzy.

356
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,140
OK, I'll stop it.

357
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,700
Forget it.

358
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,910
I'd rather make wrong moves

359
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,700
than await my doom.

360
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,030
There you go.

361
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,860
Go.

362
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,860
How's everything going?

363
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,260
Su Youlian is exactly trapped inside here,

364
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,980
but nothing has happened for the time being.

365
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,710
Take it easy.

366
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,310
If she wants to survive,

367
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,260
she will definitely take actions next.

368
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,540
We just need to wait here.

369
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,420
Yes.

370
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,940
What's he doing here?

371
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,380
You lied to me.

372
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,620
You lied to me!

373
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,860
Young Master!

374
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,380
Let's go.

375
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,060
I got tied up by the vines.

376
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,660
None of us can get out of here

377
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,580
unless you crack that chess game.

378
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,840
How could this happen?

379
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,420
Today is really lively.

380
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,700
Don't make any rash moves again.

381
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,820
If you do,

382
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,980
I'll turn her into a pile of bones.

383
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,230
Youlian?

384
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,340
Youlian!

385
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,780
It's just a chess game.

386
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,140
I can crack it.

387
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,340
You can?

388
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,980
Let them go first.

389
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,750
Hurry up!

390
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
Are you all right?

391
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,860
If you manage to crack this chess game today,

392
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,620
the three of you can leave.

393
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,820
If you fail,

394
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,380
this is where you'll be buried.

395
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,820
Why does this chess board look so familiar?

396
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,060
Li Xuan,

397
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,500
can you do it?

398
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,340
Anyway, I have to try.

399
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,900
Play quickly.

400
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,420
Hurry up!

401
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,620
You did lie to me.

402
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,660
How dare you lie to me?

403
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,540
No.

404
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,220
No.

405
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,870
Give me another chance.

406
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,820
I've lost my patience.

407
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,980
I can definitely crack it this time.

408
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,620
Trust me.

409
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,660
Then play the game!

410
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,420
Old man,

411
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,860
why do you ask me

412
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,140
to crack a chess game you can't solve yourself?

413
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,980
Just let me go and have a drink with Bian Lingcheng,

414
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,740
will you?

415
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,220
If you can crack this game,

416
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,880
you can get out naturally.

417
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,380
What if I can't?

418
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,740
If you can't,

419
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,180
you can't get out

420
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,340
even if Baihua Pavilion is closed down.

421
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,460
Yes, something comes to my mind.

422
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,550
It moves.

423
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,740
It moves!

424
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,270
Play it quickly.

425
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:54,760
Come on!

426
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,470
Hurry up!

427
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,200
-Thank you for cracking this seal for me!
-Youlian!

428
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:15,420
I'm finally free!

429
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,780
Young Master, it's safe now.

430
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,380
I didn't mean it.

431
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,179
How about him?

432
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,540
He escaped.

433
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,139
No.

434
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,219
I'm done for.

435
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:21,060
That old man will hit me to death.

436
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,380
What's up?

437
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,300
Who the hell is he?

438
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,460
He's Qilin.

439
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,900
There's a formation set in the chess board to seal him,

440
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,500
but we cracked the seal.

441
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,260
Who sealed him?

442
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,139
You bet,

443
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,139
it must be that old man.

444
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,639
Yanran just said I asked you to come here.

445
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,540
Wasn't it you?

446
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,540
[See you at Qianyuan Pavilion.]

447
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,620
Who did you offend?

448
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,660
Nobody but you.

449
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,820
Let's go.

450
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,020
I didn't expect that Li Xuan would manage to crack this formation.

451
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,940
I told you,

452
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,660
Li Xuan is extraordinary.

453
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,220
We were supposed to test Xu Youlian,

454
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,900
but Li Xuan jumped out as a stumbling block.

455
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,700
Whether he's a stumbling block

456
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,220
depends on which side he takes.

457
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,940
He has been conflicting against the Crown Prince recently, hasn't he?

458
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,740
Are you sure you're going to draw Li Xuan to your side, Your Highness?

459
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,740
That's wrong.

460
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,780
How can you attend the Assembly of States if you dance like this?

461
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,580
Turn around facing upward. Upward.

462
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,780
Yeah. Exactly.

463
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,800
Turn around once more, reversed.

464
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,860
OK, let's...

465
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,140
Youlian!

466
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,900
What are you doing? We are dancing here.

467
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,460
Did you scheme what happened in Qianyuan Pavilion?

468
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,140
I…I don't know what you're talking about.

469
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,100
I'm asking you, did you write that note?

470
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,700
What's going on?

471
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,460
Li Xuan,

472
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,860
she hit me.

473
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,700
Stop complaining like a victim.

474
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,540
You set me up first.

475
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,140
I just played a prank.

476
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,260
Don't you know

477
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,990
you almost got all of us killed?

478
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,900
I really intended to just play a prank.

479
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,700
Besides,

480
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,990
I don't know it is so dangerous inside.

481
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,820
Well.

482
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,380
you let the ancient Qilin off,

483
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,980
and caused a big trouble,

484
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,380
but you still have the heart to frolic here?

485
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,280
Especially the two of you,

486
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,140
you broke into the forbidden place regardless of the academy's rules.

487
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,260
That was absurd!

488
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,860
Su Youlian has nothing to do with this.

489
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,860
I did this myself.

490
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,300
Cui Pianran, it's you again.

491
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,540
Cui Pianran should be sanctioned

492
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,470
for violating the academy's rules

493
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,540
and inducing others to break into the forbidden place.

494
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,100
However,

495
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,980
considering that you are going to attend the Assembly of States soon,

496
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,940
I declare on behalf of the Tianqi State,

497
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,400
that starting from today,

498
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,980
you are sanctioned to clean the yard for a month,

499
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,180
with a major demerit.

500
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,740
As for you two,

501
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,320
do you know the consequences of letting the ancient Qilin off?

502
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,520
Behave yourselves and wait here.

503
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,700
You will be sanctioned

504
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,520
after I report this to Lord Zi.

505
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:46,370
Mr. Wang, enjoy your life as you only live once.

506
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,500
Just listen to me.

507
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,210
There was an evil wind.

508
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,690
What evil wind?

509
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,140
Let's go have a drink.

510
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,420
Jing?

511
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,300
Jing.

512
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,260
My sister,

513
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,180
why don't you put on the dress

514
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,940
Mr. yang gave you?

515
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,560
Everyone is waiting for you downstairs.

516
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,180
Got it, I'll be right there.

517
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,900
Then hurry up.

518
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,630
I'll go downstairs to serve the guests first.

519
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,780
Hurry up.

520
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,740
You are slim and supple and not yet fourteen,

521
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,910
just like the young spring-tip of a cardamom-spray.

522
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,670
On the Yangzhou Road that extends three miles in the breeze,

523
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,980
every pearl-curtain is rolled up, but there's no one like you.

524
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,980
You are supposed to be in your best years,

525
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,420
but you have become a courtesan.

526
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,780
It's so pathetic.

527
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,900
God is jealous of such a beauty like you.
