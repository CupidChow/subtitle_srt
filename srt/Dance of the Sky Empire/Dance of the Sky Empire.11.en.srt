[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,860
Dance of the sky Empire

3
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,860
Episode 11

4
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,700
I'm supposed to use the spiritual power

5
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,030
to buffer the power of the spiritual ball.

6
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,419
Watch out, Youlian.

7
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,540
Yunshan,

8
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,200
use your spiritual power.

9
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,500
It's awesome.

10
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,660
You've done a great job,

11
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,340
Su Youlian.

12
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,220
Perfect.

13
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,790
It should be counted as two points, shouldn't it?

14
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,710
The ball goes in.

15
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:11,940
The ball goes in.

16
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,300
The ball goes in.

17
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,780
My face.

18
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,860
My face.

19
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:46,980
Su Youlian,

20
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,659
you played dirty tricks.

21
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,420
Li Xuan,

22
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,980
she's got a hidden weapon.

23
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,620
Look at my face.

24
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,020
I win.

25
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,870
Give the token to me.

26
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,380
The goal shouldn't be counted

27
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,900
because of your flagrant foul.

28
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,940
I didn't.

29
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,460
Su Youlian has crossed the line.

30
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,340
She even played dirty tricks to win the game.

31
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,100
You're right.

32
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,660
She's played such a dirty trick.

33
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,260
It's just a spiritual ball game, isn't it?

34
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,820
Why should they try this hard?

35
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,580
Exactly.

36
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,740
What do they want?

37
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,340
Yeah.

38
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,100
Who knows?

39
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,460
She's so sinister.

40
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,310
Does that token mean so much to you?

41
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,240
Is it that important to make you get it by whatever it takes?

42
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,860
Li Xuan.

43
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,420
Li Xuan, stand still.

44
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,940
Give the token to me.

45
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,860
Why should I?

46
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,080
One shouldn't go back on his word.

47
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,540
Give it to me.

48
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,100
Go back on my word?

49
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,960
Then you should tell me

50
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,140
why you want the token that much.

51
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,740
Because we've made a promise before the match.

52
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
As long as…

53
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,020
It's a poisonous pin.

54
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,750
It's none of your business.

55
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,360
Take care of your Schoolmate Cui.

56
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,920
She's been injured by her poisonous pin.

57
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,760
She shouldn't be disfigured.

58
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,420
Let's go.

59
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,860
I'll take you to visit a doctor.

60
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,790
You can't leave.

61
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,100
Hold my hand.

62
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,740
Hold my hand.

63
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,880
Be careful.

64
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:42,950
Brother,

65
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,420
hurry and come on up.

66
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,740
Brother.

67
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,100
Brother.

68
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,220
Are you okay?

69
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,550
I'm fine.

70
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,520
Where are they?

71
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,140
I haven't found them.

72
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,150
Changqing, how is it going?

73
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,460
Have you found them?

74
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,390
Where's Li Xuan?

75
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,300
It's all your fault.

76
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,620
It's because you schemed against Su Youlian.

77
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,980
Otherwise, Li Xuan wouldn't have fallen into the lake.

78
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,380
It's…

79
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,780
it's her who hit my head with the spiritual ball in the first place.

80
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,460
You…

81
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,780
Cui Pianran,

82
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,300
the poison that hurt your face belongs to your Clan of Cui.

83
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,740
If Youlian did intend to frame you up,

84
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,420
how would you explain the poison thing?

85
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,080
Sister, how could you do this?

86
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,940
Am I your elder sister?

87
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,220
How could you defend her?

88
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,080
It's not about who I'm defending.

89
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,580
You've crossed the line.

90
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,620
I…

91
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,460
Stop.

92
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,160
Are you in the mood for a quarrel here?

93
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,700
Mentor in Chief,

94
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,540
what on earth is going on?

95
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,340
I've searched everywhere but no one is found.

96
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,980
Now,

97
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,020
if they aren't in the bottom of the lake,

98
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,220
they must have fallen into the Bloody Icebound Ward.

99
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,900
How are you?

100
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,700
I'm fine.

101
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,140
What's this place?

102
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,100
How could

103
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,040
there be a frozen and snow-covered land in this season?

104
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,660
Are…

105
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,380
What?

106
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,780
Are we brought

107
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,960
to the mysterious place in the bottom of the lake

108
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,020
because of my token?

109
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,220
You…

110
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,590
you should let me

111
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,380
check your wounds first.

112
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,510
You wanna touch me secretly again, don't you?

113
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,540
Why are you kidding me at a moment like this?

114
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,980
You're such an idiot.

115
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,400
Why did you jump into the lake with me?

116
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,540
What?

117
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,150
Are you caring about me?

118
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,140
Nope.

119
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,120
Why did you jump into the lake?

120
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,500
Thank god I jumped off.

121
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,140
If I hadn't done it,

122
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,740
your life would have been in danger.

123
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,060
How about the poison?

124
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,540
I'm fine.

125
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,580
We should leave here as soon as possible.

126
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,420
Come on.

127
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,220
The Mirror Moon Lake seems

128
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,580
to be a normal lake,

129
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,220
but in fact,

130
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,140
it's one of the most dangerous mysterious lands

131
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,660
in our Academy.

132
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,180
Li Xuan has the number one token with him,

133
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,740
which can naturally

134
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,420
start the entrance of the mysterious land.

135
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,020
If I didn't guess wrong,

136
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
the two of them

137
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,100
would be brought to the mysterious land.

138
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,200
Then we can't figure out another way to go into the land, can we?

139
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,000
Are we gonna

140
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,190
helplessly wait for them to come back?

141
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,820
Mentor in Chief,

142
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,180
is there anything

143
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,620
that we don't know yet?

144
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,460
The reason why it is regarded as

145
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,300
one of the most dangerous mysterious lands

146
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,900
is that it's too hard to get in

147
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,180
while it's harder

148
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,100
to get out.

149
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,140
Can't we figure out

150
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,380
another way?

151
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,430
Whether they will be able to get out

152
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,940
depends on their fortune.

153
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,250
How are you?

154
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:13,900
I'm fine.

155
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,220
I won't die.

156
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,540
My wounds can be healed spontaneously.

157
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,700
I won't be hurt by these wounds.

158
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,750
Why are you lying to me at the moment like this?

159
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,700
Why should I?

160
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,940
See,

161
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,860
my wounds are about to be healed.

162
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,820
It has happened all the time since my childhood.

163
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,150
I don't know why either.

164
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,950
This time, you didn't lie to me.

165
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,860
I'm so sleepy.

166
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,940
I wanna sleep.

167
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,340
Have a sleep.

168
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,740
Youlian.

169
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,140
You mean Li Xuan and Su Youlian

170
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,800
fell into the Bloody Mysterious Land together.

171
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,060
I've heard from Mentor in Chief Xie that

172
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,500
the mysterious land was transformed from a book from heaven in ancient times.

173
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,980
One can only get into it without getting out.

174
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,060
It means

175
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,620
their chance of survival is more ominous than propitious.

176
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,300
Prince Mu

177
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,460
has been figuring out a way to bring them out,

178
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,060
but I think the result won't be too optimistic.

179
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,500
How is it going? How?

180
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,700
Have you found a way to break through the mysterious land?

181
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,020
It's all that old guy, Zi Ji's fault.

182
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,100
It's he who gave the token to Xuanxuan.

183
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,820
Now,

184
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,620
it's made such a mess for Xuanxuan.

185
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,550
Don't be furious. Hurry and search the information.

186
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,790
Yunshan.

187
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,500
Yunshan.

188
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,150
It's the new information I found. Have a look.

189
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,340
You're truly learned at ordinary times.

190
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,380
Have you found a way to break through the mysterious land.

191
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,040
Have a look.

192
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,720
What I always read is tactical deployments.

193
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,220
It's done. It's done.

194
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,180
Xuanxuan and Su Youlian must be dead this time.

195
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,620
Don't curse them.

196
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,060
She's right.

197
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,700
You've finished reading all the books, haven't you?

198
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,860
Okay. Okay.

199
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,180
Eight-Diagram tactics and Pole Figure tactics,

200
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,310
I'll take them both.

201
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,660
Youlian.

202
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,260
Youlian.

203
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,820
Wake up.

204
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,460
We're…

205
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,820
You've woken up.

206
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,820
The water is boiling.

207
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,940
I'm about to start.

208
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,020
Start?

209
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,340
Start what?

210
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,580
Youlian.

211
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,100
Youlian.

212
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,780
Old bastard, what are you gonna do?

213
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,500
Grandpa,

214
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,060
what do you do this to me for?

215
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,580
For what?

216
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,860
For cooking you.

217
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,380
You brat,

218
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,520
why are you shouting out loud?

219
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,180
I'm about to eat her today.

220
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,100
The next one is you.

221
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,140
Old bastard, are you out of your mind?

222
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,500
There're so many kinds of delicious food, but you don't eat.

223
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,820
You go so far as to eat human beings.

224
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,900
Put her down.

225
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,700
Delicious food?

226
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,140
I've lived in the mysterious land alone

227
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,620
for several hundred years.

228
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,100
I've eaten everything,

229
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,540
except for a living human being.

230
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,780
Now God has brought you two here,

231
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,380
which allows me to have a taste of something new.

232
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,340
Wait a sec.

233
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,420
Wait a sec.

234
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,460
What else do you gonna do?

235
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,140
Grandpa,

236
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,300
think about it.

237
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,380
Look at her.

238
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,780
The girl

239
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,740
is too skinny.

240
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,840
She won't be delicious enough for you to eat.

241
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,060
She's really too skinny.

242
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,660
She is.

243
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,420
Have another look at her,

244
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,900
the parts of her body that are supposed to be plump

245
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,160
are actually too thin.

246
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,110
Li Xuan, you're talking nonsense.

247
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,580
Grandpa.

248
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,460
I've just heard that

249
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,380
you've lived in the mysterious land for a several hundred years.

250
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,340
It's God who sent us to take care of you.

251
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,860
How could you eat us both?

252
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,780
You mean

253
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,380
the reason that God sent you here

254
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,380
isn't to let me eat both of you.

255
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,420
Of course not.

256
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,660
Think about it.

257
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,900
God must think

258
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,340
you're too lonely here,

259
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,580
so he specially sent us here to keep accompany you.

260
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,780
If you were to eat us,

261
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,460
you would abuse his kindness, wouldn't you?

262
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,260
Am I right?

263
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,540
Sure.

264
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,900
Grandpa,

265
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,110
we're sent by God to accompany you.

266
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
You can't eat us.

267
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,240
Your words make sense.

268
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,140
I've been lonely living in the mysterious land

269
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,580
for a several hundred years.

270
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,750
I've  come up with an idea

271
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,300
I can eat one of you and keep the other alive.

272
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,960
Then there's one who's able to accompany me,

273
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,820
which is enough.

274
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,700
Old bastard, if you dare to eat her,

275
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,830
to be honest, I won't live without her.

276
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,100
You brat,

277
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,420
how dare you threaten me?

278
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,820
I…

279
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,540
If you dare to kill her,

280
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,340
I'll throw your dog into the vat.

281
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,300
You brat,

282
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,980
how dare you touch my Wangcai?

283
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,700
Don't you think…

284
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,900
I'm about to throw it.

285
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,140
How?

286
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,700
If you dare to throw her into the vat,

287
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,160
then I dare throw your dog.

288
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,700
Since I've never tried dog meat before.

289
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Okay. Okay. Okay.

290
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,300
You win. You win.

291
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,620
Well,

292
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,140
I'll put her down

293
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,440
while you should put down my Wangcai.

294
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,660
You promise

295
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,220
if I release the dog, you won't eat us both anymore.

296
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,460
Don't ask for more.

297
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,500
Come on.

298
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,100
Fine. Fine. Fine.

299
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,140
Fine.

300
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,500
I promise.

301
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
You swear.

302
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
I swear

303
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,500
I won't eat you both.

304
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,500
Does it work?

305
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,220
Youlian,

306
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,680
how are you?

307
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,660
Wangcai.

308
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,940
The poison has gone to the entrails.

309
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,140
Wangcai, my honey.

310
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,380
Well,

311
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,300
she's been poisoned with the Heart-breaking Powder.

312
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,260
It's lucky enough for her to have lived for two hours.

313
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,190
When she's still alive,

314
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,580
why not let us eat her?

315
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,990
Am I right, Wangcai?

316
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,830
You know the poison, don't you?

317
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,380
I'm the Elder of the Book of Heaven.

318
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,540
There's nothing I don't know all over the world.

319
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,300
The Elder of the Book of Heaven?

320
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,380
The Book of Heaven.

321
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,960
Are you the Elder of the Book of Heaven

322
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,140
who knows everything?

323
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,420
Why?

324
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,820
Now you know how brilliant I am.

325
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,760
Then you must know how to detoxicate her.

326
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,740
Grandpa,

327
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,350
I beg you to save her.

328
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,960
Please save her, will you?

329
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,740
Save her.

330
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,900
Why should I?

331
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,420
You almost cooked my Wangcai just now.

332
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,700
That I promised not to eat you both

333
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,700
is the last mercy I could show to you.

334
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,100
Saving her life

335
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,580
is impossible.

336
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,900
Li Xuan,

337
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,480
don't beg him anymore.

338
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
I'm afraid he doesn't have a method.

339
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,500
Life and death are doomed.

340
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,480
We won't be able to fight against God.

341
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,710
I'll figure out a way to save your life.

342
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,020
What do you mean?

343
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,780
I don't have a method to detoxicate you?

344
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,860
I'm the Elder of the Book of Heaven

345
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,550
What can the Elder of the Book of Heaven do?

346
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,060
You're just a lonely aged guy

347
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,300
who's lived in the mysterious land for quite a long time.

348
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,360
It doesn't matter.

349
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,820
Youlian,

350
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,780
if you die, I'll die with you.

351
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,980
At least, we can go in company with one another on our way to Hades,

352
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,340
which is much better than someone who's gonna die alone.

353
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,660
You brat, you're looking down upon me.

354
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,070
You wanna go in company with one another on your way to Hades without me.

355
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,820
Today, I'm gonna heal her

356
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,300
to show you how brilliant I am

357
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,980
How is she?

358
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,700
How on earth is she?

359
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,460
She won't die.

360
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,460
Don't touch her with your hand.

361
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,900
The poison has been detoxified,

362
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,160
but she still needs some time to recover.

363
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,860
When will she wake up?

364
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,820
In twenty hours.

365
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,220
What?

366
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,020
Li Xuan has fallen into the mysterious land under the Mirror Moon Lake, hasn't he?

367
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,740
Yes, he has.

368
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,980
I've just heard the news from the Moyun Ancient Academy.

369
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,460
An ordinary person isn't able to get into the mysterious land under the Mirror Moon Lake.

370
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,260
Over the several hundred years,

371
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,140
none of those who got into it has been able to get out alive.

372
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,580
Come here.

373
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,380
Put my shoes on.

374
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,180
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

375
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,980
What are you gonna do? –Hurry up.

376
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,300
Go to the Academy.

377
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,460
Go to the Academy?

378
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,420
For what?

379
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,060
What else can I do?

380
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,540
As the Crown Prince,

381
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,820
the Nation-protecting Master has fallen into the mysterious land,

382
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,460
so I'm supposed to express my condolences.

383
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,020
Let's go.

384
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,670
Head for the Academy. –Yes.

385
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,820
What are all of you

386
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,100
doing here?

387
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,700
Forget formalities. Forget formalities.

388
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,980
What a pity!

389
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,580
What a pity!

390
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,140
He died young.

391
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,900
But you don't have to be so sad.

392
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,380
It's said that life and death are doomed, and the evil must get the retribution they deserve.

393
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,580
Li Xuan

394
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,040
has done so many evil things at ordinary timeshare,

395
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,580
so even God wants to punish him.

396
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,350
How dare you?

397
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,900
Watch your words.

398
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,940
What? Feng Changqing,

399
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,060
you dare to be rude to me, don't you?

400
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,020
Your Highness, please don't get angry.

401
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,140
Changqing's just lost his head for the moment

402
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,140
and contradicted you.

403
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,670
You don't wanna bother yourself arguing with someone like him.

404
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,130
He's merely the servant of Li Xuan.

405
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,420
Now his master has gone.

406
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,020
What else can he do?

407
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,340
Li Xuan

408
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,900
probably won't be able to

409
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,980
get out of the Mirror Moon Lake alive.

410
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,130
You'd better go home soon.

411
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,170
Dismiss.

412
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,540
What a good weather today!

413
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:53,860
Why hasn't she woken up?

414
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,540
Twenty hours have almost gone.

415
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,700
Has that old bastard lied to me?

416
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,100
Nope.

417
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,020
I have to ask him.

418
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,140
Youlian.

419
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,300
I…

420
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,620
You wake up.

421
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,660
How do you feel?

422
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,700
Well, get up slow.

423
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,900
Okay.

424
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,420
I feel much better.

425
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,780
Where are we?

426
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,190
In the room of that old bastard.

427
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,880
He helped detoxicate you.

428
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,260
It's too dangerous here.

429
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,300
We have to leave right now.

430
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,900
You have internal injuries.

431
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,180
You can’t move as you want.

432
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,310
You need a good rest.

433
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,540
Besides,

434
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,260
I checked around just now. It's all covered with ice and snow.

435
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,460
We won't be able to leave here in a while.

436
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,500
So we shall find another time to leave here

437
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,740
after your injuries are healed,

438
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,580
shan't we?

439
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,140
But the Elder of the Book of Heaven said he would eat us.

440
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,500
Don't worry about it.

441
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,300
I won't let him hurt you.

442
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,240
I'll follow what you said.

443
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,520
Are you hungry?

444
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620
I'm gonna make you something to eat.

445
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,620
Wait for me.

446
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,940
Thank you, old guy.

447
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,740
Do you have anything to eat?

448
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,380
If you dare to say another word,

449
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,980
I'll definitely eat you.

450
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,320
Does it taste good?

451
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,860
It does.
