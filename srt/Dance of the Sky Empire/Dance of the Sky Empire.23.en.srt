00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,860
Dance of the Sky Empire

3
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,860
Episode 23

4
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,420
Brother.

5
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,940
Brother,

6
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,060
I'm not going back to the State of Sha with you.

7
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,900
Do

8
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,500
you wanna go find Xiao Fengming?

9
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,620
I can't leave him alone with that demon.

10
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,660
You also know that

11
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,180
the demon spirit has the spiritual power of the Dragon Emperor,

12
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,980
which you won't be able to defeat

13
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,230
Don't be impulsive.

14
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,950
I don't intend to defeat him

15
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,340
but keep him company.

16
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,820
I'll wait for you to save him.

17
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,140
Nope.

18
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,060
It's too dangerous.

19
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,120
I won't agree on it.

20
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:50,900
If

21
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,980
the one in danger is Su Youlian,

22
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,910
what are you gonna do, Brother?

23
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,300
Go ahead.

24
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,300
Be careful.

25
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,300
Loong Wei'er,

26
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,180
let's take action separately. Go.

27
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,620
Okay.

28
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,540
There are criminals who are Loong Wei'er and Zheng Bainian.

29
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,780
They collide with the renegade, Li Xuan

30
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,780
to cheat His Majesty.

31
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,700
They released the siren of the Clan of Kunwu arbitrarily

32
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,020
in the name of atoning for the previous crime.

33
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,620
They cared nothing about the order of His Majesty as well as the safety of the people.

34
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,950
They won't be absolved.

35
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,740
According to the law of Tianqi,

36
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,660
they are sentenced to decapitation

37
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,220
and will be executed in the South City Execution Ground

38
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,020
on 4th, December, Renchen Year.

39
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,060
Time's up.

40
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,380
Decapitate.

41
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,980
You're finally coming.

42
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,060
Sorry to let you suffer.

43
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,590
Let's go.

44
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,820
Zheng Bainian, hurry up.

45
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,300
Well,

46
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,660
spit it out.

47
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,430
Who on earth are you?

48
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,740
A crap.

49
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,540
You know you're a crap.

50
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,710
There're plenty of you,

51
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,900
but you still fail to stop Li Xuan from saving them.

52
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,820
I have so many subordinates.

53
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,260
Could you help me

54
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,140
accomplish at least one thing?

55
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,540
I mean at least one thing.

56
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,340
Please calm your anger, Your Highness.

57
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,580
It will hurt you.

58
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,470
Do you know the punishment?

59
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,700
Yes.

60
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,340
Come on.

61
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,580
No wonder Xiao Fengming looked down upon you.

62
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,020
No wonder Xiao Fengming looked down upon you.

63
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,460
Reach out your hand.

64
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,580
Who allows you to take back your hand?

65
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,909
You even changed a hand.

66
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,860
That one.

67
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,980
No wonder they looked down upon you.

68
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,180
Since they're so different from you.

69
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,640
They're so different from you. They're so different from you.

70
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,380
Where's Xiao Fengming?

71
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,380
He's...he's in his room.

72
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,720
Go ask him to come here.

73
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,340
Yes. I'm going right now.

74
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,100
Come on.

75
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,020
Come back as soon as possible.

76
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,020
Next one.

77
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,240
It's your turn.

78
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,060
Your Highness.

79
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,820
What's up?

80
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,060
Your Highness,

81
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,780
Princess Yunshan of the State of Sha wants to meet you.

82
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,460
Who?

83
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,920
Princess Yunshan.

84
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,300
Why is she coming?

85
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,590
I won't meet her.

86
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,140
Yes.

87
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,930
Are you clear about what I said just now?

88
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,420
Yes.

89
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,430
Your Highness.

90
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,659
I have something important to tell you.

91
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,809
It's you.

92
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,500
Okay.

93
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:41,780
Let me know

94
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,580
what important thing you wanna tell me,

95
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,580
which even makes you intrude into my bedroom.

96
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,020
Xiao Fengming has been manipulated by the demon spirit of the Dragon Emperor.

97
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,080
You can't be deceived by him anymore.

98
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,790
What are you talking about?

99
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,860
Yunshan.

100
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,220
I mean,

101
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,380
you're the princess of the State of Sha,

102
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,180
but you're slandering my subordinate

103
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,820
in front of me.

104
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,420
I mean,

105
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,220
what on earth do you want?

106
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,780
I'm not slandering him

107
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,480
but telling you the truth.

108
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,540
According to your word,

109
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,100
now that you're telling the truth

110
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,300
that he has been manipulated by the demon spirit of the Dragon Emperor,

111
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,340
do you have the evidence?

112
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,400
The evidence is ...

113
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,360
The evidence is...

114
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,340
Haven't you noticed his spiritual power is boundless

115
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,380
and the martial arts of him is extremely powerful these days?

116
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,340
I do notice it.

117
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,140
Otherwise, I wouldn't have recruited him

118
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,260
to my camp.

119
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,820
It's the evidence.

120
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,180
Xiao Fengming isn't that powerful.

121
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
What he can achieve the best is to draw formations

122
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,340
instead of martial and magic arts.

123
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,140
-Crown Prince, you... -Enough.

124
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,580
I get it.

125
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,420
Well, have you finished?

126
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,640
Please go back.

127
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,340
Guards.

128
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,140
Escort her out.

129
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,220
Crown Prince, you have to trust me.

130
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,620
Xiao Fengming isn't the one who he used to be.

131
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,500
He has been manipulated.

132
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,620
Hurry and take the crazy woman away.

133
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,460
Let me go.

134
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,420
I'm able to walk by myself.

135
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,620
What a bad temper you have!

136
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Do you know the hierarchy and order?

137
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,340
I've known who you are.

138
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,980
You'd better stop manipulating Xiao Fengming immediately.

139
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,710
-Otherwise. -Otherwise what?

140
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,580
Otherwise...

141
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,500
Otherwise, I'll let the public know the truth.

142
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,560
I'll see whoever will believe in you.

143
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,860
Does it matter?

144
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,500
Why would Xiao Fengming have a thing for

145
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,060
a silly girl like you?

146
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,340
I get it.

147
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,260
One of you are pedantic and dull

148
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,460
while the other is impulsive and silly.

149
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,780
What a perfect match you are!

150
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,180
What are you talking...?

151
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,820
Xiao Feng...

152
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,220
Xiao Fengming.

153
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,660
Yunshan.

154
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,980
Xiao Fengming.

155
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,980
Yunshan.

156
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,060
Xiao Fengming.

157
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,420
Watch her carefully.

158
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:23,980
Yes.

159
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,780
Yes.

160
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,680
Xiao Fengming,

161
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,000
you're coming.

162
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,580
Come here. Come on.

163
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,980
Have some shots of alcohol with me.

164
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:43,980
Back off.

165
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,700
Xiao Fengming,

166
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,300
have you heard it?

167
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,780
Your Highness, do you mean Second Prince was saved?

168
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,820
Exactly.

169
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,820
I've never seen father so angry.

170
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,700
You mean, how dare

171
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,260
Li Xuan

172
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,660
come to save Loong Wei'er

173
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,790
since he himself is a wanted criminal?

174
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,180
I have no idea why Li Xuan had the courage.

175
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,180
The execution ground was heavily guarded,

176
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,470
but he still succeeded in saving them.

177
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,620
Your Highness,

178
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,420
don't you think the subordinates around you are useless?

179
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,660
Well,

180
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,580
from now on,

181
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,300
you'll be in charge of

182
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,060
my personal guards.

183
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,700
As for my henchmen,

184
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,360
you don't have to hassle them.

185
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,740
Besides,

186
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,620
go find some best talents for me immediately.

187
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,700
I wanna organize a best team.

188
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,660
I want the best one.

189
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,540
The team trained by me

190
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,820
must be the best.

191
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,740
Xiao Fengming,

192
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,340
I trust you.

193
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,620
Come on.

194
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,070
Have a full shot of alcohol.

195
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,220
Well,

196
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,880
do you know Princess Yunshan?

197
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,540
The princess of the State of Sha is my schoolmate.

198
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,820
Of course, I know her.

199
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,540
Then do you know

200
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,260
what she told me

201
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,900
when she came to me today?

202
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,660
I wouldn't know

203
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,820
what she told you.

204
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,020
She said to me that

205
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,580
Xiao Fengming isn't the one he used to be.

206
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,800
He's the demon spirit of the Dragon Emperor now.

207
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,300
Do you think it's ridiculous?

208
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,700
You don't believe her word, do you?

209
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,900
Of course not.

210
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,980
The word of her is nonsense.

211
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,100
I've put you in an important position,

212
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,560
so I'll trust you for sure.

213
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,220
As long as you can assist me,

214
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,300
I'll definitely offer you gorgeous rewards

215
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,100
when I succeed to the throne some other day.

216
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,940
I'll try my utmost to assist you.

217
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,500
And I wish Your Highness could succeed to the throne

218
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,360
and rule the neighboring states.

219
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,220
Don't say it now.

220
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,740
Loong Wei'er and Li Xuan...

221
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,380
Long Wei'er is a convict sentenced to death by His Majesty

222
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,540
while Li Xuan is a renegade.

223
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,070
The two of them won't have a way to make a living in Tianqi.

224
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,620
Well,

225
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,230
thanks for your hard work, Xiao Fengming.

226
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,420
Well,

227
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,300
what are you gonna do?

228
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,500
I intend to go to the State of Sha.

229
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,270
The State of Sha?

230
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,720
It's said that there's another Saintess Stone in the State of Sha.

231
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,260
I think, since Su Youlian failed to awake the Dragon Emperor this time,

232
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,100
and the Saintess Stone was broken,

233
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,180
she would go to the State of Sha

234
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,380
to search for the other Saintess Stone.

235
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,860
I have to stop her.

236
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,220
Besides,

237
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,460
do you always wanna know

238
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,800
the memories you lost?

239
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,140
If you wanna retrieve your memories,

240
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,400
maybe that Saintess Stone will help you.

241
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,950
Could that Saintess Stone help me retrieve my memories?

242
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,980
It's said on the historical data.

243
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,580
Let it go.

244
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,400
Even if I retrieve my memories, what else could I do?

245
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,860
My father has died.

246
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,560
It's meaningless.

247
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,880
Now that you have the thought,

248
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,420
I won't force you.

249
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,060
Thank you for

250
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,230
saving me today.

251
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,420
Bainian,

252
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:10,329
let's go.

253
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,540
Wait a sec.

254
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,420
I'll go with you.

255
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,950
There's no room for me here.

256
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,089
It's meaningless for me to stay here.

257
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:21,690
Xuanxuan,

258
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,300
I...

259
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,130
I also...

260
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,780
I also wanna go to the State of Sha with you.

261
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,839
So does Changqing.

262
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:26,740
Right?

263
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,660
Nope.

264
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:28,820
Well,

265
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,300
why?

266
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,700
I can't let you go with me this time.

267
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,420
We won't be able to help you, won't we?

268
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,950
It's I who don't wanna put you in danger again.

269
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,030
Nope. Xuanxuan.

270
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,020
You can't say anything like that.

271
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,220
We're close friends.

272
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,780
Let him go.

273
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,540
Young Master has already mastered the extraordinary power.

274
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,600
I think when he encounters something difficult later,

275
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,500
he can absolutely deal with it better than I.

276
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,460
Okay.

277
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,260
If I can come back safely,

278
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,460
we'll have a reunion.

279
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,420
Take care.

280
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,660
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

281
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,500
Let's go.

282
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,220
You’re awake.

283
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,820
You look

284
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,520
much better today.

285
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,160
Prince Mu, thanks for taking good care of me.

286
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,340
Have this, please.

287
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,000
I can have it by myself.

288
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,420
How soon will we arrive in the State of Sha?

289
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,020
It will take at least over ten days to

290
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,740
get to the border city of the State of Sha, Shiye City from here.

291
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,060
If we wanna catch up with the siren of Kunwu,

292
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,280
we'd better hurry.

293
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,980
This is Shiye City.

294
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,700
When we get into Shiye City,

295
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,940
it means we've arrived in the State of Sha.

296
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,700
Miss Su,

297
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,060
it's merely an unimpressive city now,

298
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
but ten years ago,

299
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,500
it was the busiest city on the border

300
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,260
of Tianqi and the State of Sha.

301
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,260
What has happened over these years?

302
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,340
It's depressed.

303
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,660
Old bastard.

304
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,140
Military Official.

305
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,060
It's time to pay the money.

306
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,980
Military Official,

307
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,500
could you please extend the deadline two more days?

308
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,260
Stop your nonsense.

309
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,300
If you don't pay the money today,

310
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,380
I'll smash your stall.

311
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,380
Military Official,

312
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,710
I do wanna pay the money,

313
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,460
but I have no money with me.

314
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,820
You have no money with you?

315
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,100
Don't talk with him anymore.

316
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,980
Smash his stall.

317
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,060
Smash it. Smash it. Smash it.

318
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
Military Official. Military Official, please stop.

319
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,660
Go away.

320
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,780
Military Official, I'm just running the small business.

321
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,340
Your Highness.

322
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,940
Please don't smash my stall.

323
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,160
Hurry and get away.

324
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,240
Hurry and stand up.

325
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,900
Thank you, Childe.

326
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:56,820
Welcome.

327
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,820
Please come in.

328
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,180
This way. This way. This way.

329
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,660
Please.

330
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,580
Sit down, please. Sit down, please.

331
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,740
Please wait a moment.

332
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,470
I'll go make a pot of tea for you.

333
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,460
Bring some tea.

334
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,420
I'm coming.

335
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,180
I heard that

336
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,660
some other trade caravans were withheld several days ago.

337
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,740
Are you sure?

338
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,180
Of course.

339
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,620
Now Shiye City has almost become

340
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,420
the territory of the State of Tianqi.

341
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,780
These military officials of Tianqi come to levy taxes every year.

342
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,100
Some businessmen like us

343
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,100
are blackmailed one after another.

344
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,940
Prince Mu,

345
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,340
why does Tianqi come to levy taxes in Shiye city?

346
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,420
Miss Su,

347
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,460
you have no idea about it.

348
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,180
Since when the Clan of Human Being

349
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,300
won the battle between

350
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,100
the Clan of Kunwu and them ten years ago,

351
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,420
the emperor of Tianqi has planned to

352
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,020
swallow up our State of Sha.

353
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,420
The late emperor of Sha was still alive in those years.

354
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,020
So,

355
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,460
he mapped out a strategy

356
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,940
while mediated with Tianqi,

357
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,300
which protected our state from being merged.

358
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,180
But

359
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,700
the price we had to pay

360
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,140
was to sign some unequal treaties.

361
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,070
There's one among them,

362
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,340
which says the border of the State of Sha should be unguarded

363
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:07,140
and the soldiers of Tianqi are allowed to get into the State of Sha without limitation.

364
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,240
No wonder I've seen

365
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,460
so many soldiers of Tianqi

366
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,520
walking in the streets of Shiye City.

367
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,100
Military Official,

368
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,740
what do you want?

369
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,500
Back off.

370
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,500
Scram. Scram.

371
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,140
Go away. Go away. Go away.

372
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,340
Please.

373
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,540
Your clothes look great.

374
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,920
Where are you from?

375
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,910
He's asking you.

376
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,240
Haven't you heard him?

377
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,820
It's fine. It's fine.

378
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,180
You look pretty.

379
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,790
Have a cup of tea with me.

380
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,940
Loosen your grip.

381
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,740
There's someone who don't dare to die.

382
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,200
Haven't you asked around?

383
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,500
Catch him.

384
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,580
I'm He Xiongfei. I'm sorry for coming here and saving you so late.

385
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,440
Your Highnes, please forgive me.

386
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,860
General He, stand up please.

387
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,590
Your Highness. Your Highness.

388
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,280
Your Highness.

389
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,380
Your Highness, please help us.

390
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,260
Those soldiers of Tianqi have gone too far in bullying us.

391
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,020
They racketeer us every day.

392
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,700
Besides, they also hurt my guests.

393
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,430
What they've done is no less than the brigandage.

394
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,100
Yeah.

395
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,140
Your Highness.

396
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,380
Please punish those atrocious Tianqi soldiers on behalf of us.

397
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,620
We've been going through a hard time.

398
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,620
He Xiongfei,

399
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,540
listen to me.

400
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,580
Yes.

401
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,220
Give out my order that

402
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:50,980
from today onwards,

403
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,140
we should put things straight.

404
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,540
The border defence should be established in Shiye City.

405
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,580
If the soldiers of Tianqi get into the State of Sha without any reason,

406
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,910
kill them immediately.

407
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,060
Your Highness,

408
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,540
it's...

409
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,990
From today onwards,

410
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,100
our State of Sha won't be bullied and oppressed by Tianqi.

411
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,860
If any soldier dares to invade,

412
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,060
kill him.

413
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,660
Yes.

414
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,060
I'll obey your order.

415
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,220
Your Highness brings benefits to the people.

416
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,280
We hope Your Highness all happiness.

417
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,040
Your Highness,

418
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,190
are you worrying about what happened in daytime?

419
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,900
Batou,

420
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,540
is it baffling to you

421
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,860
why I announced the order

422
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,980
to establish the border defence today all in a sudden?

423
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,660
You don't want the people to suffer anymore,

424
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,660
so you have to give such an order.

425
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,620
But

426
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,380
not establishing the border defence is the agreement come to by the late emperor

427
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,740
and Tianqi.

428
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,590
If we breach the agreement unilaterally,

429
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,580
I'm afraid

430
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,540
the State of Tianqi won't

431
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,100
let us go so easily.

432
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,380
Exactly.

433
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,660
But

434
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,220
the cities in Tianqi are in chaos.

435
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,860
On the one hand, they have to prevent the Dragon Emperor from escape.

436
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,180
On the other hand, the competition between Loong Wei'er and the crown prince for the throne

437
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,460
is getting fiercer and fiercer.

438
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,340
Besides, Xiao Fengming who is manipulated by the demon spirit

439
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,670
has made such a huge mess in Qingtian City.

440
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,340
Even if the emperor of Tianqi wants to pick up a fight against our State of Sha,

441
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,340
he might not be able to do it.

442
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,420
Your Highness,

443
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,820
you've planned all of these things.

444
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,060
But the most important thing for me

445
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,260
is to give the Saintess Stone to Youlian

446
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,900
to awake the Dragon Emperor.

447
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,780
Then

448
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,940
the crisis of our State of Sha

449
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,760
will be resolved thoroughly.

450
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,520
Your Highness,

451
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,040
it's well roasted.

452
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,620
Thank you.

453
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,990
What's on your mind?

454
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,340
Nothing.

455
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,830
Are you sure?

456
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,510
It's I who get you into trouble.

457
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,940
If I didn't get you into trouble,

458
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,940
you wouldn't have to be here with me.

459
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,820
Right.

460
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,220
If I knew you would bring me such a big trouble,

461
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,260
I must have...

462
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,020
What a pity!

463
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,870
You couldn't have known it.

464
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,540
If I knew you would bring me such a big trouble,

465
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,870
I would save you anyway.

466
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,300
Why?

467
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,670
I would save my friend without any precondition.

468
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,240
Your Highness,

469
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,020
you do want the antidote, don't you?

470
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,820
Give it to me.

471
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,740
No.

472
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,660
Why do you want it?

473
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,540
You should have known it.

474
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,390
Why do you wanna do this?

475
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,750
Do you know how dangerous being a woman again will be?

476
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,860
I've been disguising myself as a man for too long. I'm exhausted.

477
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,780
Now,

478
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,300
I finally get rid of the control of the Tianqi Emperor.

479
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,880
I don't have to disguise myself anymore.

480
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,980
Bainian,

481
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,860
give it to me.

482
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,740
Is it because you have a thing for Li Xuan?

483
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,180
So you wanna...

484
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,910
How dare you?

485
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,340
Don't try to guess my thought,

486
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,070
even though you've been working for me for years.

487
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,340
I'm wrong.

488
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,540
Why is there a woman

489
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,780
having a bath here?

490
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,199
It's Loong Wei'er.

491
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,820
Seen from

492
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,780
his shadow,

493
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,420
he does look like a girl.

494
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,220
The birthmark?

495
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,580
The baby is too miserable.

496
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,700
Her mother gave birth to her yesterday,

497
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,060
while her father wanted to abandon her

498
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,780
because she was a girl.

499
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,500
Her mother found someone to escort her out.

500
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,220
And she was robbed on her way.

501
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,020
The baby is too miserable.

502
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,420
Is

503
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,940
he’s that baby?

504
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,550
It couldn't happen.

505
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,900
He's a man.

506
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,260
The one I saw in the place of Grandpa Elder of the Book of Heaven

507
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,660
was a baby girl.

508
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,980
Why are you looking at me?

509
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,580
Nothing.

510
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,740
If you have questions for me,

511
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,380
go ask me.

512
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,840
You're a man or a woman?

513
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,380
Nope.

514
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,860
I...I...

515
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,900
I mean,

516
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,980
since...since you're a woman,

517
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,990
why do you disguise yourself as a man all the time?

518
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,500
It's because of what happened eighteen years ago.

519
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,420
At that time,

520
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,820
my father had just succeeded to the throne.

521
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,540
A fortune teller told him

522
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,860
if a princess was born in the imperial palace,

523
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,500
she would bring calamity to the state and people.

524
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,260
So...

525
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,160
Your Highness.

526
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,020
Maid.

527
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,740
I...

528
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,380
I'm afraid...

529
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,300
I'm afraid...

530
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,460
Her Highness is about to give birth.

531
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,420
Someone, help.

532
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,020
Someone, help.

533
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,340
Someone, help.

534
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,860
Bring some hot water. Hot water. Hurry up.

535
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,860
Sure. Towel.

536
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,420
Come on.

537
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,980
Imperial Concubine Xie is about to give birth.

538
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,660
Send someone to watch her.

539
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,420
Yes.

540
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,160
Your Highness,

541
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,340
it's a princess.

542
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,820
A princess.

543
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,340
Your Highness, something is wrong.

544
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,800
Eunuch Zhou is coming here with some guards.

545
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,900
What should we do?

546
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,820
We should hurry.

547
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,260
Let me hug my baby.

548
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,140
Maid,

549
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,100
hurry and escort the princess out of the imperial palace

550
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,180
and to the place of her uncle.

551
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,860
Ask him to save her anyway.

552
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,700
Yes, Your Highness.

553
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,710
The emperor is so cautious.

554
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,700
How could you go back?
