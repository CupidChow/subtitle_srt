[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,870
Dance of the Sky Empire

3
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,870
Episode 22

4
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,310
Master.

5
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,270
Did you hear

6
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,680
what Prince Mu said just now?

7
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,000
What is happening?

8
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,160
If I didn't guess wrong,

9
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,280
there is only one possibility.

10
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,550
What?

11
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,250
The Dragon Emperor.

12
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,610
The Dragon Emperor?

13
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,850
Impossible.

14
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,800
No to mention that the Dragon Emperor is still in the ice cocoon, not awake.

15
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,230
Even if he wakes up,

16
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,120
he is frank and upright

17
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,310
with indomitable spirit.

18
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,510
How could he do such cruel things?

19
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,400
Of course he wouldn't do it.

20
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,190
It's his demon spirit that did it.

21
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,030
Demon spirit?

22
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,110
Last time you attempted to open the Secret Realm to save the Dragon Emperor,

23
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,440
the ice cocoon cracked.

24
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,600
His soul came out finding the demon spirit

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,550
and regarded it as his master.

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,440
Soul?

27
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,800
Where is the demon spirit now?

28
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,930
My master said he didn't know it, either.

29
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,240
But he said

30
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,780
the demon spirit was as powerful as the Dragon Emperor.

31
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,600
Ordinary people

32
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,000
can't deal with it.

33
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,470
Eventually I got you.

34
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,960
With your guard,

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,670
I won't be afraid of

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,160
Long Wei'er

37
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,470
and Li Xuan anymore.

38
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,630
Your Highness.

39
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,520
How are you?

40
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,160
Who are you?

41
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,579
Your Highness.

42
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,000
You…

43
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,910
I'm Xiao Fengming.

44
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,360
I show my respect to you, Your Highness.

45
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,750
We have seen each other before.

46
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,880
You're from Moyun Ancient Academy, right?

47
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,320
How bold you are!

48
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,360
How dare you break into my resting place without notice?

49
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,000
Do you plan to kill me?

50
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,970
Your Highness. You're mistaken.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,550
Just now I took action

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,670
to check

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,390
your carefully chosen guards.

54
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,320
As you can see,

55
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,800
they're too weak to stand a fight.

56
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,040
It seems that they are not able to ensure your safety.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,760
What do you want to do?

58
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,270
Of course I come here

59
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,160
to be your follower.

60
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,720
You?

61
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,070
Don't you believe my power?

62
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,640
Your Highness.

63
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,920
He went inside just like without resistance

64
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,270
and easily killed

65
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,920
the six superiors that you carefully chose.

66
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,600
He can't be an ordinary person.

67
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,270
You're just in need of useful people now.

68
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,070
Your Highness,

69
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,600
you'd better keep him here.

70
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,390
Do I need your notice?

71
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,070
Since young master spoke for you,

72
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,440
Xiao Fengming.

73
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,230
Turn back.

74
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,920
Yes.

75
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,790
This is exactly what I want.

76
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,620
Your Highness.

77
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,640
In the library,

78
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,760
I found all these records

79
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,070
about the battle between the Kunwu clan and human clan.

80
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,470
I have gone through them,

81
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,950
finding the records of Princess Qingsheng

82
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,480
are in these books.

83
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,690
Your Highness.

84
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,480
Why are you so interested in

85
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,960
Princess Qingsheng?

86
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,060
Is it because of this belt?

87
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,230
Maybe this is the photo

88
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,730
of Princess Qingsheng, the princess of the Kunwu clan.

89
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,370
Since it is Princess Qingsheng's photo,

90
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,670
why could it appear

91
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,140
in the study of the general of human clan?

92
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,070
According to the steward of Li Family,

93
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,880
it's not

94
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,640
General Li's favorite,

95
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,950
which shows

96
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,550
he seldom enjoyed it in public.

97
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
Look at

98
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,200
its wear.

99
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,270
It's very old and broken.

100
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,270
It should have been frequently enjoyed.

101
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,480
But the steward never saw General Li watch it.

102
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,070
It suggests that

103
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,850
this photo is a secret that General Li wanted to hide.

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,000
You mean

105
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,960
General Li fell in love with Princess Qingsheng?

106
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,040
You can also think that

107
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,920
General Li fell in love with Princess Qingsheng

108
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,760
and painted this photo for her.

109
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,810
No wonder General Li never allowed Li Xuan

110
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,810
to ask anything about his mother.

111
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,950
You mean

112
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,200
Li Xuan's mother is…

113
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,510
I'm not sure.

114
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,480
According to the

115
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,200
sudden power that Li Xuan had

116
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,880
and the fact that

117
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,320
he was appointed nation-protecting master by Lord Zi,

118
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,350
don't you think it's very strange?

119
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,950
So

120
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,230
if Li Xuan was

121
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,920
the son of General Li and Princess Qingsheng,

122
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,600
he would also belong to the Kunwu clan.

123
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,510
What?

124
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,860
Look at this sentence.

125
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,159
With the blood of Qingsheng,

126
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,280
Lord Zi sealed the Dragon Emperor.

127
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,630
No wonder Li Xuan lost the memory of his childhood.

128
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,200
If I were Lord Zi,

129
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,550
I wouldn't let him know the truth, either.

130
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,780
Your Highness.

131
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,050
The city gate is ahead.

132
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,410
Lord Zi has set a ward here.

133
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,270
We can only break through it.

134
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm going there to distract their attention.

135
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,610
You just run through the gate in chaos.

136
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,400
Brother.

137
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,909
Brother.

138
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,520
Yunshan.

139
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,080
Finally I find you.

140
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,710
I have sent to people to look for you.

141
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,640
Are you injured?

142
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,970
Your Highness.

143
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,400
We're going back to the State of Sha.

144
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,260
Since you come.

145
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,660
let's leave the State of Tianqi together

146
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,790
to the State of Sha.

147
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,280
Yunshan.

148
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,030
Su Youlian.

149
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,280
Be Quiet.

150
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,110
Why are you together?

151
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
You're wanted all over the city now.

152
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,590
It's a long story.

153
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,820
Let's leave first.

154
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,320
What's wrong?

155
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,760
Hurry up!

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,960
This way!

157
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,850
Quickly.

158
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,150
We're schoolmates.

159
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,280
How could you

160
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,840
leave without saying goodbye?

161
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,760
Catch them.

162
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,520
Finally,

163
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,760
we can't avoid this situation.

164
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,350
Take it.

165
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,280
No matter what happens, don't loose your hand.

166
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,590
Youlian.

167
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,790
Remember.

168
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,200
Live a good life outside.

169
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,530
What are you saying?

170
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,400
I can't get out.

171
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,150
Yet

172
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,720
I'll stay here missing you all the time.

173
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,440
I'll miss you all the time.

174
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,520
Li Xuan.

175
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,640
I can let you go this time

176
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,280
because I still love you.

177
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,710
No.

178
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,109
From now on,

179
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,430
there is only enmity between us.

180
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,230
Don't let me see you again.

181
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,920
Otherwise I will kill you.

182
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,430
Li Xuan.

183
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,760
You're guilty.

184
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,830
If you keep stopping us catching the siren,

185
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,070
you'll be killed.

186
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,520
Youlian.

187
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,920
Youlian.

188
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,070
I'm sorry.

189
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,710
I'm late.

190
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,650
You just let go of her like this?

191
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,880
Li Xuan.

192
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Li Xuan.

193
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,430
Li Xuan.

194
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,160
Li Xuan.

195
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,590
Is what you said true?

196
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
Your Majesty.

197
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,470
It's totally true.

198
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,190
Li Xuan and the second prince

199
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,120
could have killed the Kunwu siren,

200
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,680
but they didn't do so.

201
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,350
Li Xuan even beat some of the soldiers

202
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,340
to stop us catching the siren.

203
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,590
Darned!

204
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,740
I know it's very important

205
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,190
and should be taken seriously,

206
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,320
so I came back before the second prince

207
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,760
to tell you about it.

208
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,560
Father.

209
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,520
Now I finally see through

210
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,680
my younger brother's thought.

211
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,470
What's his thought?

212
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,950
Tell me.

213
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,560
He tried his best to protect Li Xuan in front of you.

214
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,920
It seems that he intended to search and arrest the Kunwu siren.

215
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,470
In fact, together with Li Xuan,

216
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,000
he colluded with the Kunwu siren

217
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,350
to make a chaos.

218
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,760
Don't bullshit!

219
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,110
Is the state of chaos

220
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,170
beneficial to your younger brother?

221
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,230
Father, you're wise and brilliant.

222
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,230
Can't you see through

223
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,500
my younger brother's intention?

224
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,880
If it's a state of chaos,

225
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,560
it's certain that you can't deal with many things at the same time.

226
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,310
Then

227
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,070
he will have a chance.

228
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,310
You mean

229
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,880
he dares to covet my throne, right?

230
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,070
Beyond my expectation,

231
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,190
he even has such an intention.

232
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,400
Yet

233
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,190
what is suspicious is that

234
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,590
it was my younger brother and Li Xuan

235
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,060
who took the Kunwu siren to go in and out of the Secret Realm.

236
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,920
Send my order

237
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,880
to search and arrest them all over the city.

238
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,710
Choose a day

239
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,160
to kill Li Xuan

240
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,950
and Long Wei'er.

241
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,400
I'll follow your order.

242
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,520
Li Xuan.

243
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,590
Li Xuan. You're awake.

244
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,760
Where am I?

245
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,350
In the Academy. In your room.

246
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,400
Hmm.

247
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,590
Li Xuan.

248
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,800
It's not my intention

249
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,310
to break off our engagement.

250
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,160
No need to say.

251
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,880
It's meaningless.

252
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,800
But I…

253
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,040
Sister.

254
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,400
He is very weak now.

255
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,720
It's not the right time to talk about it.

256
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,160
you’re right

257
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,680
Who's that?

258
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,230
According to Lord Li's order,

259
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,520
if Li Xuan wakes up,

260
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,160
ask him to go to the back yard.

261
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,020
He has something to talk with him.

262
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,070
Ok. I see.

263
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
You can leave now.

264
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,920
It's my fault.

265
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,230
It's up to you to punish me.

266
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,470
Li Xuan.

267
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,470
Since you were young, you've been brought up in the city,

268
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,670
innocent and simple,

269
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,490
knowing nothing of cheating.

270
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,560
The Kunwu siren is tricky.

271
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,430
It's certain that you can't deal with her.

272
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,200
It's good that the Dragon Emperor hasn't woken up

273
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,430
and you didn't cause serious trouble.

274
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,710
But you can't stay in

275
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,750
Moyun Ancient Academy anymore.

276
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,430
Li Xuan.

277
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,880
From now on,

278
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,240
you're expelled from Moyun Ancient Academy.

279
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,920
From now on,

280
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,520
I'm not your master.

281
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,430
You're not my apprentice.

282
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,800
Master.

283
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,660
Leave here.

284
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
Leave now.

285
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,650
The farther you go, the better.

286
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,170
Master. Take care.

287
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,070
Li Xuan.

288
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,760
Teach him.

289
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:50,830
Li Xuan.

290
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,950
Teach him.

291
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,520
Don't come over.

292
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,350
Watch out.

293
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,310
Li Xuan is so merciless.

294
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,210
Unexpectedly, he hurt her so seriously.

295
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,830
Li Xuan.

296
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,040
Li Xuan.

297
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,640
Xuan.

298
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,950
Really it's you.

299
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,710
Bullshit.

300
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,080
Of course we are real.

301
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,620
I've heard of General Li's death.

302
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,920
Since the mishap in the Academy,

303
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,310
Changqing and I have been cooped up.

304
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,710
You are implicated by me.

305
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,040
Nonsense.

306
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,950
Hmm.

307
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,330
I won't get you involved anymore.

308
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,690
What do you mean?

309
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,800
I have been expelled from the Academy.

310
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,680
Since it is so,

311
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,350
Changqing and I won't stay in the Academy , either.

312
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,280
Wherever you go, we'll follow you.

313
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,230
Whether to look for the Kunwu siren to fight with her

314
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,830
or revenge for the dead fellows and General Li,

315
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,310
it's up to you.

316
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,210
We've something more important to do now.

317
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,280
What's it?

318
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,310
Go to find Long Wei'er.

319
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,200
Grand guard,

320
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,590
what's up?

321
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,520
Long Wei'er.

322
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,890
Listen to the order.

323
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,920
The second prince Long Wei'er

324
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,470
colluded with the traitor Li Xuan

325
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,680
to cheat His Majesty

326
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,640
and let go of the Kunwu clan

327
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,640
in the name of atoning for his crimes

328
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,680
regardless of the safety of His Majesty and all the common people.

329
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,920
His crimes are too wicked to be pardoned.

330
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,680
[Imperial Edict]

331
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,280
From today,

332
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,520
put him into prison

333
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,480
and choose a day to kill him.

334
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,070
Kill me?

335
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,560
Is it true that my father will kill me?

336
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,880
Not only you,

337
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,560
His Majesty has ordered

338
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,070
to search and arrest Li Xuan all over the city.

339
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,530
I am confident that he will be arrested soon.

340
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,000
Then

341
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,070
you won't be lonely

342
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,950
to meet your doom.

343
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,140
Take them away.

344
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,280
Take care.

345
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,190
Be careful.

346
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,840
Quickly.

347
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,160
Search carefully.

348
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,000
What's wrong?

349
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Li Xuan.

350
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,520
Stop.

351
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,950
Who are you?

352
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,710
How dare you break in the Academy without notice

353
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,970
and search so noisily?

354
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,800
Under the order of His Majesty,

355
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,560
we're here to catch the traitor Li Xuan.

356
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,470
You must cooperate with us well.

357
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,430
Li Xuan…

358
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,310
Li Xuan is not in the Academy.

359
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,000
Really?

360
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,540
If you don't believe me, you can ask them.

361
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,640
She is right.

362
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,950
Since the mishap in the Academy,

363
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,770
Li Xuan hasn't appeared here.

364
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,090
What about you?

365
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,880
Li Xuan.

366
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,190
No. No.

367
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:16,920
We haven't seen him.

368
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,710
We haven't seen him.

369
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,110
Even so, we still need to search here.

370
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,110
Who knows if you are shielding him?

371
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,430
Who dares?

372
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,470
This is Moyun Ancient Academy.

373
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:27,070
How could you be qualified to search at random?

374
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,920
Lord Zi reseal the Moon-fall Formation

375
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,040
with his spiritual power was injured,

376
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,800
he is devoting himself to cultivation.

377
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,920
You search the Academy so noisily.

378
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,880
Don't you be afraid to disturb Lord Zi?

379
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,190
If anything goes wrong,

380
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,400
who can bear the responsibility?

381
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,560
[order]

382
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,960
Do you want to defy His Majesty?

383
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,430
Go to search the front yard.

384
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,000
Yes.

385
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,590
Go with me.

386
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,190
Yes.

387
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,370
Go to the back yard.

388
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Get out of the way.

389
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,680
Search.

390
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,430
Yanran.

391
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,710
Go to inform Changqing.

392
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,680
Li Xuan. Hurry up.

393
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,800
Hide somewhere.

394
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,800
Why?

395
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,190
His Majesty sent people to arrest you.

396
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,310
You're said to be killed.

397
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,190
What?

398
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,370
What about Long Wei'er?

399
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,640
He has been put into prison

400
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,430
and will be killed tomorrow.

401
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,560
What's wrong with His Majesty?

402
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,310
Unexpectedly, he will kill his own son.

403
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,430
Ignore them.

404
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,110
Li Xuan.

405
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,830
Find somewhere to hide quickly.

406
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,160
My elder sister is stalling time.

407
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,690
I'm afraid it won't be long.

408
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,190
There are some people there. Go with me.

409
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,720
Quickly.

410
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,690
Gosh. They're coming.

411
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,560
Hide quickly.

412
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,110
Quickly.

413
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,280
You…

414
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,960
Have you seen Li Xuan?

415
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,310
Of course.

416
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,230
Just as expected, he hid in the Academy.

417
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,880
Tell me

418
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,880
where he is.

419
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,670
Where is he?

420
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,360
He seems to be in the library.

421
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,040
No no no.

422
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,199
He seems to be in the canteen.

423
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,520
No.

424
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,670
Brat.

425
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,080
You trick me!

426
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,760
I didn't.

427
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,800
I'm helping you.

428
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,280
Team one.

429
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:29,960
Go there.

430
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,389
Yes.

431
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,320
Team two.

432
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,090
Go there.

433
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,870
Yes.

434
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,150
You…

435
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,800
How dare you stop me?

436
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,000
So what?

437
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,630
How bold!

438
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,800
Who acts so wildly here?

439
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Nice to see you, Lord Zi.

440
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,520
You want to catch someone in the Academy without notice, right?

441
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,430
I dare not.

442
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,870
Since so,

443
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,610
why not go away quickly?

444
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,950
Let's go.

445
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,280
Go.

446
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,980
Your Highness.

447
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,150
We would rather risk our life to fight with them

448
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,430
to get out of the prison

449
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,470
than sit here waiting for death.

450
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,630
It's strictly guarded.

451
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,870
Do you think we can risk our life

452
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,150
to escape?

453
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,170
It's better than sit here waiting for death.

454
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,870
I'm afraid His Majesty

455
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,070
has made up his mind to kill me this time.

456
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,850
It's not the first time that

457
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,470
he has intended to kill me.

458
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,600
Li Xuan is to blame.

459
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,150
If you hadn't saved him,

460
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,720
you wouldn't have been in such situation.

461
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,930
If we didn't have this experience,

462
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,170
I wouldn't know that

463
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,990
you're afraid to die so much.

464
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,520
I'm not afraid to die.

465
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,630
You still have many great goals unrealized.

466
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,560
I just think

467
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,080
it's not worth losing your life for Li Xuan.

468
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,320
I don't think so.

469
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,450
Since I want to make him convinced,

470
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,000
I must pay a price.

471
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,360
You're awake.

472
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,090
Youlian. You're awake.

473
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,120
Yunshan.

474
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,520
Where are we?

475
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,710
We have been out of the city.

476
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,080
Finally you wake up.

477
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,320
If you're still unconscious,

478
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
my brother will be worried to death.

479
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,040
Youlian is awake.

480
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,200
Are you feeling better?

481
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,860
This is made by the herbs that I found out of the city.

482
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,280
Drink it.

483
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
Thank you.

484
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,000
I won't disturb you anymore.

485
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,450
Enjoy your talk.

486
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,080
Wait a moment.

487
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,220
Batou said that

488
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,590
you have something to

489
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,800
tell me.

490
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,280
What's up?

491
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,710
Is there anything going wrong?

492
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,220
Your Highness.

493
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,360
You suffered.

494
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,120
I'm OK.

495
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,150
How is my mother?

496
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,280
Take it easy. Your Highness.

497
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,600
Before you came to the palace,

498
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,330
according to your order, I have

499
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,430
carried Her Highness out of the palace.

500
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,230
Now

501
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,040
Her highness is worried about your safety.

502
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,560
Everything goes on well.

503
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,630
Do you have a way to escape?

504
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,800
Don't worry.

505
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,780
Since I have make myself come to this prison,

506
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,430
I have a way to escape.

507
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,520
So

508
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:38,440
all the dead in the Academy were killed by Xiao Fengming, right?

509
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,280
No.

510
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,560
It's not him.

511
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,040
He can't bear to crush an ant.

512
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,130
How could he kill his fellows?

513
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,760
Indeed it's not him.

514
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,970
It's the Dragon Emperor's demon spirit.

515
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,280
The Dragon Emperor?

516
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,630
Demon spirit?

517
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,670
I don't know about the Dragon Emperor

518
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,870
and the demon spirit.

519
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,250
Since you know them,

520
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,080
do you have a way to save him?

521
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,600
My master said

522
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,190
the demon spirit of the Dragon Emperor was very powerful.

523
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,950
The only way to deal with it

524
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,530
is to save the Dragon Emperor.

525
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,150
As long as the Dragon Emperor is woken up,

526
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,520
the demon spirit has to go back to his body.

527
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,120
Xiao Fengming will have freedom again.

528
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,120
Then how to save the Dragon Emperor?

529
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,910
Let me out.

530
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,840
Let me out.

531
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,080
Let me out.

532
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,430
Demon spirit.

533
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Did you hear me?

534
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,560
Let me out.

535
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,120
Demon spirit.

536
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,670
Did you hear me?

537
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,430
Let me out.

538
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,470
Rubbish.

539
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,560
I just want to see you.

540
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,870
Tell me.

541
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,840
Why did you go to the royal palace?

542
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,360
What trouble will you make?

543
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,320
There's no harm to tell you.

544
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,870
Soon

545
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,190
the world will belong to me.

546
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,870
What?

547
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,840
Then

548
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,120
both the human clan

549
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,600
and the Kunwu clan

550
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,950
will be ruled by me.

551
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,000
I will become

552
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,330
the only master of this world,

553
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,870
the real master.

554
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,520
You worthless human clan

555
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,040
will all become nobody.

556
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,960
You want to kill His Majesty?

557
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,080
Crazy!

558
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,040
You're crazy!

559
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,710
You're crazy!

560
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,870
You're crazy!
