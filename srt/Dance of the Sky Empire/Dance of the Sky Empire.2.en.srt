00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,830
Dance of the sky Empire

2
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,830
Episode 2

3
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,310
Stop there.

4
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,590
What's it?

5
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
It's honey.

6
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,680
Why are you applying it on my face?

7
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,509
You'll get to know in a while.

8
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,970
Come on, behave yourself.

9
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,340
Don't dodge it.

10
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,080
Otherwise, I'll take off all of your clothes.

11
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Behave yourself.

12
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,440
Come on.

13
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,190
One more.

14
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,000
What are you doing?

15
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,829
Stop. Stop. Stop.

16
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:33,829
To be honest,

17
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,390
The last one who offended me

18
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,210
stuck out for two hours when I did this to him.

19
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,880
But in the end…

20
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,630
Take care.

21
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,880
What do you wanna do? Don't loosen your hands.

22
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,600
I won't.

23
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,960
I won't.

24
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,079
Enjoy it.

25
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,290
Where are you going?

26
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,520
Come back.

27
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,320
Come back.

28
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,470
Come back.

29
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,470
Is there anyone outside?

30
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,880
Xuanxuan,

31
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,270
you really are the number one ruffian in the Qingtian City.

32
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,270
You've figured out what a bad means.

33
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,310
I've got so many ways to make people suffer.

34
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,550
I guess that lady would

35
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,720
definitely be badly stung.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,600
What a pity

37
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,270
for her pretty face!

38
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,000
But I've also heard

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,360
someone died from bee venom.

40
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,320
I'm wondering whether the young lady

41
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
can survive this.

42
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,120
What's wrong?

43
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,550
I've something else to deal with. I'm leaving first.

44
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,360
Xuanxuan,

45
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,390
are…are you being softhearted?

46
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,550
That lady has made you fail to leave the town.

47
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,440
Do I look that softhearted?

48
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,250
Then why are you going back?

49
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,840
I wanna check the way she's badly stung.

50
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,660
That must be interesting.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,200
You can go back first.

52
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,000
Xuan…

53
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,070
What can I do?

54
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,230
Help.

55
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,440
Help.

56
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,000
In my opinion...

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,830
Help.

58
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,110
Who...

59
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,390
Who are they?

60
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Yeah.

61
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,440
What's going on? Why are they falling down?

62
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,720
It's…

63
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,480
What are they doing?

64
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,830
What's wrong with them?

65
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,760
It's so terrific.

66
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,510
Yeah.

67
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,640
They fall down without getting hurt.

68
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
Who's the lady?

69
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,650
Never seen her.

70
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,880
Isn't he the National Master?

71
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,720
The National Master.

72
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,250
What's wrong with his face?

73
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,480
Look at his face.

74
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
It's terrific.

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,200
Why did the face of Childe Li swell up?

76
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,230
What's going on?

77
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,400
He must have been stung by wasps.

78
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,640
Does he turn ugly?

79
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,480
It's mine.

80
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,320
You. Come here.

81
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,230
Thank you.

82
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,920
I failed to attend the examination of the Ancient Academy when I was young.

83
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,550
The young of this generation is so lucky.

84
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,230
It'll be lucky if they get admitted.

85
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,040
But there're lots of people

86
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,830
who fail the examination in seven or eight years.

87
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,720
Take it.

88
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,200
It's yours.

89
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,640
I arrived here early.

90
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,880
It's here.

91
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,280
Dragon Emperor,

92
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,450
I'll definitely help you out.

93
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,440
Take your name card.

94
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,820
Thank you, Mentor.

95
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,720
Where do you come from?

96
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,070
What's your name?

97
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,830
Porcelains.

98
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,670
Qinqi City.

99
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,210
Su Youlian from the Sus.

100
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,320
Where?

101
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,320
Qinqi City.

102
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,880
It's your name card.

103
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,159
Thanks, Mentor.

104
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,460
I've heard that

105
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,670
the ten-year term when the Dragon Emperor wakes up is about to come.

106
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,440
The surviving supporters of the Kunwu clan are ready to make trouble.

107
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
These surviving supporters are insignificant.

108
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,640
The Dragon Emperor used to be so powerful,

109
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,080
but he was still sealed by Lord Zi.

110
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,679
As I think,

111
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,350
if I meet those surviving supporters of the Kunwu clan,

112
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,400
I'll kill them all with no mercy.

113
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,409
Isn't this my defeated opponent?

114
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,400
How dare you come to attend the examination?

115
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,530
Aren't you afraid of

116
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,470
being beaten out of the arena by me?

117
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,280
I…

118
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,150
…I was defeated out of neglect yesterday,

119
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,840
which made you take advantages of me.

120
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,900
Wait and see how I will beat you later.

121
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,320
You're struggling like a dying duck.

122
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
I'll definitely beat you to fall on your knees begging for mercy.

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,790
You…

124
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,910
Sister, you're quarrelling with someone again.

125
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,150
She said I'm like a dying duck.

126
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,230
Sister.

127
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,840
Lady,

128
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,960
you're here for the examination.

129
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
You…

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,670
I'm…

131
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,760
I'm Sui Yanran.

132
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,740
What about you?

133
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,320
Su Youlian.

134
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,570
Don't be mad at my elder sister

135
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,000
about the thing happening that day.

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,030
It's her temper.

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,840
Yanran,

138
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,290
what're you doing?

139
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,080
Come here.

140
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,910
Come here.

141
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,150
I'm leaving.

142
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,710
Sister.

143
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,590
He‘s the one who sealed the Dragon Emperor away.

144
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,110
and killed my sister.

145
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,590
Lord Zi,

146
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,640
Long Wei'er is coming.

147
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,520
Why is he coming?

148
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,000
Maybe it's because the ten-year time limit is about to expire.

149
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,230
And he wants to offer some help.

150
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,560
What a handsome childe!

151
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,640
How delicate he is!

152
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,650
I seem not to have seen him before.

153
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,880
Where's he from?

154
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,690
Where's Li Xuan?

155
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,790
Why isn't he here?

156
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,080
Don't worry, Lord Zi.

157
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Li Xuan is always naughty,

158
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,630
but he'll definitely appear

159
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,200
on the important enrollment date of

160
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,530
Moyun Ancient Academy.

161
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,080
Okay.

162
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,280
Let's begin.

163
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,200
Sure.

164
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,520
Does it begin?

165
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,370
Yes, it does.

166
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,590
Quick. Quick. Quick quick. Come on. Let's go.

167
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,550
It begins.

168
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,570
Yeah. Yeah. Come on. Let's hurry.

169
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,550
Don't be nervous. Come on. It's about to begin.

170
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,550
It begins.

171
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,000
What will the topic be?

172
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,030
Yeah.

173
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,760
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,440
I'm late for the examination.

175
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,500
Please forgive me, Mentors in Chief.

176
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
How dare he arrive here so late?

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,460
-How can it happen?
-Yeah.

178
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,350
He's gone too far.

179
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,680
-He's gone too far.
-He has.

180
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,080
Be quiet, everyone.

181
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,550
Examinees,

182
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,670
as you all know,

183
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,880
the fight between our Clan of Human Being and the Kunwu clan that year,

184
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,610
the Clan of Kunwu was defeated.

185
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,470
The Saintess put a curse that the Dragon Emperor would definitely wake up

186
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,840
while the Clan of Human Being would be annihilated.

187
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,760
Now,

188
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,630
the ten-year time limit is about to expire.

189
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,610
Our Moyun Ancient Academy,

190
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,000
as the number one academy of Tianqi,

191
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,670
it's our inescapable responsibility to

192
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,320
fight against Kunwu.

193
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,040
There's only one goal

194
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,590
for the examination,

195
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,110
which is to select the elite.

196
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,230
Those who can be admitted by our academy

197
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,880
are pillars who will be entrusted with

198
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,110
the important mission by the State of Tianqi.

199
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,880
Next,

200
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,170
I am about to announce the rules of the selection.

201
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,080
All the applied examinees

202
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,030
will join the one-to-one group battle.

203
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,470
The winners can go to the second round.

204
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,960
The twenty examinees who can stay until the very last

205
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,570
will be the newly admitted apprentices of the Moyun Ancient Academy.

206
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,030
Besides,

207
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,400
the top twenty examinees

208
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,690
are able to get a chance to challenge the Nation-protecting Master

209
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,110
for the first prize.

210
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,470
The winner will be awarded with a number one token,

211
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,910
and allowed to

212
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,080
go to each place of the academy without any restraint.

213
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,770
Mentor in Chief, I have a question.

214
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,470
Each place of the academy,

215
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,320
is the Mysterious Land included?

216
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,400
Of course.

217
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,350
I have another one.

218
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,200
Can the one who gets the number one token

219
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,790
cultivate the magic arts

220
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,290
in the Mysterious Land?

221
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,640
Of course.

222
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,400
That's awesome.

223
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,590
That's great.

224
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,230
-But can I win?
-Cheer up.

225
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,320
It's too hard.

226
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,450
If I'm able to get the number one token,

227
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,520
doesn't it mean I can get into the Mysterious Land to

228
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,440
remove the seal on the Dragon Emperor?

229
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,110
Okay.

230
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,880
I'm about to announce

231
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,670
the examination begins.

232
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,320
Great. Great. Great.

233
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,670
Great.

234
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,730
Let's start.

235
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,210
I have no weapon with me.

236
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,090
Otherwise, you might say I will bully you.

237
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
I'm thumping you.

238
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,960
Perfect.

239
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,510
Young Master.

240
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,440
Young Master.

241
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,840
It's time to get up.

242
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,080
Young Master.

243
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,240
Young Master,

244
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,470
it's time to go to the Ancient Academy.

245
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,280
I'm not going.

246
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,960
Young Master,

247
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,470
Master…

248
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,350
…Master is getting angry.

249
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,550
Why is he getting angry?

250
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,200
What's going on?

251
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,030
What's it?

252
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,550
Help.

253
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,070
Help.

254
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,590
Are you my biological father?

255
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,849
I'm going there.

256
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,589
I promise.

257
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,710
Great.

258
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,349
Bravo.

259
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,190
Bravo.

260
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,550
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

261
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,160
-It's perfect.
-It's great.

262
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,760
Why doesn't he fight back?

263
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
He's just dodging

264
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,600
He's running.

265
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,970
He's dodged the attack.

266
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,520
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

267
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,430
I win.

268
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,840
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

269
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,830
Everyone,

270
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,290
ones who're standing here

271
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,680
are the top twenty of the arena challenge.

272
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,920
I congratulate you

273
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,160
on passing the examination of the Academy.

274
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,830
You're admitted to have further study

275
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,230
in the Academy.

276
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,700
It's great.

277
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,600
It's awesome.

278
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,400
I make it, finally.

279
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,190
Yeah.

280
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,590
Getting admitted by the Academy

281
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,400
means you have to start from the very beginning.

282
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,000
In the future, not only I

283
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
but other mentors

284
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,190
will offer you the strict training

285
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,350
that you've never received before

286
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,000
to ensure everyone here

287
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,920
will be able to become the real pillars of the Empire State of Tianqi.

288
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,230
Are you clear?

289
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,880
-Yes, we're.
-Yes, we're.

290
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,280
Okay.

291
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,680
Tomorrow,

292
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,640
we will hold a welcome party for you.

293
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,110
The Crown Prince will also come to meet

294
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,830
you, the prospective pillars of Tianqi, in person.

295
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,820
Youlian, everyone has got admitted.

296
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,880
But why don't you

297
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,950
look happy?

298
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,240
Mentor in Chief,

299
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,230
I wanna challenge the Nation-protecting Master.

300
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,310
It's Li Xuan.

301
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,480
Young Master.

302
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,230
Xuanxuan.

303
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,060
Unfasten the rope.

304
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,330
You're amazing.

305
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,430
How you appear is really unique.

306
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,480
Hurry to unfasten it.

307
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:45,890
Be careful.

308
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,860
Are you okay? Are you okay?

309
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,570
I wanna challenge you.

310
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,560
How come it's you again?

311
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,040
You wanna challenge me?

312
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,400
You have a number one token.

313
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,310
I want it too.

314
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,640
You mean this?

315
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,110
Take it.

316
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,690
Take it. Don't feel embarrassed.

317
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,520
Freshmen.

318
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,400
Freshmen. Freshmen.

319
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,040
There's an emergency happening to the Academy.

320
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,400
I have to deal with it now.

321
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,710
So today's

322
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,350
examination ends.

323
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,160
Nation-protecting Master, Li Xuan

324
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,430
will hold the number one token.

325
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,560
How could it be?

326
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,240
Dismiss.

327
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,070
Yeah.

328
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,800
What?

329
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,060
It belongs to me again?

330
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
It does.

331
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,860
How could it be?

332
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,430
Why?

333
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,230
-Why?
-Yeah.

334
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,310
Thank you. I'm honored. I'm honored.

335
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,710
Don't envy me too much.

336
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,050
I'm honored. I'm honored.

337
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,230
Old bastard.

338
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,250
Let's go. Let's go.

339
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,230
How could it happen?

340
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,920
Go. Go. Go.

341
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,110
Go. Go. Go.

342
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,160
It's disgusting.

343
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,880
Let's go.

344
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,740
The Moyun Ancient Academy is the top one in the State of Tianqi.

345
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,680
When the drums in in the morning and the bells in the evening sound,

346
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,610
everyone should go to the training ground to sign in.

347
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,280
When the bells sound during 7 to 9 a.m.,

348
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,830
everyone should go to the Justice Hall to have the class of spiritual cultivation.

349
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,110
No one is allowed to be late.

350
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,070
Are you clear?

351
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,760
Yes, we are

352
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,520
I'm about to arrange the dorms for you.

353
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,350
If you have any question, feel free to ask now.

354
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,040
Mentor,

355
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,800
I'm not used to getting close with anyone else.

356
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,590
The room in the east end is remote and quiet.

357
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,520
It's good for me.

358
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,560
I want that one.

359
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,070
Great.

360
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,430
You're sick.

361
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,040
I suggest,

362
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,950
it's necessary to allow me

363
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,710
to live close to female apprentices.

364
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,160
Because I worry about them.

365
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,280
In case there's something dangerous happening to them,

366
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,640
I'll be able to protect

367
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,860
them immediately.

368
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,040
Right. Right. Right.

369
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,970
As school mates,

370
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,510
we're supposed to take care of one another.

371
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,010
What dangerous can happen in the Academy?

372
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
As I can see,

373
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,930
you are the ones who are dangerous.

374
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,940
Fine. Fine.

375
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,330
Stop being garrulous.

376
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,400
I'm about to arrange your dorms.

377
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,200
Xiao Fengming

378
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,280
goes to the first room in the west.

379
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,880
Okay.

380
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,800
Li Xuan

381
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,800
goes to the second room in the west.

382
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,680
The first room in the south is a bigger one,

383
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,070
siblings from the Cuis can have it,

384
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,830
as well as Su Youlian.

385
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,030
It's great, Youlian.

386
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,680
We can live together.

387
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,400
Oops.

388
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,190
If I live with them,

389
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,520
my identity will be easily exposed.

390
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,280
Mentor,

391
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,560
I…

392
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,680
…I don't like to live with others.

393
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,640
Why?

394
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,950
Yeah, why?

395
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,420
Why aren't you willing to live with them?

396
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,310
I get it.

397
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,880
You snore,

398
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,970
grind your teeth

399
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,970
and talk in your sleep, don't you?

400
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,440
Your feet must be smelly.

401
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,960
He's right, Mentor.

402
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,310
Here's your place.

403
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,190
Okay.

404
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,230
I get it, Senior Sister.

405
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,230
Well, your books.

406
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,070
Take them.

407
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:42,940
And the bag.

408
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,800
Thank you, Senior Sister.

409
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,350
Thank you, Senior Sister.

410
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,350
I'm leaving if there's nothing else.

411
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,950
Okay.

412
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,950
Thank you, Senior Sister.

413
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,350
Goodbye, Senior Sister.

414
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,800
Master.

415
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,190
Master.

416
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,410
Their Clan of Human Being is so unfair.

417
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,350
I fail to get the number one token.

418
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,920
As the thing goes,

419
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,360
we don't have to be urgent anymore.

420
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,470
Since you've been admitted by the Academy,

421
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,470
you should see how things are going.

422
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,710
You can kill Li Xuan,

423
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,590
and get his number one token, when necessary,

424
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,950
which is feasible.

425
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,000
But what's urgent

426
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,920
is to find the entrance of the Mysterious Land as soon as possible

427
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,580
and confirm the location of the Dragon Emperor.

428
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,220
I'll go investigate tonight.

429
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,000
To tell you the truth,

430
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,060
for the three of us,

431
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,290
the examination is

432
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,610
totally unnecessary.

433
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,070
You haven't seen

434
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,470
how great I fought

435
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,710
on the arena.

436
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,140
You haven't witnessed it.

437
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,710
What a pity! What a pity!

438
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,070
In the future,

439
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,560
I'm gonna be the boss of the Moyun Ancient Academy.

440
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,800
I'll protect you two.

441
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,280
You said,

442
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,950
who's gonna be the boss of the Academy just now?

443
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,950
You are. It's you.

444
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,280
It's you.

445
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,680
Changqing, to be honest,

446
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,070
you almost have broken my arm.

447
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,530
You have to invite me for a feast in the Baihua Mansion tonight.

448
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,430
Changqing,

449
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
have you just said

450
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,680
my master left the Ancient Academy?

451
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,400
Yep.

452
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,880
Lord Zi said he was about to go to the imperial palace.

453
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,160
It's my chance.

454
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,680
What else do you wanna do?

455
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,270
I'm going back first.

456
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,230
It's a shield

457
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,360
Does it really

458
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,770
mean only the number one token

459
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,490
can open the ward of the Mysterious Land?

460
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,400
Old bastard,

461
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,350
it's you who didn't allow me to go out of the town.

462
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,880
I'll make you pay the price.

463
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,230
I'll give you all.

464
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,290
The old guy is coming back.

465
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,520
You.

466
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,190
My little dear golden fish,

467
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,590
why are you jumping out of the fish tank?

468
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,560
It's really so easy for enemies to meet.

469
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,800
I allow you to take advantages of me,

470
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,360
but see how you're acting.

471
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:27,730
The ground is too cold.

472
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,770
Don't jump out of the tank anymore.

473
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,760
Brat,

474
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,630
don't hide in the wardrobe.

475
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,320
Come out.

476
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,320
I know you're in it.

477
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,520
Get out of it.

478
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,710
Master, are you looking for me?

479
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,389
Tell me,

480
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,780
why do you hide in my wardrobe?

481
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,320
Do you wanna do anything bad

482
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,560
to my clothes again?

483
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,000
Why shall I, Master?

484
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,560
I'm caring for your daily routine

485
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,000
and basic necessities of life.

486
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,190
I specially stayed in your wardrobe

487
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,000
and observed it

488
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,130
for a while just now.

489
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,670
Well, I feel relieved.

490
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,150
The clothes are fine

491
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,950
without bites of moths and mice.

492
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,630
You're caring for my basic necessities of life?

493
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,560
Are you kidding me?

494
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,080
I know you well, don't I?

495
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,910
You could have made a mess, couldn't you?

496
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,520
Let me have a check.

497
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,520
Why are you hindering in my way?

498
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,000
Move.

499
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:20,710
Move away. Move away.

500
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,630
I'm not hindering you.

501
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,040
I wanna tell you.

502
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,360
Yeah,

503
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,580
it's that curtain.

504
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,530
The curtain?

505
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,120
It's it.

506
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,840
I'm getting angrier and angrier when I'm looking at it.

507
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,670
I don't know who did its color blending.

508
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,870
It looks rustic and tacky,

509
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,070
which doesn't match your temperament.

510
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,870
Your words make sense.

511
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,300
I'll ask someone to replace it tomorrow.

512
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,950
You brat,

513
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,470
don't distract me.

514
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,360
You must have done something bad to my clothes.

515
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,150
I have to check on them.

516
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,640
I have done nothing, Master.

517
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,000
Why are you hugging me?

518
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,480
I've witnessed how hard

519
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,760
you've been working day and night for us

520
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,710
in the Moyun Ancient Academy.

521
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,630
I think you've lost some of your weight. I worry about you.

522
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,360
Whether I've lost the weight has nothing to do with you.

523
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,120
Let me go.

524
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,230
I won't.

525
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,040
I won't.

526
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,230
Your left hand,

527
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,230
the right one.

528
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,670
What's wrong with me, Master?

529
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,930
Behave yourself here.

530
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,080
I have to check on them carefully.

531
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,840
Master,

532
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,520
you're suspecting me, aren't you?

533
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,710
You've hurt my feelings, Master.

534
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,470
Master,

535
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,670
you've hurt my feelings badly.

536
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,120
I care about you, but you treat me like this.

537
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,040
You're so…

538
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,910
Fine.

539
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,430
You tell me the truth.

540
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,280
Have you done anything to my tea?

541
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,430
Nope. It's not me.

542
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,120
It's not you?

543
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,810
Then who else could do that?

544
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,390
Nope. Master, don't…

545
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,600
…don't get mad at me, Master.

546
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,280
You should listen to my excuses.

547
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,940
Nope. Nope.

548
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,390
I mean explanations, Master.

549
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,150
No, nope.

550
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,290
I wanna have that pot of tea myself.

551
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
I've had all of mine.

552
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,080
Master,

553
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,470
I suffer from indigestion.

554
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,080
Master.

555
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,560
Master.

556
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,190
I'm wrong, Master.

557
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,450
Master. Master.

558
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,120
Don't punch me in the face. Don't punch me in the face.

559
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,800
You old bastard.

560
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,120
You've punched my face.

561
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,520
Old bastard.

562
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,710
Old bastard.

563
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,710
He

564
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,770
doesn't seem to be that annoying.

565
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:51,770
How is it going?

566
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,670
Have you found the location of the Dragon Emperor?

567
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,280
Yes.

568
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,320
But there's a ward.

569
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,430
I've tried several times to break it, but I failed.

570
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,560
It seems we could do nothing but get the number one token.

571
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,900
Have that old guy, Zi Ji, noticed you?

572
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,430
Like almost.

573
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,430
But…

574
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,710
But what?

575
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,840
Nothing.

576
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,280
Since I'm smart,

577
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,600
that old guy, Zi Ji,

578
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,040
hasn't noticed me.

579
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,430
It seems

580
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,040
we could only get what we want from Li Xuan.

581
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,000
He refused to have a fight with you.

582
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,950
Then we have to figure out something else.

583
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,080
I can't sit down. I can't.

584
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,480
Then lie on your stomach.

585
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,520
Young Master,

586
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,710
you can provoke anyone

587
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,910
except Lord Zi.

588
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,600
You mean,

589
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,470
have you ever survived him?

590
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,060
If it hadn't been because of that silly girl,

591
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,140
I would have let that old guy drink off the laxative.

592
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,760
That silly girl?

593
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,520
Forget it. Forget it.

594
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,560
You won't get it.

595
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,840
I'm going to heat up a pot of water for you.

596
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,320
You'll heal tomorrow.

597
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,670
That girl went to the place of Zi Ji

598
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,870
on the first day of the Academy.

599
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,890
What on earth does she want?

600
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,280
You mean, why did that silly girl

601
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,950
go to the place of the old guy?

602
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,320
Because of you.

603
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,760
Me?

604
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,390
All of us have witnessed

605
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,760
how Lord Zi was partial to you

606
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,360
in the examination.

607
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,000
It's reasonable she wanted to

608
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,120
release her anger.

609
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,190
Did she wanna pick on that old guy?

610
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,360
Li Xuan,

611
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,080
it's for you.

612
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,760
What's it?

613
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,360
Some delicious food specially made by my mother.

614
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,870
I can't eat up all, so I bring you some.

615
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,000
It looks good.

616
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,080
Cui Pianran.

617
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,760
What?

618
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,000
I've already had my meal.

619
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Bring it back.

620
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,560
What do you mean?

621
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,770
Nothing. I've already had enough.

622
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,800
You…

623
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,230
I'm sorry.

624
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,040
I didn't do it on purpose.

625
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,320
Haven't you seen him?

626
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
I'll clean it for you. I'll do it.

627
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,960
I'll clean it for you.

628
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,390
Thanks to my quick action,

629
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,920
my clothes aren't dirtied.

630
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,390
Why is it there?

631
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,900
What are you doing?

632
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,190
You clothes are have become dirty .

633
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,600
I clean it for you.

634
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,280
Do you have a thing for me?
