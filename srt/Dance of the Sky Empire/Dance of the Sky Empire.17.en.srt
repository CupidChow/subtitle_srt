2
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,900
Dance of the Sky Empire

3
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 17

4
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,380
Class is over.

5
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,140
Hurry up!

6
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,800
I'm coming.

7
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,900
Xuanxua. In my view,

8
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,060
you can marry the chick directly.

9
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,140
Anyhow you spent

10
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,780
last night together.

11
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,820
I have told you many times .

12
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,300
I was drunk.

13
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,300
Nothing happened between us.

14
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,100
You still can't forget Miss. Su?

15
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,060
Don't be silly, OK?

16
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,180
Have you forgotten that

17
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,420
she humiliated you in public

18
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,700
yesterday?

19
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,300
Besides,

20
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,980
today in the Justice Hall, I purposely mentioned that

21
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,980
you spent last night with the chick.

22
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,660
Guess what?

23
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,780
What did you say?

24
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,980
Totally nonsense.

25
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,900
I...

26
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,700
I have seen it by myself.

27
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,020
Why are you nervous?

28
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,340
Moreover,

29
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,910
I wanted to see Su Youlian's reaction.

30
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,660
Don't you want to know it?

31
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,520
Beyond your expectation,

32
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,660
she was poker-faced.

33
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,260
What's more,

34
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,660
she was intimate with Yu Fengmu instead.

35
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,720
Personally I think

36
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,780
she is not interested in you at all.

37
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,040
Just give up before it's too late.

38
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,740
I made it. I made it.

39
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,380
Stop throwing!

40
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,880
Just admit the defeat.

41
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,620
Aha!

42
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,150
Who is to treat tonight?

43
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,940
OK.

44
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,260
Even though you don't want to give up,

45
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,260
don't forget that

46
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,700
your marriage with the chick

47
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,500
was granted by His Majesty himself.

48
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,760
Do you want to defy him?

49
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,800
I know how to deal with the granted marriage.

50
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,980
Childe, you have the solution?

51
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,300
What's it?

52
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,860
What's the solution?

53
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,340
Unless he makes amazing contributions.

54
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,400
Have you finished?

55
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,300
What to finish?

56
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,840
I'm telling the truth.

57
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,460
Admit the defeat!

58
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,260
Long Wei'er has been back, right?

59
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,380
Yeah. What's up?

60
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,460
You want to fight the Kunwu clan with me?

61
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,520
Did I hear clearly?

62
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,260
Yeah.

63
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,580
It's so strange.

64
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,140
You used to be partial to the Kunwu clan

65
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,000
and didn't believe their stories

66
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,899
about we human clan being bullied by the Kunwu clan, right?

67
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,820
So I did.

68
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,700
But as the Nation-protecting Master,

69
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,100
beating the Kunwu clan

70
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,600
is my responsibility.

71
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,780
I don't think you aim to protect the human clan.

72
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,300
It's said that His Majesty gave you an order the other day.

73
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,150
Cut the crap.

74
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,560
Just tell me whether I can go with you.

75
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,190
I can agree with you.

76
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,140
But...

77
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,340
What?

78
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,380
Before setting off,

79
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,620
make sure to keep the purpose of this action a secret.

80
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,900
Don't let other students know it.

81
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,500
Why?

82
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,020
It's said that Cui Pianran is deeply attached to you.

83
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,950
If she knows that

84
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,620
you would rather go to fight against the Kunwu clan than marry her,

85
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,180
how would she face the situation?

86
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,300
I don't care what she thinks about.

87
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,230
I don't like her.

88
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,120
If I agree to marry her, it will be harmful to her.

89
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,940
You really think it thoroughly.

90
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,300
That's all.

91
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,700
Inform me before setting off.

92
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,460
Bye!

93
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,800
Your Highness.

94
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,940
Do you really plan to take Li Xuan to exterminate the Kunwu clan?

95
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
Why not?

96
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,020
He is always stubborn and disobedient.

97
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,020
I'm afraid he can't help do anything

98
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,500
but hinder us.

99
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,380
Then you really look down upon him.

100
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,980
Anyone chosen by Lord Zi

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,860
won't be ordinary!

102
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,700
Today I help him,

103
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,200
then he owes me a favor.

104
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,220
Later if we need his help,

105
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,159
naturally he won't refuse it.

106
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,060
Your Highness. You're really considerate.

107
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,940
By the way,

108
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,940
Li Xuan has joined us.

109
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,780
What about Su Youlian?

110
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,659
Perform as planned.

111
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,380
Yes.

112
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,540
Why do they let us get up so early?

113
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,300
What's wrong?

114
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,620
Why are we called to gather

115
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,620
in the early morning?

116
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,500
I don't know.

117
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,020
Last night Mento in Chief Xie just told us

118
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,300
to gather in the morning

119
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,560
but said nothing else.

120
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,740
Do you know why? Youlian.

121
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,310
Maybe we will have a new course.

122
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,860
Everyone, attention!

123
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,820
This action is under the command of me.

124
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,500
Bainian.

125
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,460
Set off.

126
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,820
Excuse me.

127
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,560
My sister hasn't come yet.

128
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,659
It's urgent. No need to wait her.

129
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,460
Let's set off.

130
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,820
Long Wei'er.

131
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,670
Didn't you ask me

132
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,740
not to tell this action to others?

133
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,580
I don't allow you to tell it to others

134
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,340
in case that the action plan is revealed in advance.

135
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,660
Ten years' time is up.

136
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,300
There are informers  of the Kunwu clan everywhere in the city.

137
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,220
If the information is revealed from the Academy,

138
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,660
we will return without accomplishing anything.

139
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,100
As for the reason why I take all the students,

140
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,060
naturally because we are classmates,

141
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,180
I don't want anyone to miss this chance

142
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,620
to make contributions.

143
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,659
Are you so kind?

144
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,750
I know what you are thinking about.

145
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,720
You suspect of Su Youlian, right?

146
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,180
Don't you want to know the truth?

147
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,540
I have known the truth.

148
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,300
Listen.

149
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,300
No matter what you've prepared,

150
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,150
I won't let you hurt her.

151
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,460
Where is

152
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,300
Long Wei'er?

153
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,360
Could it be that she has something else to do?

154
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,480
Your Highness.

155
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,419
The Red Character Army has assembled.

156
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,620
We are waiting for your order to set off.

157
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,220
Exterminate the Kunwu clan!

158
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,220
Exterminate the Kunwu clan!

159
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,940
What's the meaning?

160
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,220
Set off.

161
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,820
Attention!

162
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,260
Turn Left.

163
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,180
Set off.

164
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,260
Calm down

165
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,190
in case you are recognized.

166
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,860
They are going to....

167
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,430
They are going to...

168
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,040
You are the only hope of your clan.

169
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,310
Don't make any trouble.

170
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,820
You can only see the smile of the new comer,

171
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,460
ignoring my cry.

172
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,820
Once a woman changes her mind,

173
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,100
it's extremely hard for her to return.

174
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,580
Can't you talk less?

175
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,060
I didn't say anything wrong.

176
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,940
They are intimate with each other.

177
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,980
She never treats Xuanxuan like this.

178
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,440
Do you think so, Xuanxuan?

179
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,470
Moyun Ancient Academy.

180
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,100
Set off.

181
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,480
Keep alert.

182
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,140
Yes.

183
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,060
General.

184
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,420
General.

185
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
Uncle.

186
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,260
Do you feel better?

187
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,900
I'm feeling much better, uncle.

188
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,220
Good boy.

189
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:46,740
You're back.

190
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,260
Dad is back.

191
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,820
Thank you for your hard work today.

192
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,620
Hmm.

193
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,150
Here you are.

194
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,940
Dad, eat it.

195
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,020
Good boy.

196
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,320
I am not hungry.

197
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,820
This is for you.

198
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,520
Is it tasteful?

199
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,820
Run away!

200
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,900
Run.

201
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,420
Run after them.

202
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,310
Stop.

203
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,140
Don't move.

204
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,780
Keep down.

205
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,860
Don't move.

206
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,540
Be quiet.

207
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,220
Calm down.

208
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,460
Let me go.

209
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,270
Youlian.

210
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,230
Even though you save these people,

211
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,830
what about the rest people?

212
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,080
I know you're very sad.

213
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,060
But remember

214
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,830
you are the last hope

215
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,140
of your clan.

216
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,440
Protect His Highness.

217
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,460
Hurry up.

218
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,240
How is Long Wei'er?

219
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,940
Excuse me. Excuse me.

220
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,100
So much blood.

221
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,980
Long Wei'er must be dead or disabled.

222
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,140
Many people of the Kunwu clan also died.

223
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,420
Yunshan, what's wrong with you?

224
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,540
How can you speak for the Kunwu clan?

225
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,660
Just now

226
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,780
many elderly, women and children who are physically weak

227
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,820
were killed, too.

228
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,400
I think people of the Kunwu clan are pitiful.

229
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,340
You are too young,

230
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
easily deceived by the appearance.

231
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,020
Have you forgotten

232
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,460
what Mr. Xuanming said in the class?

233
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,260
He said the Kunwu clan

234
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,590
bullied our human clan.

235
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,280
Did you see it by yourself?

236
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,900
You just follow the tide.

237
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,260
You really have no capacity for improvement.

238
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,980
Bookworm.

239
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,140
What do you think?

240
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,620
I believe in the book.

241
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,180
But I prefer what is seen by my own eyes.

242
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,820
I think Yunshan is right.

243
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,180
You.

244
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,540
Li Xuan.

245
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,640
How ridiculous

246
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,750
their words are!

247
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,100
They are dizzy.

248
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,420
Youlian.

249
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,780
Prince Mu.

250
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,750
Do you really think it over?

251
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,100
Uncle You An and my clansmen are inside.

252
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,100
Anyhow,

253
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,540
I must save them.

254
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,540
Do you know why Long Wei'er is injured?

255
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,270
What do you mean?

256
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,600
As far as I know,

257
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,900
the armour that Long Wei'er wears

258
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,140
is made of ferrophosphorus

259
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,400
which can't be easily pierced by a spear.

260
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,300
You mean

261
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,870
there is something wrong with his injury.

262
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,200
I can't consider much.

263
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,660
I must save them.

264
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,620
Take it.

265
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,950
What's this?

266
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,340
Soul-enchanting Grass.

267
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,700
Remember.

268
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,140
Life comes first.

269
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,540
If anything is wrong, get out immediately.

270
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,140
I know.

271
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,620
Thank you.

272
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,980
Saintess.

273
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,940
Uncle You An.

274
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,740
How are you?

275
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,660
Saintess.

276
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,950
I'm OK. Don't worry.

277
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,220
How do you get inside?

278
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,780
I enchanted them to coma.

279
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,240
Don't worry. I will save you and take you out.

280
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,220
Wait.

281
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,180
Someone is coming.

282
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,290
Saintess.

283
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,420
Leave me alone.

284
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,280
Hurry to leave.

285
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,660
Leave now.

286
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,140
I'm afraid it's too late for me to leave.

287
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,260
Uncle You An.

288
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,780
Wait a moment.

289
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,329
I will save you and then we fight out together.

290
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:13,930
Saintess.

291
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:14,940
Listen to me.

292
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,500
Surrounded by lots of soldiers,

293
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,660
it's impossible for us to escape.

294
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,619
Hurry to leave.

295
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,260
Uncle You An. Get off the way.

296
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,460
Listen to me.

297
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,980
You are the only hope of the Kunwu clan.

298
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,579
You must be alive.

299
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,780
Hurry to leave.

300
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,300
What a sharp sword!

301
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,220
You have revenged for

302
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,430
the several people of your family.

303
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,140
You...

304
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,460
Su Youlian.

305
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,780
What are you doing?

306
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,500
Can you explain

307
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,540
why the guards outside

308
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,660
are in a coma

309
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,980
while you're here?

310
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,020
There is nothing to explain

311
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,820
or you don't know how to explain.

312
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,500
This person of the Kunwu clan

313
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,860
killed my parents.

314
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,380
I need to kill him by myself

315
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,020
to revenge for them.

316
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,630
Are you sure you're here to kill him

317
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,380
instead of letting go of him?

318
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,740
Zheng.

319
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,580
We saw that

320
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,020
it was Youlian

321
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,860
who killed the person of the Kunwu clan.

322
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,300
Why do you infer so?

323
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,100
Do you have evidence?

324
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,400
Zheng Bainian.

325
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,940
Don't gossip anything without evidence

326
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,740
in case it hurts the friendship among classmates.

327
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,540
Nation-protecting Master.

328
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,800
What do you think of it?

329
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,190
It's heavily guarded here.

330
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
If she really belongs to the Kunwu clan,

331
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,660
how could she save him in such a stupid way?

332
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,580
It seems that all of you believe what Su Youlian said.

333
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,380
Your Highness.

334
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,320
Don't you believe?

335
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,340
Of course I do.

336
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,500
Otherwise for the important plan of exterminating the Kunwu clan,

337
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,300
I wouldn't have taken her along.

338
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,320
That's all.

339
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,820
We've gained a complete victory by exterminating the Kunwu clan.

340
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,480
Besides, Miss. Su also revenged for her family.

341
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,190
We're supposed to have a celebration.

342
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,620
I have ordered General Wang to hold a party on the campsite.

343
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,580
My classmates.

344
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,860
Please.

345
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,560
Your Highness.

346
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,950
You recover so quickly.

347
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,300
Let's go.

348
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,260
Hurry up.

349
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,060
What mistakes did the Kunwu clan make?

350
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,060
We just want to live a peaceful life like the human clan.

351
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,460
Is there anything wrong?

352
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,300
Why does the human clan kill us ruthlessly?

353
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Why?

354
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,030
Close up!

355
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,220
Hurry up.

356
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,060
Close up!

357
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,140
Hurry up!

358
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,260
Go.

359
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,540
Quickly!

360
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,100
Go!

361
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,700
Quickly!

362
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,740
Close up!

363
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,220
Hurry up!

364
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,100
Li Xuan.

365
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,420
I'm sure to get your token.

366
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,470
I show my respect to you, my father.

367
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,820
Rise.

368
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,460
How are you?

369
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,550
Are you injured?

370
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,540
Just a small hurt on the skin.

371
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,600
No need to mention.

372
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,020
You are really valiant, my son!

373
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,140
You have made great contributions.

374
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,140
I will give you a big reward.

375
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,960
Thank you, father.

376
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,980
Though I return in triumph,

377
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,260
I dare not take credit for them.

378
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,820
Why?

379
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,140
If it were not the generosity of my  brother

380
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,460
to leave this chance

381
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,700
to me,

382
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,500
I wouldn't have the opportunity to make contributions.

383
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,340
So if you want to reward,

384
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,060
just reward my brother.

385
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,300
Good.

386
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,620
Good.

387
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,110
Both of you are my good sons.

388
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,020
You are modest to each other.

389
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,620
I feel so relieved.

390
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,220
Congratulations to Your Majesty.

391
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,260
Congratulations to Your Majesty.

392
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,620
What to congratulate?

393
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,800
You are supremely fortunate.

394
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,140
With the crown prince modest and generous

395
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,020
and the second prince extraordinary valiant,

396
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,350
both of them are important to the country.

397
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,460
With you, My Majesty, a wise emperor,

398
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,420
the crown prince who is broad-minded

399
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,800
and the second prince who is a conqueror,

400
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,620
the State of Tianqi is blessed by the God.

401
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,220
God bless the State of Tianqi.

402
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,260
God bless the State of Tianqi.

403
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,820
God bless the State of Tianqi.

404
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,280
Father.

405
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,620
How to deal with these captures?

406
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,220
Call Lord Zi to come to the palace.

407
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,060
I will make a decision after asking him.

408
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,700
Call Lord Zi to come to the palace!

409
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,740
Youlian.

410
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,100
Kill him.

411
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,500
Kill him now.

412
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,790
As the Nation-protecting Master,

413
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,580
he is our sworn enemy.

414
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,480
He must be killed sooner or later.

415
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,700
Think of your dead compatriots.

416
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,580
Forget your woman's pity.

417
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,940
Youlian.

418
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,660
Don't leave me alone.

419
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,460
Su Youlian.

420
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,030
Hurry up.

421
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,460
Master.

422
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,400
I've got the token.

423
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,380
Why didn't you kill Li Xuan just now?

424
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,620
You did have the chance.

425
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,870
Feng Changqing is really skilled.

426
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,220
If I killed Li Xuan,

427
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,020
it's likely that I couldn't escape tonight.

428
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,660
Besides,

429
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,180
though Li Xuan is the Nation-protecting Master,

430
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,780
he has unearned reputation,

431
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,940
incapable.

432
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,420
No need to fear him.

433
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,680
Do you think it's unnecessary to fear him

434
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,660
or you are unwilling to kill him?

435
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:47,940
Previously,

436
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,980
he could get out of the
Bloody Icebound Ward in the Secret Realm,

437
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,460
safe and sound.

438
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,400
It means he is not a common person.

439
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,620
Being kind to him

440
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,110
is like taking a crocodile as a pet.

441
00:30:59,180 --> 00:30:59,700
Master.

442
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,100
It's no use talking about it now.

443
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,980
Since Lord Zi is still in the palace,

444
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,640
let's take the advantage to save the Dragon Emperor immediately.

445
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,460
Our Kunwu clan

446
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,860
eventually can return to our own homeland.

447
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,380
Goodbye! Li Xuan.

448
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,180
Goodbye!

449
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,030
Moyun Ancient Academy.

450
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,660
That's it.

451
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,630
It's the breath of the Dragon Emperor.

452
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,220
It's so big here.

453
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,660
Where is the Dragon Emperor?

454
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,300
The Dragon Emperor must be locked here.

455
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,800
Miss Su has entered the Secret Realm.

456
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,120
Are you worried about her?

457
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,060
From now on,

458
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,980
the State of Tianqi will be in a chaos.

459
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,500
Eventually our country, the State of Sha can take a breath.

460
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,300
In the future,

461
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,320
we won't be oppressed by the State of Tianqi.

462
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,340
I'm afraid it can't be so simple.

463
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,620
Is there anything unexpected?

464
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,840
It should be there.

465
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,340
How to reach there?

466
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,380
Lord Zi.

467
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,940
How could this be?

468
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,980
[Nation-protecting Master]

469
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,300
Unable to pull out the sword,

470
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,560
how can I save The Dragon Emperor?

471
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,020
Could it be that

472
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,260
only the Nation-protecting Master can pull out the sword?

473
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,420
[Nation-protecting Master]

474
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,180
Master.

475
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,060
What can I do?

476
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,040
Your Highness.

477
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,000
Lord Zi is back.

478
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,820
Are you OK?

479
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,780
I'm fine. Thank you, prince Mu.

480
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,110
Thank you for your help.

481
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,220
It's my pleasure.

482
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,980
Well,

483
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,740
don't make Li Xuan know what happened tonight.

484
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,980
I stole his token.

485
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,180
It's certain that he will notice it and become more alert.

486
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,340
Give me the token!

487
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,870
As for the token,

488
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,180
leave it to me to deal with it.

489
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,030
Feng Changqing.

490
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,220
Where is my token?

491
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,350
What is he shouting?

492
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,620
Let's go.

493
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,630
It seems that the two people

494
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,550
came for your token last night.

495
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,380
Who?

496
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,550
Who are they?

497
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,580
Why are you staring at me?

498
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,640
last night, a man and a woman came.

499
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,240
The man is quite skillful.

500
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,030
I can't see through his detail.

501
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,550
Even you can't see through his detail?

502
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,580
What about the woman?

503
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,220
Su Youlian.

504
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,830
Impossible.

505
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,470
Did you see clearly?

506
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,580
I'm not sure.

507
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,350
It's very alike.

508
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,540
Her Highness Xie comes.

509
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,830
I show my respect to you, my mother.

510
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,660
Let me have a look.

511
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,820
For the last battle with the Kunwu clan,

512
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,980
are you injured?

513
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,660
Thank you for your concern, mother.

514
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,780
I'm fine.

515
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,900
You really suffered.

516
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,660
You are supposed to  live a comfortable life  in the palace,

517
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,460
but I...

518
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,060
Everything has gone!

519
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,700
You can leave now.

520
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,580
Yes.

521
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,500
Today is your birthday.

522
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,980
I can't help thinking about the past.

523
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,300
So I am a little sad.

524
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,540
It's special today.

525
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,110
To avoid your identity being exposed,

526
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,540
after breakfast,

527
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,150
leave the palace

528
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,720
and return to the Academy.

529
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,820
I know.

530
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,220
You will suffer again.

531
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,940
Don't feel sad for me, mother.

532
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,470
For these years,

533
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,660
the hardships I've suffered

534
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,140
will eventually be paid back.

535
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,900
What's up?

536
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,500
Give it to me.

537
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,900
What's it?

538
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,060
Token.

539
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,830
I didn't take it.

540
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,900
Dare you say it again staring at my eyes?

541
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,140
Tell me

542
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,100
if it was Yu Fengmu

543
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,140
who stole the token with you last night.

544
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,820
I don't know what you're talking about.

545
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,380
If you want to get the token,

546
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,700
just tell me directly.

547
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,020
Why do you combine with someone else

548
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,780
to steal it?

549
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,100
Or

550
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,120
was it Yu Fengmu who asked you to do so?

551
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,500
Don't talk rubbish.

552
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,380
Prince Mu is not that kind of person.

553
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,420
Prince Mu.

554
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,860
Prince Mu.

555
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,320
Are you so close to each other?

556
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,710
Have you forgotten that

557
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,660
you are still my wife?

558
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,980
The marriage is just a play.

559
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,540
Why bother badgering me?

560
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,620
The marriage is a play?

561
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,340
Is the kiss under the lake

562
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,700
also a play for you?
