00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,870
Dance of the Sky Empire

3
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,870
Episode 24

4
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,289
His Majesty is so prudent,

5
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,610
how did you get back?

6
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,000
Enduring untold hardship and suffering,

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,160
my uncle gathered hundreds of poison

8
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,479
to make a decoction of medicinal ingredients,

9
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,210
which can change me into a male.

10
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,720
Yet

11
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,630
bathing in the poison decoction

12
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,590
is like being gnawed by numerous ants.

13
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,190
I feel too torturous to live.

14
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,440
Moreover,

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,550
I have to suffer this pain

16
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,040
every birthday.

17
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,950
I don't want to have a bath.

18
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,000
It must be aching.

19
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,790
Only the poison decoction in this world

20
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,470
can change you into a male temporarily

21
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,140
to deceive the public.

22
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,030
Mother, I feel so painful.

23
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,190
So

24
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,320
you were suffering this pain

25
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,270
during your last birthday, right?

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,390
Did he believe you?

27
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,430
He is prone to suspicion,

28
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,410
how could he believe me so easily?

29
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,630
When he asked me to go back to the palace,

30
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,520
he checked my blood by himself

31
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,960
with the presence of many civil and military officials.

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,670
Then he allowed me to return.

33
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,960
Losing my mother when I was young,

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,360
I thought I was very poor.

35
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,630
Unexpectedly...

36
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,190
You don't need to show sympathy to me.

37
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,520
Everything has passed.

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,390
Someday

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,000
I will make him bear all the hardships

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,600
I have suffered.

41
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,000
And

42
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,880
tens of thousands of times

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,650
worse than mine.

44
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,550
From now on,

45
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,950
I don't need to disguise in front of you.

46
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,030
It's good to be yourself.

47
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,110
Why do you stay away?

48
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,190
You

49
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,630
won't regard me as a man, right?

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,470
I am a man.

51
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,440
You're not afraid to be in an unfavorable situation.

52
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,840
What shall I be afraid of?

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,600
Father.

54
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,110
The Kunwu clan fought back this time.

55
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,040
It must result from the collusion between the Kunwu siren with Li Xuan

56
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,510
and Long Wei'er.

57
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,880
They have run away.

58
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,720
It must have something to do with the Kunwu clan.

59
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,920
In my view,

60
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,110
you'd better execute all the people

61
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,159
related to Li Xuan and Long Wei'er

62
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,160
in case there are still some people working with them inside the city.

63
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
Close Moyun Ancient Academy

64
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,060
to avoid trouble later on.

65
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,880
Close down Moyun Ancient Academy?

66
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,670
Do you know Lord Zi is still there?

67
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,600
Now in the world,

68
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,900
only Lord Zi can seal the Dragon Emperor.

69
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,350
If Moyun Ancient Academy is closed down,

70
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,760
where can Lord Zi go?

71
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,550
But

72
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,390
it's all because of Su Youlian

73
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,830
who infiltrated into Moyun Ancient Academy, leading to the disaster.

74
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,110
So I think

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,640
Lord Zi can't get involved with it.

76
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,670
How ridiculous you are!

77
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,790
You just shift all the responsibility for the disaster to Lord Zi.

78
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,600
If it hadn't been Lord Zi,

79
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,590
how could we human clan have beaten the Kunwu clan?

80
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,200
Father.

81
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,320
Shut up.

82
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,070
Commander in chief of city defence.

83
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,159
I'm here.

84
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,390
Transmit my order

85
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,830
and proclaim martial law all over the city

86
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,550
to encircle and suppress the rest Kunwu clan in the city.

87
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,830
Once found,

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,040
they should be executed on the spot.

89
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,390
I will make them

90
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,390
never leave alive.

91
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,230
See?

92
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,290
I intended to share the cares and burdens with my father

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
while he

94
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,160
directly refuted my opinion

95
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,230
in the presence of so many officials.

96
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,070
I really lost face,

97
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,670
so awkward.

98
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,000
His Majesty just thinks too much of Lord Zi.

99
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,000
How can he compare Lord Zi

100
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,040
with me?

101
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,600
I'm the inheritor of the throne.

102
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,490
He treated me like this.

103
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,670
How can I govern the subordinates?

104
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,250
How can I gain prestige?

105
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,040
Do you know

106
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,040
why His Majesty treated you like this?

107
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,830
How do I know?

108
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,440
Have you ever thought that

109
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,510
if you become the emperor...

110
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,040
Unbridled.

111
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,670
Didn't I tell you

112
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,110
not to talk like this?

113
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,440
Besides,

114
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,670
my father is still in his prime.

115
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,240
It's still too early

116
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,390
for my inheriting.

117
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,760
In fact, it's not early.

118
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,790
It's all up to your own thoughts.

119
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,830
If you want to inherit the throne early,

120
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,159
I have an idea.

121
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,270
What's it?

122
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,000
No.

123
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,160
No.

124
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,600
It is to force the emperor to abdicate.

125
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,110
How could it be?

126
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,640
As the crown prince,

127
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,390
it's perfectly justifiable for you to inherit the throne.

128
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,350
We just take action secretly.

129
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,330
As long as His Majesty write the imperial edict,

130
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,510
nobody dare to doubt.

131
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,000
Listen. Don't do that.

132
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,400
It may hurt my father.

133
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,880
Forcing the emperor to abdicate is just a way.

134
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,909
If we control His Majesty,

135
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,080
of course he will write down the imperial edict to resign sovereign authority.

136
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,350
He won't get hurt at all.

137
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,470
I show my respect to you, father.

138
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,520
Rise.

139
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,910
Stand up.

140
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,110
It's a hard journey.

141
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,710
Why didn't

142
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,640
Yunshan return with you?

143
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,320
Yunshan

144
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,640
She didn’t come back with me.

145
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,530
She is still in the State of Tianqi, right?

146
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,880
Mischievous!

147
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,910
Send people to go to the State of Tianqi to take her back immediately.

148
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,030
This is...

149
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,670
She is the Saintess of the Kunwu clan, Su Youlian.

150
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,360
I show my respect to you, Your Majesty.

151
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,440
Saintess of the Kunwu clan?

152
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,150
Father, how is my mother?

153
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,150
She is fine.

154
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,280
She is waiting for you in the palace.

155
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,350
Go with me.

156
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,910
It's the first time you've been away from home for so long.

157
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,960
your mother misses you very much.

158
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,010
I'm wondering if brother Mu still remembers me.

159
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,590
His Majesty comes.

160
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,470
I show my respect to you, Your Majesty.

161
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,590
I take Mu'er back.

162
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,350
I show my respect to you, Prince Mu. Mother.

163
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,950
Mu'er. Finally you're back.

164
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,230
I show my respect to you, mother.

165
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,200
Good boy.

166
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,030
Rise.

167
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,200
Let you watch you carefully.

168
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,000
You're thinner.

169
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,150
I'm Yuxiu. I show my respect to you, Prince Mu.

170
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,960
Yuxiu is also here.

171
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,110
It's good.

172
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,280
Mu'er.

173
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,320
Look at her.

174
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,000
can you recognize sister Yuixiu?

175
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,230
She is the eldest sister of Lord Tang.

176
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,670
Just meeting once when they were young,

177
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,280
he still remembered her.

178
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,270
It's said that you're always wise and intelligent

179
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,770
with an extraordinary retentive memory.

180
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,550
So it's true.

181
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,200
Mu'er. You're just back in the right time.

182
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,440
I

183
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,110
have something important to tell you.

184
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,900
Mother. Wait a minute.

185
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,080
Let me introduce her to you.

186
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,230
She is the Saintess of the Kunwu clan, Su Youlian.

187
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,230
The Kunwu clan?

188
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,230
Didn't they...

189
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,770
I show my respect to you, Your Majesty.

190
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,410
By the way, mother,

191
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,440
didn't you tell me that you have something important to tell me?

192
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,840
What's it?

193
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,230
I have a discussion with your father.

194
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,320
You have been in the age of marriage.

195
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,000
As the future inheritor of the State of Sha,

196
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,670
you marriage is of great importance.

197
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,400
We have chosen Yuxiu

198
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,110
to be your princess consort.

199
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,030
After you have the little prince,

200
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,840
you can inherit the throne.

201
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,590
I'm afraid I can't follow your order.

202
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,200
Why?

203
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,280
I've already had my lover.

204
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,470
You mean

205
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,010
you want to marry the Saintess of the Kunwu clan?

206
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,030
Yes.

207
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,000
Prince Mu.

208
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,520
Why did you talk with your parents

209
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,670
like that?

210
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,280
Do you still remember that

211
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,150
I have told you

212
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,590
I can help you wake up the Dragon Emperor

213
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,520
if you go to the State of Sha with me?

214
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,760
Do they have something to do with each other?

215
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,470
Follow me.

216
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,170
Didn't you tell me that it can't be restored?

217
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,640
So I did.

218
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,350
But in this world

219
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,840
there are two saintess stones.

220
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,150
One is in Kunwu.

221
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,520
The other one

222
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,230
went to my country in the ancient times,

223
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,280
guarding the territory for us.

224
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,440
There are two saintess stones?

225
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,440
It...

226
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,960
It's the holy stone of the State of Sha.

227
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,110
Only the royal family of the State of Sha can drive it.

228
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,790
If it is taken away by other people,

229
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,450
it will be just a common stone.

230
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
That's to say,

231
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,280
even if I have it,

232
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,760
I can't wake up the Dragon Emperor.

233
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,640
No.

234
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,640
I can

235
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,570
make it follow your order.

236
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,550
Marry me.

237
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,880
Be my wife.

238
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,470
Marry you?

239
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,400
Besides,

240
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,320
we must be

241
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,320
real couple.

242
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,110
I know

243
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,350
you only have Li Xuan in your heart.

244
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,880
I won't force you.

245
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,400
Think it over

246
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,680
before making the decision.

247
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,640
No.

248
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,350
I can make it follow your order.

249
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,080
Marry me.

250
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,080
Be my wife.

251
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,790
Princess Mu.

252
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,150
Prince Mu ordered me

253
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,760
to send these clothes to you.

254
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,000
If you have any requirement,

255
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,200
just tell me.

256
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,520
My name is Su Youlian.

257
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,110
Just call my name.

258
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,880
Princess Mu. I dare not.

259
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,670
I know.

260
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,350
You can leave.

261
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,640
Yes.

262
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,160
Are you nervous?

263
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:03,950
No.

264
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,590
No, I'm not nervous.

265
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,310
Anyhow,

266
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,440
we just marry to cheat the Elder of the Book Heaven.

267
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,440
The stubborn old man

268
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,760
is still listening to us secretly.

269
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,520
You cried just now?

270
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,040
No.

271
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,190
I know what you're thinking about.

272
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,000
Since it is so,

273
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,160
you can only agree to marry Prince Mu.

274
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,160
Ten years' time is up soon.

275
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,880
If you still don't take action,

276
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,410
the Dragon Emperor will sleep there forever.

277
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,400
Marrying Prince Mu

278
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,430
is the only hope to save the Kunwu clan.

279
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,470
Really there isn't another choice, right?

280
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,880
Since it is so,

281
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,710
It's the only choice.

282
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,010
This is the capital of the State of Sha.

283
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,610
What are you thinking?

284
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,160
Our prince is here to stop

285
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,880
the Kunwu syren from saving the Dragon Emperor.

286
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,190
You won't hinder our prince

287
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,070
for Su Youlian, right?

288
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,160
I show my respect to you, Prince Mu.

289
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,800
Aren't you in Youlian's room?

290
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,110
Why are you here?

291
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,520
Princess Mu specially asked me to

292
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,640
reply to you.

293
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,640
She said

294
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,680
she agreed.

295
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,310
You...

296
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,110
Did you hear clearly?

297
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,330
Princess Mu said

298
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,470
she agreed to marry you.

299
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,780
Your Highness.

300
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,230
The cup is empty.

301
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,080
The teapot is also empty.

302
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,310
I am about to fill it with water.

303
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,430
Batou.

304
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,280
Go to see if

305
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,800
there are some food in the kitchen

306
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,710
and send it to Youlian.

307
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,350
Yes.

308
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,090
Your Highness.

309
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,070
I should address Miss Su

310
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,070
Princess Mu, right?

311
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,280
Batou!

312
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,280
Hurry up.

313
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,350
Yes.

314
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,110
Princess Mu.

315
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,680
How can I help you?

316
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,140
Do you know that

317
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,310
the troops are mobilized suddenly here?

318
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,520
Don't you know it?

319
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,110
I'm afraid the owner of the palace will be changed.

320
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,310
Change?

321
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,670
It must be the order of the demon spirit.

322
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,650
What on earth does he want to do?

323
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,690
Lord Xiao ordered that

324
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,420
you were not allowed to leave.

325
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,000
Watch her closely.

326
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,920
Without my permission,

327
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,760
nobody can go inside.

328
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,880
Anybody who violates my order

329
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,740
will be killed.

330
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes.

331
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,620
Your Highness.

332
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,430
Go inside.

333
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,360
Protect His Majesty.

334
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,520
You unfilial son!

335
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,340
Are you here to plot and rebel?

336
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,110
Father.

337
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,830
You've been the emperor for so many years.

338
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,070
I want to share the cares and burdens with you.

339
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,830
You're forcing me to abdicate.

340
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,490
You just commit high treason.

341
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,950
Aren't you afraid to be punished?

342
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,070
So I want to bother you

343
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,920
to write the imperial edict.

344
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
In this way

345
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,190
can I inherit the throne justifiably.

346
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,070
You want me to write the imperial edict?

347
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,110
You're dreaming.

348
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:38,800
Father.

349
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,430
I'm the crown prince declared by yourself.

350
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,520
Sooner or later, you will ask me to inherit the throne.

351
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,470
Could it be that

352
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,760
you want Long Wei'er, the traitor of the human clan to inherit the throne?

353
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,710
Your Highness.

354
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,350
Since His Majesty wouldn't like to cooperate with us,

355
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,710
no need to talk more.

356
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,800
As long as His Majesty die now,

357
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,230
naturally the throne is yours.

358
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,570
Xiao Fengming.

359
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,830
What do you want to do?

360
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,040
You frighten my father.

361
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,590
Since it is so, this is the only way.

362
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,410
Do you want His Majesty to declare another crown prince?

363
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,590
Would you like to write or not?

364
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,590
I will write it.

365
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,640
I'm the emperor.

366
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,830
The throne is mine.

367
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,620
Xiao Fengming.

368
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,820
What' re you doing?

369
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,460
Since you've got the imperial edict,

370
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,710
it's no use keeping him alive,

371
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,760
why not kill him earlier?

372
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
Xiao Fengming.

373
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,170
You've promised me.

374
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,280
don't hurt my father.

375
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,130
Anyone who can do great things

376
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,070
won't be as kind as a woman.

377
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,160
Remember

378
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,760
I'm helping you.

379
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,310
Stop!

380
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,880
Xiao Fengming.

381
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,680
Bookworm.

382
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,830
Xiao Fengming.

383
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,190
Wake up.

384
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,400
Wake up. Wake up.

385
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,000
Wake up.

386
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,880
Wake up.

387
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,430
Wake up.

388
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,110
Yunshan.

389
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,040
Yunshan.

390
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,430
Wake up.

391
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,280
Wake up.

392
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,560
Wake up.

393
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,310
Yunshan.

394
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,400
Yunshan.

395
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,560
Yunshan.

396
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,880
Yunshan.

397
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,880
Yunshan.

398
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,280
Yunshan.

399
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,000
Yunshan. Wake up. Yunshan.

400
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,310
Finally you're back.

401
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,920
Sorry.

402
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,350
Sorry. Yunshan.

403
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,470
It's not your fault.

404
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,470
The demon spirit did it.

405
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,590
There is nothing serious.

406
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,250
Let me take you to see a doctor.

407
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,940
I'm taking you to see a doctor.

408
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,350
You are not willing to part with me, right?

409
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,070
Of course.

410
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,640
I still want to go to school with you

411
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,810
and drink the soup you made for me by yourself.

412
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,800
I still want to hear you scold me

413
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,920
bookworm.

414
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,280
You are really a bookworm.

415
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,760
Xiao Fengming.

416
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,310
I...

417
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,520
I haven't heard you say

418
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,070
that you love me

419
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,680
I love you.

420
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,350
Yunshan.

421
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
I love you very much.

422
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,520
I love you very much.

423
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:23,920
Yunshan.

424
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,160
Yunshan.

425
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,590
Yunshan.

426
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,880
The Prince is going to get married.

427
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,430
Really?

428
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,430
Yeah!

429
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,800
Go to check there.

430
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,830
OK. Ok.

431
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,640
Have a look.

432
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,590
Watch out

433
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,800
in case that you will fall down.

434
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,280
I know.

435
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Boss.

436
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,690
Is there a happy event in this city?

437
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,950
It's decorated with lanterns and streamers everywhere.

438
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,430
Of course there is a happy event.

439
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,640
Our Prince Mu

440
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,680
is going to get married.

441
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,160
Yu Fengmu.

442
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,000
How can you address our Prince Mu by the name?

443
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,400
Our Prince Mu

444
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,710
has taken back

445
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,250
a supreme beauty from the State of Tianqi.

446
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,000
They love each other deeply.

447
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,310
As long as he came back, His Highness

448
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,520
went to the courtyard

449
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,570
to declare his marriage with her.

450
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,230
At first,

451
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,400
His Majesty and Her Majesty

452
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,470
didn't agree.

453
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,410
But they could do nothing to

454
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,470
stop His Highness passion of love.

455
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,430
Do you know the name of the beauty

456
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,430
that Prince Mu took back?

457
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,560
It seems that she is called Saintess.

458
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,710
Li Xuan.

459
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,400
How could he beat others?

460
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,110
Yeah.

461
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,110
Can' you hear me?

462
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,810
I show my respect to you, Your Majesty.

463
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,949
How is Lord Xiao?

464
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,340
He hasn't woken up.

465
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
You can leave now.

466
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,000
Yes.

467
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:14,840
Yes.

468
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,040
Your Majesty.

469
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,389
Lord Xiao.

470
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,630
Lord Xiao.

471
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,670
He is still unconscious.

472
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,690
Ask the servants to

473
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,560
take good care of him.

474
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,360
Yes. Your Majesty.

475
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,840
What's up?

476
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,560
Lord Xiao is powerful,

477
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,000
cruel and heartless.

478
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,390
He is respected and feared by all the ministers.

479
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,430
Almost all the garrison is under the control of him.

480
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,840
If he always carefully supports you

481
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,840
and the country

482
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,150
it's good.

483
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,950
But what if he changes his mind?

484
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,040
I'm afraid...

485
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,450
What' re you afraid of?

486
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,470
How dare him!

487
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,950
Your Majesty.

488
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,430
Have you forgotten that he disobeyed your order

489
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:26,090
and insisted on killing your father yesterday?

490
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,560
Your Majesty.

491
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,280
Xiao Fengming is really cruel and heartless.

492
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,190
If you want to kill him,

493
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,280
it's the best chance now.

494
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,910
After he wakes up,

495
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,040
I'm afraid nobody can deal with him.

496
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,120
If you want to kill him then,

497
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,600
it will be hard.

498
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,630
Then

499
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,840
do you have an idea?

500
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
Your Majesty.

501
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,120
Eh...

502
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,630
Lord Xiao,

503
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,800
you're awake.

504
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,670
If I didn't wake up,

505
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,250
your dagger would be stabbed into

506
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,000
my heart.

507
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,430
I just think

508
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,840
it...

509
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,670
the dagger was made so exquisite

510
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,910
and sharp.

511
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:37,230
So I want to give it to you to play with.

512
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,670
It's a good dagger.

513
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,520
I don't know if it's sharp.

514
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,360
You...

515
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,150
What do you think?

516
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,820
I didn't lie to you, right?

517
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,760
Isn't it sharp?

518
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,430
When I was asleep,

519
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,430
I heard someone said I was heartless and cruel.

520
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,520
I think it's a pertinent comment.

521
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,630
What do you think?

522
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,150
He dug his own grave!

523
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,920
You're awake.

524
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,630
come to have the meal.

525
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,120
Don't hurry.

526
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,230
Nobody is gonna take it from you.

527
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,760
I have sent people to the palace of the State of Sha to ask about it.

528
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,910
I don't care.

529
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,800
Really?

530
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,970
It's true that Su Youlian and Yu Fengmu will get married.

531
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,600
I learned that

532
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,950
in the wedding ceremony,

533
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,670
the saintess stone will be

534
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,190
sent to Su Youlian as a betrothal gift.

535
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,910
So

536
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,630
we only need to...
