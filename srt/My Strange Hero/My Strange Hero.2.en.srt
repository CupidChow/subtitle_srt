1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,070
Take a look here. The fluctuation of phonemic is—

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,330
What is phonemic? And why does it fluctuate?

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,150
It's a thing called phenomena when two phonemics meet to make something sound good.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,950
We learned this back in middle school.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,620
A thin bubble and yellow socks. You don't remember?

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,830
Hey.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,630
You have a strange fashion sense. Who wears yellow socks these days?

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,060
Try not to comprehend it. Just memorize it. It's simple as long as you just memorize it.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,560
There's this thing called end sound rule to cryptectomy.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,430
G N D R/L M B/V A/O are considered as such.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,960
There's also S. You forgot to mention S.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,120
So, therefore, that's why it's called GANDUARUN (thin) water drops. So don't get confused even though the S is missing in there.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,600
Look here.

14
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,310
It's seems like the rules to this are just made up and anything goes. You stop at the red light.

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,960
You cross when the light turns green. Children, elderly, and pregnant women should be protected.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,960
It's so simple but you make it far more difficult than it is.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,940
You idiot! During class, you shouldn't...

18
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,810
What, what now?

19
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,430
Would you like to eat another bowl of fried rice?

20
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,290
Should I?

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,830
- You know what you ordered was a double-sized portion, right?
- Uh-huh.

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,800
My uncle grew up so much.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,440
He's even bringing a girl over now.

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,950
Class President!

25
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,820
♫ Do you happen to know? ♫

26
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,320
♫ I don't think I can go on without you. ♫

27
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,780
♫ Afraid that I might get caught, afraid that you might get caught. ♫

28
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,740
♫ I just want to hide my feelings for now. ♫

29
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,660
♫ But it shows on my face  ♫

30
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,060
♫ My blushing face is telling  ♫

31
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,680
♫ I'm not very good at expressing my feelings to you. ♫

32
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,690
♫ But I'll still tell you how I truly feel. ♫

33
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,110
♫ Let's go out and see so we can find out whether we are suited for each other. ♫

34
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,580
♫ Let's see if we have any differences in personality. ♫

35
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,260
♫ I like you so I will try hard for you. ♫

36
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,600
♫ Have a good night sleep every night. ♫

37
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,210
♫ When I whisper in your ears, you fall asleep. ♫

38
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,360
What do you think, class president?

39
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,200
You feel so much better after going for a swift ride, right?

40
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,010
Feel so much better? I was scared to death.

41
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,060
You ran away again without coming to night study.

42
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,110
You always cause trouble and don't even study. Why are you even coming to school then?

43
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,700
Why do you ask that? It's fun.

44
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,660
There are friends, you get fed, and the class is so awesome that I can fall asleep easily.

45
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,550
It's heaven indeed.

46
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,330
Give me the test sheet for Korean class.

47
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,560
Well, that is...

48
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,450
I'm so sorry. I think I must be an idiot or something. This is so...

49
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,890
Could it be that you got them all wrong?

50
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,440
But still, it's okay since you did your best.

51
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,640
But I really can't say nonsensical things like that though.

52
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,360
Look, Class President, I got 50 points more than usual.

53
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,660
So that means you got 15% before?

54
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,300
Uh, yeah. What did you get, Class President?

55
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,780
80%?

56
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,100
90%? Could it be that you got...?

57
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,350
You got them all right?

58
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,740
Class President, you really don't have a human touch in you.

59
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,880
What?

60
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,740
Class President, what is your dream anyway?

61
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,210
- Dream?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,140
What is it that you want to be to make you study this hard?

63
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,330
I really don't have any dreams right now.

64
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,020
Well, then...

65
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,870
A teacher. What do you think?

66
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,050
- A teacher?
- Yep.

67
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,970
Teacher Son Soo Jeong. It just rolls right out of my tongue.

68
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,390
And the most important thing is the fact that you helped me get 65% on my test.

69
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,400
You know how incredible this is?

70
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,430
A teacher?

71
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,880
Teacher Son Soo Jeong.

72
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,460
You got it.

73
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,370
You decided on your dream.

74
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,420
I also thought of something else. A dream for myself.

75
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,520
The boyfriend of Son Soo Jeong.

76
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,710
Hey, what the...?

77
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,890
Teacher.

78
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,160
Son Soo Jeong.

79
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,710
Teacher. Teacher.

80
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,920
Teacher. Teacher Son Soo Jeong.

81
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,600
Hey, it's you, Yeong Min. The academic counselor isn't here yet.

82
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,440
Today,

83
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,260
I'm here to see you, Teacher.

84
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,680
Me? Why?

85
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,580
You need some psychological counseling? Is something the matter?

86
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,820
Are the other kids harassing you?

87
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,070
Not necessarily.

88
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,620
I'm...

89
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,850
so scared that I might be kicked out of the ivy class.

90
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,300
Oh, I see.

91
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,300
I'm so scared that I might be kicked out of this school.

92
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,970
Every time we take a test, I feel like the other kids are doing fine and I'm the only one who's not.

93
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,220
It seems like everyone is living the good life but why am I the only one who's not?

94
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,220
What should I do?

95
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,860
That's what I'd like to say. What do I do?

96
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,690
Yeong Min, listen. It's normal for you to feel insecure at this point in your life.

97
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,280
Teacher Son!

98
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,930
Have you been withholding your lunch money or what?

99
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,530
I just got a call from the administration office.

100
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,730
How could you be eating lunch for free for three whole months as a teacher for goodness sake?

101
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,080
I have a lot of counseling to do, sir. I will be down there right away.

102
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,380
Alright, you do that.

103
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,850
Yeong Min, do you think you can come back for the counseling session at another time?

104
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,400
Another time? When?

105
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,550
Just another time. The door will always be open for you.

106
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,030
Hello.

107
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,110
They just keep constructing new buildings.

108
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,100
- You all have to write "Flag" by Yoo Chi Hwan 100 times each.
- What?!

109
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,880
Alright, alright. Fine. Forget everything else.

110
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,010
Just remember that Yoo Chi Hwan's pen name is "Cheongma."

111
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,660
I want to be a full-time Korean teacher too.

112
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,350
Will I get a position if Mr. Park leaves?

113
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,370
I'm crazy, crazy. Son Soo Jeong, get yourself together.

114
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,290
Administration Office

115
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,060
Teacher Son Soo Jeong?

116
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,100
Your contract expires this term, right?

117
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,120
What?! $50,000?

118
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,850
Lower your voice.

119
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,070
If you pay $50,000, you can become a full-time teacher.

120
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,610
I wasn't going to say this,

121
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,960
but you know Mr. Hong, who's in charge of freshman Korean class, right?

122
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,100
Of course, I know him.

123
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,380
- No way.
- And the sophomore civics teacher.

124
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,620
- This makes no sense, Teacher Jang, too?
- Yes.

125
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,760
But why are you giving me this kind of offer?

126
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,540
And how does the admissions office plan to use that money?

127
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,920
You failed to be promoted to full-time again, didn't you?

128
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,770
If you don't make an opportunity for yourself, you'll never get in.

129
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,990
I really wasn't going to say this but...

130
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,810
I am the younger brother of the second cousin of Board Chairman's cousin.

131
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,570
Oh, I see.

132
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,940
That's amazing.

133
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,130
You son of a b*tch, how dare you try to pull this sh*t with me!

134
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,730
If you're the younger brother of a second cousin of his cousin, then you're strangers!

135
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,580
How can someone pay for a job to teach kids? Does that make sense?

136
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,480
I'm going to inform the "I Want to Know That" tv program and report you to the police.

137
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,660
I won't let you get away with this.

138
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,170
Then live like that for the rest of your life!

139
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,750
Walking on eggshells because of your unstable employment and

140
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,900
sucking to up teachers, live your life as a contract teacher.

141
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,650
I was trying to help you.

142
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,730
Oh, your meal payment.

143
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,850
Please pay up soon.

144
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,310
Grandma.

145
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,460
Have you been doing well?

146
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,820
You got prettier.

147
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,080
It's only me who's becoming aged.

148
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,750
Grandma, should I quit working at the school?

149
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,400
The cafeteria food doesn't fit my taste.

150
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,200
It used to taste so good in the past.

151
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,340
You know how much I used to like the food there.

152
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,110
I was almost persuaded for a bit there.

153
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,390
In my head, I was thinking how I should come up with the money.

154
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,580
Being like this...

155
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,350
should I become a teacher?

156
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,410
Teacher Son Soo Jeong.

157
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,450
Am I qualified?

158
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,670
Teacher! Son Soo Jeong.

159
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,900
Teacher!

160
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,920
I'm crazy. Why am I thinking of that?

161
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,060
Right, well, it's going to be a bit hard.

162
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,860
We're going to try hiring someone externally.

163
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,130
Grandma, I'll come back soon.

164
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,190
I'll have to make money quickly.

165
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,860
So Grandma...

166
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,080
Can you go easy on me this time?

167
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,130
What should I do?

168
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,070
Grandma, I'll use this money to become a full-time teacher...

169
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,580
and I'll treat you well.

170
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,860
Hello. Hello.

171
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,330
- Ah.
- Sorry.

172
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,190
Thank you, Teacher Ma!

173
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,740
Ms. Son, something good must've happened today.

174
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,000
Not really.

175
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,680
Teaching the kids is the best thing to happen on earth.

176
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,250
Have you gone crazy?

177
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,960
You were frowning so much just a few days ago. Are you dating?

178
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,590
$60,000

179
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,080
No, I'm not dating.

180
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,940
I was feeling a bit sick these past few days.

181
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:55,320
You think teaching kids is the best thing on earth, then your condition

182
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,560
is still a bit bad, don't you think?
$65,000

183
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,670
No, thank you for your concern.

184
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,970
Yeong Min.

185
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,080
Oh Yeong Min.

186
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,150
How can you lower the class average so much, huh?

187
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:21,660
Just switch to the sky class and study comfortably, instead of being a nuisance to other students.

188
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,980
You can leave.

189
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,670
Yeong Min, do you want to get counseling today? My doors are always open...

190
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,450
Yeong Min.

191
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,390
Oh Yeong Min!

192
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,950
Attention!

193
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,230
Give me your attention!

194
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,200
I heard Kim Myeong Ho from the administration office

195
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,690
ran away with all the students' meal plan money

196
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,650
and hasn't come to work since yesterday.

197
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,020
What a terrible person.

198
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,050
I heard he took 10 cents from each student's lunch money.

199
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,080
- The rumors must be true.
- I'm sure he took more than 10 cents.

200
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,180
I can't even imagine how much he pocketed for himself.

201
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,310
Is it...?

202
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,670
If he took money from the school, isn't that considered embezzlement?

203
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,460
Well, for now, I've reported him to the police.

204
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,860
It won't do us any good if the parents find out, so keep it all a secret, everyone.

205
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,960
This school charges so much for tuition because it's a private school.

206
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,160
- It doesn't make sense to keep this from the parents!
- You think we don't know that?

207
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,120
Geez, Teacher Park, tone it down a notch.

208
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,690
All of you quiet down.

209
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,220
Go ahead and teach your classes.

210
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,190
The students are quick to sense if something seems wrong.

211
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,620
Gosh! Who in the world is the owner of this school?

212
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,300
Aigoo!

213
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,830
The number you have dialed is not available.

214
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,800
You will be directed to voicemail.

215
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,660
Teacher.

216
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,790
I really want to die.

217
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,470
I am Yoo Boo Nam (also means married man).

218
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,530
It's contracted words for a boy studying in glass booth.

219
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,710
Yoo Boo Nam.

220
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,960
In Seolsong High, we call the kids who are in the top 30 in school in the ivy class Yoo Boo Nam and Yoo Boo Nye.

221
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,400
We're the only ones given glass booths to study in.

222
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,630
At first, I enjoyed all the benefits that came with the special class.

223
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,990
But as my grades started dropping,

224
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:52,830
the thought of dropping out of the class and being discriminated against like the other students was driving me crazy!

225
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,970
At Seolsong High, we take tests every week, and we're divided into classes based on our results.

226
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,530
But with this week's score, I'll be kicked out of the ivy class.

227
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,410
I'd rather die. You think I'm crazy? No!

228
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,260
I'm sure the students at Seolsong High can relate to what I'm feeling.

229
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,040
If all the classes were equal from the start, I would never have these thoughts!

230
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,160
I'm not crazy. It's the school that is crazy!

231
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,960
- I'm going to report Seolsong High.
- Find Yeong Min! Find my son!

232
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,620
- Who's in charge here?!
- Breaking News.

233
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,900
A sophomore at the prestigious S High School, Oh Yeong Min,

234
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:32,290
suddenly disappeared after leaving a post on social media about the school's overly competitive system.

235
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:38,260
S High School apparently divided its students into ranked classes based on weekly test results.

236
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,660
Yeong Min expressed that as time went by,

237
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,950
the anxiety from being kicked out of the top 1% class drove him crazy.

238
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,520
Oh Yeong Min

239
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,980
Teacher, I want to die.

240
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,210
I'm the one that really wants to die.

241
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,690
Unbelievable, Teacher, I really want to die, I mean it.

242
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,240
I mean it, too.

243
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,860
Let's meet up and die together.

244
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,920
Where are you?

245
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,250
You really came alone, right?

246
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,660
Right.

247
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,440
What should I do now?

248
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,220
What do you mean? We'll just die.

249
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,190
What? D-Die?

250
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,950
You said you wanted to die. Why?

251
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,770
Are you scared at the thought of death?

252
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:54,090
- Yes.
- I am really thankful for all of this time.

253
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,260
I'll never forget how you've supported me.

254
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,870
I will remember

255
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,050
the three years we spent together.

256
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:07,760
Now... I think it's time to

257
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,920
go forward to the next step.

258
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,680
Your boyfriend wants to break up with you.

259
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,930
Surprise!

260
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:24,290
Wow, I was surprised.

261
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,520
What kind of proposal is this?

262
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,900
Where's my boyfriend?

263
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,580
It's all your fault, Teach!

264
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,840
If you had heard me out then, it wouldn't have turned out like this.

265
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,570
I'm just a counselor by name! I don't even know what's going through my own head.

266
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,550
Contract workers are paid so little.

267
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,550
I heard that I'd get $100 bonus if I worked as a counselor, so I took the job.

268
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,750
Where's... my boyfriend?

269
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,300
Park Chang Soo contracted our firm to break up with you on his behalf.

270
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,680
A-Are you breaking up with me for him?

271
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,220
What are you doing right now?

272
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,150
Are you finished eating?

273
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,110
Of course, that old phrase is right.

274
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,380
They say, "Ghosts who die after eating look better."

275
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,130
Your complexion looks great right now.

276
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,220
I guess we won't feel lonely since we're dying together, right?

277
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,860
Teacher, why are you acting like this? This isn't funny.

278
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,670
What?

279
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:58,080
Didn't you say you were going to die? It won't take long.

280
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,440
First jump off then...

281
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,180
our brains will react first,

282
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,680
then our bodies will become anxious.

283
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,170
Then suddenly, we'll be short of breath.

284
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,760
We'll start frantically struggling, so

285
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,840
our cell respiration will become faster.

286
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,470
We'll need oxygen urgently,

287
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,880
so we'll breathe from our noses, right?

288
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,560
Then water will go into your nose and

289
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,000
flow down the airway, and when the water fills our lungs...

290
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,690
Our organs will start to fail one by one.

291
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,720
Our heart rate will decrease, then we'll become brain dead.

292
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,080
Then our hands will lose strength and fall slowly...

293
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,090
Stop! Stop it already!

294
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:44,260
Don't worry. It will be over within three minutes.

295
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,530
You're capable of sitting in the glass booth for five hours straight.

296
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,060
What's there to be scared of?

297
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,740
Teacher, I was wrong.

298
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,190
Please don't die!

299
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,130
I was wrong. I won't die. I don't want to die.

300
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,030
Please.

301
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,560
What does your father do?

302
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,810
What? He owns a business.

303
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,150
Listen to my words carefully now.

304
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,860
Use your parents. Study abroad.

305
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,020
You won't be able to withstand the ivy class for much longer.

306
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,020
Where would be good? America, Australia, or Canada would be nice.

307
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,280
I heard the school meals are very eco-friendly.

308
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,880
I'll go study abroad.

309
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,520
I came all this way and sacrificed myself for you.

310
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,960
Think that you were born again today, and live diligently from now on.

311
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,590
And there's something more important than studying and making money.

312
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,290
I'm sure there's something like that out there. It's your job to find it.

313
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,810
A pay phone?

314
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,890
Kim Myeong Ho?

315
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,900
Teacher, I got you!

316
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,060
I caught you. Hurry and come up.

317
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,460
Don't let go!

318
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,300
I can't swim!

319
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,180
Drop the phone and come up quickly!

320
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,890
What did you eat?! You're so heavy!

321
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,240
Hey! Don't let go! Don't let go!

322
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,730
Hey! Oh Yeong Min!

323
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,620
That idiot who couldn't even break up with me himself,

324
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,580
I can't believe I dated that jerk for three years!

325
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,520
Lastly, tell me what you want to say.

326
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,490
Don't let go! Don't let go!

327
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,400
My arm is falling off.

328
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,030
You jerk, how could you do this to me?!

329
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,570
Don't let go!

330
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,620
DON'T LET GO!

331
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,800
Oh Yeong Min!

332
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,530
Then I'll make a request too. That jerk...

333
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,440
Oh my god! What do we do? A person fell in.

334
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,320
Exactly.

335
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,090
What do you mean? You have to save them!

336
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,690
You go save them. I don't do anything for free.

337
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:29,530
Gee, everyone's so worried, but nobody's jumping in.

338
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,090
I'll give it to you. How much do you want?

339
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,620
$500 and dry cleaning.

340
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,290
What?

341
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,020
Is the Han River grade 2 or grade 3 water (water purity, grade 1 being the purest)?

342
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,040
Save me, save me please.

343
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,330
I can't die like this because of a stupid cellphone.

344
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,120
I don't want to die.

345
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,960
Why at this moment

346
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,230
am I seeing Kang Bok Soo of all people?

347
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,360
This doesn't make sense.

348
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,960
The thing that comes to mind in my last moment is Kang Bok Soo?

349
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:50,040
♫ You always come ♫

350
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:58,620
♫ My love is fading ♫

351
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,720
♫  I just want to be your sky, my love  ♫

352
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,570
♫  Something I have in memory  ♫

353
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:14,280
♫  Someone I hold dear  ♫

354
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,070
♫  Blue sky  ♫

355
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,990
♫  I just want to be your sky, my love  ♫

356
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,630
♫ Your warmth wrapped around me  ♫

357
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,260
♫  Someone I hold dear  ♫

358
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,900
♫  Blue sky  ♫

359
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:36,600
♫  Blue sky, blue sky  ♫

360
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,400
♫  You're in my memory  ♫
