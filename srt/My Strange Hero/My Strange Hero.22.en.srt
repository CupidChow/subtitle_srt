1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,880
Hey idiots, I guess you'll be separated soon.
Episode 22

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,080
Do you guys think studying is enough?

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,450
Just pack up your bags in advance.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,090
And clean out your lockers, too.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,420
If you cause a problem right now, it'll only hurt us. Don't do it.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,410
Oh Yeong Min, did I say something wrong?

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,950
Don't try so hard with crappy brains.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,650
Just disappear quietly.

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,830
I really hate that they're making us transfer because we're not good at studying.

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,070
I am getting sick of being belittled.

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,630
Yummy. Yum. Yum.

12
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,820
Right, you are poor at studying, but you look so adorable when you eat.

13
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,870
You surely are my baby.

14
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,040
Son, do you not want to transfer?

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,390
I heard about it, and it doesn't seem so bad.

16
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,540
You will be able to go to college, I heard.

17
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,420
- Transfer. Mom.
- Hm?

18
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,870
I just started to like the school.

19
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,560
And I won't have any friends if I transfer.

20
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,480
Right.

21
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,780
Okay.

22
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,210
Go transfer! You get to learn vocational skills. It sounds good.

23
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,860
You'll inherit my shop anyway.

24
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,170
Go learn skin care, makeup, and the technicals of this field—

25
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,300
I don't want to. All my friends are here, but you want only me to go to a different school?

26
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,040
Why are friends important?

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,220
You're so thoughtless.

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,450
Seriously.

29
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,130
Why are you deciding on the transfer yourself?

30
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,570
Then should I let you do what you want?

31
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:17,320
Listen to your mother. Listening to the director, there isn't anything wrong. Hm?

32
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,140
I don't want to.

33
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,960
Then what will you do with a high school diploma?! Just transfer!

34
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,530
All my friends are here! All my memories are here too!

35
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,740
Is it okay for my school life to be ruined just because I don't study well?!

36
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,770
They made it nasty. Our school's bul-burg is so much tastier.

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,470
Don't eat it. Give it to me. Give me a to-go box!

38
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,830
Leave it! You better not take a bite.

39
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,320
- My mom told me to transfer.
- Same here.

40
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,000
Listening to my mom made me want to study out of pettiness.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,280
But do you really think that we can do this?

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,980
Why can't you?

43
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,180
Why not? Let's show our moms.

44
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,900
Let's do it.

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,990
We will be learning about tenses today.

46
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,300
Teacher, what's a tense?

47
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,450
Tenses pertain to the past, present, and future.

48
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,050
The most important thing about tenses is seen by knowing the "be" verbs (am, are, is).

49
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,030
What's a "be" verb?

50
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,450
A "be" verb is... That's right.

51
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,790
It's possible for you to not know.

52
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:48,100
I am happy. I am sleepy.

53
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,900
I am a son.

54
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,590
The basics of a "be" verb. Let's start with only one.

55
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,830
Bok Soo, do you want to go first?

56
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,290
This looks hard.

57
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,360
"I am happy." It means I am happy.

58
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,640
"I am sleepy" is I am sleepy.

59
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,910
"I am a son" is I am a sun.

60
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,980
Oh, Elder! You're unexpectedly skilled!

61
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,830
Teacher! So what's a "be" verb?

62
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,180
The next question. What are those suffixes for passive verb change (for Korean)?

63
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,750
I told you guys this a minute ago.

64
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,640
Answer!

65
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,380
Yi hee... hee...
(The right answer: 이 yi, 히 hee, 리 lee, 기 gi)

66
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,990
Answer! Yi hee lee...

67
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,990
- Gi!
- Correct!

68
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,940
Yi si lee gi.

69
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,600
That isn't it.

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,980
I was almost there. Next one.

71
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,280
I'm starting.

72
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,430
Three types of honorific expressions in Korean?

73
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,890
Answer! Using an honorific subject, using an honorific object in a sentence,

74
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,290
- and using relatively honorific words.
- Correct!

75
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,410
Next problem. What are the special words for the honorific object?

76
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,080
Escort, give, inquire, and meet.

77
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,870
- Incorrect!
- What's wrong with you? Escort, give, inquire, and pay a visit.

78
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,180
Correct!

79
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,590
Oh, that scared me!

80
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,190
- Sorry.
- Ah, Teacher.

81
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,560
My heart is racing already.

82
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,460
Seolsong High

83
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,600
Education Board Department

84
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,990
I know the director of Seolsong High, Im Sae Kyeong, very well.

85
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,140
It seems that you have a lot of misunderstandings about her.

86
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,050
She is not a person to commit this kind of corruption.

87
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,100
This is really happening at the school.

88
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,450
The school is running under the system to rank the students mainly by grade.

89
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,280
It's extremely discriminating and makes students feel an inferiority complex

90
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,880
and a sense of relative deprivation compared to those who have better grades.

91
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,590
This society is running based on that discrimination already

92
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,270
because it's efficient.

93
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,200
You should teach your students what the reality is.

94
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,900
School has to be that way as well?

95
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,860
As a member of the education board, how can you value education with efficiency?

96
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,680
Are the kids machines?

97
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,170
No, I spared some time for you, but you don't have the right mindset!

98
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,730
Kids, let's stop here. Hurry and go.

99
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,250
Let's go. I'll drop you off.

100
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,670
Goodbye.

101
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,810
- Son Soo Jeong.
- What?

102
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,340
Are you a person who carries debts? I'm the kind of person who can't live with debt.

103
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,190
Debt? What does that mean?

104
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,130
No, if you slept at my house...

105
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:16,080
Why... here... here... my girlfriend...

106
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,980
Why can't I sleep at my girlfriend's

107
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,530
house once?

108
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,330
Let's do that then.

109
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,590
As expected. Son Soo Jeong is a contemporary woman (with an open-mind).

110
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,960
- Don't be nervous. We can just hold hands and go to sleep.
- Huh?

111
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,770
Okay.

112
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,100
Kang Bok Soo, are you sleeping?

113
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,680
Are you really sleeping?

114
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,010
Are you sleeping in this situation?

115
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,470
Are you really sleeping while only holding hands?

116
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,820
Wow, I must be crazy.

117
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,850
Why did I teach him about platonic relationships

118
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,150
and make him too straight up?

119
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,260
Patience makes the soul stronger.

120
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,810
Patience makes the soul stronger.

121
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,530
Patience makes the soul stronger.

122
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,900
Makes a soul stronger, my ass.

123
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,400
Hey, Son Soo Jeong.

124
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:59,480
I tried really hard to endure it, but I'm not able to because of you.

125
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,930
♫ Take a look, take a look ♫

126
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,610
♫ I just wanna be your sky, my love  ♫

127
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,290
♫ Something I have in memory ♫

128
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:22,000
♫ Such an embracing blue sky  ♫

129
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,660
♫ I just wanna be your sky, my love  ♫

130
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,390
♫ Your warmth wrapped around me  ♫

131
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:36,500
♫ Such an embracing blue sky ♫

132
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,480
♫ Blue sky, blue sky  ♫

133
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,380
♫ You’re in my memory ♫

134
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,150
♫ Blue sky, blue sky  ♫

135
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,840
♫ You’re in my blue sky ♫

136
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,050
♫ You’re in my blue sky ♫

137
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,460
Seolsong High School should abolish extreme discrimination

138
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,190
What the?

139
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,750
Teacher, are you seriously protesting by yourself?

140
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,730
It just happened that way. Other methods just don't seem to work on them.

141
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,040
You should've told us. Let's do it together.

142
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,970
Hey! You should just go.

143
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,610
Teacher, you shouldn't do this alone. It's cold out here.

144
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,530
Teacher Son, you should go in and teach your students.

145
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,090
And you, Kang Bok Soo, should go in and study hard.

146
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,010
Then what about you, Teacher?

147
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,520
Well, I should stay out here and fight for justice.

148
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,050
I was dropped from teaching duties, so I should at least do something meaningful.

149
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,430
Please go and do your thing.

150
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,250
Hurry up and go.

151
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,540
This is humiliating to show the students and the media might smell something funny going on too.

152
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,480
And ever since the Oh Yeong Min and Kang Bok Soo incidents, the media seems to be looking into our school more often.

153
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,090
Don't worry since I took care of that already. Principal, you can leave now.

154
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,940
There's a meeting with the man in charge of the committee today, right?

155
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,420
That's right, it will be tonight.

156
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,130
You seem to be cool since you are a young man and all.

157
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,620
It ended up taking a lot of time since I wanted to proceed with things without it getting out of control.

158
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,610
I think it's time for you to start discussing with me the other matters you've been working on with my mother.

159
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,810
What do you mean by other things?

160
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,920
Of course, it's the student records book.

161
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,960
Don't you think we should come up with a solid collaboration on this

162
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,650
since it's the most important thing when it comes to college admissions?

163
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,960
You know how I always guarantee the sufficient donation, right?

164
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,190
Are you planning to change the name of the donation account to yours?

165
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,890
No, ma'am.

166
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,590
When it comes to the donation, you can deposit it to my mother's account as usual.

167
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:05,980
I will be able to help you and other students' parents by knowing better about how things are done.

168
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,130
The school has been filled with all kinds of commotion.

169
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,600
I heard that problematic teacher has started a one-person protest, am I right?

170
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,780
The problem with that teacher will be resolved soon, thanks to you writing up a complaint so promptly.

171
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,780
Seriously, what should we freaking do about this Oh Se Ho?

172
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,150
He's coming up with all kinds of schemes to destroy Teacher Park.

173
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,110
I guess the best way to go about it is to get the media in on it, right?

174
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,240
We should go for it right away, as soon as we gather up all the data.

175
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,560
We have to reveal it all at once so we can destroy them all at once too.

176
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,000
CLOSE CODE

177
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,660
CLOSE CODE OK

178
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,370
The door is open.

179
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,750
Seolsong High second-year class placement test. Ivy class. Korean Language.

180
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,460
Why did you come to see me at this hour when you should be going out on a date?

181
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,740
I can't keep still when my teacher here is suffering.

182
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,960
Here you are.

183
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,700
What is this?

184
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,260
Bank Statement: Deposit

185
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,090
Hey Bok Soo, this is...?

186
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,880
The people from 'My Favor for You' and Soo Jeong are also helping out with this investigation.

187
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,890
I haven't been able to gather up all the sources yet, but once I do, I'm going to reveal it right away.

188
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,150
This is my responsibility. I—

189
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,200
Teacher, this is my revenge as well.

190
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,780
So please hold out a bit longer, Teacher.

191
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,860
Soon, I'm going to be able to destroy the seeds of the corrupt people.

192
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,590
And then...

193
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,110
Here.

194
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,420
For you.

195
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,920
Bok Soo, I want you to be my son.

196
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,830
Seriously, you're grossing me out. What's wrong with you, Teacher?

197
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,560
And besides, my mom has high standards.

198
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,340
My mom is all about looks, so if you are not good looking, then she just won't care at all.

199
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,170
Teacher, can't you just tell by looking at my face?

200
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,760
Am I supposed to look decent like you?

201
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,260
Yes, sir.

202
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,130
First of all, let me explain it to you, sir.

203
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,270
First, it's about the corruption of the student records book case.

204
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,790
This here is the bribe.

205
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,140
This is the account here.

206
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,630
One person protest Park Dong Joon.
Seolsong High School's extreme discrimination.

207
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,570
- Hello, Teacher.
- Hi, kids.

208
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,440
Hello, Teacher.

209
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,380
Teacher, isn't it cold out here? Here you go, sir.

210
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,190
Thanks, kids.

211
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,130
I'm cheering you on, Teacher. Good luck, Teacher!

212
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,730
Thanks, kids. Hurry up and go in now.

213
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,630
It's cold.

214
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,040
Hello.

215
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,490
Thank you.

216
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,950
Hello.

217
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,950
- I'm cheering you on.
- Thanks.

218
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,020
Hello.

219
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,060
It's cold. Hurry up and go in.

220
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,850
Hello there.

221
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,150
- Hello.
- Hi, kids.

222
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,920
Wildflowers! Let's go!

223
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,090
Alright kids, let's start the exam. Good luck.

224
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,380
How do I solve this?

225
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,290
Wildflowers, good work.

226
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,400
This is my first time ever solving problems on an exam.

227
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,720
Did you do well?

228
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,000
For some reason, there were a lot of number threes.

229
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,610
What about number two?

230
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,210
Man.

231
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,100
It was crazy.

232
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,500
That was tough.

233
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,180
I feel strange.

234
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,210
I know, right? I feel like I burnt something wild.

235
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,000
That's so true. I think this is my first time ever studying like this since I was born.

236
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,190
You did well.

237
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,490
We didn't really do all that well. We didn't get the grades we wanted after all.

238
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,480
Hey kids, this is what Celen Keller said.

239
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,290
If you do your best, nobody knows what kind of miracle it will bring.

240
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,020
Uncle, it's not Celen Keller. It's Helen Keller.

241
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,030
I wish that a miracle will happen.

242
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,810
Second-year student class standardized exam grade by class

243
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,370
Class 1 (ivy class) - 90.7 average

244
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,760
Class 2 (sky class) - 87.6 average

245
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,120
Class 3 (watermelon class) - 67.5 average

246
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,940
Class 4 (wildflower class) - 51.8 average

247
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,890
51.8

248
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,990
Seolsong High School second-year student ranking list

249
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,930
First place: Class 4 (wildflower class), Yoon Seung Woo

250
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,180
What kind of nonsense is this?!

251
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,220
Soo Jeong, I mean Teacher Son.

252
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,230
This is insane. This is so crazy.

253
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,040
No way.

254
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,090
Is this even right, huh?

255
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,620
Is this an error or what?

256
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,560
Second-year student class standardized exam.
The upper ranking student list.

257
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,140
Second place, Lee Chae Min
(Second year, class one, ivy class)

258
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,550
First place, Yoon Seung Woo
(Second year, class 4, wildflower class)

259
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,030
Yoon Seung Woo, wow!

260
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,130
Epic! Yoon Seung Woo, you are awesome!

261
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:55,990
What kind of guy are you, man?

262
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,700
This is so great!

263
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,050
No way.

264
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:10,250
Does this even make any sense?!

265
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,780
That stupid loser.

266
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,420
I wonder why he is destroying what belongs to the school.

267
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,920
Teacher, are you being serious?

268
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,300
That's what I'm saying. Our dear Seung Woo here is the number one student in the whole school?

269
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,420
Wow, you're incredible, Yoon Seung Woo. You are perfect to be a character in a novel.

270
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,510
From worst to best?

271
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,100
Should I tell you something even more amazing?

272
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,330
Gather up, kids.

273
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,590
Our class's average score was over 50 points!

274
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,060
Teacher, what about me?

275
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,330
Your rank dropped because of him.

276
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,150
- You were the one who raised it.
- Who cares, whatever.

277
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,280
You should treat us at the snack bar, man.

278
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,830
Awesome, a free bulgogi burger.

279
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,030
You should do some studying.

280
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,500
The overall class standardized exam for this week will be invalid.

281
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
Have them re-tested.

282
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,860
What do you mean, Director?

283
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,170
There is circumstantial evidence that the test papers were leaked.

284
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,810
By my class? What are you trying to pull right now?

285
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,090
The class average increased by thirty points in one week's time.

286
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,930
That is because the average of our class was originally so low—

287
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:31,000
The school's last place getting a hundred on the exam is abnormal.

288
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,920
You can't suspect students just because the student got a better grade than on his previous exams.

289
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:41,030
Teacher Park, you know very well

290
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,390
that you can't tutor a student for tuition outside of school property.

291
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,680
I swear to the teaching ethic that I never did such a thing.

292
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,520
How do you explain this?

293
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:05,260
This... has nothing to do with the exam.

294
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,800
Then what were you doing? Can you testify what was in that?

295
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:23,300
I suspect that you could have tutored the wildflower class students after school for tuition.

296
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,350
The day you and Kang Bok Soo met,

297
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:31,230
we found traces of someone opening the safe that had the exam questions.

298
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:38,820
The only ones who know the safe's password are the principal and you, Teacher Park, Chief of School Affairs.

299
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,780
I can swear on my life that there was no such incident.

300
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,100
There's no need for you to put your life at stake.

301
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,280
You can testify about the rest during the disciplinary committee.

302
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,820
With this, we will be expelling Kang Bok Soo.

303
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,440
Oh Se Ho, you're crazy.

304
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,780
Does what you're doing make sense? How could you, to Teacher Park—

305
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,490
Then, you can't reveal what was in that bag on the photo.

306
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,400
Teacher, we can't let Bok Soo get expelled like this.

307
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,990
We did nothing wrong so let's do an official investig—

308
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:26,380
With this incident, Bok Soo will again receive misunderstandings from people.

309
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:33,700
We can't hurt him in the same way even though we can't prove the truth.

310
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,530
Then what should we do?

311
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,190
It's my fault.

312
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,640
I'll take care of it.

313
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,390
Teacher.

314
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,420
I knew you were going to come.

315
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,470
But I am not sure if you're going to rant at me or beg me.

316
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,280
Or both of them?

317
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,280
I will take all responsibility and leave, so leave Bok Soo alone.

318
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,070
What a tearful sacrifice. Teacher, you're always just thinking about Kang Bok Soo till the end, making me sad.

319
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,510
Se Ho, you can't do this to Bok Soo.

320
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,550
He didn't do anything wrong.

321
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,090
Finish this up and sign this first.
Resignation Letter

322
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,640
I don't want to hear you out.

323
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,070
Resignation Letter

324
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,380
Signed: Park Dong Joon

325
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,440
Se Ho, making others suffer

326
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,330
doesn't mean your suffering will disappear.

327
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,980
You'll only be suffering more.

328
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,200
Just reprimand me like you want to!

329
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,440
Don't pretend to be a good person or teacher.

330
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,760
You're angry!

331
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,130
I am harassing you and your beloved Kang Bok Soo

332
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,390
to this degree.

333
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:26,550
I understand that you've been hurt a lot too.

334
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,640
How could I reprimand you?

335
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,290
Falling off the rooftop? I already recovered from that.

336
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:40,050
No, your heart is still hurt.

337
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:51,830
Se Ho, I'm sorry that

338
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,210
I couldn't help you.

339
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,730
What on earth is going on?

340
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,490
That's what I'm saying. The school is so scary. How can we live?

341
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,960
So why did you do that?

342
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,880
Notify students that the last placement test result

343
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,190
has been annulled.

344
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,120
Do well and keep your mouths closed so that rumors do not spread.

345
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,490
Hurry and go!

346
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:14,230
How must the students in the ivy class feel?

347
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,780
What's wrong?

348
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,040
What happened?

349
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,900
Teacher!

350
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,370
Teacher!

351
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,290
Teacher!

352
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,790
Give me this.

353
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,470
- Hurry and give it to me.
- What?

354
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,520
Hurry and give it to me!

355
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,390
What is all of this?

356
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,300
You becoming like this because of me. I'm going to quit this place.

357
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,030
I-I'm fine.

358
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,260
I'm not fine though!

359
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,280
Don't do it. You can't.

360
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,480
Let go of me now.

361
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,990
- You punk.
- Let go of me!

362
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,040
If something bad happens to you—

363
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:18,160
If I can't protect you this time...

364
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,860
then I won't be able to take it.

365
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:30,400
I won't be able to be resilient enough.

366
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:49,080
Bok Soo, this time, you definitely have to graduate.

367
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,280
Please.

368
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:33,160
