1
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,170
Nine years ago, Kang Bok Soo

2
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,100
had to leave school unfairly without having done anything wrong.

3
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,940
Even so, he returned to school.

4
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,270
He didn't mind putting himself in danger

5
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,640
in order to reveal to the world how rotten and corrupt this school is.

6
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,940
Although I...

7
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,560
I am a person who has committed a shameful sin,

8
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,140
my feelings of love for Kang Bok Soo...

9
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,540
are honorable.

10
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,750
The traces of overseas accounts for promotion outside of organization

11
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,730
Please make sure to deliver this to Bok Soo.

12
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,330
I don't think he'll accept it if it's from me.

13
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,720
You must give it to Bok Soo—

14
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,450
No, no.

15
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,080
You do it yourself.

16
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,420
You must. Don't run away anymore. Okay?

17
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,340
Hey, jerk. Where do you think this is for you to come?

18
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,720
Leave. Okay? Leave.

19
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,550
CEO, don't use violence. You never know what kind of crazy charge this bastard is going to press against you.

20
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,330
Hey! You're dead if you mess with my CEO.

21
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,940
I came because I have a favor to ask of Kang Bok Soo.

22
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,880
The CEO is me and I won't accept a favor from a jerk like you. Get out.

23
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,600
Hey, Oh Se Ho.

24
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,670
Follow me.

25
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,180
Hey. Why did you come here?

26
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,590
Did you come to ask a favor?

27
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,440
I'm sorry but I can't listen to your favor of not messing with

28
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,870
your mother, your school, and you.

29
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,840
It's not a favor.

30
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,090
No. Maybe it's a favor?

31
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,670
While I was living with my uncle in America,

32
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,330
I found out that my mother was pocketing money under my uncle's name.

33
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,040
As you can see, she won't be able to get away from her sin by cutting a tail with this evidence.

34
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,030
Why are you giving this to me? Don't you just have to reveal this yourself?

35
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,480
I'm not qualified.

36
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,770
Even without this, there is plenty of evidence for the hearing.

37
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,940
And how can I trust you in accepting this?

38
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,130
- Kang Bok Soo
- This could be your trap as well.

39
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,940
This time, you can trust me.

40
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,130
How can I trust a jerk like you?!

41
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,030
How can you even ask me trust you

42
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,630
after what you did to me!?

43
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,560
Like you said, I'm trying to not run away

44
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,990
and to live differently. For the first time

45
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,910
I'm having courage.

46
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,320
Is it true that you were the very victim of Kang Bok Soo's crime?

47
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,570
Yes, I am

48
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,860
the victim of the crime that Kang Bok Soo committed nine years ago.

49
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,390
And the truth that I am revealing today...

50
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,840
is that I am not the victim but instead the assailant.

51
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,100
Not a victim but an assailant?

52
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,630
Nine years ago, by the misunderstanding

53
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,470
that Kang Bok Soo pushed me off the rooftop, he was expelled from the school.

54
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,690
But I

55
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,350
fell off from the rooftop by myself.

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,590
Then how did people come to misunderstand Kang Bok Soo like that?

57
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,280
It's because I lied that Kang Bok Soo pushed me off.

58
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,330
Then, why did you lie about such a thing?

59
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,470
I don't think the reason is important.

60
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,840
Whatever the reason is, I can't justify my actions.

61
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,120
The important thing is

62
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,130
that because of my lies, Kang Bok Soo

63
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,170
got kicked out of school nine years ago and even today

64
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,750
is swept up in many misunderstandings and rumors.

65
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,990
Although it's late,

66
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,950
I am finally confessing the truth.

67
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,740
I request of you reporters,

68
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,600
to spread the truth to many people.

69
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,580
I sincerely apologize to Kang Bok Soo

70
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,570
who has suffered

71
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,950
from my lies.

72
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,780
In order to take revenge,

73
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,210
I came to school.

74
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,240
However that revenge

75
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,570
is not simply personal revenge against

76
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:51,130
Director Im Se Gyeong and Director Oh Se Ho

77
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,360
who kicked me out of school nine years ago.

78
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,670
In the past, with a fabrication and power

79
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,530
the school has stepped on me.

80
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,070
Right now, Seolsong High's kids are

81
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,110
being discriminated against under a wrong school system

82
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,620
and treated as a means of earning profit for the school.

83
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,470
Meanwhile, they are losing their dreams and hopes.

84
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,280
As long as Director Im Se Gyeong is in this school,

85
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,440
there will be endless victims

86
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,020
like myself and current Seolsong High students.

87
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,620
Never again.

88
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,070
I will prevent kids from being unfairly treated,

89
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,950
changing the school like that.

90
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,210
That

91
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,820
is the real revenge that I must take.

92
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,290
Ah, Teacher Park! That person!

93
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,540
I told that geezer to go and farm in the country.

94
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,290
How could he be in that (high) position?

95
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,820
Oh, my neck. I feel pain.

96
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,090
Isn't Teacher Son crazy?

97
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,220
How is she planning to see the kids' faces that she's appearing in such a place?

98
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,100
Don't you think she's just resigning?

99
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,580
It's a resolved face.

100
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,450
Bok Soo sure is cool as I expected.

101
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,800
He hasn't changed at all. He's still the same as back then.

102
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,010
What do you mean cool?

103
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,510
Because of that one person, Kang Bok Soo, the school is a mess right now.

104
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,990
It's not because of Kang Bok Soo that the school has turned out like this.

105
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,280
He's just revealing what the school was originally like.

106
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,960
Let's acknowledge what we have to acknowledge.

107
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,900
I devoted my whole life to education.

108
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,810
My passion and sincerity

109
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,620
were condemned cruelly.

110
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,540
This is...

111
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,730
so unfair and my heart hurts.

112
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,150
I will fight till the end.

113
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,890
I will for sure

114
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,030
reveal the truth.

115
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,970
Oh! It's Kang Bok Soo!

116
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,750
Please keep in line.

117
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,030
Did you know that Seolsong High's ex-director Oh Se Ho

118
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,040
revealed that he is the assailant in your incident nine years ago?

119
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,010
What did you say?

120
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,170
He has revealed that you did not push him and that he himself jumped off. He said he was sorry to you.

121
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,410
How do you feel?

122
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,170
Great job.

123
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,170
- Teacher.
- Hm?

124
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,670
Are you really going to be like this?

125
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,300
I got a chill when I saw you.

126
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,770
It was Teacher Park's big picture.

127
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,590
Don't be too surprised yet.

128
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,400
What's this? You already knew?

129
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,820
But you didn't tell the CEO?

130
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,550
Attention. Let's toast together.

131
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
- Who will give a word?
- The teacher who made a comeback.

132
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,770
You do it, Teacher.

133
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,920
Ah, no. Today's hero is Bok Soo.

134
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,360
Let's just have anybody do it and drink.

135
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,030
Okay. Then, after Teacher Park, I will say something.

136
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,340
Okay. Then I...

137
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,020
For the infinite prosperity of this restaurant—

138
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,150
Hey, hey. Nothing like that.

139
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,090
Today is a very special day.

140
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,950
So something truthful and selfish, please.

141
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,860
Is that so? Then...

142
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,120
To celebrate

143
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,770
my second life.

144
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,800
Cheers!

145
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,350
Cheers!

146
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,080
Cheers!

147
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,380
What is he saying?

148
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,420
Bok Soo's turn now.

149
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,900
Well, you all went through

150
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:11,480
thick and thin with me for a while, my family, friends,

151
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,180
Teacher Park,

152
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,910
and my girlfriend.

153
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:26,550
From now on, let's all be happy.

154
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,600
Alright! Let's all be happy!

155
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,030
Let's all be happy!

156
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,370
Hurray!

157
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,550
Congressman, I'm so disappointed in you.

158
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,970
You ate up all that money, so you should be able to at least take care of something like this!

159
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,250
Who cares if the controversy gets bigger over private school law or not!

160
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,500
You should prevent my imprisonment first!

161
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:05,260
Who the hell is Kang Bok Soo to make you do this to me?!

162
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,150
He's the one who treated me with warmth for the first time in my life.

163
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,630
You crazy little punk. Only for that reason?

164
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:23,140
When you ordered me to answer that Kang Bok Soo pushed me off nine years ago,

165
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,880
I shouldn't have done that.

166
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,360
Kang Bok Soo was the one who pushed you off of there, right?

167
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,370
I should've testified then that I wanted to die because of you.

168
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,320
It's driving me crazy that I didn't do that.

169
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,320
I was a little puppy that wanted to be loved so much.

170
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,070
"It was because of Kang Bok Soo."

171
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,190
I made a pledge to myself saying that I wanted to die because of Kang Bok Soo.

172
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,580
I ended up just hating and bullying the wrong person instead.

173
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:05,010
The thing that I should truly hate and detest is you, after all.

174
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,800
Then leave.

175
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,190
Out of my house immediately.

176
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,810
Okay.

177
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,640
Like I am not your child,

178
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,290
I no longer have a mother either.

179
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,720
I requested to close down Seolsong High School.

180
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,770
Hey! Don't do that! If you do that, you'll get arrested.

181
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,010
I came up here every time I was truly frustrated about something and screamed at the top of my lungs like this.

182
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,350
Nobody came after me though.

183
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:51,020
I feel like whatever has been tugging at me for a long time is finally released tonight.

184
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,120
I'm still relieved though.

185
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,850
I know it's late but I was still able to set things straight in the end.

186
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,570
I wonder what Oh Se Ho is really thinking though.

187
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,760
He probably regrets what he did nine years ago?

188
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,130
Just like what I did in the past.

189
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,650
I think that woman, Im Se Gyeong is the one who really screwed everything up.

190
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:17,680
I seriously can't believe that she was a mother and an educator on top of that.

191
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,520
She seriously needs to be punished for what she did.

192
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,180
Bok Soo.

193
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,960
You were so cool today.

194
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,280
You really did a good job.

195
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,050
You were the one who did really well.

196
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,800
The thing that you did the very best was this.

197
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,940
- "Yes, I do really love Kang Bok Soo."
- Hey!

198
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,500
You want to die? Don't copy me.

199
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,660
- Soo Jeong.
- Huh?

200
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:01,010
I love you too.

201
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,650
I know. I can just feel it by looking into your eyes.

202
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,330
Cheer up, no matter what happens tomorrow.

203
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:20,420
You really did do the right thing. I'm so proud of you.

204
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:30,820
Bok Soo, I was able to find my dream because of you so let's go find yours now.

205
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,500
But my dream is to just become Son Soo Jeong's boyfriend though.

206
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,220
But that dream already came true though.

207
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,520
Okay, let's do that.

208
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,090
Honey, take a look at this.

209
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,100
Seolsong High School's 300 million won slush fund?

210
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,290
This is the news about Seolsong High School, which caused the worst school scandal in history.

211
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,690
The public hearing was conducted by the educational board due to the accusation from the returning student Kang Bok Soo.

212
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,450
During that, it has been reveealed that 300 million of the Seolsong High's slush fund

213
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,600
was used as the construction fund for building Seolsong University.

214
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,610
And this is becoming a big controversy.

215
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,780
Director Im Se Gyeong of Seolsong High School has been pointed out as the main culprit of the scandal.

216
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,260
And starting today, she will be summoned for an investigation by the prosecution for this case.

217
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,350
Director Im has transferred the funds to her foreign account overseas

218
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,970
to purchase the property for Seolsong University, and this is what she is getting charged for.

219
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,490
The true owner of that land is Nicholas Im, and his Korean name is Im Tae Hoon.

220
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,490
It's also revealed that he is the blood-related brother of Director Im.

221
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,290
Stay back. We are from the prosecutors office.

222
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,000
We are with the prosecutors office.

223
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,730
We will proceed with the search and seizure.

224
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,410
Go for it.

225
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,560
We are from the prosecutors office.

226
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,540
Everyone, please take your hands off of everything.

227
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,340
The director isn't here and neither is the principal.

228
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,220
Then does that mean I'm the one with superiority here?

229
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,570
Oh my.

230
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,620
Everyone, please don't be flustered.

231
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,390
I'm here as the qualified superintendent of education for being the member of the committee.

232
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,880
I'll be managing and supervising everything regarding Seolsong High from now on.

233
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,620
Huh?

234
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,950
But I already—

235
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,900
I knew it from the start!

236
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,920
I knew that Teacher Park would be doing something great someday!

237
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,310
Welcome, sir! Welcome aboard!

238
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,060
I'm so glad to see you again, sir!

239
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,130
You looked really great on TV too.

240
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,740
Yay!

241
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,330
Kang Bok Soo! Kang Bok Soo!

242
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,660
Kang Bok Soo! Kang Bok Soo!

243
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,390
Kang Bok Soo!

244
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,160
Hey, hey, hey!

245
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,880
You are famous, Elder. I need to brag about it.

246
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,180
Look over here, please.

247
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,190
Hey, get in line dammit!

248
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,520
Hey, get out of the way.

249
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,860
Is it true about God Soo Jeong?

250
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,740
It's not true what was being said at the public hearing yesterday, right?

251
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,830
I knew something was up when I watched the whistle-blower thing in the video on the internet.

252
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,530
Wouldn't a teacher be fired for carelessly saying stuff like that?

253
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,790
How are we supposed to see our teacher now?

254
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,850
We will be start the assembly through broadcasting.

255
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,010
Students from each class, please turn on your TV.

256
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,030
Let's go.

257
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,020
Hello everyone. My name is Park Dong Joon and

258
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,970
I'm a committee member who has been reinstated as the qualified superintendent of education.

259
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:21,120
Students of Seolsong High, all kinds of things that have been going on within the school have caused

260
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,880
you to feel insecure about things, which I do understand.

261
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,150
The lake water that's not flowing but instead gathered up might look clean on the surface

262
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,200
but inside, there can be all kinds of dirty materials.

263
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,480
Wow, Teacher Park looks really nice on the TV screen.

264
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,920
He has rejuvenated indeed.

265
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,740
Hey, let's hear him out.

266
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,020
When you flip the floor and clean it, it might become rather dirty temporarily,

267
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,300
but if you avoid cleaning because you are scared of that

268
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,030
then you'll never be able to have a clean environment.

269
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:56,270
All the things that you're experiencing here at Seolsong High School are the things that I just mentioned.

270
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:02,180
So students, please don't play along with all the fuss that's going on in the school.

271
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,710
But instead, goof off like you normally would like any other times. Play and have a good time as usual.

272
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,960
Play hooky from time to time. And when the time comes, do some studying too.

273
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,650
So please live like you used to.

274
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,900
Fight on, Seolsong High!

275
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,610
Let's go!

276
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,980
Fight on!

277
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,760
He looks better on TV than expected.

278
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:21,490
Kids, do you remember we were going to do a self-introduction?

279
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,820
I thinking about doing my own today.

280
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,760
I am a corrupted teacher.

281
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,410
I never thought I'd introduce myself like this.

282
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:46,740
I had no dream and did nothing but study.

283
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,320
But a friend of mine helped me find a dream to be a teacher.

284
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,850
I shouldn't have done it if I thought about him.

285
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,650
But because I really wanted to become a teacher...

286
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:04,650
No because I wanted to become a full-time teacher, I paid for it.

287
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:09,230
And now, in order to take responsibility for that shameful action,

288
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,750
I am planning to let go of my teaching position.

289
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,350
Kids.

290
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:30,930
You do know that you're such great kids who raised the class average to over 50 points by studying really hard.

291
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,770
You guys gave me courage.

292
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,440
That I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

293
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,100
So... do it. Anything. Like now, just do it.

294
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,420
Although I'm leaving this school, let's just remember this one thing:

295
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,060
You guys are all flowers.

296
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,650
Whether you bloom on a mountain or in a field, you're all flowers.

297
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:02,840
Even when you are nameless like a bridal wreath or bush clover, you're still flowers.

298
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,230
It's a flower even if it blooms fast or if it blooms late.

299
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:12,160
It's a flower even if it blooms in the daytime or during the dark night.

300
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,660
As you live, there will be many times where you're discouraged.

301
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,480
Every time that happens, let's remember this one thing.

302
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,620
You guys... are all flowers.

303
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:37,290
A wildflower that blooms again even if stepped on once.

304
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:53,280
You're not the only one living in the world, Teacher Soo Jeong.

305
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,230
Being a social person is about compromising,

306
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:00,800
even if you don't like how things are.

307
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,520
But you just had to... Ah, really.

308
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,280
Is it because she's young?

309
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,520
Do you think it's because we don't have a conscience or something?

310
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,380
We know everything but for the sake of the organization,

311
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,180
for the sake of the whole instead of the individual...

312
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:19,230
I'm telling you this as a life senior. If you keep living like that, you'll break.

313
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,320
Don't you know that those individuals consist of a group?

314
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,950
"Just accept it as it is and compromise."

315
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,710
"Shut your mouth and live quietly. You can move past it if you ignore it."

316
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,110
Are you going to teach your kids that?

317
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:36,700
I'd rather be broken than become a teacher like that.

318
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,790
You teachers can keep living all bent up!

319
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:44,210
Slouchy and bent. In a very shabby style.

320
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:56,640
Counseling Room

321
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,760
They're saying such obvious things.

322
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,660
I had so many worries about my future, but you helped me a lot. Thank you.

323
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,180
You've suffered a lot during all this time.

324
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,920
I did. An awful lot.

325
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:55,500
Maybe that's why I feel like these times will remain in my memories for a long time.

326
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,410
Did you think about what you're going to do now?

327
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,680
I've been working really hard in career counselling the kids all this time,

328
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,220
but what should I do about mine?

329
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,050
Teacher, could you career counsel me?

330
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,210
No way. You're an adult now so you figure it out yourself.

331
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,340
Teach, I need encouragement and compliments since I am going to be unemployed from now.

332
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:17,140
What's wrong with being unemployed? The person who's first place in your life is you.

333
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,460
That's true.

334
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,840
I did come from being the school's first place.

335
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,220
Everything will turn out well.

336
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,990
♫ The breeze that passed  ♫

337
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,960
♫  by last winter  ♫

338
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,160
What are you doing? Are you guys sending me off now?

339
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,680
Well, to encourage the unemployed?

340
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,150
Teacher, I'm jealous. You don't have to come to school tomorrow.

341
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,410
Then do you want to pack up your bags right now?

342
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,950
Yeah, we'll pack your bags up.

343
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,890
Teacher, what are you going to do now?

344
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,080
Then does that mean you can openly date Bok Soo now?

345
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,610
I'm a little jealous about that.

346
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:45,450
If you break up with Elder, come to me. I'll accept you.

347
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,850
Yoon Seung Woo, I'm not interested in younger guys.

348
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,280
You can't go to the Han River out of desperation or something.

349
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,700
I want to live for a long time.

350
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,830
There are so many delicious things in this world. I won't die before I get to eat them all.

351
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,480
I won't die.

352
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,890
Auntie.

353
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,240
- Sh!
- Hey!

354
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,990
You guys know that God Soo Jeong is my aunt, right?

355
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,780
I'll see you at home.

356
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,040
Let's go, Son Soo Jeong.

357
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,750
Don't you know that we're at school?

358
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,130
I know. All the kids know.

359
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,860
Let's go.

360
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:25,970
♫ Love keeps entering me ♫

361
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,860
♫ Stay with me like this  ♫

362
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,220
Teacher!

363
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,940
You're also a flower!

364
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,610
♫ you’ll never leave me ♫

365
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:42,830
God Soo Jeong

366
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:46,200
♫  My love ♫

367
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:03,060
♫ Love keeps entering me ♫

368
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,780
♫ Stay with me like this  ♫

369
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:14,960
♫ Will you promise me  ♫

370
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:25,130
♫ That you’ll never leave me, my love ♫
