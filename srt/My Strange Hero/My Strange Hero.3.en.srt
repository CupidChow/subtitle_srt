Kang Bok Soo?

00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,410
That's great.

3
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,120
I did it. Since I saved her...

4
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,740
- Teacher! Open your eyes.
- $500...

5
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,090
- Gosh, seriously.
- Teacher, please open your eyes.

6
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,640
- Plus...
- What should I do?

7
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,560
Teacher, don't die. Please open your eyes.

8
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,210
Ah, seriously. Move over!

9
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,430
- Move over.
- Ahjussi.

10
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,300
Please save her.

11
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,150
Excuse me. Put an ambu on her quickly.

12
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,960
- Is she dead?
- One, two, three.

13
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,730
Please excuse us.

[Episode 3]

15
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,700
Is she awake?

16
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,350
But... do you know her? Why are you still here?

17
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,610
Is Son Soo Jeong your teacher?

18
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,530
Yes.

19
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,640
Why try to commit suicide?

20
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,610
I wasn't really trying to kill myself, but things got out of hand after I wrote on SNS—

21
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,240
Not you.

22
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,780
Ah... the teacher.

23
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,650
I am not sure. She suddenly asked me to die with her.

24
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,860
Anyhow, thank you for saving her.

25
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,830
Guardian for Son Soo Jeong, the patient is awake.

26
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,810
Hey.

27
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,050
You don't show appreciation with your lips only.

28
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,230
Take it. Show me your appreciation properly later.

29

010-1656-8307
Your Favor
Do anything for you

30
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,130
Your favor?

31
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,180
Mr. Oh Yeong Min! Mr. Oh Yeong Min.

32
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,840
Is he the one who saved her?

33
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Yes.

34
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,050
This is the person who saved her!

35
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,470
You are the hero who risked your life to save them. Please say something.

36
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,290
I just...

37
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,950
He's so handsome.

38
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,280
You can't do this here. Please leave.

39
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,340
Please say a word.

40
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,480
Kang...

41

Bok Soo?

42
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,430
Teacher, are you awake?

43
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,780
Teacher! Teacher!

44
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,380
You're Oh Yeong Min.

45
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,310
It was Yeong Min.

46
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,120
- Oh, that's a relief.
- We both almost died, Teacher.

47
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,820
Thank you! If it weren't for you,

48
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,920
- I wouldn't be able to see my grandma.
- Teacher.

49
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,650
The thing is... It wasn't me, but...

50
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,080
Yeong Min!

51
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,880
- Yeong Min!
- Mom!

52
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,960
Ah! My son!

53
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,160
Thank you, Teacher. Thank you so much.

54
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,180
Thank you.

55
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,320
I know you are a machine, but still, you shouldn't be like this.

56
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,590
I almost died because of you.

57
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,220
I still have 15 more months to pay off for the phone.

58
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,390
It's working. It's working. Kim Myeong Ho. Kim Myeong Ho.

59
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,160
Answer it. Please answer.

60
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,640
Oppa. If it's alright with you, press one.

61
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,210
What are you doing?

62
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,210
Won't you press it?

63
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,620
[Administrator Kim Myeong Ho]
The phone is turned off...

64
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,320
Hey, you f*cking %#... son of a bi*ch!

65
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,580
Hey, do you even know what kind of money that is?

66
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,660
That money is my father's accident settlement money.

67
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:23,860
My grandmother didn't even go to a hospital despite her illness saying she'll never use the money exchanged with her son's life.

68
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,620
The money she hid so deep and tight,

69
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,340
I handed it to you because I lost my mind over becoming a full-time employee.

70
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,350
Right. It was my fault. I am at fault, but...

71
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,360
the amount is too big. I just barely got out of Han River alive.

72
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,590
The world looked different when I came out.

73
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,190
It's funny how I have no fear. Hey!

74
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,320
I'll find you for sure and let you know how this feels.

75
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:55,340
Kim Myeong Ho, you better hide well cause if I find you, I'll rip off every strand of your hair!

76
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,360
Kim Myeong Ho! You're dead.

77
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,940
Excuse me.

78
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,010
I almost died today.

79
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,760
So can I please have a chicken leg?

80
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,000
In a meaning of blessing my rebirth.

81
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,970
Thank you.

82
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,700
Mr. Oh from S High School who made us worried came back.

83
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,770
Mr. Oh attempted suicide around 2 PM in the Han River area today.

84
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,220
- But thanks to his teacher and one brave citizen, he is recovering well.
- Over there! Over there!

85
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,790
That woman is me!

86
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,110
Why did they censor me when I'm not even a criminal?

87
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:09,090
People applauded the brave rescuer who jumped to save Teacher Son.

88
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:14,910
In front of S High School which caused this incident, there are many citizens...

89
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,120
Bok Soo?

90
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,490
It was really Kang Bok Soo.

91
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,790
Hey! Do you know what kind of money that was?

92
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,960
That money is my father's accident settlement money.

93
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,160
My grandmother didn't even go to a hospital despite her illness

94
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,680
saying she'll never use the money exchanged with her son's life.

95
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,750
Don't worry about it.

96
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,150
It has nothing to do with you.

97
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,110
Citizen Kang.

98
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,460
Hold on. It's not time to be freely looking back at memories.

99
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,750
Let's find the money.

100
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,340
They have all returned to their families safe and sound.

101
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,580
Teacher Son, has no outside injury without any mental...

102
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,160
Kang Bok Soo?

103
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,160
My goodness.

104
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,420
There are only a light flu-like symptoms.

105
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,570
Kang Bok Soo is as nosy as ever.

106
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,060
Teacher, you are so incredible. I can't believe you jumped into the water to save Oh Yeong Min.

107
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,470
You're so cool! The best! Seriously the best!

108
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,910
God Soo Jeong! God Soo Jeong!

109
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,350
God Soo Jeong! God Soo Jeong!

110
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,330
I know that you were worried about Oh Yeong Min, but he has returned to us safe and sound.

111
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,660
Let's give him a round of applause.

112
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,170
Yeong Min, go take a seat.

113
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,450
Prepare for your next class.

114
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,190
If you don't want to be here, you should just leave.

115
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,300
I came to this school because I really love the extreme discrimination system.

116
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,970
If that pathetic thing called "equal education for all" becomes a reality because of you

117
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,050
then you should prepare yourself. You freaking loser in life.

118
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,810
In front of the school where the incident was brought about, there are many different social groups

119
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,320
that are protesting to have S High School close down.

120
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,180
S High School hasn't said anything officially just yet.

121
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,200
Those people that have nothing better to do.

122
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,530
I know, right? It seems like those people just eat with nothing better to do.

123
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,520
Are you talking about me now?

124
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,340
Things are looking worse and worse.

125
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,390
There is a petition that has come up at the Blue House.

126
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,970
The number of protesters are increasing too.

127
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,180
Public opinion is scarier than law, huh?

128
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,210
What's the whole administration office thing about anyway?

129
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,600
Well, that's really nothing.

130
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,490
An anonymous letter was sent to the education office, and you call this nothing?!

131
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,510
Who was it? Who was it?!

132
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,300
You really want to see the school close down?!

133
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,610
Why are all of you so darn thoughtless?!

134
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,630
There's another thoughtless person coming in.

135
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,160
Teacher Son, you should have told us first when you got a call from Oh Yeong Min.

136
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,260
How could you as contractor make your own lousy judgement before telling us about it first?!

137
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,910
Pardon?

138
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,220
Even though I am a contractor, he probably trusted me more.

139
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,130
Teacher Son, did you get your head hit by something?

140
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,630
What's with your attitude, huh?!

141
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,260
Mr. Vice Principal.

142
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,300
If it weren't for Teacher Son, Yeong Min would've been in big trouble.

143
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,380
Be quiet!

144
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,340
Either way, she didn't do things in the right order.

145
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,570
Everyone should watch what you say.

146
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,790
I'm going to find out who sent that anonymous letter too.

147
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,090
There's no peace in this school ever.

148
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,930
This atmosphere so early in the morning is killing me.

149
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,590
Who wrote that anonymous letter?

150
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,410
Is it really that important who wrote it?

151
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,180
What's important is what the truth is.

152
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:17,560
And besides, there's a rumor going around the students that the teachers here even buy their way in.

153
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,250
How could you say that?

154
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,590
I'm so sorry, Ms. Son.

155
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,170
The school's atmosphere is so bad.

156
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,470
No, it's okay.

157
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,650
Yeah, don't take what the vice principal said to heart.

158
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,390
I mean you worked so hard and because of you, Teacher Son,

159
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,840
the image of killing students has gone away. Shouldn't he be saying something along the lines of this?

160
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,900
I know, right? It wouldn't be enough even if they did hire you as a full-time permanent teacher.

161
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,420
Are you okay, dear?

162
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,820
Yes, I'm really doing fine.

163
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,100
Sorry for making you guys worry.

164
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm so relieved though. I was so scared that you wouldn't be coming in.

165
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,620
You should be preparing for today's test questions then, don't you think so?

166
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,020
You should even do the questionnaire for the essay competition too.

167
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,330
You are free on the weekends, right? You also have to be one of the judges for the essay contest. Isn't that right?

168
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,060
She probably hasn't recovered yet.

169
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,410
Then who's going to do it?

170
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,760
Teacher Ma, do you want to do it then?

171
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,920
Me?

172
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,700
Teacher Jeong Yeh, you are being too much here to a person that barely came back alive.

173
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,560
You know, I really don't want to say this, but...

174
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,070
You'll continue to work on the lessons for the nights and weekend since it's your calling and your responsibility.

175
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,960
Isn't that right?

176
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,830
Of course.

177
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:33,200
The supplementary lessons that you can get money from will be your duty and the ones that you can't will by mine, right?

178
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,120
Teacher Son, what's the matter? They are your seniors

179
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,270
and just want to teach you to do a better job.

180
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,700
Why are you acting like you are teaching me stuff when you only send me out to make tea for you?

181
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,490
Oh could it be the tea ceremony? I don't want to learn that anymore, by the way.

182
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,790
You should teach these people that are seniors to me first.

183
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,670
Since they are more experienced with life after all.

184
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,350
Teacher Son.

185
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,390
When did I ever

186
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,820
make you go make tea for me?

187
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:13,170
I have to go make the test questions, so have a nice day, everyone.

188
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,110
Oh my, she did get her head injured after all.

189
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,360
I think she got hit in a major way.

190
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,570
I messed up so bad. I shouldn't have said anything.

191
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,660
What if I get fired before I find Kim Myeong Ho?

192
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,080
I should just sew up my mouth or something.

193
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,280
This 'brave citizen' award goes to a person named Kang Bok Soo who lives in Dong Seo County, Meogum Street 30-1.

194
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,670
You have shown great interest and understanding in police work,

195
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,720
and you came here to cooperate with the public order.

196
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,880
And you became a good example to others so this is why we give you this award.

197
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,930
You are wonderful.
Brave Citizen Award

198
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,880
The two people standing at the end on both sides, would you come out, please?

199
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,290
Ah, yes.

200
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,460
You two at the end on both sides, would you please step out of the way?

201
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,320
We'll try to have you stand with a lot of gap from everyone.

202
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,040
I'm going to take the photo now.

203
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,420
One. Two.

204
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,470
This person who saved Oh Yeong Min and the contract teacher...

205
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,310
Why does he look so familiar to me?

206
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:36,330
That Mr. Kang was somewhat involved in Se Ho's case in the past.

207
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,960
So this Mr. Kang is Kang Bok Soo, right?

208
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,300
Secretary Yoon, how did you deal with Kang Bok Soo at the time by the way?

209
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,220
After that incident we made sure to force him to be expelled from the school.

210
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,680
Couldn't graduate, eh?

211
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,930
I wonder if Se Ho will get hurt again because of this.

212
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,190
You think our Se Ho is that weak?

213
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,720
Allow Bok Soo to return to the school.

214
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,630
Se Ho.

215
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,750
Return to school?

216
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,960
An upperclassman who risked his life for his underclassman.

217
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,030
But that upperclassman couldn't graduate school.

218
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:30,040
And that school is willing to give him a chance once again.

219
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,770
Once Bok Soo comes back to school, everything will quiet down.

220
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,130
You know, people really dig that whole hero story and all.

221
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,140
Now you are starting to look more like my son.

222
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,390
You should say that you'll take responsibility for this incident as a whole and step away, Mother.

223
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,990
Isn't that why you called me in?

224
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:57,840
Shouldn't we show the people that the school has the will to reform?

225
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,910
Alright. This is why I called you in.

226
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,490
What are you doing? Get ready right away.

227
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:19,030
Look over here. This right here is called a "Brave Citizens Award."

228
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,890
Tell me who is more courageous than my son Bok Soo.

229
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,600
Oh, my son Bok Soo.

230
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,260
Here we are.

231
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,140
Look here, everyone.

232
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,860
Kang Bok Soo! Kang Bok Soo!

233
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,960
Kang Bok Soo!

234
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,390
Kang Bok Soo! Kang Bok Soo!

235
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,440
- Why did you come here?
- Why do you think?

236
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,040
This is all because I taught well.

237
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,680
Wow! I didn't even learn that much from you.

238
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,500
You punk.

239
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,380
Soo Jeong...

240
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,890
Did you meet her?

241
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,750
Why would I meet her?

242
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,060
I think there's definitely a reason your paths keep crossing like this.

243
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,670
- You should meet her—
- Meet her and do what?

244
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,870
What good would it do now?!

245
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:48,430
Bok Soo, you think you're an adult, huh?

246
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,270
As I see it, you're still a 16-year-old kid.

247
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,360
A kid only running away because he's scared to face the past.

248
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,410
What do you know to be saying that?

249
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:10,580
I think you two were forced to become adults with bruises in your hearts.

250
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,360
So meet now at least. Meet and—

251
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,010
It's fine.

252
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,510
Just go.

253
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,780
You have to get over your past to move forward.

254
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,400
You just get used to coping with the wounds, but they never go away.

255
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,750
Kang Bok Soo.

256
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,020
Get up.

257
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,800
The class president too.

258
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,310
Everyone, clap!

259
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:25,590
These two people's scores rose the most on the Korean test!

260
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,740
Hey, Kang Bok Soo's score went up by as many as 50 points.

261
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:38,090
But I was shocked that there are still more points left for him to get.

262
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,240
You punk.

263
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,150
However, Kang Bok Soo, you went through a lot of trouble. Class President, you did well.

264
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,550
Erase this and get ready for class.

265
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,520
Teacher!

266
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,300
Congratulating with only words?

267
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,480
That's it.

268
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,030
I was crazy.

269
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,900
Hey, class president!

270
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,240
If the other kids see, they'll misunderstand. Why're you telling me to come and go?

271
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,120
Stop right there.

272
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,160
- Stand straight.
- What?

273
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,100
Award for "If you try, it will happen."

274
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:22,310
Kang Bok Soo, the miracle man to raise his score by almost 4 times.

275
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:28,060
Although it's only 65 points, I present this award because of the possibility of a greater improvement.

276
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,340
Kang Bok Soo's teacher, Son Soo Jeong.

277
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,000
But what about the prize?

278
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,960
Hey. If you don't like it, give it back.

279
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,440
Give it.

280
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,570
From now on, call me the miracle man.

281
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,990
But is there really no prize?

282
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,790
There's none.

283
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,990
- What is this?
- Hey, Son Soo Jeong.

284
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,040
Why do you conserve love?

285
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,620
You know, I got super upset.

286
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,690
I reached the end of patience, but the prize.

287
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,340
There's no prize or anything. Everyone's trying to make it up with just words.

288
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,670
Wow, so suddenly, without any notice.

289
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,990
If you tell the other kids, I'll kill you.

290
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:03,480
It was at that age, the poem came to me.

291
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,490
I don't know, I don't know where it came from.

292
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,150
If it's from the winter or the pond,

293
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,360
I don't know when and where it came from.

294
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,760
No, it wasn't a voice

295
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,800
nor a word.

296
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,750
It was not silence, either.

297
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,310
I didn't know what to say.

298
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,320
My lips couldn't form the name for it.

299
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,690
My eyes were blinded,

300
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:40,020
and something had started in my soul.

301
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:47,110
And like that, my heart fluttered in the wind.

302
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,570
"If you try, it will happen" award

303
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:03,610
Yeah, can you find a person for me?

304
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,230
Kim Myeong Ho: 52-99 Majoro Dongseo-gu, Seoul

305
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,900
Where did he spend all that money to live in a place like this?

306
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,800
- On gambling.
- The bastard even gamble--

307
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,770
He does?

308
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,890
Yes, were you scammed by my dad too?

309
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,270
No, your dad did a favor for me so I'd really like to see him. Where could he be?

310
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,280
He doesn't come back for a while after he scams someone.

311
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,190
Then your mom at least?

312
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,060
I don't have a mom.

313
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,730
Wait, then he leaves you to be alone and doesn't come home?

314
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,920
Should I give you this at least?
