1
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,810
Counseling Office

2
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,730
They've got guts. How audacious.

3
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,980
No violence at school

4
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,410
No, it's a date after nine years.

5
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,620
No, no!

6
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,700
No, this sweet moment has to last longer.

7
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,910
I have to stop him. No matter what, I have to stop Yoon Seung Woo.

8
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,190
Hey, Yoon Seung Woo.

9
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,550
Let's talk.

10
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,460
Episode 19

11
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:34,070
Why are you at school at this late hour?

12
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,640
- I left my phone in my drawer at school.
- Ah!

13
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,600
Oh, really. You should have taken good care of it.

14
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,760
By the way, do you have a big mouth?

15
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,590
- What?
- It's not like you don't know a thing about loyalty, mercy, or manners,

16
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,640
and you don't intend to leak the privacy of an elder in your class to ruin his life.

17
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,460
You wouldn't embarrass me like that, right?

18
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,820
What are you doing right now?

19
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,030
You're saying you want to seal my mouth? Must mean what I saw was true.

20
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,300
Depending on how you do, I'll think about it.

21
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,620
This brat.

22
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,300
What should I do? I'm a teacher. What should I do?

23
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,220
First, calm down.

24
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,090
Why did you hug me at that time?!

25
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,690
I saw that you were sad and that made me sad, so I was trying to comfort you.

26
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,430
You're supposed to just comfort me. Why did you hug me?

27
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,130
What are we going to do if the kids see?

28
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,510
How could you hug me so affectionately and warmly?

29
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,240
Ah, I don't know. What do we do if the kids spread rumors?

30
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,150
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.

31
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,950
How?

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,850
Yoon Seung Woo!

33
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,730
Hey, Yoon Seung Woo!

34
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,450
Follow me.

35
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,780
- He said to follow him.
- Hey, you guys shouldn't come.

36
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,040
Elder, we are a set, though. We are like a needle and thread.

37
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,240
Bul-burger and milk.

38
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,990
I definitely told you, this is a problem between Yoon Seung Woo and me. Come out!

39
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,620
This bastard.

40
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,560
Only English

41
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,110
Bul...

42
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,890
Bul-burg.

43
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,400
What?

44
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,820
Hey, get three bul-burgs and then order everything you want.

45
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:10,550
Then I won't be rejecting your offer. Thank you, Elder.

46
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,990
Suddenly I have an appetite.

47
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,840
- Nano-cone, kohmi-ball, hot-bar, milk, and a chocolate cone, please.
- All right.

48
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,590
Oh wait, three of each please.

49
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,130
You got it.

50
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,290
With your strong will to come to the snack bar,

51
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,160
you've mastered the English of the convenience store.

52
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,410
It's basic English.

53
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,380
What you were thinking of

54
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,190
was absolutely right.

55
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,140
Unbelievable.

56
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,520
I've liked Son Soo Jeong

57
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,970
since nine years ago.

58
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,720
You're so pure-hearted, Elder.

59
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,100
So Korean men must have tight lips.

60
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,990
And... this... you don't really know.

61
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,620
You should give a chance to the grown-ups so that they can deal with things by themselves.

62
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,570
So this...

63
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,380
I don't know. Help me out. Keep it a secret.

64
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,490
It depends how you do.

65
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,140
Listen to yourself. Hey!

66
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,320
An elder told you this. You should say, "Yes, sir."

67
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,640
What? "It depends how I do"?

68
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,200
My mouth is suddenly ticklish (he feels like talking).

69
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,600
- You eat so well. Which one, which one?
- A drink.

70
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,790
A drink? Which one? Milk or—

71
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,880
- I don't like milk.
- Okay. Okay.

72
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,820
Hello.

73
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,380
Seolsong High

74
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,160
Did you guys not like lunch today or something?

75
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,850
Why is the atmosphere like this?

76
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,770
Today, we'll study Yeom Sang Seup's Mansejeon—

77
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,410
What's wrong? Open your textbooks.

78
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,930
Why are you guys like this?

79
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,880
Ask yourself why we are protesting.

80
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,420
I said stop it.

81
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,890
Hey, Oh Yeong Min. How much money did you bribe Teacher Park with?

82
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,730
I mean how much did you offer him for him to go crazy and—

83
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,610
You're the one who bribed, Lee Chae Min.

84
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,380
This bastard has gone crazy.

85
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,910
I have one more thing I'm curious about.

86
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,210
Did you raise your grades by yourself?

87
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,040
Or did you also with money...?

88
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,960
This bastard.

89
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,140
Hey! Hey!

90
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,650
Goodness.

91
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,680
Why are you getting in between? Step aside!

92
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,170
Oh Yeong Min! You're the only one who will suffer if you use violence. Don't do it.

93
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,020
What is this? Move!

94
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,540
What are you doing at school?!

95
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,900
Chae Min!

96
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,530
Are you okay?

97
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,830
Are you okay, Chae MIn?

98
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,350
What is going on?

99
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,830
Was it Student Kang Bok Soo again?

100
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,230
It wasn't him but Lee Chae Min—

101
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,100
Please submit the accident report. I will conduct a school violence committee meeting.

102
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,130
Geez.

103
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,610
Director, we heard there was a fight.

104
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,020
How slow you showed up. Prepare for a school violence committee meeting.

105
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,740
That punk just lives at school.

106
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,870
Does a young man not even have a date?

107
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,780
Why is he doing everything that I'm supposed to do?

108
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,920
Is he... perhaps firing me?

109
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,140
Oh, no way.

110
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:38,200
Well, he could be pressuring you to leave on your own.

111
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,440
Vice Principal, I'll be leaving first.

112
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,570
If you were gone, I'd be the principal.

113
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,130
It hurts.

114
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,100
What a crybaby. Lee Chae Min went to the hospital.

115
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,040
You didn't get that hurt.

116
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,650
Isn't this boy being a crybaby for no reason?

117
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,980
Not so sure. After hearing the news, Chae Min's mother came and made a fuss again.

118
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,420
You don't look like it, but are you good at fighting?

119
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,040
That's true. I thought I was watching a movie.

120
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,160
Why did you keep receiving hits all this time?

121
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,900
My mom told me not to fight.

122
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,300
Just stay quiet.

123
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,310
Your image breaks when you open your mouth.

124
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,980
Bring it here.

125
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,410
Chae Min definitely hit you first, right?

126
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,680
Yes.

127
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,100
All the kids saw.

128
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,890
Okay, but still it's a relief.

129
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,950
You must write the incident report clearly and thoroughly.

130
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,320
That's the most important.

131
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,230
Kang Bok Soo, you busy body. Why did you get involved?

132
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,360
I can't help you.

133
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,250
I heard Lee Chae Min say something about Teacher Park. Is he okay?

134
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,680
He has to write a report on his disciplinary actions from the debate competition.

135
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,130
So he's going to be a little upset.

136
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,140
Those ivy jerks won't stay still.

137
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,730
Report for the reason of receiving a disciplinary action

138
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,290
Testimony

139
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,700
Lee Chae Min hit Oh Yeong Min first.

140
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,980
It's true that Oh Yeong Min hit first.

141
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,010
Dean of Student Affairs and Teacher Son, come over here.

142
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,920
The testimonies are contradicting.

143
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,710
The ivy class says Oh Yeong Min hit him first.

144
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,160
The wildflower class say Lee Chae Min hit him first.

145
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,790
Did you plan this?

146
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,000
What do you mean?

147
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,870
The kids said Chae Min hit first—

148
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,470
No matter who saw it, you could tell Chae Min got hit a lot.

149
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,240
Would our Chae Min go around hitting people first?

150
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,040
The problem is the wildflower class.

151
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,550
Teacher, my Yeong Min isn't someone who'd hit Chae Min for no reason, either.

152
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,820
If he was, he'd have beaten him—

153
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,170
Be quiet! I'll figure it out so go back.

154
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,030
Hello.

155
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,280
Yes, Chae Min's mother.

156
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,120
Yes, don't worry.

157
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,870
The school will take care of it.

158
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,410
Please take this to the ivy class for me. The bell has rung, so I must go.

159
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,670
Yes, Mother.

160
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,920
Schedules for many awards

161
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,960
In-school English Speaking Competition

162
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,310
Award for volunteering

163
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,710
Does this make sense? That bastard hit Yeong Min first.

164
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,510
This bastard Lee Chae Min.
School Violence Committee Meeting for Oh Yeong Min

165
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,870
This is absurd. I'll be sure to write a letter and report them.

166
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,620
I'll write a report that can't be read without tears.

167
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,430
Our Yeong Min.

168
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,100
What are you doing?

169
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,240
What?

170
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,180
Why is Yeong Min supposed to be disciplined through the committee?

171
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,050
The kids already testified that Chae Min was the one who hit first.

172
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:47,570
Yoon Seung Woo, Kim Jae Yoon, and Yoo Si Won. Compared to these troublemakers,

173
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,350
ivy class students have more credibility in their testimonies.

174
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,080
This is why their regular behavior is important.

175
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,490
Vice Principal, how could you suspect the kids based on their grades?

176
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,990
I also believe my kids.

177
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,930
Teacher Son, the ivy class are all our students.

178
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,820
On what basis are you suspecting their testimony?

179
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,910
Enough.

180
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,510
If you have more to say, then say it in the school violence committee.

181
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,070
I have a good idea. Trust me.

182
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,100
I am really grateful. If you get in trouble over this, I will—

183
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,930
Don't worry, Bok Soo. If it's for you, I can do anything.

184
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,020
Thank you, I'm going.

185
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,840
Go, go.

186
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,770
Goodbye, Bok Soo. I won't say anything.

187
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,970
You surprised me! What are you doing here?

188
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,350
Tell me honestly.

189
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,400
Is it true what I just saw?

190
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,100
What is going on between Bok Soo and you?

191
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,420
Honestly?

192
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,110
I really like...

193
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,670
Enough!

194
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,320
Stop there.

195
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,560
When you didn't accept my heart,

196
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,400
I wondered if you might be (gay), but...

197
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,310
You're a bad person. Then why did you make me fall for you?

198
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,280
Why on earth? Why?

199
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,100
A friend.

200
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,400
He's a friend I really like.

201
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,070
Teacher Ji Hyeon. What kind of misunderstanding are you...

202
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,820
Hurry and get in.

203
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,910
Hurry, Kang In Ho!

204
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,410
Broadcasting Room

205
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,060
Tech Room/ Music Room

206
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,350
I'm clueless about computers. I'm scared of machines. I can't do it.

207
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,850
How do we do this?

208
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,520
I've only filmed before. I don't know these kinds of things.

209
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,370
Move, move, move.

210
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,380
Do you know how to do that?

211
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,720
Yeah, I was in the broadcasting team in middle school.

212
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,130
Wow, Kang In Ho!

213
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,300
What is this?

214
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,120
Why is it like that?

215
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,570
Isn't that Kim Jae Yoon?

216
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,030
Cute.

217
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,830
How childish.

218
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,820
Hey.

219
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,470
Why'd you turn that on? It's going to make everyone lose their appetite.

220
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,340
The-the next videos here.

221
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,720
How can you say that? Why would they lose their appetites?

222
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,310
Here.

223
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,450
Transfer Oh Yeong Min to another school after the school violence committee meeting.

224
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,590
It won't be difficult since he caused multiple problems already.

225
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:30,010
Then what about student Lee Chae Min who fought with him?

226
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,310
Isn't he the top student in this school?

227
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,590
That's true.

228
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,070
Director, are you really carrying out the transfer of the wildflower class?

229
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,400
Does your mother know?

230
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,780
Mother... will probably say I did well.

231
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,290
If the wildflower class disappears, how much do you think the school's average would rise?

232
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,050
You were supporting the class with instructors.

233
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,000
Why are you suddenly doing this after devoting a lot to the wildflower class?

234
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,300
I got rejected.

235
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,500
Excuse me?

236
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,690
Support for the instructors...

237
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,860
Since my offer got rejected, I have no choice but to use force.

238
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,950
Homeroom Teacher: Son Soo Jeong

239
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,780
Director, I'm so sorry.

240
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,900
I have something to say quickly to the principals.

241
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,570
What's going on?

242
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,040
The TV... The video!

243
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,230
I'm wondering about something else too.

244
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,140
Did you really raise your grades by yourself?

245
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,300
Was that also with money—

246
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,090
I will go right now to stop them!

247
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,030
You go ahead first!

248
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,560
Hurry.

249
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,880
You, you, you!

250
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,350
I'll open it in a bit.

251
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,230
Kang Bok Soo, you! Are you not going to move aside?

252
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,230
Are you not going to?! You brat!

253
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,140
Ah, Teacher! I need to love your students.

254
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,920
Let me give you a hug.

255
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,820
- Wait.
- Vice Principal.

256
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,290
I have a spare key.

257
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,300
Spare key! Spare key!

258
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,920
What do you think you are doing now?!

259
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,080
I am cleaning.

260
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,120
What did you say?

261
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,180
That belongs to us.

262
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,480
Teacher Son.

263
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,230
If there was such a video out there, you should've checked it out as the homeroom teacher and brought it to us!

264
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,910
Don't you think that's what you should've done?!

265
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,200
Why are you making things so much bigger than they should be, huh?!

266
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,690
That's what I'm saying, sir!

267
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,710
If I had known about it, I would've gotten the video from the students and brought it over to you right away.

268
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,700
I feel so betrayed since the kids didn't tell me about anything.

269
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,540
I will discipline the kids with severe punishment, sir.

270
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,230
You shouldn't be doing that.

271
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,250
Do Hyun, you did it.

272
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,110
No, that's not it.

273
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,480
Send me the video clip to my phone too. You have a back up on your phone, right?

274
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,280
Yes, ma'am. I made sure to spread it out to all the other kids through the web and USB

275
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,050
so they won't be able to delete the original.

276
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,280
I'm going to get him in trouble with this.

277
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,480
You are not going to complain to the principal and the assistant principal, right?

278
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,430
Am I stupid enough to bring that over to them so they can get rid of the evidence, huh?

279
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,470
- We should broadcast it.
- We should broadcast it.

280
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,860
Hyung, why are you speaking so casually with the teacher?

281
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,860
Whoops, I am being so rude, aren't I?

282
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,920
Sorry, Teacher.

283
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,270
It's because you are older than the other kids.

284
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,130
Just mere penalty points won't be enough, Teacher Son!

285
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,820
That's right. We also shouldn't let Chae Min get away with mere penalty points then.

286
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,300
Isn't that right, Assistant Principal?

287
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,960
It looks like there was a difference in opinions between the kids for a bit.

288
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,620
So you shouldn't be so cold-hearted and give them a bunch of penalty points, okay, Teacher Son?

289
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,240
Hey Chae Min, I did write the affidavit the way you wanted me to, but I'm also not going to be at a disadvantage, right?

290
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,100
Hey, jerk ass, don't say such nonsense.

291
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,050
What the?!

292
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,970
Lee Chae Min, you decide.

293
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,120
What for, you punk ass?

294
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,400
There's video evidence, so it's going to be easy for it to be written on your student record.

295
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,790
Isn't that what you and your mom are both scared of the most?

296
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,090
Due to this incident, you should leave my classmates alone and

297
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,590
return the award that you got by paying for it with your dirty money.

298
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,060
Don't you think this is a reasonable deal for what you did?

299
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,120
I'm going, knowing that you understood what I just said.

300
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,860
Hey, don't you think we're a little more useful than you think?

301
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,570
It's not just a little, it's more like a lot.

302
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,710
You seem more skilled than I thought, so useful indeed.

303
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,080
This is a piece of cake.

304
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,830
I think this kid right here was the most useful. Don't you think so?

305
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,010
This is the power of media I must add.

306
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,170
The highlight was that my face was broadcast school-wide.

307
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,190
I won't be able to forget that.

308
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,790
Oh.

309
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,390
Oh Yeong Min!

310
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,750
Teacher Son.

311
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,260
Are you really returning this to me, sir?

312
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,590
Lee Chae Min did confess that he didn't write the debate papers.

313
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,990
It just turned out that way.

314
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:56,890
Teacher Son, I feel like the years of my life are decreasing because of the wildflower class.

315
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,750
Let's try not to cause any more trouble, okay?

316
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,860
Award Certificate

317
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,660
Uh, I have something to give you before starting class.

318
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,870
Oh Yeong Min, Kang Bok Soo, and Yoon Seung Woo. You three, please come forward.

319
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,690
What are you doing? Hurry up and come forward.

320
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,290
Award Certificate. The people stated above participated in the school's debate competition

321
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,100
with broad knowledge of logical reasoning

322

327

I also want to become a teacher like you.

Teacher, I love you.

329
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,490
Dear Teacher...

330
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,360
Oh Se Ho

332
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,410
Bok Soo, Soo Jeong, and Se Ho incident.

333
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,760
Park Dong Joon

334
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:50,540
Ms. Director, Bok Soo's not the type of kid to do such a thing.

335
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,430
He's not the type of kid who would hurt Se Ho like this.

336
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,520
You should ask Se Ho aga—

337
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:01,000
Are you implying that my Se Ho is lying?
