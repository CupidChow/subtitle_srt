1
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,120
Okay.

2
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,370
Yes, yes, Director. I am coming right now.

3
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,320
Coming. Going.

4
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,660
Education Foundation

5
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,370
What?

6
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,540
Seolsong Highschool Teacher Hiring Request List

7
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,580
I... But... You told me to put Son Soo Jeong's name in, so I did.

8
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,450
But that is also making me feel uncomfortable.

9
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,590
Leave.

10
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,300
Kim Myeong Ho.

11
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,470
Yes, Director.

12
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,660
Take Son Soo Jeong off of the hiring request list.

13
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,560
Pardon? You insisted on including it—

14
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,660
I said to exclude it, I won't say it again.

15
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,350
Yes.

16
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,360
Did you buy your way into being a teacher?

17
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,690
Where did you get this?

18
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,230
Where do you think? I got it from Kim Myeong Ho's computer.

19
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,900
That isn't what's important right now. Is this really true?

20
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,640
You really became a teacher by paying?

21
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,150
Wow. You wench. There's no point in being the first rank in school back then.

22
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,420
- I got scammed.
- Scammed?

23
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,030
Do you think I'll believe that?

24
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,930
How could a smart person like you get scammed...!

25
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,250
But why are you on this list?

26
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,670
Bok Soo is going to overturn the school, but you became his girlfriend...

27
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,500
You know this can shackle Bok Soo, right?

28
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,160
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,330
Don't you know that it gets hard for Bok Soo if anything bad happens to you?

30
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,200
Live upright, Son Soo Jeong.

31
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:30,100
Ack. Hey, you scared me.

32
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,970
What is this?

33
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,960
Ah, again, but you know everything.

34
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,600
The director said he's going to fire all teachers involved in the hiring corruption.

35
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,650
He said to put together the file.

36
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,940
What?

37
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,020
But is there something for you to worry about?

38
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,230
It seems you have a good relationship with Director Oh Se Ho.

39
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,970
Earlier, he insisted on putting your name in,

40
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,030
but now he ordered me to take it out.

41
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,500
You must have fought with him earlier, right?

42
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,860
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

43
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,450
Please speak favorably of me.

44
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,050
What crazy talk are you saying?!

45
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,700
Try to fool someone you can actually fool. He gave $50,000 of his own money to you.

46
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,110
Is that a normal relationship?

47
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,820
$50,000... What did you say about $50,000?!

48
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,600
Kim Myeong Ho, are you not going to tell me?

49
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,250
You didn't know?

50
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,720
Son Soo Jeong, what's going on?

51
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,800
You gave it?

52
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,370
The $50,000.

53
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,960
- What are you saying?
- Tell me correctly.

54
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,170
Was the $50,000 really from you?

55
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,110
It's true.

56
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,970
- Son Soo Jeong, that—
- Why did you give me that money?

57
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,370
Why did you give me that money?!

58
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,700
You were having a hard time. You needed it.

59
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,890
How could you make me so pitiful?

60
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,450
I just wanted to help you.

61
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,740
I wanted to do something for you.

62
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,280
I just didn't like... that you were having a hard time.

63
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,840
Then you must have known everything.

64
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,770
The very fact that I tried to buy my teaching position with money

65
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,480
and the fact that I got scammed and had my hands tied.

66
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,670
You knew and saw everything.

67
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,680
- Son Soo Jeong, that—
- Who are you?

68
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,980
Who are you to keep interfering with my life?

69
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,330
It doesn't occur to you that I am sincere?

70
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,910
Why do you always... just trample on my sincerity?

71
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:16,590
Selfish jerk. You really only know about yourself.

72
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,150
The $50,000 was paid back and things didn't go your way,

73
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,820
so you put me on the corruption roster.

74
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,510
Then you pull me off it again as if you're being kind.

75
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:29,230
What? Did you want to show off to me that you pulled me off the roster?

76
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,210
You really... are the worst.

77
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,270
I, who paid back the $50,000 without you knowing,

78
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,660
and Kang Bok Soo, who knows that but pretended to not know...

79
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,120
What's the difference?

80
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,250
- What?
- Kang Bok Soo too!

81
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,190
He was lying behind your back!

82
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,430
Kang Bok Soo didn't tell you this either, right?

83
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,350
Nine years ago... I was the one who told people about you being a low-welfare student.

84
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,570
I wasn't sure, but that was you?

85
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,720
How did you know something that was only between me and Bok Soo!

86
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,010
I already told you. I'm always watching you.

87
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,760
Why did you lie like that?

88
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,300
To tear you and Bok Soo apart.

89
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,590
So you guys broke up.

90
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:05,430
A teacher dating her student. What do you think will happen when people find out?

91
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:19,470
Even if it's for Kang Bok Soo, shouldn't you guys break up?

92
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
Why did you lie like that?

93
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,560
To tear you and Bok Soo apart.

94
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,150
So you guys broke up.

95
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,260
Soo Jeong!

96
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,460
You came?

97
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,690
Ah, but are you sick?

98
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,060
What do you mean?

99
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,230
No. Fever? Are you hot?

100
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,330
- Give it. I'll put it on you.
- Hey, Kang Bok Soo!

101
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,810
I'm okay. You should leave. The kids might see.

102
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,000
What will the kids see? They're all in the classroom.

103
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,450
- Ah, it's okay.
- I said leave!

104
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,300
Why? Is the dating not going well?

105
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,180
Nope, it's going super well. I'm like the happiest person on earth now.

106
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,120
What did she say?

107
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,970
She told me to leave, that the kids will see.

108
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,250
She said the right thing.

109
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,070
I'm just telling you this, but you guys shouldn't date at school.

110
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:01,370
During class time, doing this and this and that and that.

111
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,120
Can I survive such an eyesore?

112
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,880
You know I can report you.

113
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,640
What? You saw it all?

114
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,390
You little rascal, always pretending to be asleep! When did you peek?

115
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,370
It's really obvious that you're a first-timer.

116
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,160
As you already deduced, since the board members of Seolsong High School Foundation

117
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,560
were changed nine years ago, they have not been changed at all.

118
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,230
As for the change made nine years ago—

119
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,480
My mother must've fired the weakest to save herself.

120
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,390
Yes, that's correct.

121
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,640
And who will she frame this time, once things get exposed?

122
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,970
One of the executives? You?

123
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,020
Or is it me?

124
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,970
I do have someone I deem possible.

125
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,250
I should make my mom take responsibility for this.

126
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,100
Do you think my mother was like this too?

127
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,340
Pardon?

128
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,250
Even when I know things are turning out to be wrong,

129
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,890
I can't stop.

130
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,490
Hey. Hey!

131
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,590
What will you do about it?

132
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,030
I will take care of it.

133
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,660
What?

134
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,000
You're the one who committed the hiring corruption, but you're going to take care of it?

135
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,830
It's my business, so stay out of it.

136
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,890
Do you think I care because I am so fond of you? It's because of Bok Soo, of course.

137
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,900
If you keep doing this, I'm going to tell Bok Soo.

138
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,030
Bok Soo already knows.

139
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,650
He knows?

140
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,480
Things are already complicated for me, as it is, without you, so can you please stop irking me?

141
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,090
Seriously.

142
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:46,380
This won't do. Follow me.

143
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,590
Equipment Contract Ledger

144
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,550
Look at this.

145
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,860
Just calculating the last three years of rebates they siphoned from those suppliers for the school...

146
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,700
Hey, something happened, right?

147
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,210
Soo Jeong...

148
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,260
That's enough. Stop right there. Dating is a self-service.

149
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,520
Just take revenge. Let's take revenge!

150
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,580
Lee Kyeong Hyeon! Just hear me out.

151
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,790
She won't take my call and she's ignoring my texts too.

152
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,030
Hey! Where are you going?

153
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,760
♫ It's already 12 o'clock.  ♫

154
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,220
If you got scammed by Kim Myeong Ho, then what did you do wrong?

155
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,970
Because I intended to buy the teacher position.

156
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,430
No wonder

157
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,940
Bok Soo wouldn't dig into the hiring corruption when we needed a witness.

158
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,980
Witness?

159
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,670
♫ Come to me  ♫

160
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,060
♫ My upsetting ♫

161
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,910
Never mind.

162
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,170
Why is that jerk Se Ho doing this?

163
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,140
Didn't he like you?

164
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,420
♫ When I already know  ♫

165
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,820
♫ The more we're honest  ♫

166
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,330
♫ The more you are  ♫

167
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,370
♫ Still once  ♫

168
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,930
What is this?

169
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,910
Paparazzi? Is it Oh Se Ho that jerk?

170
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:16,350
He's really doing all sorts of things. Why is he so crooked?

171
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,310
The most dangerous person for Bok Soo is me.

172
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:25,570
I'm a teacher and he's a student, and Oh Se Ho is using that fact.

173
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,150
Seeing Oh Se Ho kick out Teacher Park like that,

174
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,780
it seems like it's really my turn to protect Bok Soo.

175
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,110
What the hell is wrong with you guys' luck anyway?

176
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,710
Son Soo Jeong, endure it until he graduates.

177
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,160
Just break up for a little bit.

178
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,650
You guys couldn't forget each other for nine whole years.

179
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,940
Could you be parted because you were not together for that short period of time?

180
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,390
I want Bok Soo...

181
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:04,150
No, I want the two of you to be happy.

182
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:10,800
For that, don't you think you guys need to conduct yourselves more wisely?

183
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,590
What is this? Yang Min Ji?

184
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,100
It's the CEO...

185
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,390
What the heck? This woman here, on such a late night.

186
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,110
Not going home and drinking this much.

187
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,980
You're a dangerous woman.

188
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,070
Get on. I'll take you home.

189
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,540
What? I told you to get on.

190
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:14,770
Your shoulders are suddenly like the Pacific Ocean. So cool.

191
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,890
This woman sure tells the truth when she's drunk.

192
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,660
I understand. So first, throw yourself at this Pacific Ocean like body,

193
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,430
so we can go home.

194
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,280
I said get on.

195
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:46,990
♫ You always come to my mind  ♫

196
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:52,550
♫ You give me the flutters and the palpitations  ♫

197
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:57,510
♫ Your trails are, one by one, ♫

198
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,740
♫ sink in my heart  ♫

199
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,150
It's invalid. Invalid.

200
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,740
Huh?

201
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,530
I shouldn't like this because you're drunk,

202
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,430
but I wanted to do this beautifully!

203
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,250
♫ I don't want to. Love has started.  ♫

204
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,250
It's... my first kiss.

205
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,980
♫ You and me.  ♫

206
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,540
I wanted to do it beautifully and powerfully! I wanted to kiss you first.

207
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,260
I'm not drunk.

208
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,150
I'm not drunk at all.

209
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,920
♫ Our history.  ♫

210
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,270
I don't know.

211
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,860
♫ In my memory  ♫

212
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,130
CEO.

213
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,890
♫ Hiding it.  ♫

214
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,160
Lift up... your pretty head.

215
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,070
How long have you been there? It's cold.

216
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,500
It's okay since I'm a man with a warm heart.

217
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,990
Why did you come here?

218
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,880
Did something happen?

219
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,600
I came because I'm worried.

220
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,150
Bok Soo,

221
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,580
I have something to say to you.

222
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,000
Kang Bok Soo,

223
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,180
let's break up.

224
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:50,490
Just until you graduate, since we were able to endure it for nine years.

225
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,840
I came back after nine years,

226
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,650
and you want me to go back again.

227
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,350
Why? Did that jerk Oh Se Ho threaten you?

228
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,430
Did he say to quit your job if you're going to date a student?

229
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,570
If it's because of that, I can... I can just leave that school and it'll end.

230
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,990
It's over if you quit?

231
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,330
Then what does that mean for Teacher Park who quit to protect you?

232
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:19,360
Even though she doesn't say it, what about your mother whose wish is to see you graduate?

233
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:29,690
I also want to protect you, Bok Soo.

234
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:36,660
Do you not know the sincerity of people who want to protect you?

235
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,570
We're not breaking up forever.

236
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:49,690
It's just until you graduate. Only for a little bit.

237
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,220
Soo Jeong.

238
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,920
Did you forget my dream?

239
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,430
Let's not ignore the desire of Teacher Park and your mother for our happiness.

240
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:16,360
If you get expelled from school again, I won't be able to face you.

241
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:26,270
So... Let's break up.

242
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,430
♫ To my heart ♫

243
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,380
Soo Jeong.

244
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:39,000
♫ The forgotten breath leaks out  ♫

245
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,160
♫ and the sorrow flows out shouting their lament  ♫

246
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:54,420
♫ Do you know my flowing tears?  ♫

247
00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:03,290
♫ Do you hear my stifled heart?  ♫

248
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,660
♫ I still think of you like this ♫

249
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,790
♫ And if I can love you like this  ♫

250
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:16,190
♫ I will try to be happy  ♫

251
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,940
♫ Are you listening to my heart?  ♫

252
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,750
It's over if you quit?

253
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,280
Then what does that mean for Teacher Park who quit to protect you?

254
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,360
Even though she doesn't say it, what about your mother whose wish is to see you graduate?

255
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:00,420
I also want to protect you, Bok Soo.

256
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,280
The year-end exam is almost here so, everyone, please produce your exam questions now.

257
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:28,180
There's always someone who turns them in at the very last hour, but please be on time this time, everyone.

258
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,080
Ivy class, will your reputation get restored this time?

259
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,850
Yes, don't worry.

260
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,760
This time, the school's first place will be from my class.

261
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,050
Hey, man.

262
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,250
Hello, Teacher.

263
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,510
Teacher, are you sick? Your face looks like a panda's right now.

264
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,470
No, I think it's because my mascara smeared or something...

265
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,470
Hey kids, the finals are just around the corner.

266
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,490
- How do you like studying? Isn't it fun?
- No, teacher!

267
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,410
Let's break up.

268
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,480
I think we should break up for now. I think that'll be the best for everyone right now.

269
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,970
I'll just consider it as if I sent my girlfriend to the military.

270
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,200
But make sure not to fall in love with somebody else though.

271
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:01,620
And also make sure not to let anyone else buy you your yogurt drink.

272
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,910
Okay, I will.

273
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,460
I will quit drinking the yogurt drink until you are back with me to buy it for me.

274
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,720
I'm going to make sure to get revenge and also graduate from high school.

275
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,070
- So, please wait for me.
- Okay, I will.

276
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,300
Kang Bok Soo, you can do everything that you want to do.

277
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,300
I'm leaving now.

278
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,750
Oh, and I was the one who dumped you this time.

279
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,600
I didn't get dumped this time, but I was the one who dumped you.

280
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,720
I'm really leaving now.

281
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,400
Sounds like Kang Bok Soo indeed.

282
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,040
I was so cool in there.

283
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,440
Kang Bok Soo, you were so cool in there indeed.

284
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,380
You did well.

285
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,420
Hey man, don't....!

286
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,820
Ah, seriously.

287
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,990
How long are you going to live like this, Mr. Kim Myeong Ho?

288
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,840
Pardon?

289
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,990
When you work this hard, they will promote you, and for your hard work, they give you a raise.

290
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,870
Do you think they will really do that for you?

291
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,800
How do you think people like us survive in a place like this, huh?

292
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,660
Do you think they will just let us be if we don't do what they tell us to do?

293
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,700
Look here, Mr. Kang Bok Soo, I guess you are being this way because you are still rather young.

294
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,790
It seems like you don't really understand how the real world works.

295
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:58,410
Since you do whatever is asked, no matter if it's legal or not,

296
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:01,370
you have no idea that you are the one that's getting your own hands dirty, right?

297
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,560
Listen up, Mr. Kim Myeong Ho. Do you really not understand?

298
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,350
Don't you know that they will kick you to the curb, once they realize that your hands are dirty?

299
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,100
You should know who are the right people to stand by.

300
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,150
This is not going to be over so simply.

301
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,870
What I'm saying here is that you might be framed for everything, you know that?

302
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,320
I'm saying that you will be the first one to go!

303
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,120
You can just lower the pay for the person you hire then.

304
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,760
Isn't it only natural to pay that much for a person who's becoming a teacher at Seolsong?

305
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:42,160
Mr. Principal, are you really going to work this way with me?!

306
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,340
How much is it?

307
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,910
How much does a person who works as a teacher at our school get paid?

308
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,460
It's none of your business, kiddo. It's my business.

309
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,580
It's my school.

310
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,940
Your school? Is it any different because it's your school?

311
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,660
Of course, I'm much different from you since I don't make my school into a business deal like you do, Mother.

312
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,620
Different, huh?

313
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,260
The teacher who used to work at the school gets kicked out after being framed.

314
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:09,560
You created this wildflower class by saying all the convincing things in the world, and now you're trying to get rid of them all.

315
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,780
So how's that any different from me?

316
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,710
So you think what you are doing is considered sophisticated or something?

317
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,280
That has nothing to do with how I operate the school.

318
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,140
You're still so good at making up excuses.

319
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,560
Se Ho, you are my son.

320
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:31,360
You are my son who is exactly like me. Look at all the things that you've done.

321
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,770
Do you genuinely think that you are different from me?

322
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,990
I'm different.

323
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,870
I'll make sure and show you that I am different from you.

324
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,680
♫ Happy birthday, dear Oh Se Ho

325
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,880
♫ Happy birthday to you

326
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,820
Hurry up and make a wish and blow out the candle

327
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:29,680
I wonder what kind of wish I made at the time?

328
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,530
I don't remember at all.

329
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,620
Teacher Certification Examination

330
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,570
I want to become a teacher whom my students can be proud of.

331
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,600
I want to become a teacher who can look at my students as beautiful flowers.

332
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,340
I want to become a teacher

333
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,450
who practices what she preaches to the students.

334
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,460
Seolsong High School's Teacher Request Hire List

335
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,380
Son Soo Jeong: Korean language teacher, 50,000,000 won

336
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,900
Seolsong High School

337
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,820
Hey, Son Soo Jeong.

338
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,290
Son Soo Jeong: Korean language teacher, 50,000,000 won

339
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,650
Don't you ever take my name off. Make sure to put my name on there.

340
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,840
Son Soo Jeong, you did become a permanent teacher through legal means...

341
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
It's true that I did become a teacher through corrupt ways of doing things.

342
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,290
If I met the right parents who had plenty of money,

343
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,400
I would've ended up being the first one to donate money to the school to become a teacher.

344
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,030
Whether Kim Myeong Ho came in the middle and snatched it away is irrelevant since I gave the 50,000,000 won to him

345
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,680
so I could buy my way in to become a teacher.

346
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,760
So make sure to not leave my name off the list.

347
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,980
Don't you realize what this means? Son Soo Jeong, have you gone mad?!

348
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,890
Did you forget that I will show you who's even crazier?

349
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,500
This is just the beginning.

350
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,860
Son Soo Jeong: Korean language teacher, 50,000,000 won

351
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,600
I'm thinking the school would be the best place to announce everything in one go. Don't you guys agree?

352
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,340
Well, I'm not sure. I think there might be a much more effective way than that.

353
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,520
We should make sure to do it properly while we're at it.

354
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,640
When should D-day be?

355
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,910
Once we confirm the information leak for the test, then we should do it.

356
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:19,940
Then that means we'll get moving sometime around finals time, right?

357
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,420
The thing we have left now is...

358
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,950
Hiring Scandal

359
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,440
Yeah, it's the hiring scandal.

360
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,790
Let's get it going minus this.

361
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,530
With this list, it will be difficult either way.

362
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,420
I bet they made a deal either through cash or via a separate account.

363
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,180
It would be hard to find the info on deposits and any kind of evidence to that.

364
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,970
But the teachers that gave money to the school

365
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,550
will probably not stand as a witness to testify for us either.

366
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,950
Hiring Scandal

367
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:01,060
Right, let's exclude it. It will be better to take it out.

368
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,440
Why are you leaving out the thing about the hiring scandal?

369
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,560
That's the main thing regarding the corruption scandal for Seolsong High School.

370
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,500
- But Soo Jeong, that is—
- I will testify.

371
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,790
Need to secure a witness

372
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,980
Secured a witness

373
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,630
I will be the one to show the rotten face of this school.

374
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,990
I will be that witness and proof.

375
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:14,890
My Strange Hero

376
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,060
♫ Are you listening?  ♫

377
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,430
Teacher, this was your dream.

378
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,330
You found that dream for me.

379
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,430
Now find me another dream.

380
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,800
Are you ready?

381
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,020
I move to dismiss the director from his position.

382
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,660
He stabbed his mom in the back big time.

383
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,530
I told you to try and snatch my school from me, right?

384
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,530
Wasn't this the image of the son you wanted?

385
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,550
No matter the situation, let's trust each other. I'll protect you,

386
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,240
so don't worry too much. You have me.

387
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,690
The feeling of a great evening.

388
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,860
It's a problem that can't be solved?

389
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,130
Because of this, Lee Chae Min's rank is dropping.

390
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,290
I'm asking you for the last time.

391
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,400
If you don't come up with courage now...

392
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,370
There's nothing else.

393
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,630
Chae Min!

394
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,580
You can't, Chae Min!
