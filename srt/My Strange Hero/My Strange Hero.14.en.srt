00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,050
Hi.
Episode 14

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,200
What's wrong with you, Teacher?

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,190
This punk, what were you looking at that way? So what are you looking at?

4
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,760
I wasn't looking at anything.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,940
That's Soo Jeong, right? You were looking at her, weren't you?

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,370
I wasn't looking at Son Soo Jeong.

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,100
This kid! How can you call your teacher by her name?

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,930
How improper! Is that how I taught you?

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,410
Yes.

10
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,640
Hey.

11
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,970
Okay.

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,450
Thank you, Bok Soo.

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,400
No problem.

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,460
Teacher Son! What are you doing? Oh, here's Bok Soo.

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,080
Oh my, is that so?

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,790
I didn't know.

17
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,340
Ah, that was Kang Bok Soo's back.

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,900
Ms. Son, what are you doing over the weekend?

19
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,850
Nothing in particular. Why?

20
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,030
Talk on career choice plans!

21
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,370
You guys know it's today, right? Talk on career choice plans.

22
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,300
Aww, man!

23
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,480
Hey.

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,470
You all should be grateful that it's scheduled during class time instead of after school.

25
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:37,480
So I brought the first lecturer who will inspire our wildflower class on how to manage school life.

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,630
You'll do well, right?

27
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,070
No.

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,220
I'll do well, Teacher.

29
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,310
Elder, you're quite enthusiastic.

30
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,630
This is crazy. It's the board director.

31
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,400
Epic.

32
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,050
What is this?

33
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,370
Darn it.

34
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,490
Director, what are you doing here?

35
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,950
I thought about it,

36
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,800
and I concluded nobody would be better than me to do this.

37
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,640
So I came. I am qualified for this, right?

38
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,030
Hello, I'll be giving the talk for today. I'm Oh Se Ho.

39
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,510
I graduated from Saintbury High School.

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,610
At Stanley University, I double majored in business and English.

41
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,840
And now I'm currently the board director of Seolsong.

42
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,320
I am proud of what I've achieved.

43
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,580
But what I want to say to everyone

44
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,020
is not to live your life like I lived mine.

45
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:14,720
I lived under a fixed belief that a student must attend school and study.

46
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,910
However, even the person who isn't good at studying

47
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,780
can find something that they can do with confidence.

48
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,620
Wouldn't that be more rewarding than passing time lethargically at school?

49
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,060
Better than being holed up in the school.

50
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,580
That's all.

51
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,490
Thank you for giving us your time, Director.

52
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,190
So your point was...

53
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,330
if you're bad at studying, there's no need to come to school. Is that it?

54
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,070
So that's all for today...

55
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,080
If you twist what I meant, that's regretful.

56
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,440
It's not twisting. I am pointing out the main point.

57
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,760
The main point of my talk was to find what you, yourself, are good at.

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,600
What if you can't find what you're good at?

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,850
Then we'll just find what you like to do.

60
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,660
What if we can't find what we like?

61
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,950
- Everyone has a dream.
- No.

62
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,890
Director, in this world,

63
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,570
there are many ordinary students who are not specially good at anything,

64
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,380
or like anything, and don't even have a dream.

65
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,480
Then they need to hurry up and find one

66
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,320
before cold reality hits.

67
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,810
Either way, we have to face cold reality when we graduate.

68
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,320
Can't we just remain comfortable while we are still in school?

69
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,420
Don't you think that that's too lazy?

70
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,250
No, I don't.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,140
To some people, this school acts as a fence and a protective barrier,

72
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,760
and it sounds like you're asking us to leave as soon as possible and find our means of living.

73
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,750
Kang Bok Soo, that's enough.

74
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,090
The lecture has ended.

75
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,820
Thank you, Director.

76
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,110
Although I gave the lecture today, starting next time, we'll focus on field training.

77
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,640
So you're really planning on a career-focused education.

78
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,880
I'll consider it.

79
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,370
What is it? Is something bothering you?

80
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,520
We're trying to show the kids other available paths,

81
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,840
but I wonder if it comes across as us forcing them to find something they can do.

82
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,200
Alright, I'll respect your opinion.

83
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,680
Let's put it on hold for now. When you're ready, tell me.

84
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,010
Thank you.

85
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,080
I know that paying this much attention is not something easy to do.

86
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,470
- Then shall we go out to eat?
- Huh?

87
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,360
I still haven't eaten pork belly.

88
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,440
Give me the accounting documents by the end of today again.

89
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,450
Excuse me? I've already submitted the documents.

90
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,190
So you're just going to give me the official documents too?

91
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,330
I'm this foundation's successor. Give me the internal files.

92
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,010
Get it ready before I come to work tomorrow.

93
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,040
Ah, yes. I understand.

94
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,790
Secretary Yoon,

95
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,860
do you have any tips for eating pork belly?

96
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,110
He said to cook the pork belly all the way through.

97
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,460
How can I tell though?

98
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,230
By intuition.

99
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,940
Intuition?

100
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,080
I will be grilling it today, Director.

101
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,560
I'm usually good at everything, but I can't do anything when I'm in front of you.

102
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,650
What are you good at?

103
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,390
Well...

104
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,470
Horse riding, fencing, swordsmanship, range shooting, tennis, piano.

105
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,300
That's a lot.

106
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,860
I'm just bragging to you that I'm a hot shot.

107
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,320
Oh Se Ho.

108
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,430
You know I used to live on welfare, right?

109
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,190
You were mistaken then. It wasn't Bok Soo who said that.

110
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,300
Then who said it?

111
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,130
I'm also curious about that.

112
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,000
But why did you say Bok Soo was the one who said it?

113
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,880
Because I heard it from others, but if not, I'll apologize.

114
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,500
Because of those words of yours, I had such a big misunderstanding.

115
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,090
"I'm sorry" with a couple of words. That's not enough, isn't it?

116
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,750
Then what about the rooftop?

117
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,990
Bok Soo said he didn't push you, but why did you say he did?

118
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,490
So you don't listen to me and only believe what Kang Bok Soo says?

119
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,850
That's why I'm asking you right now, so I don't make the same mistake!

120
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,010
Kang Bok Soo pushing me...

121
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,330
is true.

122
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,580
You and Bok Soo were friends.

123
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,830
You say you want to cover the past, but until I find out the truth,

124
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,840
I don't think I can do that.

125
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,120
I fulfilled my three dinners with you with this.

126
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,880
Who lives here?

127
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,930
Your delivery!

128
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,390
Please put it over here on the dinner table.

129
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:27,940
Okay!

130
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,380
I am sharing this problem with you guys only, so don't tell others.

131
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,370
Let's look at the next question.

132
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,980
Director's just running wild since he's young.

133
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,330
He's giving so many favorable treatments to the wildflower class.

134
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,350
How's the support for our ivy class though?

135
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,960
Don't you think you should go see the former director once, Chae Min's mother?

136
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,170
Why should the support from the Office of Education go to the last place class?

137
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,950
I really don't understand!

138
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,920
How much is it?

139
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,820
You ladies are the mothers of Seolsong's ivy class, right?

140
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,630
I get to meet all you mothers here in a place like this.

141
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,220
My kid is also in the ivy class!

142
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,430
Who in the ivy class?

143
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,010
In Ho. Ivy class's Kang In Ho.

144
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,960
Kang In Ho?

145
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,920
Kang In Ho! In Ho!

146
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,800
Why?

147
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,350
Why, why?

148
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,860
Why didn't you tell me that the director of your school prepared a special lecture for the wildflower class?

149
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,680
How did you know that?

150
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,150
What's the use of special lessons for kids who have no prospects anyway?

151
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,490
So frustrating, really.

152
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,190
- Uncle is in the wildflower class though.
- Huh?

153
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,080
I don't know.

154
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,430
You're my son and Kang Bok Soo is my mother's.

155
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,860
I'm tired.

156
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,250
I'm going inside.

157
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,410
Okay. I'll give you nutritional supplements later!

158
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,660
Okay.

159
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,920
We mothers that are part of the ivy class, should gather our strength at this rate.

160
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,640
Hello, Chae Min's mom.

161
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,260
I'm In Ho's mother from the ivy class.

162
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,200
Yes, see you there.

163
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,280
Lee Chae Min, do you know what rank your classmate Kang In Ho is?

164
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,890
Is he the kid that came up from taking the last exam for class placement?

165
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,950
Kang In Ho?

166
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,090
Lee Chae Min!

167
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,650
Kang In Ho is from the wildflower class.

168
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,410
Sorry, but we can't take your exam for you.

169
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:52,580
What I am saying is, there are requests that can be honored and some that cannot be.

170
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,850
You are a student so you should be studying instead doing bad things like this!

171
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,100
Seriously, these little punks aren't even worth the money, for goodness sake.

172
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,870
You shouldn't have passed around our fliers at school.

173
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,150
Be patient.

174
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,930
Don't you think there might be a kid that is actually worth the big bucks?

175
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,150
Oh, he's coming,

176
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,530
Coming. Coming.

177
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:18,690
Five, four, three, two, one.

178
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,920
Hey kids, what are you doing?

179
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,200
Why did you come again?

180
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,840
I came here to get some consulting, kid.

181
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,980
Aigoo, dear customer! Team Leader Yang, what are you doing? Hurry and serve the customer.

182
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,070
Our lovely customer, here.

183
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,660
Sit here, please.

184
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,110
Can I get a cup of coffee?

185
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,730
I am making it right now, customer.

186
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,940
So, our customer, what brings you here?

187
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,690
About that.

188
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,690
Teacher, are you really sick?

189
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,780
Well, you were perfectly fine up until yesterday.

190
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,250
You spent money unnecessarily because you didn't want to go on a field investigation.

191
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,380
Seriously, I am really sick.

192
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,870
I am too sick to even swallow porridge.

193
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:18,100
Ah, this is not it. This, this is the sound of someone eating jajangmyeon (black bean noodles).

194
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,350
No, I really am sick, kid.

195
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,630
There's going to be another teacher who will go over there, so have a good time exploring.

196
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,760
I am hanging up.

197
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,520
Seriously, that kid.

198
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,690
Thank you.

199
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,330
What? Do you have good news?

200
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,410
No, just in the midst of making something good happen.

201
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,500
But who—

202
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,720
Son Soo Jeong?

203
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,500
Kang Bok Soo, why are you here?

204
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,350
The person Teacher Park was sending in his place is you?

205
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,860
Seriously, how lovely he is.

206
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,850
This is not right.

207
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,930
He probably won't answer.

208
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,900
This is something that happened that neither of us expected at all.

209
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,280
First off, I have been paid and have work to do.

210
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,350
Should we go?

211
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,980
Let's go, Teach. We don't have much time.

212
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,480
Teacher, Teacher!

213
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,380
I did make a list of the places that we can visit for a field study.

214
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,130
I'm also going to be taking photos that I will include in the report.

215
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,450
Just now, you thought I looked a bit cool, right?

216
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,370
What are you saying?

217
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,030
I was just wondering if you even know what this list is for.

218
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,990
I am not the same old Kang Bok Soo.

219
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,060
I've been working for years now, so I'm aware of the words that I do use often.

220
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,380
But how did you start this work?

221
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,230
I wonder if your girlfriend asked you to do it or something?

222
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,370
Girlfriend?

223
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,440
You don't mean Min Ji Noona?

224
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,470
That noona is really...

225
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,520
I haven't had a girlfriend for nine years.

226
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,560
I helped someone by chance and he insisted on rewarding me with money.

227
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,570
Kyeong Hyeon said that this business is like a blue ocean or something like that, so we started doing this in a jiffy.

228
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,590
It suits you.

229
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,420
I will escort you perfectly, Customer.

230
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,490
Teacher.

231
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,940
Hey.

232
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,230
I am not here as your student right now.

233
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,940
Let's go, Miss Soo Jeong.

234
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,580
Miss Soo Jeong? Ah, seriously!

235
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,410
What are you saying? You must be crazy.

236
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,380
Hey, make sure you maintain the proper manners. I am your teacher.

237
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:35,780
Did this punk arrive there or not?

238
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,810
Give me an update on your duty.

239
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,230
Bok Soo.

240
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,980
Look at this. I arrived.

241
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,650
Work hard.

242
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,040
Where is the car key?

243
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,160
What the!

244
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,750
What?

245
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,820
- One, two, three, four.
- National Treasure #6.

246
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,200
It's made out of granite. It was a pagoda built during the Unified Shilla period,

247
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,180
and it's known to be the biggest and the highest out of them all.

248
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,630
Geographically, it's located in the center part of our country that

249
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,300
it was also called the central pagoda....

250
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,120
- This is over seven though.
- Hey, you.

251
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,150
It's written right there, saying that it's a seven layer pagoda for crying out loud.

252
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,300
I'm leaving now.

253
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,410
Teacher! Teach Soo Jeong!

254
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,820
Are you abandoning your student? Teach Soo Jeong!

255
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,260
I'm telling you, I didn't know either.

256
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,670
If I knew that old Teacher Park was drawing up such a wicked big picture,

257
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,690
do you think I would've sent Bok Soo over there?! We both did the consulting together, you know.

258
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,960
This is work related. Bok Soo went to work. This is his job, you know.

259
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,020
I'm going to work too.

260
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,500
The most important work for me in my life, Kang Bok Soo!

261
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,540
Team Leader Yang, we should separate business and private life alright?!

262
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:08,590
Hey, did the three of us have anything good come to us whenever Son Soo Jeong was involved?!

263
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,360
It was like that before! And now that Bok Soo is back in school, we are missing our ace worker!

264
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,370
So that's why our sales are cut in half too!

265
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,070
Come out. I will be doing the driving.

266
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,430
♫ Last winter, you were by my side ♫

267
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:41,210
♫ And it was like a wind that flashed me by ♫

268
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:46,530
♫ Suddenly, without a notice ♫

269
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:52,430
♫ Finding me once again ♫

270
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,430
♫ A memory that was forgotten ♫

271
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,840
♫ Just like a cluster of flowers ♫

272
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,190
Since this is experiential learning, shouldn't we go and do some experiencing?

273
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:11,540
♫ My heart was feeling so barren, but once again ♫

274
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,500
♫ It's making my heart flutter ♫

275
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,630
♫ The love that is coming towards as me as the day goes by ♫

276
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:27,390
♫ I'm scared that my love will leave me ♫

277
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:34,430
♫ Every day I feel like my heart is fluttering, and it's making me stay up all night ♫

278
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:40,870
♫ I just wanted to stop like that, my love ♫

279
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,390
You're so good at riding a bike.

280
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,050
Whoever taught you must be a really good teacher.

281
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,490
- What? You don't know how to ride a bike?!
- No.

282
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,700
There is something that Class Pres isn't able to do, eh?

283
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,850
You know, riding a bicycle doesn't go on your report card.

284
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,750
It's better to memorize another English word than to learn how to ride a bicycle.

285
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,710
Okay then, let's start from the basics.

286
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,880
♫ Oh, could it be that you know how I feel? ♫

287
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,630
♫ I don't think I can without you ♫

288
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:26,260
Hey wait, Class Pres. What did you do when you didn't even teach yourself how to ride a bike after all these years?

289
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,500
There was nobody to teach me, that's why.

290
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,690
Huh?

291
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,960
No, nothing.

292
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,060
This seems like a piece of cake too.

293
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,870
Hey, Class President, I, your darling oppa, am able to balance it so well,

294
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,930
so that's why you're able to ride comfortably in the back.

295
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,890
I will give you a private lesson next time so you'll be able to ride a bike all by yourself.

296
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,030
Can't you go any faster?

297
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:54,150
Hey, do you really want me to make you get a cold sweat on your back? I'm really going to go now.

298
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,630
♫ Let's find out if we have any personality differences ♫

299
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,220
♫ I like it so I will do more for you ♫

300
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,710
♫ I'm able to sleep well at night ♫

301
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:09,690
♫ When you whisper in my ears, I fall asleep ♫

302
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,640
We got to ride a bike which is something we haven't done in a while.

303
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,460
It's nice.

304
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,390
This is a very educational experience.

305
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,770
Let's get going.

306
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,480
Lines exist only to be crossed,

307
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,380
Son Soo Jeong.

308
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,480
Bok Soo!

309
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,860
Kang Bok Soo!

310
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,720
- Hurry!
- Hey!

311
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,330
Bok Soo!

312
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,460
Long time to see, Class Prez. You're pretty as always.

313
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,530
Pretty, my butt. She's aged so much.

314
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,570
What? She looks the same.

315
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,350
It's just her makeup. Don't you know when you see?

316
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,560
No, I don't know.

317
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,710
Lee Kyeong Hyeon!

318
00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:01,420
Oh, I'm running a small business right now.

319
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,720
I'm the CEO.

320
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,100
Your Favor 
I'm the sales team leader. Bok Soo's the management team leader.

321
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,660
- Team Leader? Me?
- Yeah.

322
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,730
You were promoted to team leader a few days ago.

323
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,800
I promoted you at high-speed.

324
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,510
There are just three of us. What's the need for a team leader?

325
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,960
What kind of company promotes their workers without letting them know?

326
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,460
If you don't like it, leave it. It's up to me.

327
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,340
Kang Bok Soo, you're demoted to an employee.

328
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,790
What do you mean, Mr. CEO? I will bury my bones in the company.

329
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,740
I'll bury mine along with Bok Soo.

330
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,090
Of course. Of course.

331
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,880
As always, our teamwork is great.

332
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,180
Why would you two come here?

333
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,880
I had a lot to do today!

334
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,200
It's here?

335
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,120
Let's go.

336
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,250
Astronomical Science Museum

337
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,930
Can you even see stars in the board daylight?

338
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,860
I'm observing the sun right now.

339
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,850
What's this? You're giving me something to drink?

340
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,000
If you don't want it, don't take it.

341
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,150
Son Soo Jeong.

342
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,730
I won't ask you this again, so think this through before answering.

343
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:36,630
You. Do you still like Kang Bok Soo?

344
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,350
Do you know?

345
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:49,600
It's also a form of lying if you don't respond in a situation where you should.

346
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,210
You might think it's not lying,

347
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,390
but nine years ago, the person who made other kids believe you were rich,

348
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,570
that was all you.

349
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,930
What I'm saying is, using a vague manner

350
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,530
just leaving our Bok Soo drawn to you is also your responsibility.

351
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,610
So, if it isn't, say it isn't.

352
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:11,070
If you don't like him, say it. Settle it out yourself!

353
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,630
CEO, should we have a company dinner later?

354
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,420
Oh, that's good. Company dinners are great.

355
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,260
Chicken.

356
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,930
- Do you want to ask Bok Soo?
- No.

357
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,390
- Bok Soo–
- No, no.

358
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:45,990
What?

359
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,960
I talked to Bok Soo and–

360
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,390
What's with you?

361
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,090
Let's go, Soo Jeong.

362
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,660
What?

363
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,020
You know, you can let go now.

364
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,590
Bu this wasn't a part of the field survey plan.

365
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,420
I really wanted to come here.

366
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,800
It's pretty, right?

367
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,720
Doesn't it feel as if the stars are surrounding us?

368
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,850
Yeah. It's super pretty.

369
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:04,320
Do you remember our younger days when we went to see the night view?

370
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:11,450
The world we saw from there was so sparkly like this.

371
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,240
Yeah, I remember.

372
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,490
Afterward, I never went back there.

373
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:29,410
That's what I thought since I never saw you there.

374
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,710
For nine years, I went there frequently.

375
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:44,320
Whenever I felt frustrated or whenever I thought of you.

376
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,570
Do you not even hate me?

377
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:03,200
Because of you, I got a dream and made it come true.

378
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,190
That day, if it hadn't been for what happened,

379
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,960
you would've lived a different life.

380
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,800
As for my dream,

381
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,600
you can make it come true right now.

382
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,610
How so?

383
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,910
Did you forget about my dream?

384
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:27,100
It was to be Son Soo Jeong's boyfriend.

385
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,500
I thought you hated me.

386
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,430
During that time, only my scars were important to me.

387
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,020
Even though I knew you weren't that kind of person–

388
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,910
You were just...

389
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,830
You just testified as you witnessed.

390
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,640
Yeah. For nine years, I kept thinking,

391
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,400
"I didn't lie, so it's not my fault."

392
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,660
But someone told me that not saying things that should be said

393
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,850
is lying, too.

394
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,930
What she said was true.

395
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,860
"I don't have to be sorry for him."

396
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,170
I kept assuring myself about that every day,

397
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,830
but I think I was sorry for you all the time.

398
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:38,930
Bok Soo, I'm really sorry

399
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,760
for not trusting you that time. I–

400
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,680
I'm truly okay now,

401
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,420
since you're by my side right now.

402
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:22,990
For the past nine years, I tried to forget you,

403
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,690
but it's such a relief that I never did.

404
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,120
You're a fool as always, Kang Bok Soo.

405
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,660
You haven't changed a bit.

406
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,520
♫  The small sigh ♫

407
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,360
♫  that has gathered in my heart  ♫

408
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,550
♫  Has slipped out quickly ♫

409

410

My Strange Hero Preview

427
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,200
Is today our first day of dating?

428
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,100
Go on a date with me.

429
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,380
I want to make you happy.

430
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,040
I don't think I'm the person who can make you less lonely.

431
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,580
Teacher, you got a boyfriend recently, right?

432
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,870
A teacher is dating her student? Then, the school will–

433
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,280
Oh Se Ho, what are you planning?

434
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,000
I've had a crush on you for a long time.

435
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,420
I won't ever lose hold of your heart.

436
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,440
Will you make my dream come true?

437
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,730
♫  Can things stop just the way they are now? ♫
