1
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,820
Kang Bok Soo, what would you like to say now?

2
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,970
I am asking that Teacher Park be held accountable

3
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,560
for tarnishing the school's reputation with a false accusation.

4
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,380
Hey, Oh—

5
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,180
But Mr. Director, you still shouldn't be doing this while there's a student present...

6
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,810
A student?

7
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,260
Oh, it seems like you forgot but I'm clearly a student here.

8
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,000
If you are a student, you should act like one by butting out of teachers' affairs.

9
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,980
Hey! About Kang Bok Soo...

10
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,770
Resignation letter

11
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:22,040
Director, that accusation made against the school isn't false,

12
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,940
and you know that better than anyone else here.

13
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,690
You can approve this resignation letter whenever you feel like it.

14
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,630
Until my time is over at Seolsong,

15
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,500
I will do my best.

16
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,740
I hope you think carefully what your best is.

17
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,240
Oh Se Ho! You are firing Teacher Park, threatening Son Soo Jeong,

18
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,260
and forcing the wildflower class to transfer elsewhere. What are you trying to do here?

19
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,140
Forcing to transfer?

20
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,130
Didn't you hear that it was a special recommendation transfer by the school principal?

21
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,740
You think I don't know what you're thinking?

22
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,880
What you're doing is kicking out all the kids that have poor grades.

23
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,710
Don't you think transferring to another school is better than being miserable as the worst student in the whole school?

24
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,430
No matter where you go there will always be the worst student in the whole school.

25
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,680
Even if we do leave this school, there will be other worst students!

26
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,740
That's not my problem.

27
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,930
Would it be okay as long as we are not the worst students then?

28
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,650
- What?
- Will it work if we raise our grades?

29
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,060
- Who? You?
- Nope.

30
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:16,890
I mean us. If we raise our grades, what are you going to do then?

31
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,000
That sounds good. I will take your offer, Kang Bok Soo.

32
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,500
I'll be looking forward to it, even if it will be impossible to accomplish.

33
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,390
I'd better really watch out. This is seriously brutal, indeed.

34
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,340
A blank resignation letter?

35
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,800
How can we teach here in this scary environment?

36
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,360
I wonder if Kang Bok Soo will be okay.

37
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,710
Is it true that Kang Bok Soo and Director were friends once before?

38
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,820
What? How in the world do they even look like friends?

39
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,030
I would believe it if I were told that they were sworn enemies for goodness sake.

40
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,630
Teacher Son, Kang Bok Soo ranted at the director

41
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,920
that he would raise the grades for the wildflower class, during this week's class placement test.

42
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,390
- Pardon?
- Well, that is...

43
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:21,800
The current overall average 29.5%.

44
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,980
But if they manage to raise it up to 50%,

45
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,370
then they won't transfer elsewhere with the recommendation of the principal.

46
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,890
What do you mean by the transfer with the recommendation of the principal?

47
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,920
How should I know? It's an order made by the director. That's all I know.

48
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,260
Just because he is the director of the school, he can't just make those kinds of decisions on his own.

49
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,850
The parents of the students will complain.

50
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,530
The director is going to meet with the parents of the wildflower class face-to-face as well.

51
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,160
Didn't Kang Bok Soo say that he was going to raise the grades?

52
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,930
Raise the grades for the whole wildflower class, I must add.

53
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,930
Who knows? They might not have to transfer after all.

54
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,880
Hey, wildflowers!

55
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,530
Wildflowers? Oh my, what's wrong with you, elder?

56
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,490
Let's

57
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,680
study.

58
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,840
What the? Did I hear him right? Elder, stu— did you say play basketball?

59
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,640
Oppa, I like you a lot but this is so wrong.

60
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,280
Uncle, you've finally gone mad.

61
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,740
Hey, are you going to get kicked out of school like this?!

62
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,080
If they kick us out, we have no choice but to leave.

63
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,500
The owner of the school wants us to leave.

64
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,790
The owner of the school is the students and not the director.

65
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,550
But realistically, we don't have power in this school.

66
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,720
If we bring up the average grade of the class, we don't have to transfer elsewhere.

67
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,190
Hey, don't you think this is funny?

68
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,440
Just because we are not good academically, they ignore and discriminate against us!

69
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,930
We should at least give it a shot.

70
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,330
Doesn't it piss you off?

71
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,400
He's right. We should give it a shot, kids.

72
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,250
I will also help you to the best of my ability.

73
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,040
Sending you away to another school...

74
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,510
I really despise it.

75
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,170
But I've never really studied before.

76
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,690
Raising the class average?

77
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,650
Just tell them to transfer.

78
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,740
Don't you think that would be easier for them than to study?

79
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,920
Why are you taking a detour when there's an easier path?

80
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,340
We are gathering together to help out the younger ones.

81
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,360
Doesn't it make you feel proud for thinking of that?

82
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,100
Don't you think we should be helping the younger ones take the easier path?

83
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,880
I will officially request this.

84
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,690
Yes, ma'am.

85
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,520
Sorry for not recognizing you, Customer.

86
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,950
If we are going to raise the grade average in a short amount of time, we need a strategy.

87
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,200
I bet it would be hard for these kids to study all of a sudden since they haven't done anything like this before.

88
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,330
What we need to do for those kids more than anything is to help them enhance their concentration skills.

89
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,230
We will try to find a special solution for this.

90
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,790
I think it would be impossible to raise up the grade for mathematics in a short amount of time,

91
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,980
so we should focus on Korean and English.

92
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,490
I can teach Korean, but what should we do about English?

93
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,720
English? I know a person that can help.

94
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,490
Yeong Joon.

95
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,110
Yes?

96
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,070
You said that you'd help me, right?

97
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,730
Yup. What can I do to help you?

98
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,590
Oh, sorry, Teacher. Bok Soo usually isn't a rude kid.

99
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,930
Kang Bok Soo, are you crazy?

100
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,700
Hey kids, it's me, Ma Yeong Joon.

101
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,370
Seolsong High School's 23rd year.

102
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,280
During our school days, I was the bread—

103
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,130
That Ma Yeong Joon?!

104
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,480
- Ma Yeong Joon?
- Yup.

105
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,460
Unfortunately, he couldn't avoid aging and got hit directly.

106
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,070
He got hit on the head real good. I was really shocked.

107
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,590
I'm sorry for not recognizing you. I mean...

108
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,750
Sorry.

109
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:25,120
It's alright. Now that my former classmates are all gathered together,

110
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,290
I don't know why but I feel really happy.

111
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,410
That's right, you might have been a genuine teacher to Kang Bok Soo,

112
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,870
but to me, you were not.

113
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,160
Se Ho—

114
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,560
Teacher Park Dong Joon, I am living proof that your educational philosophy is a failure.

115
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,810
I was your student then, but that boy is dead now.

116
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,800
Teacher.

117
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,430
Would you be okay with having soju with me tonight?

118
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,410
Teacher.

119
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,360
Hey, it's overflowing.

120
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,440
This symbolizes my love for you, Teacher.

121
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,400
Have a drink of that and forget about everything that happened today.

122
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,420
How in the world did you end up promising Se Ho something like that?

123
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,280
Seriously, Teacher, you wait and see.

124
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,780
Did you already forget that Son Soo Jeong helped me raise up 50 points before?!

125
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,100
That's true. I do acknowledge that both you and Soo Jeong are truly determined.

126
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,550
You look rather unwell.

127
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,830
One of my students is doing something wrong,

128
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,880
and my heart feels so heavy for not being able to set him straight.

129
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,980
When it comes to raising children,

130
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,830
their parents are the first ones to take responsibility for the kids, then the teachers are next.

131
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:46,380
You might have lost your student once, but don't you ever let go again.

132
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,140
When the kids are causing trouble, they are basically saying, "Please take a look at me."

133
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,890
"Please help me." To me, it sounds as if they are calling out for help.

134
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,270
How are things coming along with preparing to leave the country?

135
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,280
I will make sure to quickly wrap up what I'm working on now.

136
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,500
I feel sorry for you trying so hard to get a grasp of the business of the school.

137
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,060
We'll just have to wait and see about that.

138
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,760
Don't you dare try to lay hands on what I'm working on right now.

139
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,350
Of course, Mother. I'll be off now.

140
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,860
Student record book

141
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,980
Kang Bok Soo's friends got jobs at the school,

142
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,910
so I was wondering if you were just going to let them be like that?

143
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,410
Why? I think it's quite amusing. I wonder if they were able to find anything.

144
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,860
Should I look into it?

145
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,410
It seems like they are digging into the affairs of the school.

146
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,170
Just let them be.

147
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,720
For the first time, it seems like my goal and Kang Bok Soo's goal are the same

148
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,220
when it comes to flipping this school upside down.

149
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,450
Are you planning to use them?

150
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,410
It would be nice if they were that useful.

151
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,400
So the parents of the school are putting in complaints about me now?

152
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,290
Yes, that's right. For example, since the founding of the school,

153
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,590
we haven't gotten this many complaints apart from the Oh Yeong Min incident.

154
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:24,310
Either way, disciplinary action towards you has been decided.

155
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,560
For the time being, your classes will

156
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,460
have a substitute Korean language teacher.

157
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,370
And Teacher Park will be in charge of the school environment.

158
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,580
What do you mean by taking me off of teaching duties?

159
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,480
Did I do something that bad to take me off of teaching duties?

160
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,850
Why don't you take a look then!

161
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,330
This is how the parents of the students feel and also the kids' sharp look toward you!

162
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,860
Be open-minded to accept others' opinions!

163
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,510
Grievance report

164
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,010
Grievance report

165
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,820
I feel offended that you were playing favorites with the wildflower class during the debate competition.

166
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,290
During class, you made kids do things that were unrelated to college admissions.

167
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,250
It's a bit too much, you know.

168
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,630
Shouldn't sending the kids off to college be a priority?

169
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,880
A teacher with a low performance rating

170
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,970
shouldn't be assigned to the ivy class.

171
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,090
Change the teacher for the subject immediately!

172
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,950
I would like to request that Teacher Park Dong Joon resign.

173
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,860
Teacher. Teacher. Teacher. Teacher.

174
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,080
Why are you doing this kind of work, Teacher?

175
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,320
You are the one who makes people do it and makes sure that they are doing their job right.

176
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,310
Did you already hear about me becoming in charge of the school environment?

177
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,140
Teacher, why are you the only one taking it from them?

178
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,960
Are you worried about Oh Se Ho? Is it because of what he said?

179
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,590
I'm not really sure why Se Ho is being this way just yet,

180
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,690
but there is something that does make me feel worried.

181
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,520
I also feel bad for not being able to be there for him when he was my student.

182
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,980
In my family, there is my mom, my sister, and myself

183
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,390
who have been raising In Ho, but we still had no idea what he was thinking.

184
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,050
The whole family just has to worry about one kid, but we still had no idea about him.

185
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,820
So how can you know those tens and even hundreds of kids while being there for them too?

186
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,510
A teacher isn't a god, you know.

187
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:45,030
The teacher that I know is willing to do his best, hear his students out, and hold their hands (be on their side).

188
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,730
If Oh Se Ho had asked for your help, knowing you, you wouldn't have ignored him.

189
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,570
Right, Teacher? Am I right?

190
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,180
The more he resists, shouldn't you face him even harder?

191
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,260
What's the use of worrying yourself like this?!

192
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,100
There will be more kids going down the wrong path as you waste your time like this.

193
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,780
Se Ho.

194
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,690
Didn't I clearly order you to talk to me formally, Teacher Park Dong Joon?

195
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:30,020
No, I am now speaking with my former student Oh Se Ho.

196
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,460
I'm warning you. Don't call me your student ever again.

197
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,520
Sorry for not embracing you and not being there for you back then.

198
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,380
How could you say that now?

199
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,470
Back then, you looked like a nice, innocent kid when I saw you,

200
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,860
so I wasn't able to hear you screaming inside, in those days.

201
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:55,530
But now that I have made you explode, I can hear somewhat of what's going on inside of you.

202
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,950
Se Ho, please give me another chance.

203
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,840
I know it's late, but can you still give me a chance?

204
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,730
Just go. What would change now?

205
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,370
It's too late to change things now.

206
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,770
Are you regretting what happened a long time ago?

207
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,600
No, never.

208
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,060
Although I can't change the past, I can change the future.

209
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:31,660
I'm sorry that I wasn't a good teacher to you,

210
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,060
but I will keep on trying.

211
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,540
You're wrong now.

212
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:44,450
To change that, I will keep fighting.

213
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,660
This is frustrating.

214
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,430
I have never studied since my birth. How am I supposed to raise my ranking?

215
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,360
I don't like studying but I like school.

216
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,120
- Our school's uniform is pretty.
- Geez.

217
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,680
Me too.

218
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,240
School was starting to be fun.

219
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,050
I hate being forcefully transferred.

220
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,620
I hate it even more because it seems like we're being kicked out by discrimination.

221
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,310
That's right. They're telling us to leave just because we're not good at studying.

222
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,800
Isn't it too mean?

223
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,450
Exactly.

224
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,040
That's what I meant. Let's go study, juniors!

225
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,640
I am...

226
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,140
Wait up.

227
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,100
Let's go together!

228
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,630
Yoon Seung Woo, you come here.

229
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,650
So the point is, utilitarianism means for the greatest numbers and for the greatest

230
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,430
happiness.

231
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,560
How about if you transfer for the greatest numbers and for the

232
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,540
greatest happiness?

233
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,400
Then, you're dismissed.

234
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,430
Kids, let's go study!

235
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,060
What is this? Bok Soo?

236
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,340
What? Why?

237
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,010
What? Oh, shoot.

238
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,180
Idiots.

239
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,000
Move, move, move, move.

240
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,740
Hello.

241
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,190
Run away! You should at least run!

242
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:18,880
Quickly!

243
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,740
Ouch.

244
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,230
What is this?

245
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,390
Starting now, we will begin your special training.

246
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,230
Uhm pa.

247
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,760
Uhm pa.

248
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,400
Uhm pa.

249
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,470
We will engrave one English word into one brain cell.

250
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,360
Uhm pa.

251
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,140
Uhm pa.

252
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,540
Uhm pa.

253
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:52,460
Uhm pa.

254
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,740
Actually, a story about school corruption won't have that much impact.

255
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,900
It'll be the same wherever you go.

256
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,750
Is the impact important when the school is being corroded?

257
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,690
Excuse me, wait...

258
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,410
Director, Teacher Park Dong Joon is meeting with Reporter Choi now.

259
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,610
Will he go to the Education Committee next?

260
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,340
Hello, mothers of the wildflower class.

261
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,320
I'm Seolsong High's director, Oh Se Ho.

262
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,460
Transferring students to meet their needs is true equality.

263
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,110
At Seolsong High, where the focus is on academic performance,

264
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,140
your children are evaluated against the same standards as others.

265
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,750
It could be an assault on the students of the wildflower class.

266
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,830
If studying is not their forte, then we need to find another path for them boldly.

267
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,520
Schools shouldn't force their students to follow the stereotyped education.

268
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,560
It is my educational philosophy for suggesting various possibilities for them.

269
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,190
Excuse me. I will definitely make my son Jae Hoon go to college.

270
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,900
Yes, Mother. It'll be more advantageous for him to get into college if he transfers to a different school.

271
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,820
Seolsong's internal competition will be more fierce than in any other schools now.

272
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,570
And transferring to another school will give him a higher score on his GPA record.

273
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:40,560
If my kid wants to attend this school, I want to let him.

274
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,760
Please think about what is the best for them.

275
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,340
Our kids... are still very young.

276
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:56,100
Your wise decision will be the right investment for their future.

277
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,770
Came to check up on you.

278
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,360
You pretty kids, was it hard studying?

279
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,400
Teacher, it's too weird here.

280
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,140
I want to go home, Teacher.

281
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,150
Okay, I know it's hard.

282
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,130
Let's show them that your will is stronger

283
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,970
than the choices and the decisions of the selfish adults.

284
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,770
No matter the result, your hard work will have significance,

285
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,800
even this time when you guys are all together with your friends.

286
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,460
Good!

287
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,720
In order to make this time more meaningful,

288
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,810
I will treat you guys to a

289
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,170
full course of black bean noodles and sweet and sour pork!

290
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,390
Hold on.

291
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,030
Forget the sweet and sour pork, just black bean noodles.

292
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,140
Why?

293
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,400
Just study.
