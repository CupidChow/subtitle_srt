1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,240
He should be feeding rice to a growing kid but instead, he feeds her ramen.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,690
- Why?
- Why are you so naive?

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,360
What are you saying? Who's naive?

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,370
My dad purposely left me alone.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,430
So I can look pitiful.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,400
I can cook well.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,000
And you should eat this.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,250
I would've never expected this.

9
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,660
Kim Myeong Ho, I'm going to catch you!

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,900
This man is crazy over gambling.

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,890
Where is he right now?

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,420
At least let me know the reason before I look for him. Who is this guy?

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,050
He's a contracted admin employee for Seolsong High.

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,130
The teacher that I saved...

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,260
was Son Soo Jeong.

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,780
What? Why would you just tell me that now, you crazy man?!

17
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,930
I knew she looked familiar.

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,390
But why did you save her?

19
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,110
She was scammed by him.

20
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,860
I heard she told a student who was going to commit suicide to die together.

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,050
Hey, you should have left her to die especially with what she did to you.

22
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,190
Don't look for him!

23
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,990
Why? Did Son Soo Jeong ask you to find him?

24
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,390
Is she a client or something?

25
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,730
What are you going to do when you find him?

26
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,760
She probably has seen that video too.

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,770
If she's seen it, she should come say thank you or that she won't forget your kindness.

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,850
At least words.

29
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,490
If words are hard, at least give some money. She's terrible to the end.

30
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,150
Are you done?

31
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,590
Yeah.

32
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,370
Life is such a battle, seeing a smart kid like her being scammed.

33
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,410
Hey, he's coming.

34
00:01:54,410 --> 00:02:00,140
Five, four, three, two, one.

35
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,080
What's going on?

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,030
Look at these kids.

37
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,750
You guys did something bad, right? You're hiding something, right?

38
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,660
What do you mean something bad? This isn't school!

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,120
Why did you come again?

40
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,660
I'm not here to see you. I'm here to see Bok Soo.

41
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,350
Pardon? Why?

42
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,110
Come back to school, Bok Soo.

43
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,110
Wow! Wow! That's the funniest thing I've heard this year.

44
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,130
Teacher, did you drink in the daytime?

45
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,400
What do you mean a 27-year-old going to school?

46
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Right? Why would I go there?

47
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,130
Why should my Bok Soo go back there?

48
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,760
Mom.

49
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,390
Due to the incident of saving a student,

50
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,410
the school suggested reinstating Bok Soo.

51
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,890
They want to give him another chance to learn.

52
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,010
Opportunity?

53
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,190
I don't want to hear it so please leave.

54
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,310
Mother, I understand your feelings.

55
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,220
But, until when is Bok Soo going to live like this?

56
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,620
What's wrong with living like this?

57
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,020
What's wrong with living someone else's life for them?

58
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,230
"I wish I could've lived Bok Soo's life for him during that time,"

59
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,260
is what I think a dozen, no... a thousand times each day.

60
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,520
Don't sway someone who's working hard. Just leave.

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,750
- Mother.
- Hurry and leave!

62
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,730
H-Hold on. Please listen to me—

63
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,920
Why did you come all the way here?

64
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,060
I'm going to leave.

65
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,000
You should stop contacting that man.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,500
He's a teacher at school but how dare he come here and act like a teacher!

67
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,740
I'm leaving.

68
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,260
I'm leaving. Don't come outside!

69
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,780
They say even a flea has a mug.
(He has no shame)

70
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,920
Do you even know how my son lived during that time?

71
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,100
Wait, wait, hold up.

72
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,740
I told you to eat. Why did you come outside?

73
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,020
Oh, right. The one with a blue top is yours.

74
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,390
Why? Is it something different?

75
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,920
I put two eggs in there.

76
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,400
Aigoo, because of that teacher...

77
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,070
You don't have to laboriously pack a bento for me. I can just buy it from here.

78
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,690
I came to see my son's face one more time. Why?

79
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,480
Are you wanting to go back to that school?

80
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,190
No.

81
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,720
Yeah, we thought it'd be trouble if we didn't go to school back in my generation.

82
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,860
The world has changed. The fourth industrial revolution is in front of our eyes.

83
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,200
You're more educated than me.

84
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,870
You punk. It must be nice to be dumber than your mom.

85
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,480
Go inside and eat!

86
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,810
I'll eat it well!

87
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,330
Go back safely!

88
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,350
Teacher Son, my baby is feeling unwell so I left first.

89
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,460
Please take care of the supplementary lessons too!

90
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,120
You must be busy but go check out the war weapon club too!

91
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Make test questions! Fighting!

92
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,990
Yes, yes. I have to do everything.

93
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,530
Because I'm a temporary employee.

94
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,060
Teacher Park, how did it go?

95
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,430
Bok Soo said he's not coming.

96
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,080
So you just said "okay" and came back?

97
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,190
You said you were going to make him return no matter what!

98
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,180
If the chairwoman hears this, she'll throw a fit.

99
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,850
What was the reason for not coming?

100
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,510
Well, I mean he probably wouldn't come being that old anyway.

101
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,190
I don't know. You take responsibility over Kang Bok Soo and make him return!

102
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,590
Kang Bok Soo?

103
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,280
Why would "Kang Bok Soo" come out right now?

104
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,020
Teacher Son, can we talk?

105
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,980
Teacher, I don't feel so well.

106
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,870
I have to make the test questions and take care of the club stuff too.

107
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,130
Do it slowly.

108
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,790
Tell me.

109
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,550
So? If Kang Bok Soo doesn't come, do you think there's a bigger issue than this?

110
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,880
Make sure to make Kang Bok Soo come back to school.

111
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,710
The picture is good. I'm telling you to make it! Okay?!

112
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,550
There's nothing that's going correctly.

113
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,910
Bok Soo isn't coming?

114
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,430
I knew it wasn't going to be easy but...

115
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,900
I'll bring him in.

116
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,810
You will?

117
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,860
Yes. We're friends.

118
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,040
Weren't you going to run instead of me?

119
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,070
Excuse me, please say something that makes sense.

120
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,250
My client is your wife. I'm making you run instead of her. Understand?

121
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,280
Let's go.

122
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,060
Let's go.

123
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,540
But am I satisfying you by eating in your stead?

124
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,420
I'm full just from watching you eat.

125
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,030
This is an eating show that's just for me.

126
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,610
Jeo-Jang (to save one's heart).

127
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,520
Don't be like this and please eat while making some noise.

128
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,210
- While chewing.
- Okay.

129
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,050
Oh, yeah.

130
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,770
Oh my god.

131
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,880
A little bit more.

132
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,720
Jesus.

133
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,640
Oh my god!

134
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:47,180
Is this really black bean noodle delivery?

135
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,320
Yeah. The client wants it from So Jeong Gak restaurant.

136
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,490
There are such crazy men like that in this world.

137
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,390
Oh and I think Kim Myeong Ho will be finished soon.

138
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,260
Okay, I got it. Hang up.

139
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,590
We love all your request—

140
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,300
It's been a long time, Kang Bok Soo.

141
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,560
Are you surprised?

142
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,520
Has it been nine years?

143
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,130
You haven't changed at all.

144
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,730
I prepared this because I thought it would be more dramatic.

145
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,570
So Jeong Gak

146
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,190
Please enjoy your food, customer.

147
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,740
I have one more request.

148
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,780
Come to school.

149
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,110
- What?
- Be a substitute man and come to school. It's simple.

150
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,610
- You crazy—
- Just think you're going in place of a student until the news quiets down.

151
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,310
I'll pay you however much you want.

152
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,690
Hey, am I crazy? To go back there?

153
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,940
Doesn't it feel unfair quitting school like that?

154
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,260
This bast***!

155
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,630
Because of you—!

156
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,020
So come to school.

157
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,190
I'm going to become the board chairman of Seolsong High soon.

158
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,160
The guy who was crazy to die was living well all along.

159
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,710
I'm the idiot for trying to forgive you thinking you're a pitiful guy.

160
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,350
Shouldn't I be the one who should be forgiving?

161
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,100
I... am the victim.

162
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,940
Think about it well.

163
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,030
I'll probably get scolded by Mom for this.

164
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,930
Yeah, why?

165
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,300
Bok Soo, Kim Myeong Ho is about to finish.

166
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,470
He's leaving.

167
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,350
He even used all his loans at the end. Going home is now a matter of time.

168
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,410
Okay, I understand.

169
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,910
Mr. Kim Myeong Ho?

170
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,820
Who? You know me?

171
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,250
I know you. Scammer.

172
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,780
Stop following me.

173
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,560
I'm tired, Kim Myeong Ho. How about we stop and go down?

174
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,590
Seriously.

175
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,180
Come down! Come down.

176
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,150
Please just leave!

177
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,430
It's danger—

178
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,980
She is my girlfriend, you bastard!

179
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,580
Teacher, it really wasn't me.

180
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,590
I didn't push him. Why would I push Se Ho!?

181
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,070
Teacher, I was grabbing his fingertips so I could save him!

182
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,620
I really didn't push him!

183
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,100
Fortunately, Se Ho woke up.

184
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:32,060
But... he said you... pushed him.

185
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,640
Crazy bast***.

186
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,520
Why would I push him?

187
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,860
Teacher, did he not hurt his head when he fell?

188
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,890
I have no reason to push him!

189
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:58,470
Bok Soo... Soo Jeong already testified everything.

190
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,820
This isn't so, Bok Soo.

191
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,770
Ahjussi, it's really not Bok Soo.

192
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,170
Bok Soo.

193
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,880
Son Soo Jeong!

194
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,170
You know it wasn't me.

195
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,880
Let go!

196
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,790
Soo Jeong, you know it wasn't me.

197
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,520
Why are you lying?!

198
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,340
Let go of me. Are you not?

199
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,980
Ah, this bastard.

200
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,670
Hyungnim.

201
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,920
Welcome.

202
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,660
You're late.

203
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,350
Yeah.

204
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,650
Sim Lan, I'm tired.

205
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,460
You look like it. Your face is rotten.

206
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,030
Hiring part-time workers

207
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,450
Sim Lan, how long do I have to work at a convenience store to get 50 million won ($50,000)?

208
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,780
Fifty million won?

209
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,980
Calculating with the minimum wage 7,530 won,

210
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,720
ten hours a day...

211
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,250
Should I calculate overtime payments as well?

212
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,530
Take it out for now.

213
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,350
Then in a month, 2,259,000 won.

214
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,400
In a year,

215
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,820
27,108,000 won.

216
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,670
That means you'll have to work two years without spending any money on food and other things.

217
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,320
Two years? Kim Myeong Ho, you—

218
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,610
Grab another one.

219
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,970
Why?! Are you pitying me?

220
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,410
No, it's a 1+1.

221
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,160
I finished the test problems,

222
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,150
so starting tomorrow, I'm going on the lookout for Kim Myeong Ho.

223
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,150
You can do it, Son Soo Jeong! Mother!

224
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,370
Kim Myeong Ho?

225
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,400
It's been a long time.

226
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,340
You jerk. Give me back my money!

227
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,030
- Give it back!
- Aigoo.

228
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,380
I also didn't know it would end up like this.

229
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,620
The money isn't with me.

230
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,210
I swear I only delivered it and didn't take a penny out.

231
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,240
To whom? To whom did you give it to?

232
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,990
You know

233
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,950
the food chain, right?

234
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,460
You have the sun.

235
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,450
The plants photosynthesize from the sun and the grasshoppers eat those plants.

236
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,570
Then the grasshoppers get eaten by the frogs.

237
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,130
Did he go crazy?

238
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,800
Then that frog gets eaten by the bird which gets eaten by the fox.

239
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,100
And at the end, the tiger eats the fox. That food chain!

240
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,640
Eat and get eaten relationship!

241
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,570
Teacher Son, you can think of me as that grass.

242
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,460
My money... Where's my money!?

243
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,210
You come here. I'm going to put you in jail tonight.

244
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,320
If I get arrested,

245
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,070
it'll be revealed that you tried to buy your way into full-time.

246
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,770
Then you won't even be able to do short-term.

247
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,770
Will that be okay?

248
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,070
This is why people should not try to take shortcuts.

249
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,600
Because there's no one you can tell if something unfair happens.

250
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,600
What bullshit.

251
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,290
But why did you come here?

252
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,430
Were you going to make some conscience confession?

253
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:13,860
Some kind of good-looking punk, I mean sir...

254
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:20,200
Wait, no. Anyway,

255
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,480
I'm very sorry.

256
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,220
I'll live with an apologetic mind for the rest of my life.

257
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:32,350
Well then, Teacher Son, I really hope you become a full-time teacher.

258
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,610
You scared me!

259
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,140
Excuse me. I didn't speak a word about you—

260
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,920
Don't think about running away somewhere.

261
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,930
Finding people is my specialty.

262
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,850
Come out. I told you to come out!

263
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,960
I know that you're hiding over there, Kang Bok Soo.

264
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,240
So come out. It is you and I know it.

265
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,790
You thought that I would thank you for this?

266
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,170
You are still the same as ever, that personality of yours.

267
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:00,210
What the heck are you? Who the hell are you to be so nosy anyway?

268
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:08,200
Just because. You are a girl who's so well off, but you thought about dying and it made me wonder why.

269
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,200
But then, it was because you were scammed into buying your way into that teaching position of yours?

270
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,970
Did I ever tell you to save me?

271
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,890
Seriously, what turned you into a person like this anyway?

272
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,020
Shouldn't you at least say a word of thanks first as a human being?

273
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,160
People change. That's how you can survive in this world.

274
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,400
Didn't I tell you before that you should memorize it if you just can't seem to get it?

275
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,290
So you want to pay your way into becoming a teacher then?!

276
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,130
Just so that you can survive?!

277
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,010
A person like that doesn't deserve to be a teacher in the first place.

278
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,720
You don't have to memorize this to get it.

279
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,190
Snap out of it, Kang Bok Soo!

280
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,720
Just because you saved a person and in return, they notice you and beg you to come back to school,

281
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,890
you feel like you have become somebody and even well off?

282
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,250
- What?
- People just get led by the interesting issue of the day,

283
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,220
and you just happen to be the lucky one at the moment.

284
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,270
Don't be so proud. They are just using you to cover up the case anyway.

285
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,820
Nothing's going to change. No matter what you do you are nothing but an expelled student.

286
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,340
I'm leaving.

287
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,040
Don't come to the school!

288
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,950
I don't even freaking pee in near the school gate anyway!

289
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,480
Director's Office

290
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:01,790
You might think that it's quite arrogant for a lowly person like myself to come in here,

291
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,360
but I really have something to speak to you about.

292
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,240
To the administrative office worker Kim Myeong Ho, I...

293
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,130
Son Soo Jeong.

294
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,980
Oh Se Ho?

295
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,680
What were you going to tell me earlier?

296
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,420
Huh?

297
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,920
Oh, it's nothing really.

298
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,940
Thanks for saving the student.

299
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,390
It's my duty. I had no idea that you were the son of the director.

300
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:48,060
I'm pretty sure there are a lot of things that you don't know about me yet.

301
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,870
You have no idea who I had eyes on the whole time, right?

302
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,530
That makes sense since you only had one guy in mind at the time.

303
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,160
You didn't call me over here to talk about things from a long time ago, right?

304
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,620
Why should my precious daughter meet someone like you?

305
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,930
Break it off right now.

306
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,950
Mom, please lower your voice.

307
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,880
Do you even know what shame is? Then why are you going out with such man like him?

308
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,290
This place is not so good. Should we go somewhere else?

309
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:09,970
I'm fine.

310
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,320
How much do you want?

311
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,660
How much should I pay you to break up with my pretty little daughter?

312
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,620
Fifty million won ($50,000).

313
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,180
Sorry.

314
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:24,700
I think 50 million won would be a good amount to break it off without having any lingering feelings.

315
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,030
You are still funny as ever.

316
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:33,340
I have a favor to ask you.

317
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,340
Please help me bring Kang Bok Soo back to school.

318
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,230
You know that there's a bit of a commotion because of Bok Soo.

319
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,590
Soo Jeong, if you tell him to come, Bok Soo for sure will...

320
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,590
I'm leaving first.

321
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,590
I heard that you were close to the administrative worker Kim Myeong Ho.

322
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,140
If you bring Kang Bok Soo, I will hire you as a permanent full-time teacher.

323
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,760
I remember you helping me in the past too.

324
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,630
What?

325
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,500
Please help me again.

326
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,330
When did I ever?

327
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,190
Why do you have to think so hard about it? It's a good opportunity for both of us. It's a win-win situation, you know.

328
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,210
I'll take it that you agree. I'm leaving now.

329
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,280
Your elder is speaking to you.

330
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,290
Seriously, Mom, did you go mad?!

331
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,820
You probably were looking forward to this. Well, I put in the perfect amount for the kind of person you are.

332
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,420
You silly girl.

333
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,620
I'm so sorry. I know splashing you with water wasn't on the contract.

334
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,040
Man, if my real boyfriend came out and saw this...

335
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,230
Why are all women like that, huh?

336
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,630
Just to get what they want, is it right to use their former boyfriends?! Geez.

337
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,540
Excuse me!

338
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,210
I heard that Mr. Kang Book Soo is on his way over.

339
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,110
I don't think you have to track him down any longer.

340
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,120
Thanks for the good work.

341
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,220
Yes, I understand.

342
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,510
Why are they doing this to me?

343
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:04,820
My life is already ruined anyway. I lived quietly despite the unfairness and all.

344
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,830
But, my goodness.

345
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:08,700
Come to school.

346
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,540
Don't you feel it's unfair quitting school like that?

347
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,420
Don't be so proud. Nothing will change.

348
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,640
You are nothing but an expelled student.

349
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,490
If you bring Kang Bok Soo to me, I will hire you as a permanent full-time teacher.

350
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,810
You helped me once in the past.

351
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm the one who should forgive.

352
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,760
Since I'm the victim after all.

353
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,560
So you want to do whatever you want with this life that I have now too?

354
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,500
The new director of the school

355
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,560
is from an ivy league school

356
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,130
The S High School

357
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:47,820
If you bring Kang Bok Soo, I'll hire you as a full-time teacher.

358
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,870
Will get rid of the old school system of S High School.

359
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,890
S High School director will lead the school with an innovative and revolutionary school system

360
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,630
If he must play with my life like this,

361
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,880
I guess I have to mess with him for real.

362
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,470
Grasshopper

363
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,700
Grass

364
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,290
Kim Myeong Ho

365
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,520
50 million won

366
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:44,560
Kang Bok Soo

367
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,550
Kang Bok Soo?

368
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,890
Kang Bok Soo.

369
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,960
Bok Soo has come back.

370
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,500
My Strange Hero

371
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,680
♫ You keep on constantly permeating me. ♫

372
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,770
The person who is supporting my admittance...

373
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,140
I, Kang Bok Soo, will try and live diligently.

374
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,490
Teacher Son goes to field flower class.

375
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,600
There's one missing.

376
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,070
Who are you?

377
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,360
Kang Bok Soo, please get out of my life.

378
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,300
What was there between us anyway?

379
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,660
I thought there was a lot going on between us,

380
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,420
but there was nothing.

381
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,380
Is that the only thing you can say to me?

382
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,950
What is there to say between us?

383
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,320
You have nothing to say, huh? Then I will help you remember it.

384
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,320
♫ My love. ♫
