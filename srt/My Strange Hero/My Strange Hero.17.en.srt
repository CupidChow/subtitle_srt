00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,750
Episode 17

2
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:42,070
You two... can never...

3
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,660
be happy.

4
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,400
Hey. Whatever wrong I've done to you,

5
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,390
was the thing you committed against me nine years ago not enough for you?

6
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,500
Breaking up because of you once is enough.

7
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,380
Now it's your turn to get hurt.

8
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,750
You are going to regret the choice you just made.

9
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,260
It's going to be very hard for you guys from now on.

10
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,400
If I open my mouth right now, it's only a short moment before you're fired!

11
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,600
Every moment is a crisis in my life.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,280
That's why you went back to school.

13
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,110
But who's the one dating at school?

14
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,930
Hey, you guys, let's do it together.

15
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,660
Huh? Help me get revenge.

16
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,950
Isn't revenge self-service?

17
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:30,090
Of course. Traditionally, water, pickled radish, and revenge are self-service.

18
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,140
I'm formally requesting.

19
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,520
Aigoo, Mr. Client.

20
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,840
This has got to be done right. I had to withdraw my CD, which I had been saving little by little, for this.

21
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,710
This... is your employee discount.

22
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,080
From where should we start?

23
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,490
I will pay for your kindness to reinstate me to the school—

24
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,050
Including Teacher Son's case,

25
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,840
make a list of all the teachers who were hired by paying money to our school.

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,700
As for Teacher Son, because I needed money, I scammed her—

27
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,040
Well, you could say I borrowed from her for a short while.

28
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,370
Well whatever it is, I need to know

29
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,000
how much money is dealt with for a teacher position.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,370
You're acquainted with Kim Myeong Ho, right?

31
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,500
Yes, that's right. He is someone I used.

32
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,890
I called him in before he went to the media.

33
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,270
Share the responsibility and share the benefit

34
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,130
so that he doesn't cause an issue with the people.

35
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,310
This time, use him well.

36
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,530
What do you mean by 'use'?

37
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,430
Keep doing what you've been doing.

38
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,030
The work that my mother, the directors, the principal, and the vice-principal have been doing.

39
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm my mother's son.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,300
There's no reason for me to interfere.

41
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,610
Ah, yes. That's true. This is a family business.

42
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,340
I understood you very well.

43
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,100
Prepare for a forced transfer of the wildflower class.

44
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,890
D-Director, what do you mean by a forced transfer? That doesn't work the way you want—

45
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,410
Transfer him to another school for vocational training, or

46
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,140
use punishment mileage, or you can make up anything to expel him.

47
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,000
No, to do this all of a sudden like this, it'll be hard for the kids to accept.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,970
And wasn't it you who made the wildflower class?

49
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,000
This is the reason why I made that class.

50
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,050
To get rid of those students who fall below standards.

51
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,020
That rude!

52
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,520
He's gone crazy.

53
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,390
He's worse than his mother!

54
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,240
Did he get dumped? How dare he release his anger on us when he's the one who got dumped?

55
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,810
He's at that age. He's so young.

56
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,170
At that age, I also was dumped like every day.

57
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,670
I've never gotten dumped before, so I have no idea how that feels.

58
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,390
No matter what, this is a school. He can't forcefully transfer kids as he wishes.

59
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,860
That's what I'm saying. Does this make any sense?

60
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,260
Okay, at times like these, we need to stand together and endure.

61
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,670
Have strength. Fighting!

62
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,510
Have strength, Son Soo Jeong.

63
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,360
The greater the danger, the more you need to focus.

64
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,780
You didn't become a teacher through money.

65
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,740
Don't be scared.

66
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,110
You didn't forget about our appointment, right?

67
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,260
I'm not in the mood to go out.

68
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,180
No... You shouldn't make Bok Soo worried.

69
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,320
What's this? This awkward gathering.

70
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,010
We're not that close to be eating chicken together, right?

71
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,640
Uh... I'm going to formally introduce to you.

72
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,820
My girlfriend...

73
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,640
Son Soo Jeong.

74
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:32,260
For the past nine years, because you were beside me,

75
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,760
I was able to endure.

76
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,290
I'm grateful and again thankful.

77
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:48,240
Even though I knew how you felt about me, I pretended not to know.

78
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,960
I'm really sorry about that.

79
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,120
Even though you took the long route...

80
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,580
You're saying it's Son Soo Jeong, right?

81
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,060
Even though I knew I was the only one having feelings,

82
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,400
I'm the one who held on,

83
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,010
so you don't have to be sorry for me, Bok Soo.

84
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:34,370
If you're sorry, don't ever have a hard time

85
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,840
and be happy.

86
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,990
Be happy.

87
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,470
Let's go. You two can eat the chicken.

88
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,690
Get up.

89
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:12,510
Thank you. For being next to Bok Soo for nine years.

90
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:21,720
And... I'm sorry for hurting your feelings.

91
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,510
Bad wench. Why is she saying that to me now?

92
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,050
I can't even curse at her.

93
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,040
Stop crying.

94
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,390
I'll buy you something more delicious than chicken.

95
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,050
Should we use the knife (eat steak)?

96
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,990
Kim Myeong Ho was threatening me.

97
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,750
But I feel so embarrassed since I can't really do anything about it since all of it was my fault.

98
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,750
Honestly,

99
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,210
I'm scared that I'll get canned.

100
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,750
I'm shaking in my boots because of that stupid thing called money.

101
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,440
I feel so miserable.

102
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,860
I'm sure anybody that's in your position would feel scared too.

103
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,670
It also wouldn't be easy to come forward and interfere either.

104
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,130
Stupid Oh Se Ho. Whoever saved a guy like that in the first place is the real problem.

105
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,390
Oh Se Ho

106
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,180
told me that he likes me.

107
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,810
I know.

108
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,560
Did he even confess to you?

109
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,850
I turned him down, and he told me that things will get harder for the both of us.

110
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,940
And right away, Kim Myeong Ho appears.

111
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,550
He told me that you'll be in danger because of me.

112
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,280
Soo Jeong.

113
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,890
If something like that were to really happen,

114
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,430
I am going to just quit school.

115
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,460
You can't do that! You can't do that a second time.

116
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,310
Bok Soo.

117
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,620
We shouldn't sacrifice the present

118
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,200
just because we are worried about the future.

119
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,210
I don't want to do that.

120
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,860
Let's not do that.

121
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,790
Let's overcome this together.

122
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,300
Let's make sure to do that.

123
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,720
Hey.

124
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,160
Hey.

125
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,240
Hey!

126
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,160
Why do you keep on calling me? I'm right here.

127
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,760
Huh?

128
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,550
You are not Son Soo Jeong.

129
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,120
Son Soo Jeong isn't ugly like this.

130
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,000
Seriously, you little...

131
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,050
Hey, be prepared, alright?

132
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,260
We're going to be really busy soon.

133
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,310
Why?

134
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,700
If we are going to be dating to make up for the nine years we missed,

135
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,520
we'll be super busy.

136
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,190
You know, we have a lot of things to do, I say.

137
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,600
For nine years

138
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,160
there were so many things that we hadn't done together.

139
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,290
♫ From now on, it’s our love story  ♫

140
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:08,860
I'm going to pay you back for hurting you for nine years.

141
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,510
I will look after Kang Bok Soo.

142
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,040
Just trust me.

143
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,370
I'll give you a piggyback ride.

144
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,990
I'm not drunk yet.

145
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,680
So cold.

146
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,270
Oh my.

147
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,240
♫ Stay with me ♫

148
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,360
♫ You, how should I say it? ♫

149
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,890
♫ Should I confess everything?  ♫

150
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,110
♫ Love you, words in my heart  ♫

151
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,650
Whose son is he? He's so handsome.

152
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,760
He's my son.

153
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,290
Thanks for taking care of In Ho last time.

154
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,130
My pleasure. It was my duty—

155
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,970
But, what kind of sports did you play in the past?

156
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,040
When I saw you last time, you had such a powerful grip—

157
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,180
What?!

158
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,580
Teacher, I can call you auntie, right?

159
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,420
Wow, a goddess like Teacher Soo Jeong is my auntie.

160
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,530
- Uh, what?!
- Says who?!

161
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:25,710
Ever since you came out with the truth, you've become rather relaxed, haven't you!

162
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,210
We feel burdened by people with professional careers, alright?

163
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,370
- Professional careers?
- Teachers.

164
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,490
Mom, you don't feel burdened?

165
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,650
I'm against this.

166
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,350
I'm for it.

167
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,090
This is so chaotic.

168
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,800
-Just go and get some sleep.
- Why are you constantly telling me to go to sleep?

169
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,390
I have things that I'm curious about.

170
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,650
Our Bok Soo and you had something together nine years ago.

171
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,580
Is Bok Soo your son now? He is my son!

172
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,550
Don't be so concerned with my son's affairs, and just go to your room and get some sleep.

173
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,250
Oh my, look at the time here.

174
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,380
Well then, I must get going now. In Ho, I will be seeing you at school tomorrow.

175
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,720
Oh my.

176
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,150
It's late so you should just spend the night here.

177
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,400
The buses stop running at this hour, so how can you go when it's going be so dangerous this late at night?

178
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,500
What do you mean? Who's going to be in danger here?

179
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,510
She looks like the type that can beat up a bull.

180
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,690
Teacher.

181
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,980
To celebrate you being my auntie tonight, we will take a selfie together.

182
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,670
One, two, thr—

183
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,550
Please spend the night here tonight. My room is upstairs. Get up!

184
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,530
You don't dislike me?

185
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,530
Back then—

186
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,330
It's not like you were at peace with yourself either.

187
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,290
For so long, just as much as our dear Bok Soo,

188
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,310
you probably went through a lot of hardships too, during those times.

189
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,240
So, how can I dislike you? But I rather feel bad for you.

190
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm sure your life wasn't a bed of roses either because of my son and things related to him.

191
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,560
The young kids are clumsy at the things they do.

192
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,580
So we grown-ups should be blamed for not looking after you guys properly

193
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,740
and not being able to set things straight for you.

194
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,730
I won't be a grown-up like that.

195
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,990
I won't be that kind that of

196
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,080
teacher.

197
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,450
Uh, what is this?

198
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,590
I think something good happened?

199
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,350
I will look after Kang Bok Soo.

200
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,140
Just trust me.

201
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,280
For those nine years that I've hurt you

202
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,810
I'm going to make them all up to you.

203
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,530
School.

204
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,310
Ms. Lee, I have to eat and go to school...

205
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,520
What the? Hey! What are you doing here?

206
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,560
Is that hairstyle of yours a conceptual thing?

207
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,880
Sit down and eat.

208
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,980
Oh my hair.

209
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,850
Auntie, eat to your heart's content.

210
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,490
I'll call you Teacher at school.

211
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:43,150
Hey Sis, In Ho doesn't need to do well in school.

212
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,110
This kid is super witty, you know,

213
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,420
so he'll be able to make it out alive fine.

214
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,970
I think he's a genius.

215
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,260
- Have some meat.
- Thank you.

216
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,400
Our dear Soo Jeong loves meat.

217
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,340
My son loves meat too.

218
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,930
Please make a list of the students that will participate in the school debate session by today and submit it.

219
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,780
It will be a competition that will go into the student record book.

220
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,310
The teachers that will be participating as the judges need to be solidly prepared too.

221
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,700
This is a competition made for the ivy class kids to get special awards and stuff.

222
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,040
So is it necessary to make our kids a part of this to serve as a foil?

223
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,620
If the ivy class just received the awards, it would just make things more obvious.

224
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,220
Of course, the principal and the assistant principal would love to just give out all those awards to ivy class kids.

225
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,000
But everything has a process and steps, right?

226
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,230
Just like dating has a procedure.

227
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,540
Do we need a procedure for a rejection?

228
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,450
Then, Teacher Son, who will go from the wildflower class?

229
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,520
Hello.

230
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,140
Well, everyone. You all know about the debate contest, right?

231
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,740
Those who will participate, raise your hand.

232
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:42,170
Students, if you win, you will receive a perfect score on your performance test, and it will look good on your student record.

233
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,300
We are the wildflower class. What debating?

234
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,350
It will be difficult for us to have a normal conversation for longer than one minute.

235
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,710
But we still need participants. We have to have three people.

236
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,240
Teacher! Me.

237
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,830
Okay, Yeong Min, thank you.

238
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,310
Okay, now we have two more left.

239
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,840
Okay! Yoon Seung Woo. This is your punishment for tardiness.

240
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,560
You're on the debate team.

241
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,750
Then, the last remaining—

242
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,470
I recommend Kang Bok Soo.

243
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,950
I-I'm not good at debating.

244
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,570
Ah, why? When you pulled me out of the glass booth that time, you were good at speaking.

245
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,920
Okay. So our class president is selected as our last debate team member by recommendation.

246
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,240
You can't change it.

247
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,180
T-Teacher.

248
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,860
Hey! Hey!

249
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,880
♫ Is this love? ♫

250
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,190
♫ I just don’t know what this feeling is​ ♫

251
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,100
I'm here.
♫ I want you ♫

252
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,800
Oh, you're here.
♫ I need you ♫

253
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,310
Ahem.
♫ Once more, for no reason  ♫

254
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,880
♫ I wanna see you ♫

255
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,750
Oh!
♫ After I shut my eyes tight and lay down ♫

256
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,110
Noona, today, are you going on a blind date?
♫ I kept tossing and turning at thoughts of you. I'm not sure— ♫

257
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,080
Alright. That's a good idea. Bok Soo belongs to another woman already.

258
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,030
This time, don't have a one-sided crush. Try for the real thing.

259
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,900
You're wrong. It's not a blind date.

260
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,770
I'm going to interview at Seolsong High.

261
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,200
Really?

262
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,040
Then, first check the administration.

263
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,400
Ah, right. Even though I got movie tickets for free,

264
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,350
I don't have anyone to go with. Man!

265
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,090
I wanted to see this movie after the interview.

266
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:49,120
What should I do? I'd rather die than go see a movie by myself.

267
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,960
Should I throw them away?

268
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,940
Really?

269
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,970
Then give them to me. I will go watch with Bok Soo.

270
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,290
Why would Bok Soo go with you? Wouldn't he take Son Soo Jeong instead of you?

271
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,110
What in the world?

272
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,740
I should quit this job!

273
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,940
Why do I like that fool who can't even read my intention—

274
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,150
Why do I like him?

275
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,550
Yang Min Ji, get a hold of yourself!

276
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,620
If you fall for an ugly guy,

277
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,450
there is no cure for that.

278
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,920
As for basic skills, I am good at using Excel and Powerpoint.
Resume

279
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,430
My father used to run a printing company, so I am really good at printing.

280
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,540
And my hands are quite fast.

281
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,500
Oh. I like that, your hands being fast.

282
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,260
Okay.

283
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,530
Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.

284
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,750
Ta-da!

285
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,360
You passed.

286
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,390
But would you be my partner, Miss Yang Min Ji?

287
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,500
If we work together, I think we could make a lot of money.

288
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,130
"While Waiting for You" by Hwang Jiwoo

289
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,540
Alright. Start copying.

290
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,340
The rooftop?

291
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,530
For you—

292
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,870
Are you crazy, Kang Bok Soo? During class time—

293
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,990
Why? We won't get caught.

294
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,690
This won't do. Until you graduate, from now on we have a platonic relationship.

295
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,720
Do you understand?

296
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,480
Pl-plato... Okay. Call (it's a deal). I'll do whatever you say, Teacher.

297
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay. Platonic. We are in a platonic relationship. I will protect you.

298
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,190
Protect? Protect what, Teacher Son?!

299
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,580
If you have time for protecting something, you need to protect your seat first.

300
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,630
You are always leaving your post.

301
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,550
What are you protecting standing out here?! You need to stay in your seat to protect anything.

302
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,650
Go. Go. Go.

303
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,930
Platonic

304
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,490
Platonic: of love or friendship, a close relationship that is characterized by lack of physical touch.

305
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,230
Not this!

306
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,770
No. I am old enough already.

307
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,090
How can we avoid touching? Why do we avoid touching?

308
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,910
Hey, Son Soo Jeong. Who are you? Why are you protecting me from physical touching?

309
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,860
Oh, man.

310
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,770
This doesn't make sense.

311
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,770
Kang Bok Soo.

312
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,570
Even though revenge is good, if you come to school, shouldn't you at least study?

313
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,670
Are you already here?

314
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,680
'Your Favor' specializes in completing tasks with speed.

315
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,260
Do you know what 'platonic' means?

316
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,470
Pla...tonic?

317
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,910
- I know about gin tonic (bubbly water for alcohol), but what is it? An alcohol?
- Yeah.

318
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,120
Alcohol? People have to learn.

319
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,540
Five, four, three, two, one.

320
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,280
I don't want to do this.

321
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,400
What is this? Why are you here too?

322
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,120
Did your company fail?

323
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,900
I am working two jobs now since times are hard.

324
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,330
Look at this. This is really strange.

325
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,970
What are you cooking up? Why does this guy come to school in this disguise?

326
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,290
Teacher. From now on, don't show up like that. You are the most suspicious among us.

327
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,910
Let's go.

328
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,130
They are— Really suspicious. What are—

329
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,740
I have finished preparations for the debate.

330
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,040
You know that the opponent is chosen on the spot.

331
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,990
I will tell you about debate rules.

332
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,460
Can we even pass the preliminary rounds?

333
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,880
I wrote up the preparations well. I've won several debate awards so we can make it to the final.

334
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,980
If you are so good, you do it well.

335
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,270
He's right. Let's do well.

336
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,180
Hyung, I'm saying I really want to do well.

337
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,130
To debate, if you can just speak well, is that enough?

338
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,010
I'm good at talking.

339
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,620
It isn't just talking. You have to be logical.

340
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,300
Aigoo. I'm sorry, Young Min. I don't have that talent.
