1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,490
I said, where did he go?

2
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,230
You purposely got us separated, didn't you?

3
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,980
Gosh, none of it was planned.

4
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,460
You also saw that they just ran off together.

5
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,610
Geez, let's just return to Seoul ahead of them.

6
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,520
We already looked through all the famous places.

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,150
Hey! How can we go back, leaving the two of them behind?

8
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,070
They couldn't have gone far.

9
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,970
What's a place for a date?

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,600
That is the last place, okay?

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,570
Really. I'll just go back to Seoul by myself.

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,540
What? They're not here either?

13
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,230
No. Kang Bok Soo, that guy.

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,670
What was he doing in a public place?

15
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,010
Son Soo Jeong is supposed to be his teacher.

16
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,220
Are you crying?

17
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,390
Okay, Noona. Go ahead and cry.

18
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,380
Cry it out.

19
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,130
I'll go to the car and bring back some tissues.

20
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,870
Wool.

21
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,250
One hundred percent.

22
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,230
Humanly speaking, don't blow your nose on it.

23
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,960
My goodness.

24
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,940
Yang Min Ji, it's the CEO.

25
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,210
It isn't Kang Bok Soo.

26
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,070
Am I too shocked?

27
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,830
It's a little uncomfortable now.

28
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,750
Why is it so hard to breathe?

29
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,840
Me too. Is it because the air is lacking inside the car?

30
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,970
Shall I let the window down?

31
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,730
Ah! It's cold.

32
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,750
Shall we head back now?

33
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,720
Sure.

34
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,460
Then, your seat belt... I'll—

35
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,130
No! It's okay.

36
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,220
I'll do it.

37
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,990
What? Focus on driving. Driving with one hand is dangerous.

38
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,810
Don't worry. I'm the best dresser.

39
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,690
You meant "best driver," huh?

40
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,770
Whichever.

41
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,770
We're here.

42
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,610
Bye.

43
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,580
It looks like I need to paint the gate again.

44
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,990
Then, today is our day one.

45
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,010
What?

46
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,530
If not, should we just say tomorrow is our day one?

47
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,730
Hey! I'm your teach—

48
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,160
Good night, Teacher.

49
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,630
Have a dream about me.

50
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,720
Kang Bok Soo!

51
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,790
Bye.

52
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,080
Oh Se Ho, I am asking you this because you are the second smartest person here.

53
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,250
Who is the smartest person then?

54
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,440
Son Soo Jeong, you idiot.

55
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,590
Do you have any good ideas for an event?

56
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,410
Making her smile is really hard. She's pretty but she doesn't smile.

57
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,340
Study.

58
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,010
I prepared something.

59
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,090
Will this do?

60
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,830
You should give her something she needs, then she will smile.

61
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,660
Something she needs? Wait, then should I get her snacks?

62
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,060
- Let me see.
- Hey!

63
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,820
Don't touch.

64
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,420
Let me see.

65
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,710
Study, you fool.

66
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,500
What is this?

67
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,910
That part was also too difficult for me, so my private tutor summarized it.

68
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,400
Take a look. I have my own.

69
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,040
Why are you giving this to me? It cost you to learn this.

70
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,390
There's no need.

71
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,050
Competition in good faith. It's because I feel like I'm the only one cheating.

72
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,020
Look at it because I'm definitely going to win against you this time.

73
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,360
I don't know. It won't go the way you want it to.

74
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,370
Then, I'll graciously accept this.

75
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,460
Thank you very much.

76
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,960
Hurry up and go.

77
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,970
Does he think he's really 18 years old just because he's wearing a uniform?

78
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,180
What's with the cheek kiss at 27 years old?

79
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,200
Weak, weak. So weak.

80
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,190
You're crazy, Son Soo Jeong. Snap out of it! You're Kang Bok Soo's teacher.

81
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,870
He must be on a diet. He became humble.

82
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:33,150
Son, you're studying again?

83
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,750
That's right. You need to study persistently to be first place.

84
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,670
I know I tell you this all the time, but there's no point if you're not first place.

85
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,630
The world is like that. So—

86
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,250
I'll do it, I'll do it. I just have to be first.

87
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,120
I'm studying.

88
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,660
I believe in you, In Ho.

89
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,960
As you know, you are the hope of this house.

90
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,510
Oh my. It's Goryeo Period literature.

91
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,740
I'm only letting you guys know this question, so don't spread rumors.

92
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,320
Between you and me, a mother's ability to gather information makes her kid first place. Don't you agree?

93
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,960
When her kid runs, his mother has to run even faster than him in order to lead him.

94
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,480
No. My son is doing well even without that.

95
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,430
He's done so well so far.

96
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,120
Or not?

97
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,860
♫ Oh do you know how I feel?  ♫

98
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,090
♫ I can’t go on if it’s not you  ♫

99
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,550
- Teacher!
- Oh my! What's going on?

100
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,850
Oh, you scared me. Why are you like this in the morning?

101
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,830
Because the world is so beautiful.

102
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,760
Teacher, from what I've seen,

103
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,970
the best thing you've done in your life

104
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,880
is being sick on the day to go to Choong-ju.

105
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,190
I've been wondering where I can smell sweetness (their sweet love).

106
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,160
I'm about to fall for you after ten years. What do I do?

107
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,560
Hey. I have a great sense, right?

108
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,560
Thank you, Teacher. Teacher, Teacher, Teacher.

109
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,120
That's gross. Just go.

110
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,250
♫ Let’s give it a go, see if we have any differences ♫

111
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,870
♫ I’ll hit “like” on your photos  ♫

112
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:42,430
♫ Every night, when I whisper good night, you can sleep ♫

113
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,680
Teacher Son Soo Jeong.

114
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,120
Director.

115
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,570
You look tired. Take better care of your condition.

116
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,030
The students can all see.

117
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,990
What is this? What are they talking about?

118
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,730
Hey. You didn't see it earlier, right?

119
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,670
Director and God Soo Jeong walked in together.

120
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,590
I should've taken a picture!

121
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,020
According to my information source, Director and God Soo Jeong had a lover's relationship from high school.

122
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,550
Huh?

123
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,830
The two were apparently famous ever since going to school. The school's 1st and 2nd ranked couple.

124
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,900
Wow. Director was the school's 1st rank?

125
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,430
No. God Soo Jeong was.

126
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,860
Director gave it to her for the sake of love.

127
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,700
You're the first to win over me.

128
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,560
I know you gave up first place for my sake, Oh Se Ho.

129
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,710
I like you too.

130
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,960
♫ The forgotten memories bloom like a flower  ♫

131
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,000
Hey, Gye So Ra. What nonsense! Teacher Son Soo Jeong's boyfriend was a different person.

132
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,620
- Who?
- Who?

133
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,110
Huh.

134
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,540
Do I have to say this?

135
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,780
Piscal said this: "The truth is always near us."

136
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,120
"However, we just don't listen to it."

137
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,400
Don't look too far, friends.

138
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,250
It's Pascal.

139
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,890
Never mind. You don't have to know such things.

140
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,720
Because your face is blessed.

141
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,620
Hey! What are you guys doing here during PE time? Aren't you getting out?

142
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,840
Teacher, you got a boyfriend recently, right?

143
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,080
Gye So Ra, what are you saying? What boyfriend?

144
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,900
Oh, Teacher. You're overreacting too much.

145
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:13,460
Teacher, I know everything. Ever since high school,

146
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,400
you dated Director, right?

147
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,630
You broke up with him when he went abroad, but now the fire has been lit again, right?!

148
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,760
Gye So Ra, I have no kind of relationship with Director, so don't spread false rumors.

149
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,370
Don't write a novel either!

150
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,060
Can't you just date him?

151
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,050
Gye So Ra, of course you'd be like this.

152
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,600
I had a gut feeling.

153
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,000
Hey.

154
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,280
Amazing.

155
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,150
What are you saying?

156
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,350
The ledger is awful and the corruption is worst than I expected.

157
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,710
But my mother must be rich.

158
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,360
Secretary Yoon.

159
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,460
Is this funny?

160
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,560
You should judge well what to do for yourself,

161
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,480
because my mother is very good at sacrificing the tail (to save herself).

162
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,460
How about you?

163
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,210
If I stand on your side, will it make things different for me?

164
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:35,240
Whoa, as I expected, you are quick to read the situation.

165
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,030
Hey, Kang Bok Soo! What are you doing?

166
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,990
- Hey, Son Soo Jeong.
- Huh?

167
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,250
I really wasn't going to say this, but...

168
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,040
What did you and Oh Se Ho talk about this morning?

169
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,860
I know it's embarrassing,

170
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,590
but it bothers me a lot!

171
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,040
Hey, do I have to report every single thing to you?

172
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,460
Hey, yesterday we...

173
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,920
What?

174
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,290
You know! If we did that... You know!

175
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:49,020
Hey Kang Bok Soo, are you trying to act like my boyfriend just because of that one kiss?

176
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:55,780
Hey, if we kissed... then we are like dating—

177
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,290
A person should know how to take all the necessary steps.

178
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,780
Did we plan to date each other? I never got that kind of offer anyway.

179
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,480
Wow, an offer, huh?

180
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,970
Hey! I told you kids not to be dating inside the nurse's office, didn't I?!!

181
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,430
Oh, you’re here. I'm treating this student because he's hurt.

182
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,320
Teacher, that's liquid pain reliever.

183
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,000
Alright, Nurse, you can take over for me now.

184
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,040
Hey, where are you going?

185
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,130
Nurse, please hurry up and wipe this off for me.

186
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,380
- Hurry, please.
- How did this happen?

187
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,980
Up here, please.

188
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,720
Nurse. Nurse.

189
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,220
Yeah?

190
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,190
Your mom probably gets full just by looking at you without eating anything (because he's handsome).

191
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,650
She never got that offer, huh?

192
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,940
Do I need to do that thing called presentation or what to Son Soo Jeong?

193
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,870
What you doing—

194
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,080
You startled me, kid.

195
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,460
You were so happy that you seemed to fly when I saw you early in the morning. But what happened?

196
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,210
Here.

197
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,530
Teacher, are you going out with me?

198
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:25,360
It tickles because you tend to even worry about how I feel.

199
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,890
Son Soo Jeong is the one I am dating here, but she denies it. Gosh, darn it.

200
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,460
Are you dating alone?

201
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,330
It's nothing like that, sir.

202
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,030
It must be a burden for Soo Jeong.

203
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,600
Personally, I think you should at least wait till you graduate—

204
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,650
Teacher.

205
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,650
I'm a legal adult and so is Son Soo Jeong.

206
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:50,620
Whether she is a teacher or a student, it doesn't matter because she is just Son Soo Jeong to me.

207
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,710
I wasted so much time already.

208
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,590
I'm not going to hesitate any longer.

209
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,750
Please cheer me on, sir.

210
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,780
That silly kid.

211
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,680
Alright, you are just being Kang Bok Soo.

212
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,530
Good luck.

213
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,850
I really do not like Chinese characters!

214
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,960
Why do Koreans have to even bother reading Chinese characters?!

215
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,150
This is a very easy poem to read.

216
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,920
King Yuri is the one who wrote this poem, and his wife ran away from him.

217
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,390
And he chased after her to catch her, but got dumped.

218
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,260
Let's read the poem now, shall we?

219
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,360
"The flying nightingales look lovey-dovey."

220
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,830
"Whom can I live with, this lonely body of mine?"

221
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,740
When we interpret this poem.

222
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,270
King Yuri was sitting under the tree and getting some rest on your way home.

223
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,130
And the nightingales that are in the top of the tree are so lovey-dovey.

224
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,910
- Hey, you guys are in love, but I'm the only one who is lonely.
- What?

225
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:14,280
It's like a letter for luck or a note.

226
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,760
That's what this poem is about.

227
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,850
Let's go out on a date!

228
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,980
My goodness. Did he forget already?

229
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,020
Doesn't he know that I don't date blockheads? My goodness.

230
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,200
Do you think I'll really go with this?

231
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:20,000
Hello there. I am In Ho's mother.

232
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,490
Oh my, you scared me.

233
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,380
Mom, do I look like I come from the privileged class?

234
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,750
I'm scared that I might see you like that in my dreams.

235
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,790
Is that so?

236
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,970
Is it too intense?

237
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,950
It's pretty though.

238
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,650
My goodness, that young thing is so absurd.

239
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,990
How can she mistake wildflower for ivy, huh?

240
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,470
Shouldn't we say something about it?

241
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,490
Do you want to do it?

242
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,010
Oh, why should I? Isn't it bad to carelessly meddle in other people's family affairs?

243
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,390
Does it make sense for a mother to not know anything about her kid like that?

244
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,340
Hello there. We have met before, right?

245
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,160
I'm Kang In Ho's mom from the ivy class.

246
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,120
I was very poor with attendance when it came to the meetings with all the mothers, right?

247
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,680
Please call me over often from now on.

248
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,850
Often?

249
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,330
Of course, ma'am. It's so great to see you all like this.

250
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,820
Please give me a small cup of Americano here.

251
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,800
Never mind. Give me a medium size, please.

252
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,910
By the way, what is your major?

253
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,680
Who me?

254
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,200
I used to do sepak takraw.

255
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,880
Sepak what now?

256
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,080
Is that an instrument or what?

257
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,150
You ladies don't know what it is?

258
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:08,850
It was selected to become an official sporting event for the National Sports Competition since the year 2000.

259
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,600
There's the net in the middle,

260
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,700
and you only use your feet to make the ball go back and forth over the net.

261
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,690
So...

262
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,210
Oh my!

263
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:37,790
What's she doing?

264
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,760
My goodness.

265
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,320
I understand, so you can come and have a seat now.

266
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,460
I'm usually better at it but I'm wearing high heels today, so I'm not as good as I could be.

267
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,200
I was the killer.

268
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,780
Killer?

269
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,500
That's what my position was.

270
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,200
They call the person who is in charge of offense the killer.

271
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,680
By the way, did you ladies request to become the exam directors for tomorrow's exam?

272
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,180
Of course I did. That's a good way to have a meeting with the homeroom teacher.

273
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,790
Exam directors? Mothers can do that?
