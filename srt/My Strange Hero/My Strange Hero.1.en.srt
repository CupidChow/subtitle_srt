My Strange Hero

2
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,870
Of course, I would give more (lucky money for a wedding). I heard that the steak here is over 150,000 won.

3
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,400
If you are someone with a heart, it's only right to give at least 100,000. But still, I won't be able to. I just can't do that.

4
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,050
It will be against Kim Yeong Ran law.

5
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,630
Meat, meat, beef.

6
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,840
Thank you for coming despite your busy schedule.

7
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,490
Thank you so much.

8
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,780
Hello there, Mr. Principal.

9
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,720
Wow! Congratulations!

10
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,690
Oh, Teacher. Son. I wasn't sure if I sent you the invitation or not.

11
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,880
I knew everything about it and decided to come here on my own

12
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,680
since I will be taking care of you for a long time once I become a full-time teacher at the school.

13
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,140
I'm afraid that might be a little difficult.

14
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,980
I think we will be hiring a full-time teacher from elsewhere.

15
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,970
What do you mean? I already took the exam to be the official full-time teacher.

16
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,390
I really don't have the power and authority to make that kind of decision.

17
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,010
Teacher Son, that's how it's going to be for now, so I'll just see you at school.

18
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,790
Hey, Teacher Park.

19
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

20
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,560
Tolstoy once said, "Since you don't know what the future may bring,

21
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,860
that's what makes life wonderful."

22
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,900
Groom Kim Jae Woong, will you take the bride, Lee Chae Young, as your lawfully wedded wife

23
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,220
and swear to love her unconditionally and cherish her for the rest of your life?

24
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,210
- Yes!
- Yes!

25
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,130
I swear.

26
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:31,310
♫ If I should stay ♫

27
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:37,860
♫ I would only be in your way ♫

28
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,230
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,090
I'm quite late, aren't I?

30
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:54,960
♫ And I will always love you ♫

31
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,690
Chae Young.

32
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,950
Lee Chae Young!

33
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:04,140
That old gramps Tolstoy was wrong. Since you don't know what to do for the future...

34
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,010
Hey, block him!

35
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,710
life is... shit.

36
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,170
There's an incident up in here.

37
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,030
You should go get to work for a change. Let's get to plan B.

38
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:34,050
♫ That is all I'm taking with me ♫

39
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,770
♫ And I ♫

40
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,630
Are you really going to give up on me like this?

41
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,610
I'm not going to give up on our love like this.

42
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,110
I can't break up with you like this, so please let's be more confident in front of the world.

43
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,990
♫ Love you ♫

44
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,790
What are you doing, you punk? Don't you come near me.

45
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,290
I don't know that guy. I really don't know him. Who the heck are you, jerk?!

46
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:07,820
♫ I will always love you ♫

47
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:14,720
♫ I will always love you ♫

48
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:26,410
♫ I will always love you ♫

49
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,100
He's the one who told me to depend on him to get me that full-time teaching position and even made me work late nights for it.

50
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,530
While I'm at it, I'm going to make him pay for this.

51
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,300
Come on, what are you doing?!

52
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,350
Hurry it up.

53
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,270
I can't help but keep on eating it. I guess it's because it's an expensive quality steak.

54
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,710
He made it seem like he was going to give me that freaking full-time position.

55
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:54,270
- You bastard, I bribed you with so many things every season!
- What's wrong with her?

56
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,790
Who will wipe my tears away for constantly working this contract teaching gig?

57
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,510
Hurry up and get in.

58
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,210
How are you going to make the payment?

59
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,310
- I will pay you in cash.
- Oh, excuse me.

60
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,330
Our CEO is not able to come out of the wedding hall yet.

61
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,970
- So you have to consider that as well.
- I've already considered all of that in the payment.

62
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,600
I had you do this on such a short notice, but you were able to finish the job nice and clean.

63
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,730
You can drop me off right here.

64
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,480
Your Favor 365

65
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,610
Mr. Principal, I hope you get a granddaughter who looks just like you, okay?

66
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,900
Amen.

67
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,340
Hey guys, if you can't get married within six months after you catch the bouquet,

68
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,410
then you won't be able to get married for the next three years. That's what they say, Bok Soo.

69
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,760
- You are not planning on getting married to Bok Soo, are you?
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

70
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,790
Nobody knows the future, you know.

71
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,730
Are you okay with where you got hit earlier?

72
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,120
Now you're asking, huh?

73
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,540
The groom's hobby is jiujitsu.

74
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,900
All of those people from earlier came from the jiujitsu club, according to what they told me.

75
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:54,620
Take a look at this. I got a triangle-shaped bruise too.

76
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,410
Sorry about that. So sorry.

77
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,750
Hey kids, can't you see this big van in front of you?!

78
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,660
Sorry, sir. Sorry about that, sir.

79
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,290
- Where do they even put their eyes for goodness sake?
- It's Seolsong High!

80
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,870
Their uniforms are still the same.

81
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,990
It's normal for kids to not be able to distinguish between heaven and earth.

82
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,150
Bok Soo, let's get going.

83
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,710
Kang Bok Soo.

84
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,880
Kang Bok Soo. What you doing?

85
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,670
Kang Bok Soo.

86
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,510
Kang Bok Soo.

87
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,470
Kang Bok Soo.

88
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:29,900
October 2009

89
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,540
Do you think this will be okay?

90
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,310
I think so. No, wait. Isn't that our homeroom teacher today?

91
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,620
It's not our homeroom teacher.

92
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,970
Let's go.

93
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,060
Let's go for now.

94
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,220
- Hey.
- What?

95
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,730
You're a bit... colorful today.

96
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,770
Hey, the life for the uniform is in the fit. P. I. T.

97
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,980
I took 1 cm off, but it made a drastic change. See?

98
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,670
Come on. Let's go first.

99
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,250
Park Dong Joon

100
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,900
Ah, no.

101
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,970
Sit down.

102
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:02,900
Kang Bok Soo, I love you!

103
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,410
I love you! Noonim!

104
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,640
Are you guys crazy?!

105
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,890
You, shut it!

106
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,110
He's mine, mine.

107
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,980
Hey, Kang Bok Soo and Lee Kyeong Hyeon. Add 5 more laps.

108
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,130
Pardon?

109
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,920
Hurry up and go!

110
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,100
Seolsong High School

111
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,470
Bok Soo, you had a rough start this morning, didn't you?

112
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,180
Yes. And you made it a bit cranky, too.

113
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,860
I am only a year older, so what's with the honorifics?

114
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,790
He minds his manners.

115
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,060
College Entrance Exam Advanced English Words 1500

116
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,470
Our class goddess is pretty again today.

117
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,990
Pretty my foot. My head with hair will be way prettier.

118
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,030
Our class president is so nice and pretty.

119
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,740
Our homeroom teacher didn't believe my hair is naturally brown.

120
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,730
But our goddess said,

121
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,480
"It's a student's right not to be required to have our natural brown hair to be dyed these days,"

122
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,630
like that.

123
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,250
Still, she's not Bok Soo's style. Right?

124
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,520
Right. Ah, you are not either.

125
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,400
Your eyelash came off.

126
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,860
- It became two.
- I did it on purpose.

127
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,010
- What?
- It's coming.

128
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,690
Five, four, three, two, one.

129
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,830
Hey, hey, hey.

130
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,590
Good morning!

131
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,900
I got your practice test results.

132
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,900
The school's top scorer is, as expected, class president Son Soo Jeong.

133
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,330
Hey, what a sight!

134
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,020
The school's worst scorer is in this class as well.

135
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,900
I'll keep it secret for personal privacy, Bok Soo.

136
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,790
Do some studying, punk. What will you become when you grow up?

137
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,380
Hey, Kyeong Hyeon, you're 299th.

138
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,360
This guy, he's worst in Korean!

139
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,440
Your homeroom teacher is a Korean teacher!

140
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,110
So I had a great idea.

141
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,950
We'll pair one good student with one who doesn't do as well,

142
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,150
so the smarter student can take responsibility and teach the other one.

143
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,950
Those who do well will do even better while teaching others.

144
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,310
Those who don't do well will learn from those who do.

145
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,890
And to the pair who raises their grade the highest

146
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,140
will get full points on the performance evaluation.

147
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,370
Okay, so I've prepared the pairs, so check it—

148
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,870
Aigoo. First in the school and Kang Bok Soo are a pair!

149
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,720
Hey, Bok Soo, if you do well, you might be able to go to college!

150
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,910
Wow, you're partners with Kang Bok Soo. I'm jealous.

151
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,790
Teacher, I want to be paired with Bok Soo.

152
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,350
Minji, you're in 298th place.

153
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,640
If you and Bok Soo pair, you'll end up like two fire moths jumping into the light (will be doomed).

154
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,440
And that's never love.

155
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,720
Guys, prepare for the class.

156
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,970
Let's eat, let's eat.

157
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,770
Let's do well, Kang Bok Soo.

158
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,280
I will tell you my schedule for you to fit...

159
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,050
No, I can't. I'm busy.

160
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,760
There are so many things to do besides studying! No can do, I'm too busy.

161
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,050
Since it's for the performance evaluation, shouldn't you do it?

162
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,910
I don't want to!

163
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,430
What?

164
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,660
Let's try to squeeze in as much time as we can.

165
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,970
See, I have to get 100%.

166
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,940
Let's do well.

167
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,310
President, would you at least like some ramen?

168
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,790
Hey, Kang Bok Soo!

169
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,370
Kang Bok Soo. Kang Bok Soo.

170
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,980
Hey, Kang Bok Soo.

171
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,030
Hold on, I'll be there in a second.

172
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,610
Hey, Kang Bok Soo!

173
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,830
Hey, Kang Bok Soo! Hey, Kang Bok Soo! Hey, Kang Bok Soo!

174
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,760
Hey, Kang Bok Soo!

175
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,520
Let's go out and talk.

176
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,000
Hey, president, wait a sec!

177
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,900
President— Hey, class president!

178
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,330
What? Did you master how to walk faster?

179
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,860
What do you have to say?

180
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,830
You'd probably draw bread with your cousin's crayons.
(Sounds like Korean words for "you little b****.")

181
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,940
Since you don't know if Pythagoras is for triangles or pentagons,

182
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,580
you don't seem to have any sense of numbers, but

183
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,090
I'm ranked first in the school.

184
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,840
Can't you see I'm wasting time just talking to the guy who's ranked 300th?

185
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,910
I'm saying that I can solve five problems in this time!

186
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,720
P-president, why are you suddenly being like this?

187
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,960
Solve this and come back.

188
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,620
Or else, I'll rip your pants before homeroom teacher even has the chance.

189
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,420
Korean Literary Secrets

190
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,530
Uncle, Grandmother says to come eat.

191
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,750
I said come eat.

192
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,440
Grandma, Mom, Uncle is acting weird.

193
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,860
He's studying.

194
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,850
You'd probably draw bread with your cousin's crayons.
(Sounds like Korean words for "you little b****.")

195
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,480
What's this, huh?

196
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,860
It's an irregular heartbeat. It runs in the family. Irregular heartbeat.

197
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,280
What do you mean?

198
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,540
Bok Soo, are you hurt somewhere?

199
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,340
What?

200
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,130
Why are you doing things you don't usually do?

201
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,060
Here, satisfied?

202
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,550
What was that?

203
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,800
What did the class president say? What did you say?

204
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,770
What do you mean? She didn't say anything.

205
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,240
She talked to you with her gaze, without any words.

206
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,890
The class president's amazing!

207
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,670
Her backside is just as pretty.

208
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,660
I should have been in last place.

209
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,310
Why am I so smart for no reason?

210
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:07,850
Hey, she—

211
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,060
Never mind. Hey, hey, hey.

212
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,120
She— She's so two-faced.

213
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,460
Her cussing is no joke!

214
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,990
Kang Bok Soo. Are you trying to compete with me too?

215
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,010
God is fair... to Kang Bok Soo.

216
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,650
He gave Bok Soo the looks but not the brains.

217
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,510
Positive sayings for studying

218
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,850
I mean, he doesn't even study. Why is he memorizing the positive sayings?

219
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,700
I told you to bring it

220
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,610
before we eat, didn't I?

221
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,200
A guy your size is scared?

223
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,760
Wow, this guy's like a cushion!

224
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,560
It hurts. Stop it!

225
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,980
You bought the buns on your own,

226
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,680
and you really got the taste of living, huh?

227
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,290
I told you to stop it!

228
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,650
Ah, who left recyclable plastic containers in a trash bin—

229
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,870
It hurts. Please stop!

230
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,960
You need to separate trash for recycling!

231
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:07,960
♫ While embracing you, the warmth of that time comes rushing in again ♫

232
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,940
♫ In my heart, the innocent dreams of my childhood haven't been polluted yet ♫

233
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:20,010
♫ Today, you and I are side by side again ♫

234
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:28,090
♫ The love of that year is now fresh again ♫

235
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,370
To be honest, I'm a believer of nonviolence.

236
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,650
You know that Lincoln guy, that Indian one, once said—

237
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,860
You guys know this much, right?

238
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,770
"The weak can never forgive."

239
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,790
But I... I forgive you.

240
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,040
Go now.

241
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,050
Go, go!

242
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,420
You punk! I told you not to fight!

243
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,200
Bok Soo, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

244
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,490
I'm okay, I'm okay. Who fought whom?

245
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,740
Ah, and you always come after the fight's over. Can't you come a little quicker?

246
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,010
Are you hurt?

247
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,830
Who? Me?

248
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:32,500
Teacher, I'm Kang Bok Soo!

249
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,190
Punk, the mouth of yours!

250
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,560
It really hurts!

251
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,530
That punk has no persuasive power and only knows how to propel forward.

252
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,060
Okay, today's event is a three-legged race.

253
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,600
This will be reflected on your performance evaluation for your midterm exam.

254
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,400
You have study teams in your class, right?

255
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,090
The person who studies with you in class.

256
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,980
For this event, partner teamwork is very important,

257
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,590
so from now, find your partners

258
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,450
and get ready!

259
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,180
Where did she go?

260
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,250
Are you okay?

261
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,960
What?

262
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,460
It's nothing. Which leg do you want to use?

263
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,500
Just tie it anywhere. Tie it.

264
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,180
Come to your senses and do this properly.

265
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,130
If we get points off, I'll kill you.

266
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,880
Wow, what a double personality. This is really a waste for me to see it alone.

267
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,000
Shut up.

268
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,050
Ready!

269
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,230
My leg!

270
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,470
Bok Soo, it'll be better if you just pass out.

271
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,590
Ah, I can't watch this.

272
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,970
Over there! O-Our Bo-Bok Soo!

273
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,650
Class president, are you okay?

274
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,390
We're first, right?

275
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,330
Uh, well, you are, but...

276
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,380
Bok Soo, are you okay?

277
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,550
Are you crazy? What did you do to me?

278
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,120
What do you mean?

279
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,920
Hey, Kang Bok Soo. We just got first place. Have you ever gotten first place in your entire life?

280
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,090
Is that really important right now?

281
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,510
Ah, I'm so embarrassed!

282
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,330
Hey, you just made me look so stupid!

283
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,640
You are stupid.

284
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,350
Hey, I'm not going to go easy on you because you're a girl.

285
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,370
Hey, stupid, that Indian guy isn't Lincoln. It's Gandhi.

286
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,290
Lincoln, that Indian guy, once said—

287
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:24,180
Well, anyway, they're both not Korean.

288
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:30,170
I don't know if you're a believer of nonviolence or whatever, but you were a little cool back there.

289
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,430
You were a little cool back there.

290
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,840
Bok Soo... Oh no! He must have hurt his head too!

291
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,170
Hey, get on my back. Let's go to a hospital.

292
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:16,570
Why? Is it really broken?

293
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:23,350
My heart... It's been broken.

294
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,050
What?

295
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,680
Hold on!

296
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,470
Wait, wait, pres!

297
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,250
Your leg looks all better.

298
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,460
Oh yeah, this is love's pow—

299
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,780
Uh, that is, class pres?

300
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,960
No... Son Soo Jeong.

301
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,630
Go on a... date with me.

302
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,820
I don't date stupid people.

303
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,900
Hey, if I try, I can do well!

304
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,530
I don't want to disappoint you.

305
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:41,280
But I don't really know what to do.

306
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,050
Well, I have to have some expectation before I get disappointed.

307
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:55,240
Then, try to raise your Korean grade.

308
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,630
I'll expect it from you, Kang Bok Soo.

309
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:08,660
♫  Step by step, ooh, baby  ♫

310
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,890
♫  Gonna get to you, girl  ♫

311
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,850
♫  Step by step, rock  ♫

312
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:17,800
Hey, Kang Bok Soo!

313
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,460
H-Hey!
