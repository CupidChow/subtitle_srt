1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,880
Seolsong High School's 32nd graduation
One year later

2
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,790
Hello, my name is Kang Bok Soo, and I will be your public orator for today's graduation.

3
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,340
Yeah!

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:35,600
Everyone, I'm graduating after entering this school ten years ago.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,270
As you all know, I have been kicked out of school once before.

6
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,500
I met with my first love and returned to school again.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:49,400
And finally, I was able to protect this school along with all of you who are here today.

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,620
All of you have been there for me through it all.

9
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,190
Seolsong is here in the name of remembrance.

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:08,320
I am so very happy to be with you all through making this great memory.

11
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,150
All of you will go out to the brutal world there waiting for you.

12
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,800
If I were to tell you this ahead of time as someone who has experienced things before, you...

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,680
Let me tell you this. Making a living? It's hard.

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,280
If you live haphazardly? Well, you will just lose in the end.

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,870
Life is all about being in the real-life battle after all.

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,200
When you let your guard down, things just happen and that's just life.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,080
This life makes you feel as if you're walking on thin ice.

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,410
Despite all that, I would like to tell you all that life is still worth living.

19
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:43,500
That's because there is at least that one person around you somewhere who is watching over you.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,950
It could be just that one person, but I want to tell you that clearly that there is at least that one person who will be there for you.

21
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,860
And that's the reason why everyone who's here today shouldn't give up on life.

22
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,860
And finally, I would like to share a famous quote before I finish my speech.

23
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,160
K. Revenge once said this

24
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,630
"No matter what you do, no matter where you are, everyone in this world has plenty of reasons to be loved."

25
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,650
That's it, folks. My name is Kang Bok Soo,

26
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,380
and I am the oldest returning student of Seolsong High School and the oldest graduate.

27
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:42,060
Seolsong High School's 32nd graduation

28
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,240
K. Revenge?

29
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,170
It's Kang Bok Soo.

30
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,540
- Mom!
- Mom!

31
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,020
Mom, I have a present for you!

32
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,480
Ta-da!

33
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,560
Diploma

34
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,070
Mom, aren't I a good son?

35
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,090
Yes, you are a good son.

36
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,630
You are the best son since you've shown me that you never give up.

37
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,370
So embarrassing. You shouldn't brag about graduating ten years after your actual time.

38
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,770
Shhh! You even gave a graduation speech.

39
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,220
What's wrong?

40
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,130
Oh, my boy.

41
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,590
What are you doing?

42
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,480
Mom, my In Ho is the real good son.

43
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,330
My In Ho got accepted into a university!

44
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,440
Really?!

45
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,230
Really?! Did I really get in?!

46
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,400
Yeah! Congratulations!

47
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,330
In Ho!

48
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,740
Seriously, him being accepted into college is all due to Soo Jeong.

49
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,630
I agree. So I permit you two to get married.

50
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,830
Naturally.

51
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,720
In Ho, I'm so proud of you.

52
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,630
- Bok Soo.
- Teacher.

53
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,420
Congratulations, kid. You went through so much but did well.

54
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,760
Ma'am, thanks for everything.

55
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,360
It's all thanks to you, Teacher. Thank you.

56
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,030
No problem at all, ma'am. It's all because of Bok Soo's hard work.

57
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,300
Please give me your camera. I will take a photo for you.

58
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,730
Oh, Teacher...

59
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,500
It's alright, you can give it to me.

60
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,630
Teacher, you should take it with us too.

61
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,720
But it's a family photo though.

62
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,340
Hurry up and just take it with us, Teacher. Just take it with us, Teacher.

63
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,310
- Just gather up.
- Teacher, just take it with us.

64
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,570
It's okay, kid.

65
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,280
Hello there, Mr. Principal!

66
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,630
I will take the photo for you, sir.

67
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,890
- Will you do that?
- Yes, sir.

68
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,320
- Go ahead, sir.
- Alright.

69
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,560
Alright, I'm going to take it now.

70
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,540
You two look so good together.

71
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,410
Alright, I'm going to take it now, so strike a pose please.

72
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,440
One, two, three.

73
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,360
Hey, Kang Bok Soo.

74
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,510
Hey, Son Soo Jeong.

75
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,460
What do you think? Do I still look good in it?

76
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,900
You totally look good in it.

77
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,860
Let's go out.

78
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,840
Where to?

79
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,620
We should go out and have a graduation celebration for just the two of us.

80
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,220
I am too old to be doing this.

81
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,390
Ouch, that hurts. My knees.

82
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,770
Oh, my back.

83
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,350
Seriously, my whole body is aching for goodness sake.

84
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,870
I'm still fine, I suppose.

85
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,620
What's going on? Something feels funny.

86
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,350
- You little punk.
- What the?

87
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,980
You are a student teacher now, and you are still coming in late?

88
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,260
Principal, what are you doing to me, huh?

89
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,090
You are not busy?!

90
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,760
This is the kind of job that a principal does.

91
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,860
Are you sure that this the kind of work that a principal does?

92
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,860
You talk too much, kid.

93
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,530
What kind of role model are you going to be to the students, coming in late all the time?

94
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,520
The children will be watching.

95
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,260
Let me go.

96
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,190
Mr. Principal!

97
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,610
Mr. Principal! Mr. Principal!

98
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,120
Oh, you were here all along.

99
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,820
Teacher Kang, you are late today again?

100
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,350
Assistant Principal, what's the matter?

101
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,520
Ta-da!

102
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,030
I brought you some oriental medicine, sir.

103
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,320
This is very effective before you eat.

104
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,710
I'm fine, you should have some for yourself.

105
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,960
You hurry up and go to class, Bok Soo.

106
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,860
I better get going now.

107
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,560
But this is very expensive.

108
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,220
Only if you weren't here...

109
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,800
Until then, I have to look out for my health at least.

110
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,990
Wow, that's bitter!

111
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,790
Hey!

112
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,540
What are you doing? Aren't you going to go in?

113
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,100
Teacher Kang, you're here? Now is the wrong timing for this. But let's just go in for now.

114
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,220
Why? What's wrong?

115
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,420
What do you think it is? You haven't heard about the rumors?

116
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,030
One of the teachers went out on a blind date but got rejected.

117
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,850
And that teacher is taking it out on everyone else in there. It's a mess.

118
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:55,660
I'm not saying anything about you wearing your jeans. But this is a little too...

119
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,100
I told him to be a little more fashionable for crying out loud.

120
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,980
He is so unpopular because he is wearing a newly reformed hanbok for crying out loud.

121
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,610
I told him to wear a pair of jeans, but he still is wearing that hanbok for goodness sake.

122
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,580
Was it you?

123
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,800
Were you the one that gave him the advice to wear jeans?

124
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,360
Yup.

125
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,290
He got rejected because the woman told him that he looked too casual and insincere.

126
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,940
Seriously?

127
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,420
Why are you doing that?!

128
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,670
Come here now.

129
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,580
Come over here right now!

130
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,830
Come over here!

131
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,750
I'm running away now!

132
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,290
Come right here! Kang Bok Soo.

133
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,020
Everyone's perspectives will be different depending on your view.

134
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,780
Draw exactly what you see.

135
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,210
This isn't a test, so don't look at someone else's work.

136
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,180
Teacher, does that person really need to do that?

137
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,350
I'm an official client and I already paid.

138
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,540
Teacher, can't you just be the model.

139
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,430
Then I think I can draw really well.

140
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,090
No. Although my face is like sculptural art,

141
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,650
you can't.

142
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,750
Teacher, do you have a girlfriend?

143
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,830
It wouldn't be right if this good looking face didn't have one.

144
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,750
Teacher, is your girlfriend pretty?

145
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,830
She's super pretty.

146
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,570
2023 Secondary Teacher Employment Examination

147
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,150
The next person, please come in.

148
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,790
Yes, you are right. This is my third try.

149
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,990
"Failure is the mother of success." Who even said that?

150
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,060
I mean, I want to give up saying those words

151
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,040
to comfort those who failed, especially if they failed the final screening three times.

152
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,390
Honestly, I am very upset.

153
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,960
If I fail again, then I am going to be too embarrassed to face my boyfriend.

154
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,330
I won't even have the right to face my boyfriend's nephew.

155
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,160
Do you know how much I made fun of them, calling them stupid?

156
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,150
Now I'm going to be the stupid one.

157
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:20,880
So please, this time can you pass me?

158
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,030
This is my third time seeing you this year.

159
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:27,070
You already know why you keep failing.

160
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,630
There's record that you resigned after involvement in a corruption at a private school.

161
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,670
Then you must know why I resigned.

162
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,280
We know you exposed the school corruption.

163
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,060
Yes. I am a corrupted teacher.

164
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,680
I really wanted to become a teacher, so I chose a method that I shouldn't have.

165
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,490
So what's the reason you want to become a teacher so badly?

166
00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:00,600
The school I used to work at showed off their student discrimination by ranking outright.

167
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,910
They classified the students by their grades and discriminated against them.

168
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,130
The class I was in charge of

169
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,310
was the wildflower class who had the lowest grades.

170
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,360
Hey, intern.

171
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,520
Yes?

172
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,340
Copy these.

173
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,920
Yes, sir.

174
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,890
These too.

175
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,670
Use recycled paper.

176
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,510
Your Own Business

177
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:40,000
In Ho, once you launch the app you're making, I'm going to collect rent.

178
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,180
A CEO's generosity is up to this point.

179
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,660
Uncle, if this app becomes successful,

180
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,990
I'll buy you a house.

181
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,240
Write a contract and sign it.

182
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,320
The more the students that the school called hopeless got stomped on,

183
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,700
the more they wanted to prove the school wrong.

184
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:07,860
Even though they didn't know it themselves, that was their strength.

185
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,230
With the faith that they had in themselves and a little bit of support,

186
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,900
they didn't give up their lives.

187
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,630
Even though it seemed like they gave up on their future,

188
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,610
in reality, they were as passionate as adults about their lives.

189
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,400
Honorable Judge, the defendant committed a heinous crime,

190
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,810
but without any remorse or repent, she only offers excuses and blame.

191
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,350
I ask for your sentence of indefinite imprisonment for the defendant.

192
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,790
The defendant has suffered from family violence.

193
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,220
If one saw how that violence was used on her young child,

194
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,680
nobody could have withstood that.

195
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,970
The school was about to transfer students because of their bad grades.

196
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,600
I witnessed how they protected their friends and their school.

197
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:03,050
Seeing those children grow helped me to grow as well.

198
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,500
Okay. That was good and all,

199
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,210
but this is such a serious disqualification.

200
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,440
I feel like I can be a really good teacher now.

201
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,090
I mean, besides what's in the textbook, what more can a teacher teach the kids?

202
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,990
I think I really understand now.

203
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,520
So please, will you let me be a teacher,

204
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,330
and give me a chance to make up for my mistake?

205
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,850
I beg you.

206
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:37,140
Miss. Son Soo Jeong, if you happen to fail this year as well, are you going to take it again next year?

207
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,160
Yes, as long as I have enough money for the application,

208
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,830
I'm going to keep taking it.

209
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,580
I taught those kids to never give up,

210
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:51,450
so I will not be a coward who goes back on my words.

211
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,800
Did I fail again?

212
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,570
Will I never be able to pass?

213
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,400
Yes! Yes!

214
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,820
Hey, Bok Soo!

215
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,950
Goodbye.

216
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,980
Next, Mr. Oh Hee Jun.

217
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,530
- Yes!
- Yes, come inside.

218
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,430
You came well.

219
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,550
- Coffee too!
- Ah, yes.

220
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,370
Over there.

221
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,690
Yes, yes. Ah, yes, I understand.

222
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,700
Because we have so many appointments right now...

223
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,920
Of course, it's possible.

224
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,790
But client, that kind of situation will require a premium.

225
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,120
Please wait just a moment.

226
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,900
When should we book you?

227
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,220
Let me ask for a favor too.

228
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,650
- Why, why?
- Hey, hey!

229
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,250
What?

230
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,810
I revised it to this point.

231
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,540
The revision isn't the issue. Your grammar is still wrong.

232
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,130
What's going on?

233
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,220
Get in if you want to save the hostage.

234
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,150
Your Favor

235
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,760
Four, three, two, one. Go!

236
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,690
Let's go!

237
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,400
Wh-What are you guys doing?

238
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,670
Teacher!

239
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,510
Hey.

240
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,510
Hey, what's this?

241
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,690
Congratulations, Teacher Son Soo Jeong, on obtaining your teaching certificate.

242
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,500
Thanks.

243
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,800
Thank you.

244
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,020
You've suffered.

245
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,720
You must have suffered a lot all this time. Good job. You did well.

246
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,150
As expected, a teacher should be someone like you.

247
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,760
Look at how our In Ho got sent to college. Isn't this enough proof?

248
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,920
It's a miracle. The girlfriend of a miracle is a miracle too.

249
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,800
Congratulations, Aunt-in-law. You've suffered a lot with studying all this time.

250
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,510
You too.

251
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,100
You've suffered a lot. You did well.

252
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,360
You're great.

253
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,540
Teacher!

254
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,920
Teacher!

255
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,600
Congratulations.

256
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,570
Seriously, congratulations.

257
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,310
Thank you.

258
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,270
What about the cake? Is there no cake?

259
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,100
Congrats on passing.

260
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,210
Teacher's Certificate.

261
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,990
Why is a celebration so clumsy?

262
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,320
What about the presents? Are there no presents?

263
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,600
These things... This is how you congratulate your teacher on passing her exam?

264
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,300
Did I teach you guys to be this rude? Huh?!

265
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,860
Let's only hear good things and see good things.

266
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,200
But we'll have to look only at Daddy's face every day.

267
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,990
So cute.

268
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,080
Teacher Ji Hyeon, how many months is your baby?

269
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,430
Ah, it's been eight months.

270
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,830
I saw the ultrasound and our baby looks like his dad so he's a total flower boy.

271
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,790
Gye So Ra, I heard your webtoon blew up!

272
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,720
"My husband is a returned student?"

273
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,470
Yes, that's right. Did you know that the main characters are you and Bok Soo?

274
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,080
What? We're seriously the models?

275
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,150
Yes, I'm also filming the web drama.

276
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,800
I'm the director and Gye So Ra is the writer and the main lead.

277
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,380
Hey, is there a kiss scene?

278
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,400
Yes, there's a scene where they kiss behind the classroom door without the kids seeing.

279
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,890
No, take out the kiss.

280
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,360
What the? The kiss scene is the meat of it.

281
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,030
What? What is this situation?

282
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,660
Jae Yoon confessed to So Ra and then got rejected.

283
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,160
Hey, you did?

284
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,960
Do it again confidently.

285
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,130
No thanks. You can't with your hair.

286
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,020
She said I can't.

287
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:10,590
♫ From now on, it’s our love story  ♫

288
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,100
♫ I want to draw out our future that I dreamed of  ♫

289
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:21,060
♫ Now we will make history  ♫

290
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:28,390
♫ Every memory, one by one, I want to place in my heart ♫

291
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,160
Bok Soo.

292
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,600
2023. 09. 12
Tuesday at 11 am.
We are getting married.

293
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,370
Are you really not going to regret it?

294
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,350
Life is long.

295
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,440
Kyeong Hyeon & Min Ji are marrying

296
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,340
Friend, Socrates said this,

297
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:05,380
"If you get a good wife, you will be happy, and if you get a bad wife, you will become a philosopher."

298
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,580
But this. Are you really not going to regret it?

299
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,720
Are you really going to marry?

300
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,400
I'm not doing it! Never!

301
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,420
All the invitations are out, so come now...

302
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:20,490
He didn't even propose properly. Would you want this improper wedding?

303
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,180
He didn't propose to you?

304
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,910
Don't do it then. Just shove it.

305
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,390
Just live alone instead of marrying or whatever. Why do it?

306
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,510
I mean, why are you actually telling me to live alone though?

307
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,310
Anyway, I can't do it like this no matter what.

308
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,310
Kyeong Hyeon, I can't.

309
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,320
Just know that.

310
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,760
Look, look. She doesn't want to, so you shouldn't either.

311
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,460
Our Min Ji is a woman who is 3C4W.

312
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,410
She's cold for three days and warm for four.

313
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,300
Today is the third day, so she'll be warm tomorrow.

314
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,440
That's love.

315
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,720
True love, yeah.

316
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:34,620
You never contacted me until now, so why did you come here?

317
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,530
I needed time.

318
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,620
What time?

319
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,200
A time to accept that you are my mother

320
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,270
and to try and forgive you.

321
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,170
Forgive?

322
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,540
You to me?

323
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,850
You should beg for forgiveness from me.

324
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,870
Mother.

325
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:06,000
Will you also change one day?

326
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,730
Like I changed.

327
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,960
You changed?

328
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,480
I heard your company is doing well in America. Do you think you've become someone now?

329
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,060
Now I'm not hurt by looking at you anymore.

330
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,410
That means I am changed.

331
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:35,980
Mother, I'll believe that you will change one day.

332
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,900
Like one friend back then believed in me,

333
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,770
I will wait.

♫ The breeze that  ♫

346
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:00,010
♫ passed by last winter  ♫

347
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:08,880
♫ As if it came to me suddenly, without warning  ♫

348
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,030
♫ Finding me again ♫

349

♫ Love that comes to each of my days  ♫

353
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:47,090
♫ I’m afraid that love will leave me ♫

354
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:54,140
♫ Every day, I get anxious all night ♫

355
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,080
♫ Will you stop right there?  ♫

356
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,220

♫ This love that finds me day after day  ♫

366
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:07,110

♫ I will not regret again  ♫

371
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,610
Soo Jeong. Indeed, being at school suits you well.

372
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,450
Of course. Who helped me find this dream?

373
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,610
I'm a very dashing boyfriend, right?

374
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,330
Yep. So I thought about it,

375
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,180
and the next wish, I set it to my liking.

376
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,340
What? What is it?

377
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,270
Kang Bok Soo's wife.

378
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:11,880
♫ This love that is getting bigger by the day  ♫

379
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:25,630
♫ This love that keeps seeping into me ♫

380
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:30,170
♫ Please stay by my side like this ♫

381
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:38,520
♫ Do not leave me ever.  ♫

382
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:47,570
♫ Will you promise me? My Love.  ♫

383
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,370
But... what is the commemoration?

384
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,020
Graduation.

385
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,120
I'll take the picture. Look at the camera.

386
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,990
One, two, three.

387
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,430
Okay, nice. Smile widely!

388
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,440
One, two, three.

389
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:34,700
♫ Because I can wind my hands into yours  ♫

390
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:40,020
♫ Do you feel the way I do?  ♫

391
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:49,030
♫ Or because you were too shy to say it ♫

392
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,130
♫ A star for you ♫

393
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,890
♫ A star for me  ♫

394
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:03,970
♫ We name them ♫

395
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,210
♫ And we look up  ♫

396
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,790
♫ And our tightly wound hands  ♫

397
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:20,280
♫ What would be good to talk about?  ♫

398
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:27,830
♫ I want to walk with you  ♫

399
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:33,480
♫ Once we walk you will understand how I feel  ♫

400
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:41,550
♫ We will become wings together ♫

401
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,800
♫ I love you  ♫
