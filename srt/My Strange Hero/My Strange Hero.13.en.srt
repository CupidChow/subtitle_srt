1
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,620
That day... that day nine years ago.

2
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,040
I'll just ask you two things.

3
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,590
That day on the roof,

4
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,700
did you push Oh Se Ho?

5
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,060
Answer me.

6
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,590
Did you really push Oh Se Ho?

7
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,050
No.

8
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,480
It wasn't me.

9
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,930
I didn't push him.

10
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,380
That I was a recipient of welfare... did you start that rumor?

11
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,800
No. What are you talking about?

12
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,350
I definitely heard you that day.

13
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,530
You called me pitiful.

14
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,450
Did you also just pity me?

15
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,930
Because I was pitiful, did you walk me home every day,

16
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,420
and smile at me, find my dream,

17
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,610
and paint the gate?

18
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,660
Hey! Don't you think Son Soo Jeong is pitiful?

19
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,180
I guess you can't answer me.

20
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,500
No. It was because I liked you.

21
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,850
It wasn't because I pitied you. It was because I liked you.

22
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,150
I liked school.

23
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:25,240
I had no parents, lived with my grandma, was even a welfare recipient.

24
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,900
But nobody would notice as long as I wore my school uniform.

25
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,750
And since you were there...

26
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:47,650
After you left, school was hell.

27
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,340
I had trusted you for the first time,

28
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,530
but you said that I was pitiful.

29
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,700
Those words hurt for nine years.

30
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,020
And because of me,

31
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,990
you too...

32
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,400
I'm sorry

33
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,970
for asking you too late.

34
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,750
I'm sorry.

35
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:36,100
Back then, if I'd had just a little more courage, I would have asked you.

36
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,720
Why did you need courage to ask me?

37
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:50,580
I was afraid that you would really say I was pitiful.

38
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,110
Did you know?

39
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,700
After learning about my circumstances, there were a lot of kids who belittled me,

40
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,250
but there were more kids who were kind.

41
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,290
They shared their stationery with me and gave me snacks.

42
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,770
But they didn't treat me as their friend.

43
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:15,060
They were proud of doing so because they were helping a poor girl.

44
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,520
I really hated their superiority complex.

45
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,430
I didn't care how others thought of me.

46
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:33,420
But if you really thought of me as pitiful, by any chance,

47
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,650
I was too scared of that, so I ran away

48
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,370
because I liked you too.

49
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:46,660
If you had really accidentally let my family's circumstances slip, I wouldn't have hated you

50
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,660
since it was the truth.

51
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,200
Instead, I would have just scolded you a little.

52
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,440
You should have done that.

53
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,600
Even if you cursed and hit me, it would have been better than leaving each other with this misunderstanding.

54
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,350
Kang Bok Soo. I am really sorry.

55
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,420
Soo Jeong,

56
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,250
I'm so sorry.

57
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,830
I didn't even know how much I was hurting you, but

58
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:20,500
I hated you because you didn't believe me.

59
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:30,980
Let's just let go of those things from nine years ago.

60
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:38,070
Kang Bok Soo, why are you such an fool?

61
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,860
Hey, don't you know the proverb, "try to be a happy fool?"

62
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,190
Let's think that we met each other again.

63
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,530
With you as the teacher and me as the student,

64
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,030
let's start again

65
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,510
from the beginning.

66
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:14,930
♫  I don't know anymore what this feeling is ♫

67
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,510
♫  I want you ♫

68
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,840
♫  I need you ♫

69
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,010
♫  I just want to see you one more time ♫

70
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,020
♫  After I lie down and close my eyes ♫

71
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,930
Our handsome In Ho!

72
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,880
Wake up. We have to go to school!

73
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,170
Wake up, wake up!

74
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,780
♫  My restless heart ♫

75
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,230
♫  Eventually, I open my eyes in the middle of the night ♫

76
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,210
♫  The sound of your laugh ♫

77
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,220
♫  plays in my head ♫

78
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,930
♫  I have to come to my senses, I have to come to my senses ♫

79
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,610
♫  Oh my ♫

80
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,640
♫  You're mine, I want to say, you are my lady ♫

81
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,920
♫  After we get a little space between us ♫

82
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,780
♫  I want to pull you towards me ♫

83
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,390
You must be going crazy.

84
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,470
♫  It might be love, this feeling ♫

85
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,910
♫  I'm not sure what this feeling is ♫

86
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,550
♫  I want you ♫

87
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,910
♫  I need you ♫

88
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,190
♫  Just one more time ♫

89
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,820
♫  I want to see you again ♫

90
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,150
♫ Love you, love you, love you ♫

91
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,630
♫ Want you, want you, want you ♫

92
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,410
♫  I keep on thinking that I want to see you ♫

93
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,100
♫ Love you, love you, love you ♫

94
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,880
- It's Kang Bok Soo!
- What?

95
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,710
Is he finally coming back to school?

96
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,730
Oppa! We missed you!

97
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,660
Hey friends, did you eat breakfast?

98
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,520
You have to eat breakfast so your brain works.

99
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,770
It's Kang Bok Soo! He's back!

100
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,600
Aish.

101
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,520
Hey, kid.

102
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,870
You're back!

103
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,840
Hey, if you still didn't come today, I was going burst into Sojeonggak, you little rascal!

104
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,730
And so I came here.

105
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,120
Kang Bok Soo!

106
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,800
Hello, Vice Principal.

107
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Wh-Why did you come to school?

108
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,820
Well, is a student coming to school so wrong?

109
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,060
You were gone for two days without notifying the school!

110
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,610
That's why I'm working so hard to volunteer right now, Vice Principal.

111
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,930
Volunteering can be done outside of school!

112
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,080
Vice Principal, please let me off this time.

113
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,280
Until I graduate,

114
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,720
- I will work hard to come to school.
- Vice Principal.

115
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,660
Yes, Bok Soo will come to school and even volunteer—

116
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,950
Are you really taking this punk's side?

117
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,850
Oh, my blood pressure.

118
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,490
Because of you, I started taking high blood pressure medication again.

119
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,350
Teacher, Teacher, you can't just stop taking blood pressure medication. You have to persistently take it.

120
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,720
Make sure you take it regularly 30 minutes after meals.

121
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,180
Kang Bok Soo!

122
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,820
Relax, relax.

123
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,460
Take him away.

124
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,570
Kang Bok Soo! Clean nicely!

125
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,820
- Ah!
- Whoosh.

126
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,480
There's a broom over there.

127
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,380
Do it all yourself.

128
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,500
Excuse me? Hey, help me out!

129
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,370
Nope, do it yourself!

130
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,490
Ah, please help!

131
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,130
Good morning!

132
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,420
Who's not here?

133
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,000
Kang Bok Soo didn't come?

134
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,970
I'm here!

135
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,490
Elder!

136
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,230
Oppa, are you coming back to school?

137
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,310
If you guys want me to.

138
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,190
Okay, then there's nobody absent today?

139
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,600
That's good, nobody's absent.

140
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,750
Well, there are no special announcements today, so please...

141
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,010
H-Have a good day.

142
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,610
The Kang Bok Soo that everybody thought had left is back.

143
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,590
Why were you absent for two days?

144
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,730
Move, I can't see Oppa's face.

145
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,560
Oppa, did you eat before you came?

146
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,480
Wake up, the elder is here.

147
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,920
Long time no see.

148
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,440
As I thought, your face is as addictive as mine.

149
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,610
The elder's is addictive, but yours is more like poison.

150
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,320
Hey, really—

151
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,320
Here. It's something I'm throwing away.

152
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,250
If you're going to throw it away, throw it to me!

153
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,820
Hey, Yoon Seung Woo!

154
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,020
Bulgogi burger

155
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,800
Let's forget the past.

156
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,430
Now, I want to live in the present with you. In this moment.

157
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:13,610
Answer me. Did you really push Oh Se Ho?

158
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,020
Let's focus on the kids.

159
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,500
I put together a list of instructors for the subject area the kids might be interested in.

160
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,590
I don't think it will be hard to book them.

161
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,550
But I was worried that we might be leaning to a particular occupational area only.

162
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,910
Then, for now, go with someone who can offer guidance for school life.

163
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,300
Start with educational field instructors.

164
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,810
And how about we introduce these ones afterwards?

165
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,190
That sounds okay, too.

166
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,500
Then, which field should we go with?

167
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,080
I'll find that out.

168
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,740
Okay, I'll leave it to you. Thanks.

169
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,850
So I guess in order to make you smile, I just have to be nice to the kids?

170
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,110
Bok Soo... I think he said something he wasn't supposed to.

171
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,470
Why? Do you have anything else to say?

172
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,590
It's nothing.

173
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,670
I'll get going now.

174
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,080
M-Me?

175
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,360
Are you saying you can't?

176
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,570
I mean, because you've got nothing else to do. That's why you're spoiling Kang Bok Soo.

177
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,470
You, teachers, discuss it among yourselves and decide on one more,

178
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,970
and take that person with you.

179
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,930
And make sure you turn in a report.

180
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,430
It doesn't make sense.

181
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,260
The preliminary survey isn't something Teacher Park should do.

182
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,540
Teacher, how did you get on the vice principal's bad side?

183
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,130
When he's such a grudge-holder.

184
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,040
What do you mean bad side?

185
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,590
It's for the students. If he tells me to go, I should.

186
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,920
I-is there anybody who'd like to join?

187
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,850
Hey, Teacher Ma.

188
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,690
Let's go to Choongju together.

189
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,630
M-Me?

190
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,960
Yeah, you should go with Teacher Park.

191
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,270
That works!

192
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,160
Y-Yes.

193
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,360
I want to go too! I'll go as well! Suddenly I really want to go to Choongju!

194
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,250
R-Really?

195
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,450
Do the two of you just want to go together?

196
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,220
Should we... do that?

197
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,360
Teacher, I'm sorry.

198
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,990
I suddenly don't feel very good.

199
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,390
I don't think I'll be able to go.

200
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,220
I'm sorry—

201
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,520
I'll pat you on the back!

202
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,850
Teacher Ma!

203
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,140
Did Ms. Son go somewhere?

204
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,180
Hello, Teacher.

205
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,080
Good work volunteering all that time.

206
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,820
I worked hard, so isn't there a reward?

207
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,760
You probably didn't prepare one, so I did.

208
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,980
What is this?

209
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,760
You like this.

210
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,430
You still remember?

211
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,300
Hey, what are friends for?

212
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,130
From now on, I will be in charge of supplying you with yogurt.

213
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,960
On top of that, every day.

214
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,350
Please just accept it.

215
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,600
What are you doing, Kang Bok Soo?

216
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,740
Don't smile like that. It makes my heart flutter.

217
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,980
You're crazy!

218
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,050
This is crazy! I'm his teacher.

219
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,100
Snap out of it!

220
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,030
- I didn't want to have to say this, but—
- Son Soo Jeong. Wh—

221
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,370
Stop being deluded! I'm your teacher.

222
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,020
From now on, make sure to call me "Teacher" properly!

223
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,420
And we may have been friends nine years ago,

224
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,280
but not now.

225
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,710
You must be happy that you're so popular.

226
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,870
Well, a hoobae got this for me, wishing for my good health.

227
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,960
She made this jar of origami turtles with great effort. How can I just throw this away?

228
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,140
I don't care. You live up to a hundred years old with it (turtle means long life).

229
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,930
You think if you just do this, you'll be off the hook (for accepting a meaningful present and making jealous)?

230
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,590
No.

231
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,780
I brought my face too.

232
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,070
You smiled!

233
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,340
You smiled!

234
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,840
It worked! It worked, right?

235
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,150
Even though he's not that smart, he didn't forget about this.

236
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,250
Teacher! What are you doing?

237
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,060
I haven't had this in a long time. It's so delicious.

238
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,200
I mean, how can you just drink that?!

239
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,280
Why? Is it past expiration?

240
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,100
I'm strong. Don't worry. I should have another one.

241
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,570
Do whatever you want.

242
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,810
Wait. You resigned. Why are you here again?

243
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,680
Hey, CEO I advertised to get more customers! It's perfect!

244
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,740
Customers?

245
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,630
We will do anything for you.
Your Favor

246
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,190
Your Favor

247
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,450
You did well, Team Leader Yang.

248
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,920
Team Leader Yang?

249
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,850
I knew you would make it someday. I should make you a team leader as of today.

250
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,310
Even if I do things well,

251
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,420
I can't be promoted before Bok Soo.

252
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,150
I will decline your offer to promote me to team leader.

253
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:13,960
Okay. Then Noona, you be the sales team leader and Bok Soo will be the management team leader.

254
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,290
Well, if Bok Soo a team leader too, then okay.

255
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,360
Team Leader Yang should have a cup of coffee.

256
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,700
Bok Soo! The uniform...

257
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,330
It turned out this way.

258
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,860
What should we do? I thought you were quitting school.

259
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,730
I quit my job at the school cafeteria yesterday.

260
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,990
Oh, my.

261
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,960
My resignation letter might not be accepted yet.

262
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,930
I'll be right back!

263
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,070
Don't come back! Just bury your bone there (stay there until you die).

264
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,230
Noona! That's the place where you belong.

265
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,140
Geez.

266
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,050
My beloved friend, have you finally gone crazy?

267
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,200
Hey, Kyeong Hyeon. Never mind.

268
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,580
Even you're upsetting me. Say what you want to say.

269
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,760
I talked it all out with Son Soo Jeong.

270
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,960
Epic! What did she say?

271
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,750
It seems I hurt her a lot,

272
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,430
because I said, "Don't you think she is pitiful?"

273
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,110
She really hated those words.

274
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:32,650
So you're saying that's the reason she gave for doing what she did back then?

275
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:37,570
She should have yelled at you instead of shutting her mouth. What was that?

276
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,200
But we were young back then.

277
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:49,830
As much as she had trusted me, she must have felt betrayed a lot.

278
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:55,420
As I recalled, she must have been very lonely.

279
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:02,630
Wait. So she thought that you spread the rumor about her household's issue?

280
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,270
And you didn't tell her that bastard, Oh Se Ho, was the one who spread the rumor?

281
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,760
No, not yet.

282
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,030
If I were to tell her the truth now, it would make her feel too bad.

283
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,620
So for now, I just want to wait and see.

284
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,200
But that bastard is a dangerous guy.

285
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,730
I think you'd better let her know.

286
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,840
Well anyway, I'll be always by her side, so...

287
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,170
I can protect her!

288
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,160
It's been a really long time.

289
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,540
I have a delivery!

290
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,920
What is this?

291
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,310
Kang Bok Soo!

292
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,370
What is this? What are you doing?

293
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,420
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

294
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,210
My treat today. Today's sweet and sour pork is to die for.

295
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,150
Why are you doing this?

296
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:09,370
Because I am so thankful for the grace of my teacher.

297
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,190
No, you can't! Get yourself together, Son Soo Jeong!

298
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,910
You are a teacher! You can't accept bribes.

299
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,360
Right. You're right. I'm your teacher.

300
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,870
I can't accept this because it's against the anti-graft law. Take it away—

301
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:30,950
That's why I made sure the meal costs no more than 30,000 won (less than $30 is legal).

302
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:37,230
Then, enjoy your meal, Teacher.

303
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,500
Yep, food is innocent.

304
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,100
Son Soo Jeong, you can't be like this!

305
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,820
Yep, food is innocent, but a teacher having feelings for a student is a crime.

306
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,940
Ah, whatever. Let's just eat first.

307
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,380
Look at how much she likes it.
