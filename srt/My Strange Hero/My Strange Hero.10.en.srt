1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,830
Again, again, again. Instant (ramen).

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,570
You don't answer your phone all day. How can you come to work this late?

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,120
- What's that?
- What do you mean? I packed it for you to eat.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,030
I got a job at Seolsong High's cafeteria.

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,090
- You're really going to school?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,580
This is the Ivy class menu.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,890
You purposely packed this to give it to me—

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,430
Of course.

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,830
I'll eat it well.

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,980
It's better to throw it away to you than the trash can.

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,680
- What'd you say?
- Hm?

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,140
Eat a lot.

13
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,610
You looked like you weren't feeling well earlier.

14
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,270
Take it.

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,820
Thank you.

16
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,190
Consulting Room

17
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,580
I'm dating Bok Soo. I've been next to him for nine years.

18
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,420
What does that have to do with me?

19
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,750
Seolsong Highschool

20
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,030
In English, aish!

21
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,310
Why is... Son Soo Jeong here?

22
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:45,270
Oh Se Ho, was it like that?

23
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,700
Seung Woo didn't come today either?

24
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,510
No. I can't reach him.

25
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,210
Nobody received a call from him?

26
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,280
Won't he still be sleeping?

27
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,390
I want to sleep too.

28
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,120
I'll try and contact Seung Woo. Tell me if somebody gets a call from him first.

29
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,880
Kang Bok Soo, volunteering is important but please come earlier.

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,040
Kang Bok Soo, do you have something to say?

31
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,860
Let's not cause trouble today.

32
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,320
Especially Kang Bok Soo.

33
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,400
Yoon Seung Woo's profile

34
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,290
Father: Yoon Jong Goo
Mother: Ban Min Jeong

35
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,130
Neither of them are picking up.

36
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,470
Seung Woo is not one to be absent without an excuse.

37
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,670
That's true.

38
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,860
Even though he doesn't pay attention in class, he does have perfect attendance.

39
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,090
He ranked first in his entire middle school.

40
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,680
Seung Woo did? Are you sure?

41
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,820
He's last place in the Wildflower class.

42
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,400
There is a reason I can think of, but...

43
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,530
Because you said he had a perfect attendance,

44
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,180
I would go to the places that his friends have said.

45
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,770
Okay.

46
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,580
Tell me, Son Soo Jeong.

47
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,010
Why is your portrait in Oh Se Ho's office?

48
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,370
Why did that jerk Oh Se Ho draw a picture of you?!

49
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,180
Why isn't it clean no matter how I rinse it?

50
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,930
It's dark and unforeseen like somebody.

51
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,350
Oh my, Teacher.

52
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,500
Kang Bok Soo! The dirty water.

53
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,110
You little punk!

54
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,810
You said you would take responsibility, Teacher Son Soo Jeong.

55
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,090
Are you not going to supervise Kang Bok Soo's volunteer service?

56
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,480
I'm sorry, Teacher. I'll quickly launder it—

57
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,600
It's all dried anyway.

58
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,800
I mean, you can't rinse a mop properly and have me chewed out?

59
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,580
What's wrong with you?

60
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,650
Kang Bok Soo, do you have something to say to me?

61
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,910
Why are you like this, Kang Bok Soo?

62
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,000
Get a hold of yourself, Bok Soo. Focus on your revenge.

63
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,030
Si On

64
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,490
Mom

65
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,050
Delete

66
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,960
Do you wish to delete?

67
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,930
It's because you're our teacher that we're telling you. You have to keep it a secret.

68
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,160
It's to make money. That kid needs money.

69
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,560
You know how he looks old.

70
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:12,090
No matter what, working at a bar? Yoon Seung Woo, you really...

71
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,650
Kang Bok Soo?

72
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,640
Seung Woo is really working part-time in a place like this?

73
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,320
You are also?

74
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,290
I am a legal adult. Did you forget?

75
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,890
You're a student right now.

76
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,550
And what's with the weird formal talk?

77
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,990
Since you're a teacher, I should be speaking formally.

78
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,720
Who do you think you can fool with such a crude ID card?

79
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,060
You should be thankful that I even let you work.

80
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,340
I worked. You should give me the money.

81
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,840
I did.

82
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,630
It's not even minimum wage. Are you kidding right now?

83
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,090
Then report me... if you want to get expelled from school.

84
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,530
Are you not letting go?

85
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,810
This bast***!

86
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,250
Yoon Seung Woo, don't do it. You can't use violence.

87
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,370
What, Teacher? Why did you come? How'd you know?

88
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,860
Did you tattletale?

89
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,630
Why would I?

90
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,960
Oh, Bok Soo. You came?

91
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,760
This part-time jerk has no manners. Wait a bit.

92
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,950
You're his teacher? You came at the right time.

93
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,660
So your student is insisting that he worked at this bar—

94
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,050
Yes. You said he worked.

95
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,060
It looks like you haven't paid him the right amount.

96
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,700
He's going to quit today so give him the correct amount.

97
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,030
I did give it to him, but he's grabbing me by the neck!

98
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,210
He said it's not even minimum wage!

99
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,990
Yoon Seung Woo, how much are you short? Make sure to calculate it properly, to the penny.

100
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,450
814,400 won short.

101
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,190
The teacher is also crazy.

102
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,110
I said your student worked at a bar.

103
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,850
Why are you arguing about him not receiving money?

104
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,410
Don't get involved. You're a student.

105
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,720
What? Student? You're a student too?

106
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,230
Seriously crazy!

107
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,130
Look here. For this student,

108
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,930
if the school finds out, he'll be put on disciplinary action and punished but that's it.

109
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,630
But Mr. Boss. No, hey, boss!

110
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,120
If it gets known that you employed a minor, your business will be brought to a halt.

111
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,020
Go ahead and lose a big one trying to save 814,400 won then.

112
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,370
Let's go, Seung Woo.

113
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,190
Looks like it was the teacher that went wrong.

114
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,150
If he doesn't have a mother and father, then the teacher should have taught him well!

115
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,820
What's wrong with not having a mother and father? Why?!

116
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,050
Aren't you embarrassed that you're ripping off a student who's working hard without his parents?

117
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,880
As the adult, you should say how great he is and help him out, but instead, you deprive him of payment for his labor?

118
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,620
Did your parents teach you that?

119
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,140
Don't make it so that your parents get cursed at!

120
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,650
Look at this, when I go easy on her!

121
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:18,020
I'll tell you. I loathe the most in the world bastards like you who sneer at people who have less to gain a sense of superiority.

122
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,220
That... makes you a really bad jerk.

123
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,440
This crazy—

124
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,140
Are you a P.E. teacher? Huh?

125
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,740
What are you doing, Bok Soo? Are you not going to let go?

126
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,980
Hey, are you saying you guys are on the same team?

127
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,420
Because I have a mother but not a father,

128
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,480
I'm getting angrier the more I hear.

129
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,500
You... It's not your first time, right?

130
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,110
You hired a high schooler in a bar on purpose.

131
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,440
And you're a repeat offender who tries to take advantage, aren't you?

132
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,500
My homeroom teacher said she'd cooperate with you.

133
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,180
Should we just go by the law?

134
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,080
Teacher?

135
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,890
What are you saying? Let go.

136
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,950
What are you two doing?

137
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,490
Are you dating?!

138
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,100
Wait.

139
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,150
Isn't this assault?

140
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,850
Should we add a crime of injury too?

141
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,060
Leave, leave. Don't come back.

142
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,830
Leave, leave!

143
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,960
That bast*** till the end!

144
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,830
Are you sure you got the right amount?

145
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,830
That cheap bast***. He left out 100 won.

146
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,220
It's alright. The 100 won is just for him to get lost.

147
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,040
Ack.

148
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,760
Why?

149
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,780
You should come to school. The other kids are worried.

150
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,190
I'll go (ya - informal to yo - formal).

151
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,480
Kang Bok Soo.

152
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,810
Don't go anywhere and just go home.

153
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,130
Why do you keep getting involved, Kang Bok Soo?

154
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,450
Can't believe it. How could he hold my hand?

155
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,090
How dare he hold a teacher's wrist?

156
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,980
What to do? And even further,

157
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,140
like this!

158
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,070
Kang Bok Soo, who taught you this?

159
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,490
You only learned bad things!

160
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,700
Your Request Agency

161
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,070
I'm getting old because of you.

162
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,570
Kang Bok Soo, I said I'm getting old because of you!

163
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,170
Wildflower Class President

164
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,750
What do I do?

165
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,910
What are you?

166
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,940
You keep talking to yourself like a crazy woman who got rained on.

167
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,460
Customers are leaving saying you're scary!

168
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,050
If you have something to say, call him.

169
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,850
Welcome.

170
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,980
Chairman Oh Se Ho

171
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,220
Hello?

172
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:36,880
Hey! Do you even know how good the pay was for singing instead of?

173
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,470
And you blew it away? Hey!

174
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,800
I'm the CEO but why are you deciding that?

175
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,020
You know our sales are down by half? You don't know, of course.

176
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,710
You don't know of course. How can you know how the CEO feels?

177
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,520
You don't know anything about how I feel.

178
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,090
Why are you smiling? Did you hurt your head too?

179
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,470
She's still the same, Son Soo Jeong.

180
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,730
What? She's still pretty?

181
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:14,460
Her temper. She was bold and spoke daringly. I wondered how she became such a weakling.

182
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,960
But she's still got it, indeed.

183
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,360
You're still the same too.

184
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,930
You become a fool when you meet Son Soo Jeong.

185
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,810
You said you were going to take revenge. Did you even talk to Son Soo Jeong?

186
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,340
I got a call.

187
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,260
Bitch

188
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,220
Why? What is it? Who is it that you're like that?

189
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,830
What? Bitch? Who's 'bitch'?

190
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,370
Is it Son Soo Jeong?

191
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,820
Kang Bok Soo, why do you take a detour instead of an easy path? You can just ask her.

192
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,390
Seeing how she called, she must also have something to say.

193
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,850
Aren't you more curious about that than revenge

194
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,140
why Son Soo Jeong did what she did?

195
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,700
Kang Bok Soo. This isn't like you.

196
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,930
You came, Chairman.

197
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,640
Why are you so drunk? How much did you drink?

198
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,730
Two cans.

199
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,010
If I drink three cans, I'll probably crawl around.

200
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,910
Be careful.

201
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,670
Why did you come?

202
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,990
Because I thought you were drunk.

203
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,930
So? Are you my friend?

204
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,990
Then am I not?

205
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,080
Then what am I?

206
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,450
Director. Seolsong High's director of the executive board.

207
00:17:53,450 --> 00:18:00,270
My superior at work. My employer.

208
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,750
There are so many things I don't have,

209
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,600
but among those, another thing I don't have is a friend.

210
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,350
Son Soo Jeong, what are you—

211
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,620
It's warm.

212
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,210
No...

213
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,190
Director, you should lie down too.

214
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,340
It's warm and nice, right?

215
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,530
Yeah.

216
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,100
It's quite nice.

217
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,990
Kang Bok Soo, you voulenteer—

218
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,290
I know, so stop talking. You smell like alcohol.

219
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,280
What alcohol smell?

220
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,560
Kang Bok Soo, hurry up and clean the gym!

221
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,590
Do it right! I'm going to check later.

222
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,670
I guess it suits you.

223
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,060
Leave. Don't bother me.

224
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,500
You caused trouble already. Son Soo Jeong became a full-time teacher with difficulty.

225
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,350
Do you want her to get fired because of you?

226
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,580
When did it start?

227
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:50,890
What?

228
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,380
Son Soo Jeong. You. What are you doing?

229
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,850
What do you mean?

230
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,030
Like you said, who are you to Son Soo Jeong that you're asking me that?

231
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,030
She's my homeroom teacher and I'm a loyal class president who wants to protect her. About that.

232
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,590
No, because I've been hearing rumors about some rich trash obsessing over her.

233
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:16,080
Isn't rich trash better than a returned loser?

234
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,870
Do you like Son Soo Jeong?

235
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,650
Why?

236
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,100
I can't?

237
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,240
Don't even think about messing with Son Soo Jeong, Oh Se Ho.

238
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,460
What qualification do you have to interfere in what Son Soo Jeong does?

239
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,850
Qualification? Are you nuts?

240
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,780
Qualification... How dare you judge my qualification? Hey, because of you—

241
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,830
What because of me?

242
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,430
It's different from back then.

243
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:55,370
Now, no matter who sees, I match with Son Soo Jeong better.

244
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,260
What are you doing?

245
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,590
It looks like you want to do one round and so do I.

246
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,360
I'll teach you. Grab the sword.

247
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,190
You're going to whine about getting injured and putting blame on me?

248
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:17,050
No matter what happens, I won't have you take responsibility. It's the same for you.

249
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,900
Don't be whining after getting beat up by me.

250
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:34,450
If so, I'll accept it.

251
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,220
Wear the uniform or else you're going to get hurt.

252
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,640
I don't need it. Winner gets his wish fulfilled.

253
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,290
How about it?

254
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,890
You should keep the rules.

255
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,480
I have my own rules.

256
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,290
This bast***.

257
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,570
So can I say my wish?

258
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,570
Not yet.

259
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,630
See, I told you I would win.

260
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,250
So what's your wish?

261
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,650
Do you want me to kneel down?

262
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,860
Was that your wish?

263
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,600
But, what do we do? I won.

264
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,910
Kang Bok Soo, did you finish clean—

265
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,430
Kang Bok Soo!

266
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,810
Kang Bok Soo, didn't I tell you to not cause trouble?

267
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,310
Are you crazy? You've done all sorts—

268
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,570
Why do you care?

269
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,550
Don't mind it.

270
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:43,500
Hey, I'm your teacher. If you cause trouble, it's my responsibility.

271
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,200
First, the nurs—

272
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,820
What?

273
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,360
Move. You really—

274
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,960
Why do you not ask?

275
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,750
Nine years ago and even now, why do you not ask

276
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,410
me what happened?!

277
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,960
Please tell me now.

278
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,820
♫  Are you listening? ♫

279
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,960
♫  My falling tears  ♫

280

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,410
♫  my love cries every day  ♫

284
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:58,030
♫  If you're under the same sky  ♫

285
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,070
Where did that $50,000 come from? Wait.

286
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,520
Did the $50,000 come from Oh Se Ho?

287
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,600
Eat with me three times. As a man and woman.

288
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,970
I want to live in the present with you. This moment now.

289
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,510
Why do you think she didn't believe me then?

290
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,780
Were my feelings that I showed you not enough?

291
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:15,050
Maybe I should've lied saying I didn't see it and I didn't hear it.

292
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,300
It's all in the past.

293
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,110
But it feels like I'm the only one stuck in that time.

294
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,850
You're not the only one stuck in that.

295
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,390
Were my feelings laughable?

296
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,890
Is this really the end?

297
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,160
I'm only going to ask you two things.

298
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,530
Did you really push Oh Se Ho that day on the rooftop?

299
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,630
Were you the one who spread the rumor?

300
