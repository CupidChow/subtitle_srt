1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,920
S high school's corruption facing a new phrase

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,570
Ah, really.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,500
S High whistler Kang Bok Soo, suspected having an inappropriate relationship with a female teacher.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,490
He's not answering.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,520
What do we do about Bok Soo?

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,700
Shouldn't we be comforting him?

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,270
Do you think he'll be comforted with a few words in this situation?

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,810
Son Soo Jeong, I am counting on you.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,240
Huh? What for?

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,600
Right. Who could console him better than you now?

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,610
Wherever it is, a place that only you two can be in...

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,430
Go.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,830
Hey, hey. The company credit card! The company card!

14
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,290
Company card?

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,000
Hurry.

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,020
Use this too.

17
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,870
Sojeong Gak

18
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,400
Your favor 365

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,520
You! Drive—

20
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,650
Get in!

21
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,470
What?

22
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,910
Son Soo Jeong!

23
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,130
Slowly, slowly, slowly!

24
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,010
Ah, really!

25
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,160
It feels good since it's been so long!

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,010
Stop pressing the accelerator!

27
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,630
Why? Are you scared?

28
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,190
No, that's not it. I'm just telling you to drive safely.

29
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,850
Kang Bok Soo, after you left the school like that nine years ago,

30
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,190
do you have anything you want to do the most or regret not doing?

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,110
Field trip.

32
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,330
Okay! Let's go on a field trip.

33
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,310
Right now? The two of us?

34
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,040
Yeah! These days, most people go to Jejudo, but because we can't go there right now,

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,480
let's go to the beach.

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,220
Go, go!

37
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,790
Okay, I understand but...

38
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,290
Let's go slowly, okay?

39
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,140
Kang Bok Soo!

40
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,650
What's this?

41
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,130
You really came to the rest stop for this?

42
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,330
I really wanted to eat this. Sausage-rice cake.

43
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,320
You should be eating something more delicious.

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,070
Delicious?

45
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,990
We should keep eating.

46
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,520
Kang Bok Soo!

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,700
Kang Bok Soo!

48
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,080
What is this?

49
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,190
It's delicious.

50
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,120
Bok Soo!

51
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,660
Kang Bok Soo!

52
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,280
Ta-da!

53
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,320
You came?

54
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,000
Then shall we start out?

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,190
Yeah, shall we?

56
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,690
Credit card transactions

57
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,240
I'm regretting it. I'm really regretting it.

58
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,670
Why are you eating so much?!

59
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,590
♫ Whenever I think about you, you suddenly appear ♫

60
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,030
♫ You make my heart flutter and tremble  ♫

61
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,720
♫ Thick traces of you, one by one  ♫

62
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,750
Bok Soo, we should probably do everything that others have done, right?

63
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,740
♫ Settle into my heart and they won’t leave ♫

64
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,390
Kang Bok Soo! Try and catch me!

65
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,820
♫ From now on, it’s our love story  ♫

66
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,070
♫ I want to draw out our future that I dreamed of  ♫

67
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,530
She still doesn't know that I can run 100 meters in 11 seconds.

68
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,290
♫ Now we will make history  ♫

69
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,660
♫ Every memory, one by one, I want to place in my heart ♫

70
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,100
Wait a moment! Wait.

71
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,940
This... It's because it's sand.

72
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,170
I can't in the sand.

73
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,550
Help me up.

74
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,510
Usually, when you go on a field trip, you have a campfire like this.

75
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,540
Aren't you supposed to roast potatoes and sweet potatoes on the fire?

76
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,270
You eat those kinds of things on a field trip?

77
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,090
I don't know. I didn't go either.

78
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:40,720
After that incident, the things that we should have done together, I did none of them.

79
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,960
I couldn't.

80
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,860
Thank you for the field trip today.

81
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:59,220
Because of you, a memory that I lost became alive.

82
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,700
Because I'm here with you like this,

83
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,150
it's seriously so nice.

84
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,700
I... sent in my resignation letter.

85
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:28,060
The time at school... I'm sorry that I can't spend it with you till the end again.

86
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:37,510
In exchange, I'll give you all of the remaining time in my life.

87
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,050
Let's date again, Kang Bok Soo.

88
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,990
Let's start again.

89
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,520
Our second first love.

90
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:59,030
♫ One star for you. One moon for you ♫

91
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:05,840
♫ What kind of a day would I send you? ♫

92
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:14,020
♫ Walk with you ♫

93
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,600
♫ As we walk, we will reach to it soon ♫

94
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,790
♫ As long as I go with you, ♫

95
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:29,090
♫ no word is needed ♫

96
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,190
♫ Let's share love together ♫

97
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,820
♫ In many days ♫

98
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:45,870
♫ Will you tell me this? I love you ♫

99
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,890
Give me black bean noodles please.

100
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,660
Yes! Welcome—

101
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,410
You came.

102
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,680
Yes. I came.

103
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,450
Yes.

104
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,310
Yes.

105
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,030
I was worried.

106
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,180
I heard that you quit school because of Bok Soo.

107
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,760
My heart wasn't at ease.

108
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,870
I was sorry and thankful.

109
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,490
It wasn't because of Bok Soo.

110
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,030
It was because of me.

111
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:49,180
I knew that I would regret it for a long time if I didn't protect Bok Soo this time.

112
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,850
Because I said all that I wanted to,

113
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,220
I feel relieved and my heart at ease.

114
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,720
I am not sure if I should say this as an unemployed person.

115
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,770
I understand even if you talk like that.

116
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,950
I know you think teaching is a calling for you.

117
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,890
To be honest, I came to receive support.

118
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:17,530
I am thinking about starting a new challenge.

119
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,130
You'll do well in everything. It'll turn out well

120
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,330
because you're a good person. I know you are.

121
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,030
Teacher!

122
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,730
What's with you, seriously?

123
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,900
You didn't pick up nor were you at your house. You don't know how worried we were!

124
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,670
No, why? Did you miss me?

125
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,670
I thought something happened to you who live alone.

126
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,450
And you should have met with me first not with my mom.

127
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,550
Well I wanted to eat some black bean noodles

128
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,680
and I also received some strength from your mother.

129
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,390
Teacher. I already warned you that her standards are high. You're going to get hurt.

130
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,200
I think I am good enough. Let's go in.

131
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,290
Let's go inside and talk.

132
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,680
Do you really think you did it?

133
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,820
I think I am decent for my age.

134
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,930
That's not true.

135
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,250
Why are you here?

136
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,480
I have something to say.

137
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,600
Can you give me a bit of time?

138
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,270
I won't come look for you like this again. This is the last time.

139
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,320
Resignation letter

140
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,150
Why do you have this?

141
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,040
I received it from Secretary Yoon.

142
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,080
I heard you submitted it to my mother.

143
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,400
To be honest, I wanted to give the resignation letter to you

144
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,750
because you were the one who made me a full-time teacher.

145
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,860
It turned out well then. You should settle it.

146
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,230
Soo Jeong, I came to give you back your resignation letter.

147
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,840
Why?

148
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,080
You're the one who threatened me saying I'm a corrupted teacher who is dating a student.

149
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,210
Wasn't it you who spread the rumor nine years ago to attack Bok Soo?

150
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,140
It wasn't me.

151
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,280
I have been serious about my feelings for you from nine years ago up until now.

152
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:39,690
During the time that I couldn't come to Korea at all, I thought about you every day.

153
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,430
That I... wanted to meet you in a different way,

154
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,000
although it turned out like this.

155
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,730
Oh Se Ho.

156
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:57,790
I feel like I did a lot of wrongs to both you and Kang Bok Soo.

157
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,580
Son Soo Jeong, you were hired by your merit and not for the money.

158
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,470
And... you're a good teacher.

159
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,630
You're changing the kids of the wildflower class.

160
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,130
I would like it if you didn't give up like this.

161
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,720
Even so,

162
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,680
the truth that I paid to buy the teacher position doesn't disappear.

163
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,500
And I also want to honorably meet with Bok Soo.

164
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,240
Your class evaluations were the highest for past three years,

165
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,570
and you passed the exams to become a full-time teacher.

166
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,190
You're more than qualified.

167
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,630
When you acknowledged me as qualified... I was thankful.

168
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:51,220
And I would like it if you told Bok Soo personally that you wronged him.

169
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,690
And it would be better if it was with actions rather than words.

170
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,560
I'm leaving.

171
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,250
Resignation letter

172
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,920
I checked into it. The education board is preparing a hearing

173
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,740
over this Seolsong High matter.

174
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,480
And they seemed to be planning to have your mother as a testifier.

175
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,990
Will my mother not be suspicious?

176
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,590
Since she's someone who is suspicious of everything in this world, she might not believe me,

177
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:54,050
but she seems to think you used up all the evidence in the board meeting.

178
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:58,660
She probably believed that that money would never be revealed.

179
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,780
What do you mean expelled?

180
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,390
I told you to give him either a transfer or even a drop-out!

181
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:13,460
The thing is, the school can't ignore public opinion.

182
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,060
If we allow a drop-out for your son,

183
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,410
his grades which were obtained illicitly will become official.

184
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,350
So public opinion is very strongly against it.

185
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,060
I won't stay still.

186
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,710
I gave so much money to this school!

187
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:35,660
This shouldn't— This shouldn't happen.

188
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,390
Teacher's lounge

189
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:05,900
Chae Min, realizing early on that you did wrong,

190
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,570
doesn't that mean you have an early opportunity?

191
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,030
What opportunity? It seems like my life is ruined.

192
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,210
Bok Soo already told you.

193
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,880
An opportunity to live life differently.

194
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,220
I also did a very bad deed at your age,

195
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,910
Wrongdoings, as time passes, get bigger like a snowball.

196
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,150
As big as your inability to turn back.

197
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,540
You'll become a better adult than me.

198
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:53,070
Thank you... for letting me stop.

199
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,150
As a teacher,

200
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,270
you should feel ashamed for ruining a kid's life.

201
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,880
Mom.

202
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm most embarrassed by you and me right now.

203
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,460
Lee Chae Min.

204
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,240
Let's go.

205
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,290
I'm sorry to ask to see you suddenly.

206
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,160
No, it's okay.

207
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,480
I also missed you.

208
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,450
Why has a summons for the hearing been sent to me?!

209
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,270
You are an important testifier, and

210
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,210
the hearing is for the principal, I hear.

211
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,900
I don't suppose you need specially prepare.

212
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,650
Please stop.

213
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,350
What did you say?

214
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,940
Even though you covered it up this time, you won't be able to hide it forever.

215
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,990
It'll all collapse.

216
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,110
You're the one who made my Seolsong collapse, you awful jerk.

217
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,340
With the stolen money from this school, you're going to make another school.

218
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,870
And with the same method, you're going to extend the school.

219
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,070
At this rate, you'll make a country.

220
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,530
That's what a business is, Oh Se Ho.

221
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,200
Do you think there's a business other than the private school business

222
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,510
that will protect my rights and assets safely as the owner of the school?

223
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:03,090
Even so, it's not right for you to be in school business.

224
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,920
You're calling your one and only son a loser, so how can you be involved with other students?

225
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,200
Speaking of you, I'm angry that I couldn't throw you away when I wanted to.

226
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,460
As for students, I can throw them away when they fail,

227
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,390
just like you were going to forcefully transfer Kang Bok Soo and the wildflower class.

228
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,890
Here.

229
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,130
What is it?

230
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,400
A scarf. Your neck looks empty.

231
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,290
Our CEO, due to the company law banning company dating,

232
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,890
is leaving the live fox scarf idle (Our CEO left me alone).

233
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,700
I... thought about it.

234
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,390
In order to celebrate the new year, I am thinking about adjusting the company rules.

235
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,470
How?

236
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,390
Actively encouraging office romance.

237
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,460
Moreover, the CEO and team leader, just the two, are going

238
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,290
to the winter workshop.

239
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,050
I like it a lot.

240
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,250
I agree with it.

241
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,010
Let's try it on.

242
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,910
It's pretty.

243
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,060
This is our real first kiss.

244
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,690
You. You can't do that to me.

245
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,500
This jerk has no manners towards me!

246
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,740
Oh, you came?

247
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,220
I had some trouble with the CEO.

248
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,690
A kiss is the best way to resolve troubles.

249
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,530
Of course. A deep kiss is even better.

250
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:35,560
No. There are a lot of things to prepare for tomorrow. Why did you come here?

251
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:13,290
Board of Education Hearing for Seolsong High private school corruption investigation

252
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,090
Witness Seat

253
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,470
Chairman

254
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,370
Hello, everyone.

255
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,080
I'm going to be the chairperson for today's hearing of the education board.

256
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,890
My name is Park Dong Joon, and I'm the superintendent of the citizen commission board.

257
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:19,240
We will start the 264th education committee hearing right now.

258
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,420
First on the agenda is the corruption of the Seolsong High foundation

259
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,730
which was established under the Seolsong cooperation.

260
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,840
This will help investigate the scandal, and we now open the hearing.

261
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,890
We will proceed with this public hearing with the help of witnesses on stand today.

262
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,030
I expect nothing but the truth and honest answers today.

263
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:45,240
My name is Kim Da Seon who is the manager of the PTA.

264
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,530
As for the current issue at Seolsong High School about the test paper leak scandal,

265
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,340
would you say that you are the victim of this case?

266
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,740
Yes, that's true.

267
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,930
However, that's all because of the principal who is sitting here today and

268
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,410
also Director Im Se Gyeong who tempted me to do this.

269
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,120
What do you mean by temptation?

270
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,080
If I made a contribution to the school,

271
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,680
she promised that she would help the kids successfully enter into college

272
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:17,490
including writing a favorable entry in the student record book and leaking of the test papers as well.

273
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:26,610
I was foolish enough to fall for that temptation.

274
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,650
As an evidence, I submit receipts for the statement

275
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,930
which shows the amount of money deposited to be close to 700 million won.

276
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,440
Seolsong Foundation's official record

277
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,030
has about a 70 million won gap on their received donation amount.

278
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,650
And we need to track it down somehow since the account is under various names.

279
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,920
Out of them, there are many accounts that have relations to the previous principal, Mr. Kim Gwi Chang.

280
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,170
Did the previous principal, Mr. Kim Gwi Chang, offer you that?

281
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,970
No, sir.

282
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,510
It was Director Im Se Gyeong.

283
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,570
That's not true at all.

284
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:06,320
The leak of the test papers happened when I wasn't working as the director.

285
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,590
What Ms. Kim Da Seon meant

286
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,580
is that there has been leak of test papers continuously besides what just happened this time around?

287
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,640
No, ma'am. It was just this one time.

288
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,670
What you're saying just doesn't add up.

289
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,860
Director Im, I will give you a chance to speak so please be cautious.

290
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,510
Yes, I'm sorry.

291
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,190
While working for the administration office for Seolsong High School

292
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,170
you approached the temp teachers and helped to get them hired

293
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:36,650
by paying money to the school. Is that true?

294
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,680
Yes, that's true sir.

295
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,310
I would like to submit the teacher's list that Mr. Kim Myeong Ho wrote

296
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,560
regarding the Seolsong High School hiring scandal.

297
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,420
So who is the one that asked you to do this?

298
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,760
It was Principal Kim Gwi Chang.

299
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,850
However, you do know about the food-chain, right?

300
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:05,960
There's the sun, the grass, and grasshopper that eats the grass.

301
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,990
Lastly, the tiger eats the fox, and this is the food-chain that I'm talking about.

302
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,310
What are you trying to say here?

303
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:19,380
Basically what I'm trying to say is that both the principal and I are nothing but pieces of grass.

304
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:25,630
Grass! We just did what we were told.

305
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:30,230
I was once offered by Mr. Kim Myeong Ho that if I paid 50 million won,

306
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,670
I could get a full-time permanent teaching position at the school.

307
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,560
So what you're saying is that what Mr. Kim said is the truth, right?

308
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,490
Yes, that's correct.

309
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,550
What I would like to say is that authority over human resources of a private school

310
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,790
has nothing to do with Mr. Kim Myeong Ho nor the principal of the school.

311
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:53,570
The person who has authority over the human resources department is Director Im Se Gyeong.

312
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,040
Last person on the witness stand, please make your request to tell your testimony.

313
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,420
Thank you for coming.

314
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,600
I'm here today to tell you all about the new controversy that's been on the news lately.

315
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,400
My name is Oh Se Ho, the former director of the school, and I'm here to greet you all today.

316
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,730
You said that you have something to report about Mr. Kang's past who is the whistle blower. Isn't that right?

317
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:49,530
Is it true that you're the very victim of the crime that Mr. Kang committed?

318
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:56,450
Yes, I am the victim of what Mr. Kang Bok Soo did to me

319
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,550
nine years ago.

320
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,930
I have revealed the date about the corruptions on meal service, rebate relating to equipment and tools,

321
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:31,190
hiring scandal, student record book, and the leak of test papers.

322
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:35,420
Just to inform you, today's public hearing is opened with this data that I have here.

323
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:40,390
After that, the previous principal, Kim Gwi Chang, made a confession.

324
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,880
Even the prosecution department decided that the principal was solely responsible for this whole corruption scandal.

325
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,680
However, the principal claims he's the one who did this, which is worth billions of won.

326
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,060
So I wonder where and how

327
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:01,450
did he use this money?

328
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,170
I brought the answer to that.

329
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,240
Seolsong University land construction

330
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,190
It's located near the capital with nice mountains and clean water.

331
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,770
This property on Yoo Rim Avenue in the city of San Joo, Jin Young county

332
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:22,740
is permitted to build Seolsong University.

333
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,230
As for Seolsong University, do you mean it's the next school over from the Seolsong Foundation?

334
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,400
Yes.

335
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,320
And the owner of this property is Nicholas Im.

336
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,050
His Korean name is Im Tae Hoon.

337
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:40,000
So therefore, he is the real brother of the Director Im Se Gyeong.

338
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,650
I have no younger sibling!

339
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,380
Of course, the younger sibling isn't in the family registry.

340
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,910
Once the parents got divorced, they were separated on the family registry.

341
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:53,520
He got citizenship in a foreign country, but he is her real sibling.

342
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,900
I guess it would be one of those safe boxes that would be hard to track down, right?

343
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,600
The board of directors of the private foundation would say that, "this school belongs to me."

344
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:11,250
However, 90 percent of the funding for private schools comes from the nation's taxes.

345
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,670
The corruption scandal for Seolsong High is about taking public funding and building their own school,

346
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,110
which is considered theft.

347
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,820
The funding to establish Seolsong University is approximately 300 billion won.

348
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,480
Unexpectedly, it's close to the amount of Seolsong High School's corruption fund.

349
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,920
This is the end of my testimony.

350
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,630
I look forward to our country doing the rest to reveal everything in detail.

351
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,180
Witness Stand

352
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,290
Director Im, I will give you a chance to speak.

353
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,580
So please take the seat over there.

354
00:30:53,580 --> 00:31:00,450
I have done my best to make a special school for discerning the most excellent students and educating them.

355
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:05,220
Seolsong High School helps the students reach the Ivy League universities with remarkable grades for college entrance.

356
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,370
So this proves that my conviction about education was right time and time again.

357
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,130
The university I am going to establish is not just for entering into college,

358
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:18,190
but it will become a special school for cultivating the true leaders of this country.

359
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:24,270
This public hearing isn't about promoting your school.

360
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,520
As Kang Bok Soo said about Seolsong High School,

361
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,360
ninety percent of its funding is backed by the country, so this school belongs to the citizens.

362
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,220
The school is operated by everyone's taxes,

363
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,140
so why do you only seek to have an education system for particular students?

364
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,200
The school isn't your private property.

365
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,960
Would you like to explain the suspicion that you're trying to establish a private school

366
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,200
by siphoning tax revenue from the government?

367
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,890
That is not true at all!

368
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:00,480
This is nothing but a fabricated conspiracy against me.

369
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,380
Kang Bok Soo is the one that brought suspicion about this incident.

370
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,590
But he was the perpetrator of school violence nine years ago.

371
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,590
He shoved my son against the gates of death.

372
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,460
And because of that, he got kicked out of school.

373
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,630
And now he is trying to defame me to take revenge against me.

374
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,640
Kang Bok Soo....

375
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,360
As a witness of the incident that happened nine years ago,

376
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,680
I've heard recently from the victim admitting that he threw himself (from the roof).

377
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,770
Kang Bok Soo is not that type of person.

378
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:54,090
You are a teacher but you are having a relationship with a student named Kang Bok Soo, isn't that right?

379
00:32:54,090 --> 00:33:01,560
Do we have to believe in the testimonial of a teacher that's having an inappropriate relationship with a student?

380
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,160
Reference Witness

381
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,930
Yes, that is true.

382
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:37,290
I love Kang Bok Soo.

383
00:33:53,830 --> 00:34:01,150
♫ Are you listening to my bursting tears?  ♫

384
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,920
♫ Are you listening to my heart that I can’t endure?  ♫

385
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,520
My Strange Hero

386
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,490
To have no students with pain and torment from unfairness,

387
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,350
I think that the true revenge is to change the way things are done at this school.

388
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,660
I'm mustering up the courage to live an honest life for once just because you told me to not run away from things!

389
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,860
How dare you do this to me?!

390
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,610
I requested a settlement for the school.

391
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,760
She wants to close down the school just because she's not able to do whatever she wants?

392
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,630
All we have to do is discuss the countermeasures calmly to come up with the way to stop the settlement.

393
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,400
We want to be a part of this too.

394
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,080
- Are you guys confident?
- Yes, sir!

395
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,430
♫ I try to let you go  ♫

396
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,100
♫ But my heart can’t do that yet ♫
