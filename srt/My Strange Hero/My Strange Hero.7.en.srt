1
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,550
Oh Se Ho.

2
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,820
It's prohibited for students to be here.

3
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,190
Hey, it's been a long time

4
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,380
since the three of us were here.

5
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,540
My life fell apart here...

6
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,830
Because of your lies.

7
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,500
I never lied.

8
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,900
- Me either.
- Don't speak nonsense, you jerk!

9
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,300
Hey, when did I ever push you? You came up here to die.

10
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,560
Back then, I was curious what kind of nonsense you were saying,

11
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,470
but I'm not even curious anymore

12
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,950
why you wanted to die.

13
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,120
That's not something I need to know.

14
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,410
My heart hurts.

15
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,370
An indifferent Kang Bok Soo.

16
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:54,540
Hey, Son Soo Jeong, did you really think I pushed this jerk to die?

17
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,290
I heard Se Ho begging for you to save him.

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,330
Kang Bok Soo.

19
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,610
Save me!

20
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,930
You should have believed me when everybody else misunderstood!

21
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,850
How could I believe you?!

22
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's stop.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,530
Were my feelings nothing to you?

24
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:36,741
What if I can't go to college like this?

25
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:40,721
That's why I told you to change your math tutor.

26
00:02:40,721 --> 00:02:43,581
Class President.

27
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,571
Are you first place again?

28
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:47,491
Yeah.

29
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,451
Is it pay by the hour? How much?

30
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:52,151
Yeah, how much is it?

31
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:58,091
I forgot that our homeroom teacher told me to go to his office during our break time. I'll be back.

32
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:01,741
Ah, really!

33
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:04,391
How expensive is it that she's like that? Is she the only one that's rich?

34
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,121
Her parents are both professors.

35
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:07,761
No, they are working for the education department.

36
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:10,611
That's why she's taking all the school's scholarships.

37
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:11,871
How unlucky.

38
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:13,431
Hey, hey.

39
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:14,481
Sit down.

40
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:17,131
You've never won against a female.

41
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:22,031
Her words...

42
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:33,721
Kang Bok Soo, why are you following me?

43
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:35,421
What do you mean follow?

44
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:38,511
I'm dropping you off. Don't mind me and study.

45
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,491
It's okay. I'll walk alone.

46
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:42,641
I don't like anyone going to my house with me.

47
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:44,611
Don't come.

48
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:03,011
It's here.

49
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:04,211
Wow!

50
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:08,131
Class President, your house is really big.

51
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:09,031
Now leave.

52
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,411
After seeing you go inside.

53
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:13,121
You leave first.

54
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:16,281
Doing this makes it really feel like we're dating.

55
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:19,211
You should go on ahead and leave.

56
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,281
Okay. I'll leave.

57
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,001
I'm going.

58
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,231
Yeah, go.

59
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:32,421
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Goodnight!

60
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:34,521
Okay, hurry and go.

61
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:40,451
Who is it?

62
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:45,441
I'm sorry. I mistook the house.

63
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:48,531
- Okay.
- I’m sorry.

64
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,781
Class President.

65
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:16,541
Stop following me.

66
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,581
I'm not following you.

67
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:20,831
I'm dropping you off.

68
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:24,931
I have never lied.

69
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:29,491
I just let the kids believe what they want. I have never...

70
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,501
lied myself.

71
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:48,721
Who said anything?

72
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:51,641
No matter where you live,

73
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:56,551
Son Soo Jeong is just Son Soo Jeong.

74
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:16,371
We're here.

75
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:19,301
This is my real house.

76
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:21,031
Oh.

77
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:22,271
I...

78
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:25,761
Because I now know where you live, I'm going to drop you off every day now.

79
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:28,051
What are you saying?

80
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:28,991
Hurry and leave.

81
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:31,321
After seeing you go inside.

82
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:41,901
- I...
- Wait a moment.

83
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:56,261
Go inside.

84
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:08,681
That's right.

85
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,151
It's not embarrassing.

86
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,321
What's wrong with being poor?

87
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:20,701
Who in the world did this, huh?

88
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:25,601
Who did this with so much care?

89
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,651
How can the door open so easily?

90
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:36,931
Aigoo, their handiwork is good.

91
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:39,281
But who did this?

92
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:42,091
Oh my world.

93
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:47,181
The gate is now as pretty as Son Soo Jeong, right?

94
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:03,351
I'll be back!

95
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:12,921
What's this, Kang Bok Soo?

96
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:15,461
I'm way prettier.

97
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:33,201
Son Soo Jeong, don't come inside right now.

98
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:36,451
- Huh?
- If you come inside right now, you'll get hurt.

99
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:38,381
What are you saying?

100
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:42,771
Bok Soo said something that he shouldn't have.

101
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:47,021
You came, Class President?

102
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:54,201
Come here.

103
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,921
I'll take care of it on my own.

104
00:08:55,921 --> 00:09:01,791
- What's going on?
- Hey, I heard that you're from a low-income family?

105
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:07,021
How could you fool us like this?

106
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:10,301
She must have found us funny every time we asked her for a tutor.

107
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:11,421
Right?

108
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:12,971
How did I fool you?

109
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:14,301
Hey.

110
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:17,231
We all thought you were from a rich household.

111
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:21,361
You always laughed every time we asked you to introduce us to a tutor!

112
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,451
Why did you lie?

113
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,521
I never lied.

114
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:32,221
How cunning.

115
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:33,941
How funny did we look?

116
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,831
You guys just thought what you wanted.

117
00:09:35,831 --> 00:09:39,331
Then you should have said it wasn't so!

118
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:45,451
I'm also a human.

119
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:49,061
It's nothing to be bragging about.

120
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:55,091
I am not a liar.

121
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,441
Why are you hiding, Son Soo Jeong?

122
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:12,791
Is this all that you are worth?

123
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:18,681
Snap out of it and face it.

124
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:41,341
You pitiful girl.

125
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,691
Low-income family?

126
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:48,071
Don't say that. You are going to offend the person from a low-income family.

127
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:55,371
No wonder. Kang Bok Soo's hobby is helping others anyway.

128
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:58,871
It makes sense that he was so good to Son Soo Jeong in the first place. It was because he pitied her all along.

129
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,281
Are you okay?

130
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:23,271
Oh Se Ho, is this what you meant by Bok Soo saying what he wasn't supposed to say?

131
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:24,331
Bok Soo's not the type of person to do that.

132
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:27,211
I'm pretty sure Bok Soo didn't say that with any ill intentions.

133
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:30,951
Bok Soo said that he felt sorry for you so...

134
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:38,131
Didn't he even paint your gate?

135
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:06,931
Do you even know what trust is?

136
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:11,171
Thanks to you, I don't trust anyone anymore.

137
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:18,661
Alright, I understand.

138
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:26,471
I am not going to ask about why you two had to do that.

139
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:31,571
I'm just going to pay you back for exactly what I received from you.

140
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:35,431
With your misunderstandings and lies, you completely turned my life upside down.

141
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:38,351
However, you have become a teacher and the school's director!

142
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:41,711
So it's not fair for the two of you to lead such good and successful lives, right?

143
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:57,241
You both are going to regret bringing me back to this school.

144
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:58,841
Teacher.

145
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:01,601
Teacher!

146
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,231
Yes?

147
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:14,141
Today, we will be learning more about this novel in which a character travels on a path and comes back to the starting point.

148
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,921
Let's start by reading the first line of the story.

149
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,991
Oh Yeong Min, you can start reading the first line.

150
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:25,511
The god-like teacher is telling you to start reading.

151
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:28,581
You should just get lost if you are going to be nothing but a distraction to the class.

152
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:38,631
I, too, wonder if someone else is listening in.

153
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:44,641
Since earlier, I was looking at something that was a bit suspicious—

154
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,051
Lee Chae Min, what are you doing?

155
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:51,271
It's because he is not able to snap out of it.

156
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:55,821
If you are going to be like this, you should just get the hell out of here.

157
00:13:55,821 --> 00:13:59,961
I told you that I'm not leaving, okay? I'm not leaving here! I'm not leaving!

158
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:01,961
Yeong Min.

159
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,711
Drink this before it gets cold.

160
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,821
You were a bit startled earlier, weren't you?

161
00:14:28,821 --> 00:14:34,311
Is it really true that you don't trust anyone now?

162
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:37,011
It would be nice if you put your trust in me,

163
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:41,291
just like you did before.

164
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:49,401
Before, huh? I thought to myself that I would have to discuss this at least once with you.

165
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:51,091
I'm just letting you know that I didn't take your side at that time.

166
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:55,721
I just said exactly what I heard, that's all.

167
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:58,371
Even if that's the case, I was still grateful either way.

168
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:01,481
I felt like I was fighting with that grand and mighty Kang Bok Soo all alone.

169
00:15:01,481 --> 00:15:04,771
But you were there to testify for me. I was really grateful for that.

170
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:09,461
Doesn't Bok Soo seem to be the same as ever? Kang Bok Soo is going to take a revenge, eh?

171
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:11,481
Ah, so hot.

172
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,151
Are you alright?

173
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:18,571
Stop laughing.

174
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:20,551
Oh, sorry.

175
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:26,011
I actually called you in because of the kids from the wildflower class.

176
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:29,711
- Huh? Did my kids cause some kind of trouble?
- Oh, no. It's nothing like that.

177
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:33,001
The wildflower class was established especially for helping kids decide on their career path.

178
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:37,161
I was wondering if we could invite teachers from elsewhere for vocational training after class.

179
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:40,891
Don't you think our school should help the students who have a hard time getting into college find the right path for them?

180
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:43,811
What do you think about putting your trust in me once again?

181
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:47,941
Putting your trust in me in regards to how I'm going to change this school.

182
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:55,051
Hold on, let me take this call.

183
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:58,741
Hello, this is Son Soo Jeong.

184
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:05,941
This is the Hana Sanitarium. Ms. Lee Soon Ae's condition has suddenly become worse, so that's why I am calling you.

185
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:10,201
She is being relocated to Hankook Hospital right now. I urge you to go see your grandma right away.

186
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:24,341
I want to tell you that she has pneumonia right now.

187
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:27,131
And it seems like she has a chronic lung condition at the moment.

188
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:29,981
Yes, but she was doing okay for a while though.

189
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:33,491
As you know, this lung condition is too severe for us to put a stop to it.

190
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:36,911
She did endure it well for a very long time, but considering her age,

191
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:41,861
she's going to have pneumonia more often from now on, so as her guardian, you have to take better care of her.

192
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:45,421
She has to be hospitalized for about a week and go through treatments here.

193
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:50,191
Ah, yes.

194
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:55,541
Invoice amount: 1,535,104 won

195
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:10,171
Well, I'm afraid you have exceeded your limit.

196
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:13,231
Ah, yes.

197
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:16,701
Seolsong High School food pyramid

198
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:21,691
First, the producer.

199
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,591
A.K.A. the grasshopper. 50 million won.

200
00:17:26,591 --> 00:17:29,851
Alright, let's go and catch the grasshopper first.

201
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:32,741
Once I go and catch the grasshopper...

202
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:40,371
First of all, I should do a whole lot of research on this Kim Myeong Ho guy.

203
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:55,141
♫ It just flickers and it's hard to see what it is ♫

204
00:17:56,691 --> 00:18:05,391
♫ And it's a path like going on a rainbow ♫

205
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:15,361
♫ Oh dear, please be my strength ♫

206
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:21,651
♫ My path that is hiding ♫

207
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:24,991
Man, you live such a dramatic life.

208
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:40,891
Celebrity waiting room

209
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:47,251
Kang Bok Soo.

210
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:51,431
I'm really curious.

211
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,601
How are you going to take revenge anyway?

212
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:58,811
You are a student and I'm the director of this school after all.

213
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:08,271
Doesn't it make sense that it's easier for me to do something to you?

214
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:18,791
Hey, what's wrong?

215
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:23,601
Revenge... What should I do?

216
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:27,801
Kang Bok Soo, what did you learn from working?

217
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:30,561
There is not one man who does not shake off any dust (everyone has a weakness or baggage).

218
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:33,971
That's right. Closely monitor him.

219
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:37,201
Closely monitor, you say.

220
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:42,551
You've worked hard. The response was good.

221
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:44,911
I put in some more.

222
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:48,201
'Your Favor' will work even harder.

223
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:55,221
Hey! What are you doing here?

224
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:57,881
I'm working. Here's what you ordered.

225
00:19:57,881 --> 00:19:59,841
Wait, wait, wait.

226
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:03,021
This guy is a high school student in my class.

227
00:20:03,021 --> 00:20:04,691
High school student? He's not older than me?

228
00:20:04,691 --> 00:20:09,591
Hey, elders. Just be quiet and chew the squid.

229
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:18,941
Can you get me the family records of the students in the wildflower class, Secretary Yoon?

230
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:22,881
Oh, and please find out how to forcefully transfer a student to a different school.

231
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:25,461
A forced transfer?

232
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:27,011
Yes.

233
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:41,201
Oh Se Ho arrives at work at 7:50 am.

234
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:54,961
Meeting as soon as he gets here.

235
00:20:57,271 --> 00:21:00,971
Director Oh Se Ho

236
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:09,101
Yes, I will get to your instructions.

237
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:16,891
What are you doing here?

238
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:22,471
Because I've gotten older and came back to school, I'm getting the classes mixed up.

239
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:24,751
I didn't know where this was.

240
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:28,091
The wildflower classroom is in a different building.

241
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:35,121
This... Because I came back to school as an adult, it's become so hard.

242
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:37,751
As expected, everything has its own prime time. Right?

243
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:43,021
Right now is when I'm having a conversation with Secretary Yoon?

244
00:21:43,021 --> 00:21:44,991
Secretary Yoon, did you know you're handsome?

245
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:48,221
You seem like a good person and, shall I say, full of charm?

246
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:57,091
I have a feeling that I can become good friends with you.

247
00:21:57,091 --> 00:21:59,851
I have a man that I'm dating.

248
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:09,871
Failure on Secretary Yoon.

249
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,611
Instead, I found out his secret.

250
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:22,511
Oh Se Ho, it's just a problem of time for my revenge.

251
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:26,201
I'm going to find out your weakness and take revenge—

252
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:30,571
I didn't know things would work out like this either.

253
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:34,931
I swear I just delivered it. I didn't touch it.

254
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,481
What was the key like? What was it?

255
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:08,241
Administrative Staff: Kim Myeong Ho

256
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:13,591
Come on. Lunch time is almost over.

257
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:17,271
But I’ll...

258
00:23:57,091 --> 00:23:59,211
Is it true? What are you doing right now?

259
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:02,411
Why did you ignore my text? So unmannerly.

260
00:24:02,411 --> 00:24:04,501
About that...

261
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:08,271
Are you pushing and pulling?

262
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:12,791
No, I don't like the push-and-pulling.

263
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,541
People are too calculating.

264
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:18,301
If you like someone, you like them. If you don't, you don't. Why push and pull? It's so tiring.

265
00:24:18,301 --> 00:24:21,401
You're not even a rubber band.

266
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:25,751
Please be clear about whether you're going to push or pull.

267
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:29,251
Then I'll continuously push—

268
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:36,081
Stop! A moment's choice can determine your life.

269
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:40,201
Okay! I'll give you more time.

270
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:42,731
Have some courage.

271
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,291
Here.

272
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:51,991
A courageous beast can capture a beauty.

273
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,241
I don't know.

274
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:19,161
It's natural for people to date inside a school.

275
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:21,961
You see that as dating?

276
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:26,591
It's like a third-rate drama where a rich older woman is threatening a poor younger man to be with her.

277
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,001
Right?

278
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:33,531
You only see how you are, they say. So you think of such earnest and sweet love in regards to money too.

279
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:37,011
As expected, a person who loses a lot of money is different.

280
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:38,751
What?

281
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:45,711
You're still the same, hurting people when you don't know anything.

282
00:26:12,391 --> 00:26:17,291
I know I'm supposed to meet you at school,

283
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:21,441
but going to school is still a bit hard for me,

284
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:25,241
so I asked to meet you outside like this.

285
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:30,021
I'm like this, so I don't know what that kid is thinking going back there.

286
00:26:38,641 --> 00:26:42,631
Well... With this opportunity, Bok Soo

287
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:48,161
probably hopes to overcome the pain from the past.

288
00:26:48,161 --> 00:26:53,391
Although he acts like he's fine, after that incident,

289
00:26:53,391 --> 00:26:56,751
he really tried hard to become an adult quickly.

290
00:26:58,181 --> 00:27:03,051
It hurt my heart to see that.

291
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:10,861
I think that Bok Soo has given me another opportunity.

292
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:16,711
This time, I will protect him till the end.

293
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:27,291
This isn't much, but please accept this as my sincerity.

294
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:30,791
Ma'am, you can't do this. This is bad. I could get fired.

295
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:35,001
That's not it. You shouldn't be like this for the sake of Bok Soo.

296
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:37,751
I'm being like this because I'm thinking about Bok Soo.

297
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:42,341
I'm a countrified person so this is the only method I know.

298
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:45,821
Think of it as my heart and accept it.

299
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:48,151
Then, I'll be leaving.

300
00:27:48,151 --> 00:27:51,481
Ma'am, excuse me... Ma'am...

301
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:54,531
This...

302
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,471
