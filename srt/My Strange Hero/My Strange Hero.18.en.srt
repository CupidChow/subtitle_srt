Administration
[Episode 18]

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,740
Morning Clean

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,770
Oh! Are you perhaps... Bread Shuttle (errand boy to fetch bread for bullies)?

4
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,160
Oh! Are you Bok Soo's friend, Lee Kyeong Hyeon?

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,300
Wow! How did you also come here?

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,190
Wow. I heard you became a teacher but you really are!

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,860
- You've succeeded, Shuttle Ma.
- Oh, yeah.

8
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,850
Why are you calling him a shuttle?

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,290
What?

10
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,690
No. I just...

11
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,450
Look here. Excuse me, but if I said to you,

12
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,440
"Hey, services. Hey, cleaning." would you feel good?

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,970
Also, addressing him with something that's painful to him from his past as if it's a proper noun and not painful to him

14
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,660
is not what a mature adult should do.

15
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,370
Listen carefully.

16
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,150
This person's name is not Shuttle Ma but Ma Yeong Joon.

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,340
Teacher Ma Yeong Joon.

18
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,920
Yes, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,720
I'm just an alum from the same class, so I was just glad to see him.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,020
Alum from the same class?

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,780
Our Teacher Ma, who looks so young for his age, and you?

22
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,170
No way.

23
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,170
♫  Who are you? Who, who, who, who? ♫

24
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,890
♫ Who are you? Who, who, who, who? ♫

25
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,460
♫ Tell me, who are you? Who are you? Who? ♫

26
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,370
♫ I really want to know. ♫

27
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,170
♫ I really want to know. ♫

28
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:09,020
♫ C'mon, tell me, who are you? You? You? Wow! You! ♫

29
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,800
People don't know well

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,090
that someone can rummage through their trash.
List of consulting institutes for college entrance

31
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,480
As expected, you're qualified as a CEO.

32
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,000
The school had a list for consulting institutes.

33
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,860
College entrance consulting institute.

34
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,560
Friend, I just saw you act as a smart man.

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,880
So shocking.

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,730
I absolutely hate meaningless consulting.

37
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,290
Nowadays, without a connection to the school's foundation,

38
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,130
it's a bit hard to take care of a student's records.

39
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:00,560
I have a very special relationship with Seolsong High.

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,590
Especially, for the most important campus competition,

41
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,230
we are the only one that Seolsong High provides information to.

42
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,730
It's all been planned out before the start of the competition, huh?

43
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,490
But it isn't wrong to pay money for consulting service.

44
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:18,980
It's okay if the school didn't give out information to the consulting institute, but...

45
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,660
They did. That's true. That's corruption.

46
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,710
Hey, are you going to let this out right away?

47
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,620
No, we need to reveal all the people who are involved first.

48
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,370
Oh Se Ho is definitely involved.

49
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,130
People who paid money...

50
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,530
Of course. I knew they'd get caught.

51
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,350
Debate Topic: One's career choice is based on money

52
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,600
What are you doing here?

53
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,380
Ugh!

54
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,640
Hey, then what are you doing here?

55
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,350
Because of my punishment. I'm cleaning.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,510
- Why, why?
- Hurry and go!

57
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,440
Hey, we're debating against the wildflower class.

58
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,890
Right? We uselessly paid the institute.

59
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,950
I feel like we'd win even without receiving the tip in advance.

60
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,480
Those kids, we'd be able to beat them just by opening our mouths.

61
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,910
Oh, I forgot to tell you. My mom said that we would have to pay double the price to get the materials after the debate starts.

62
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,860
Isn't the school crazy? They have to have a limit on getting extra money.

63
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,120
Watch your mouth.

64
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,740
Oh... Sorry.

65
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,770
Money?

66
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,700
Hello, Teacher Son Soo Jeong.

67
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,320
Yang Min Ji. What are you doing here?

68
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,570
Bok Soo and I have something to do at school. You know it, right?

69
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,660
No, I don't know.

70
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,720
Looks like Bok Soo didn't tell you about such things.

71
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,620
Seolsong's 15th Debate Contest Final
Wildflower VS Ivy

72
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,560
Oh, Teacher Son.

73
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,730
How did it turn out to be against the ivy class?

74
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,440
- Student Department Teacher?
- Yes?

75
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,630
You should buy lunch one time.

76
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,300
How did Ivy turn out to be against yours?

77
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,230
They must have passed the preliminaries due to having Yeong Min in that class.

78
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,200
Hey, at least you made it to the finals.

79
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,360
You should be satisfied with that. Don't make kids dream too big.

80
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,920
Teacher Son, you'll probably need to console the kids.

81
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,390
Who are the members again?

82
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,030
Oh Yeong Min, Yoon Seung Woo, and Kang Bok Soo, right?

83
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,320
Yes.

84
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,380
An idiot, a last place, and a returned student.

85
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,530
Wow. The wildflower class members sure are the Avengers.

86
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,220
Yes. They are the Avengers.

87
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,210
If our students do well, watch out.

88
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,050
Well, to be honest, no matter how well they do,

89
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,010
they can't be compared to my kids.

90
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,390
I was scared you guys weren't going to come.

91
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,980
Hey. What kind of contest is this for you to be like that?

92
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,050
Even so, this is my first contest as part of the wildflower class. I want to do well.

93
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,640
Fighting!

94
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,090
Fighting!

95
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,980
We will be starting the final round of Seolsong High's

96
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,920
15th debate contest.

97
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:54,450
The topic is: One's career choice is based on money.

98
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,160
The first speaker who agrees with statement, please arise.

99
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,820
I'm Oh Yeong Min from the wildflower class.

100
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,620
Oh. You made it to be the leader since going to the wildflower class?

101
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,640
You've succeeded, Oh Yeong Min.

102
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,950
The team formation sure is amazing.

103
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,940
The school's last place and the school's oldest student.

104
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,310
Student Lee Chae Min, please keep your manners during the debate.

105
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,730
Ah, okay, Teacher.

106
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,920
I listen well to a pretty person.

107
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,140
Money is an immediate issue, you see.

108
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,830
But the accomplishment or satisfaction you get through your job is a later thing.

109
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,650
People who don't have money nor study well always say that.

110
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,150
Did you leave the ivy class due to lack of money?

111
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,380
What kind of future do those types of kids have?

112
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:56,250
In my opinion, money is already an important value that's established in our society.

113
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,170
A flow that you can't go against.

114
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,060
Therefore, the wildflower class agrees with the idea that money is a criteria

115
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,810
in choosing a career.

116
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,360
Admission before choosing the career path has already ended before first semester.

117
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,610
Yes, that is why I came to see the school's principals in person.

118
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,480
I'd like to continue the transfer with the recommendations through the school's principals.

119
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,460
By the way, Seolsong High is well-established already.

120
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,160
Why do you have to intervene in matters pertaining to a student's transfer?

121
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,570
Of course, I should come here myself when it's for the students.

122
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,310
Because our school focuses on university admissions,

123
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,340
I feel bad that the students who rank low are being left out.

124
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,840
Ah, yes...

125
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,650
Because it's a favor regarding our students, we do plan on providing support funds.

126
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:47,270
Firstly, how about we sponsor Yoomin High by buying you training equipment?

127
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,180
Aigoo, you don't have to.

128
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,470
Well, I mean Yoomin High does have the highest employment rate in the country,

129
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,870
so it's an honor to do it.

130
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:59,150
I'll try to make it so that Seolsong High students can transfer to our school.

131
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,390
Thank you.

132
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,860
- Please eat.
- Okay.

133
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,900
Let's eat.

134
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,190
Next up: the first speaker from the opposite team, please arise.

135
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,610
We, the ivy class team, negate the claim that

136
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,400
job selections are based on money.

137
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,760
Richard Easterlin's paradox emphasized that the rich are not always happy.

138
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,320
As for the hypothesis that the more you earn, the happier you will be,

139
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,120
a lot of research from various countries has proven it to be false.

140
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,900
Firstly, according to data from Korea Industrial Development Institution,

141
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,990
when the young select their jobs,

142
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:49,230
the thing that they prioritize most is stability.

143
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,510
Unlike what you have stated, stability is of greatest priority, not income.

144
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,800
And the second is income, according to research.

145
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,460
Members of the wildflower class team,

146
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:03,160
it seems that you are unable to perform simple fact checks.

147
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,360
Please only comment on what's related to the debate.

148
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:22,630
If there is no special individual comment to be made, we will wrap it up by making a final remark.

149
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,430
According to a Gallup Research opinion poll,

150
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,570
in the last half-century, the country's total production percentage has been continually increasing.

151
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,030
And also individual earnings from jobs have increased as well.

152
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,400
However, the percentage of people's happiness has not increased at all.

153
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,980
So, therefore, money shouldn't be a standard for picking a career.

154
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,090
I will end the final statement for our ivy class team.

155
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,970
Wildflower class team, please make your final statement as well.

156
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,980
I think people get so embarrassed constantly talking about money.

157
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,280
Money is a thing that we all need to survive after all. Isn't that right?

158
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,830
Even if money can be petty and dirty,

159
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,530
some people are anxious about getting canned, so they hang in there with great patience.

160
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,900
And the reason to protect their job is money.

161
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,370
It's not...

162
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,880
It's nothing to be ashamed of at all.

163
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:37,190
Honestly, I'm scared that I might get canned.

164
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:43,570
I'm shaking in my boots because of that stupid thing called money, and it makes me feel miserable.

165
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,890
Some people never have even experienced working for money.

166
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,520
Those punks who were born with silver spoons in their mouths want to take care of everything with money,

167
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,360
but those kids despise money too.

168
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,670
So when you are not paid for your work, that's considered volunteering and not a job.

169
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,490
Someone once said this.

170
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,690
"If you can't buy happiness with money, check if you are lacking the money."

171
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:13,410
No, you are not able to receive adequate pay for your work, so what use is self-realization?

172
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,070
That materialistic jerk. He's so vulgar.

173
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,910
- What?
- A school won't pay you,

174
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,390
so why did you crawl back to here? I don't get it. At your old age.

175
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,410
So embarrassing. Right?

176
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,840
Hey...

177
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,230
Stop.

178
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,460
How is liking money a vulgar thing?

179
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,570
Chae Min, you are the one who is reaping the benefits of money more than anyone.

180
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,880
More than anyone else, you are studying and coming to school with money.

181
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:04,320
Perhaps, was the textbook-type logic you presented, like "self-realization and social volunteering,"

182
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,690
bought with money as well?

183
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,600
Why don't you put your hand on your conscience and swear to yourself.

184
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,040
Self-realization and social welfare volunteer work are also jobs,

185
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,360
but if it's a job where you can't even earn a cent for doing it,

186
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,570
would you select such a job for yourselves?

187
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,670
The measuring stick for picking out a career is based on money.

188
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:36,160
That is it. From wildflower class, my name is Yoon Seung Woo, the final commentator for the debate.

189
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,460
Debate Score Card

190
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,460
Debate Score Card

191
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,120
Debate Score Card

192
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,670
38.9

193
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,750
78

194
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,520
Teacher Park, didn't the score card get switched?

195
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,590
What's up with the scores for the ivy class?

196
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,450
I gave out the points honestly.

197
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,120
This is really important for college admissions.

198
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,720
You should be supporting some capable kids.

199
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,200
How wasteful giving high points to the wildflower class.

200
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,490
Teachers should be fair.

201
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,460
What are you trying to say, Assistant Principal?

202
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,950
We lost?

203
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,500
Why? What's the measuring stick for scoring?

204
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:55,030
The debating competition is about teaching to listen courteously to what others have to say and respect for others.

205
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:59,560
You mocked other people's opinions and acted as if you were superior in the debate.

206
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,570
You mistook it.

207
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,660
And just reading out loud from already printed sources has nothing to do with the art of debating.

208
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,490
The wildflower class team lacked in many areas and was also a bit clumsy,

209
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,090
but they expressed their own opinions from the heart and also minded their manners.

210
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,580
That's the reason for this particular result.

211
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:25,160
I'm going to make an official complaint about this.

212
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,150
You should ask yourself what that complaint is exactly.

213
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,970
See if you are ashamed of your own self.

214
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,680
The 15th Annual Seolsong High School Debate Competition

215
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,960
Teacher, you should lower your temper. You are leading a tiring life.

216
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,420
What, kid? I didn't say anything wrong over there.

217
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,040
Of course, you don't ever say anything that's wrong.

218
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,660
Either way, you did well.

219
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,690
You have to do things that are troublesome and the things that you don't like from time to time.

220
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,850
Even if you are not capable, do the best you can. That's what school should be about.

221
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,420
I know, right?

222
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,170
Teacher, you should still look out for yourself. Sometimes I think you are worse than I can ever be.

223
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,500
I bet you are going to hear an earful this time.

224
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,110
I'm not scared of any of that.

225
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,690
Oh, the smell of trash.

226
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,200
The nasty foul smell is wreaking all over the place.

227
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,250
Who's the one that got kicked in the ass by trash, eh?

228
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,260
What is the worst student of the whole school saying, huh?

229
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,540
You should try to do something about that dumb blockhead of yours.

230
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,770
Are you really that proud of doing so well in school?

231
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,520
You think you are some hotshot or what?

232
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,830
Hey, it seems like you have no idea at all, but Chae Min is number one in the whole school.

233
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,860
Oh, really?

234
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,970
Let's go.

235
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,040
Oh, Mr. Elder! It seems like this old man really does act his age.

236
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,090
Oppa, I'm falling in love with you today.

237
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,960
As expected, you're cool.

238
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,690
So annoying. Go away.

239
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,150
You know you like it.

240
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,700
- How does it feel to kick the ivy class in the butt?
- Don't do that.

241
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,850
Can you say a word?

242
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,470
Good.

243
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,460
Are you really that happy about winning the debate competition?

244
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,280
I just like seeing my students happy.

245
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,500
I wonder why I feel so good seeing all the kids smile like that.

246
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,850
I remember Teacher Park telling us that he felt full just by looking at us smile once.

247
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:18,840
I don't know about feeling full, but I do want to make the kids laugh more.

248
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,360
Me too.

249
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:28,080
I also want you to smile more.

250
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,110
I feel like we are back in high school being like this.

251
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,560
But I am currently a student, after all.

252
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,590
I like school, Soo Jeong.

253
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,610
Me too.

254
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,220
I like school because you are here.

255
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,310
No, I can't! We can't do this until you graduate!

256
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,960
What is it that you can't do?

257
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,340
- Huh?
- I want to know what can't you do.

258
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,110
I'm so curious now.

259
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,580
Seriously, man.

260
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,390
You go now. I said, go!

261
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,200
My goodness.

262
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,920
Oh yeah, that's right. Okay, let's see...

263
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:35,570
What is the thing that you need to do with Yang Min Ji at the school anyway?

264
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,360
Why aren't you telling me?

265
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,910
- Son Soo Jeong.
- Yeah?

266
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,780
Are you being jealous right now?

267
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,660
No, I'm not!

268
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,190
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

269
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,290
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not.

270
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,950
Yeah, you are.

271
00:20:55,050 --> 00:21:02,570
Hey, Soo Jeong, related to that issue, there is something that you need to know.

272
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,760
What do you mean student record corruption? That doesn't make any sense.

273
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,960
That nonsense is happening at Seolsong High right now.

274
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,420
Starting an in-class competition is dealt with using money.

275
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,280
I overheard No Woo Hyeon and Lee Chae Min talking about it.

276
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,910
In-class competition has increased, but I had no idea that starting one had such a problem.

277
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:22,250
So are you saying that ivy class parents start such a competition by paying money? No way.

278
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,580
That's not all.

279
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,640
Also, private college admission consulting companies would pay the school

280
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,920
to get the theme ahead of time, and then they tip the students with the best answers.

281
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,370
You know the debate competition that we just had, right? The kids from the ivy class

282
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:39,740
had both the exemplary answers for opposing and approval questions. I verified and confirmed it.

283
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,210
Take a look.

284
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,090
Debate competition play-off

285
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,620
Selection

286
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,860
Wow, are they totally insane or what?!

287
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,790
This is so important to college entrance for goodness sake! How could they?!

288
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,040
- What?
- I love it when Son Soo Jeong swears.

289
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,840
You little! Get out and do your lovey-dovey thing.

290
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,330
You went to school to get revenge and just ended up doing nothing but dating. And now you have to do this at work?

291
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,580
As the CEO here, I would like to prohibit dating at work.

292
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,970
Get out.

293
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,360
Thank you. Let's go.

294
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,010
Alright.

295
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,590
CEO, are we not allowed to date a coworker?

296
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,630
It's prohibited.

297
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,130
Then what do we do?

298
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,830
Huh?

299
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:34,460
The issue of dealing with the debate contest is already causing a lot of fuss among ivy class' parents.

300
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,500
What did you do for the results to come out like this?

301
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,660
Teacher Park is just so uptight and hard to get around.

302
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,770
Nothing seems to work on him. I'm in a very difficult situation here.

303
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,410
Just modify the ivy class score report first.

304
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,650
Announce that there was a mistake in judging, and thus, there was a reevaluation.

305
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,230
Order Teacher Park Dong Joo to submit his suspension forms.

306
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,090
He won't stand by it.

307
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,480
That's what I wish for.

308
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,210
Correcting the winners of the debate competition

309
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,500
After reevaluating, we have concluded that some of the judges made an error in their scores.

310
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,060
The judge responsible for this is subject to suspension, and the winning team has been changed to the ivy class.

311
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,810
Ivy Class

312
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,540
Don't get worked up. You can't.

313
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,670
Revenge is about rationality and coldness.

314
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,290
You don't know that?

315
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,870
This is the evidence that we need.

316
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,460
Kang Bok Soo, do as planned.

317
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,300
Are you kidding? We totally beat the ivy kids!

318
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,930
We did. And that's why they don't like it!

319
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,640
I heard something from the elder yesterday.

320
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,950
The ivy kids give money to the school.

321
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,190
They give money?

322
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,460
What?

323
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,720
You scared me. When did you come?

324
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,790
Is that true?

325
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,800
This sort of thing is done just to write something on the ivy kids' transcripts.

326
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,600
I never paid.

327
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,740
Not you, but your mother probably.

328
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,730
Eat this and calm down.

329
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,210
Don't spit on your own face.

330
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,220
How could I have made a mistake?

331
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,980
I did it precisely and fairly.

332
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,690
How can the school overstep on a teacher's exclusive right?

333
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,580
So why would you give the points like that?

334
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,820
Your markings are wrong.

335
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,050
You don't know that you're not supposed to be giving points like that?

336
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,790
Are you doing this because you really don't know?

337
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,530
I, this... I will formally discuss this with the director.

338
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,770
Teacher Park, you're so exuberant even at your age.

339
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,460
How about you quit and just retire to be a farmer?

340
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,140
With the strength you use to hold on to this place, do something more worthwhile,

341
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,660
because this school will still do well without you!

342
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,160
Bok Soo, Teacher Park is in trouble.

343
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,500
Right now, he's going to argue with Oh Se Ho.

344
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,160
I will go inside the director's office.

345
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,630
No, Teacher Son, I will take care of this.

346
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,250
This is about my class.

347
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,490
The wildflower class students are my kids.

348
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,600
Instead of the one who judged, I think that it is right for me, the teacher in charge,

349
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,560
to complain officially.

350
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,920
Let's talk calmly.

351
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,530
With logic. Don't panic or get emotional.

352
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,920
You can do it, Son Soo Jeong.

353
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,080
You bast***!

354
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,470
Are you done? Shall I give you some tea?

355
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,390
Director, please correct your ridiculous decision.

356
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:45,090
You know the wildflower class won fair and square.

357
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,140
Is it really fair and square if the results changed due to one person's judging criteria?

358
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,240
But it's fair and just to change the results

359
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,620
in order to let the pre-decided kids win?

360
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,750
You're saying some dangerous words without any evidence.

361
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,630
You know it's the truth.

362
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,030
Is teaching about unfairness your educational philosophy?

363
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,630
You said you were going to establish justice at Seolsong High.

364
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,550
You told me to watch for it!

365
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:16,620
I'm going to catch everything that's wrong at Seolsong High.

366
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,480
Soo Jeong, are you in the position to be so confident in front of me?

367
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,350
What about Kim Myeong Ho? What'd you do that you're like this to me?

368
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,220
Okay, fine. What about you? Do you have no wrongs regarding Kim Myeong Ho?

369
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,200
Where did all the money go? Isn't it to you or your mother?

370
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,220
Yeah, that's why we're accomplices.

371
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,400
If we're on the same boat, do you think it's right for you to dislike me like this?

372
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,090
Don't mess with the kids.

373
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,770
Okay fine, because of that pathetic money,

374
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,090
I sold my conscience and am living without honor,

375
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:01,760
but if you mess with the kids, you and I both are going to die.

376
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,150
I will never die alone.

377
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,990
No.

378
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:16,080
You tell me to not mess with the kids nor Kang Bok Soo. Then...

379
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,230
What do I do?

380
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,470
I... I myself did wrong,

381
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,790
so I'm okay if things like this happen to me, but the kids did no wrong.

382
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:33,900
You know the most that Kang Bok Soo did nothing wrong, you evil jerk!

383
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:43,610
You should know that the more you do this, the more I want to make Kang Bok Soo...

384
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,760
disappear.

385
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,130
Try it, you psycho.

386
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,270
Because I'll show you who's crazier.

387
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,620
Counseling Room

388
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,240
What are you doing not going home at this time?

389
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,900
I came after hearing from Teacher Park.

390
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,930
Are you okay?

391
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:51,400
Our Bok Soo, you look so good in a uniform.

392
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,780
I want to help you graduate.

393
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,460
Don't worry.

394
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,880
I'm going to graduate with my own will.

395
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,970
So you have to give me that diploma.

396
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,990
What do I do?

397
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,900
I want to confidently confront Oh Se Ho,

398
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,780
but because of my wrongdoings, I can't proudly fight him.

399
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,890
I really lived wrongly.

400
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,190
Counseling Room

401
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:26,390
My Strange Hero

402
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,150
This isn't a school, it's a corporation.

403
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,620
Is this all true?

404
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,730
Teacher Park wrote a letter to the Board of Education?

405
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,990
Don't you dare ruin my school. Get out this instant!

406
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,600
This is my school right now.

407
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,320
If you're going to kick me out, wait.

408
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,730
What do I do? I'm a teacher, so what do I do?

409
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,820
Don't worry. I'll sort it out. Trust me.

410
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,420
Make him transfer by saying that he was violent.

411
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,730
All of a sudden, doing this...

412
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,250
I got rejected.

413
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,520
Since you've rejected our good will,

414
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,140
we'll have no choice but to go with the stronger method.

415
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,550
Umbrella. Don't you have an umbrella?

416
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,620
Are you crazy? This is a school. You're wearing a uniform right now—

417
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,220
Is the uniform the problem?

418
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,550
Are you confident you won't hurt her?

419
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,230
I will never leave her alone.

420
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,290
I want to become a teacher like you.

421
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,760
First, we need Teacher Park.

422
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,060
I am the evidence that your education philosophy is a failure, Teacher Park.

423
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:21,190
As the school's director, I am now firing Teacher Park Dong Joon.
