1
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,080
Hey, what are you doing?

2
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,730
I'm going to school. I still look awesome in the uniform, right?

3
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,830
Why are you going to school?

4
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,630
Revenge. There's an old saying,

5
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,050
"In order to catch a tiger, you must go to the fox den."

6
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,270
I'm going to play along with their tricks once. I'm heading to school.

7
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,170
I'll be back.

8
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,050
Why is he like that?

9
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:39,250
No. Why does he need to go to a fox den to catch a tiger? Is it right?

10
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,190
Hey, Kang Bok Soo!

11
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,750
Hey, isn't he awesome?

12
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,200
- What?
- Unbelievable.

13
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,000
If there were face Olympics, he'd win a gold medal.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,060
He'd be the winner of five gold medals!

15
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,220
Who is that?

16
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,090
Hey, I got wind of some rumors about him. Listen up.

17
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,700
What is it?

18
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,380
That guy is a senior in our school.

19
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,140
- Senior?
- So what?

20
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,410
Heol! You don't know anything about the legend of Seolsong High?

21
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,020
Listen carefully because this is 100% a fact.

22
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,450
Back then, about nine years ago, the category one storm called Gojira was

23
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,860
passing by our nation.

24
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,340
Because of health reasons, a girl returned to school after a year.

25
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,660
That girl was quite pretty.

26
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,120
Kind of like Son Ye Jin (Korean actress).

27
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,380
- Son Ye Jin? Is that true?
- You scared me!

28
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,980
- Don't interrupt me!
- Hurry up.

29
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,920
Around that time, a troublemaker who was stalking that girl cornered her.

30
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,320
As soon as he heard the news of her return,

31
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,090
he brought his members and came to our school.

32
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,760
They all surrounded her when she was heading home.

33
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,180
That weak girl was so scared and felt like she would pass out at any moment.

34
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,070
The desperate young girl begged for help from the other kids.

35
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,740
No matter how much she cried, others ignored her and passed by.

36
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,820
Wait. Was there no one at school when it was right after school let out?

37
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,430
Come on! What is wrong with you?

38
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,660
I'm just curious— I almost hit you.

39
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,220
At the very moment when the gang leader was about to drag the beautiful girl away,

40
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,170
this guy appeared and first made his way to the beautiful girl.

41
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,270
But then...

42
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,670
he got hurt.

43
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,960
Blood.

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,750
He got a scratch on that handsome face.

45
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,150
He couldn't forgive himself for that.

46
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,140
He slowly spoke.

47
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:54,360
"If you face a rock in your way as you're walking, the weak will call it an obstacle,

48
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,360
but the strong will call it a stepping stone."

49
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,360
So what happened to the Son Ye Jin girl?

50
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,370
Write a novel! A novel! Man.

51
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,990
Isn't that Kang Bok Soo?

52
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,880
Class 2-3 (Second year, Third Room) Watermelon group

53
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,660
Is he wearing our school uniform?

54
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,440
U-Uncle?

55
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,600
Why is my uncle here?

56
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,810
I will make you guys regret making me return.

57
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,160
Get inside. You insolent, you—

58
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,960
- What?
- Stay right there, you rascal.

59
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,060
You're the punk who jumped over the wall, aren't you?

60
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,350
Pardon? Just a minute, Teach— Ouch!

61
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,480
- Ouch! Wait! Wait! Wait!
- Where is your name tag?

62
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,000
This... Hey! Your hair! Look at your hair style!

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,770
- Hey! Your pants are about to burst! Come here.
- Ouch! Teacher!

64
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,370
This timing is unbelievable.

65
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,980
That jerk really came just because he was called.

66
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,910
It turned out well. Let's start according to my instructions.

67
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,640
Secretary Kim, get it ready.

68
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,530
Yes, sir.

69
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,360
You should be thanking me for doing this, huh?

70
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,500
You seem to live without thinking things through just because your face is handsome, but you'll regret it one day—

71
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,490
Teacher Kim, let him go. Starting today, he is a returning student.

72
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,260
Teacher Kim, you know him too, right? He's Kang Bok Soo.

73
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,630
Hardheaded Kang Bok Soo!

74
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,520
You're getting old. You can't recognize your student. I'm returning to school!

75
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,990
Why did you return to school?

76
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,420
Enough, let's hurry. Today is a very important day.

77
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,690
Where are we going?

78
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,040
Do well, you rascal, and don't cause a problem.

79
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,970
Do what well?

80
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,340
Announcement of Seolsong High New Director
Press Conference

81
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,970
Oh, Kang Bok Soo.

82
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,990
It's Kang Bok Soo!

83
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,520
Please give a statement.

84
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,900
Seolsong High—Press Conference—New Director—Announcement

85
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,620
What is your reason for deciding to return to school?

86
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,580
There's a lot of public interest in you. Please make a comment!

87
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,500
What is the reason why you have returned?

88
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,160
Please make a statement.

89
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,790
Why did you return?

90
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,370
Mr. Kang Bok Soo!

91
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,640
- Hey! Mr. Kang Bok Soo!
- Why did you return?

92
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:25,480
At this time, the new director, Oh Se Ho, will make a statement.

93
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,560
Hello. To all the students and administration staff,

94
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,490
I am the new director, Oh Se Ho.

95
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,080
I stand here today with a heavy heart

96
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,490
because Seolsong had been chasing the wrong direction by focusing the on college education exam

97
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,390
without caring about students' individual interests and talents.

98
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:01,870
It was true. At last, it drove one of our students to the edge of life,

99
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,890
but he was dramatically saved.

100
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,040
Now as a new director, I will discontinue old practices

101
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,350
and create an innovative school that is more suitable for the future.

102
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,000
I am committed to reform. We are starting the commitment to that reform now.

103
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,160
Furthermore, students whom Seolsong could not take good care of before,

104
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,700
like Mr. Kang Bok Soo, will be encouraged to return.

105
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,480
It will be our first step

106
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,930
to exercise our new education principle.

107
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,250
So you have plotted Mr. Kang Bok Soo's return?

108
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,420
Mr. Kang Bok Soo, why did you drop out of school?

109
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,270
Aren't you just trying to cover up the issue with this instead of changing your school's systems?

110
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,740
Is Kang Bok Soo influential enough to cover up our school's issues?

111
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,750
Could you two please look to the front for pictures?

112
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,800
Smile for us, please!

113
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,160
Oh my. Looks like I've seen too many dirty things all this time.

114
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,440
I feel like my eyes are being cleansed just by looking at them.

115
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,710
We're so lucky to be able to see them together like this.

116
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,960
Which of the two do you like?

117
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,740
The fierce wild horse or the smart gentleman from a rich family?

118
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,880
I have someone that I like.

119
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,780
Kang Bok Soo's gaze is alive.

120
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:10,700
What incident made him quit school?

121
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,830
Teacher Park, you said you were a homeroom teacher back then.

122
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,510
Why did Kang Bok Soo drop out of school?

123
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,570
Look, you were bound to come back.

124
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,310
You've been cooking up hard.

125
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,700
What do you mean "working hard"? I'm not the one going back to school.

126
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,740
It won't be long. Until then, just diligently attend school.

127
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,460
You should go back down now.

128
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,220
Why? I should speak too.

129
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,380
Hello, I am Kang Bok Soo. Oh Se Ho—

130
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:03,370
No, the director made it sound like he allowed my return with a big heart.

131
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,780
But that's not the case. Yeah. Originally, according to the education law,

132
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,220
if a person who was expelled or dropped out of school

133
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,100
wants to return to school,

134
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:21,000
he will be allowed to be readmitted so long as there are no special reasons against said readmission.

135
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,700
What this means is

136
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,800
as long as the student wants to, the school has to accept him.

137
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,370
Which means I am here by my own will.

138
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,300
Anyway, because I have recovered the opportunity to learn,

139
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,890
I, Kang Bok Soo, will live diligently.

140
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,400
Awesome!

141
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,430
He's a complete nutcase.

142
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,470
Hey. Everyone, look here.

143
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,690
Why are you making so much ruckus about his appearance?

144
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:09,510
Well... I would like to begin by talking about the new director's instruction.

145
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,010
Beginning today, we're starting a new class.

146
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,880
We'll call it the "wildflower class" for now.

147
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,150
This class will consist of the troublemakers we picked out from other classes, so

148
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:30,710
the teachers should guide the rest of the students well and make sure they're not upset about it.

149
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,950
Wait, are you trying to make the discrimination worse?

150
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,970
It's customization, not discrimination.

151
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,210
Se Ho!

152
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,980
Director, this is a clear violation of rights.

153
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,060
Teacher Park!

154
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,410
Teacher Park.

155
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,240
How many students stay awake during your classes?

156
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,960
We must acknowledge the differences in the students' level of studies,

157
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,070
their focuses, and their interests.

158
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,900
Forcing students to meet the standard in the excuse of equality

159
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,360
is violence towards those students who lag behind.

160
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,640
Educating students according to their level of studies as a form of equality

161
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,370
is my educational philosophy.

162
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,890
Discrimination is your educational philosophy?

163
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,430
Where is Teacher Son Soo Jeong?

164
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,490
Yes.

165
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,630
The organization has decided to appoint you as a full-time teacher from now.

166
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,040
I am really thankful for the Oh Yeong Min incident.

167
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,790
No... So suddenly...

168
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,470
But Kang Bok Soo...

169
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,940
- Full-time teacher?
- Teacher Son.

170
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,830
Attention everyone. Let's give her a round of applause.

171
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,410
You're doing this because you like it, right?

172
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,380
Excuse me, Director.

173
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,140
Yes, Teacher Son.

174
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,600
You can go first.

175
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,570
That... Kang Bok Soo's readmission...

176
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,180
He came before I told him to come,

177
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,190
so I don't think this is right.

178
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,150
Since I didn't bring Kang Bok Soo—

179
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,370
Oh, about that?

180
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,160
You didn't become a full-time teacher because of that.

181
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,940
Your class evaluation points were the highest for the past three years,

182
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,300
and you even formally took the full-time teacher exam.

183
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,440
I saw that you weren't appointed many times over dubious reasons.

184
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,620
Even if it's now, consider it a relief that you were able to do it.

185
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,770
From now on, I'm going to catch everything that's wrong with Seolsong High.

186
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,810
You're fully qualified.

187
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,450
Congratulations.

188
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,240
Okay.

189
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,220
I'm fully qualified.

190
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,760
The world is finally working in order.

191
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,660
What's this? It says we're in the wildflower class.

192
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,670
Are they gathering outsiders or what?

193
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,140
I like the name. A natural nature. It's nice.

194
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,860
You're saying you like natural beauty but why are you wearing full makeup?

195
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,930
You should do it.

196
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,200
I have been.

197
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,300
What's this? Kang In Ho is also in the wild flower class.

198
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,980
Aigoo. We must be fated.

199
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,660
So are we relearning all the basics again?

200
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,090
Are you stupid? They're basically saying they're giving up on us.

201
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,500
So there is no way to change it. I'll keep on sleeping; you'll keep on doing your makeup.

202
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,940
Our In Ho can keep on being our shuttle (errand boy).

203
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,470
Go and study.

204
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,150
Grasshopper - Kim Myeong Ho - 50 million won

205
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,730
50 million won

206
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,940
Congrats, Teacher Son.

207
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,980
From me, too, since we are all now full-time teachers.

208
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,570
Right, consider me a sister.

209
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,380
But they'll hire more contract teachers, right?

210
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,180
There are no openings. No openings!

211
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,700
Teacher Son.

212
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,600
Since I'm busy I will congratulate you later.

213
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,680
Here's your attendance book.

214
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,900
You'll be the homeroom teacher for the newly created wildflower class.

215
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,530
Excuse me. Me?

216
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,890
But you said that's the class full of troublemakers. It's my first day as a full-time teacher!

217
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,930
That's why you start from the bottom.

218
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,000
What are you doing not taking it?

219
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,240
Ah, wait, wait, wait!

220
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,430
One person is missing.

221
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,690
What, who is it?

222
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,150
Vice Principal!

223
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,840
Why? It's because I'm busy. I'll reprint it for you later.

224
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,700
Kang Bok Soo is in the counseling room, so you should go and take him to the classroom.

225
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,090
- Pardon?
- You should guide him to the wildflower class.

226
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,600
Get his signature too.

227
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,390
List of students: Kang Bok Soo

228
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:33,540
Kang Bok Soo, please disappear from my life.

229
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,770
This is tough.

230
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,830
Teacher Son Soo Jeong, thank you.

231
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,620
God Soo Jeong, when did you become so pretty?

232
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,770
Well, Son Soo Jeong

233
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,180
has been pretty since she was young.

234
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,230
What am I saying? I must be crazy.

235
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,090
Pretty, my foot.

236
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,230
Beauties die young.

237
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,640
Right, he's a student and I'm a teacher.

238
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,190
How are you so nervous?

239
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,000
You must act well as a teacher. You seem to be popular.

240
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,380
Why did you come? I told you not to.

241
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,670
Come on. I feel disappointed if you say it like that.

242
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:10,260
Thanks to me, you became a full time teacher even after losing ₩50 million. Isn't that so?

243
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,720
News travels fast.

244
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,350
But I didn't become a full-time teacher because of you.

245
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,750
It already worked out? Oh Se Ho is pretty fast.

246
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,480
Do you even know how hard I worked?

247
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,630
With my lesson evaluations and passing the exam, I deserved to be a full-time teacher.

248
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,580
If so, why couldn't you be one before, even after spending ₩50 million?

249
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,500
How odd?

250
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,730
What do you want from me?

251
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,070
What I want? Admit that you tried to buy your position with ₩50 million

252
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:55,230
and that you are not qualified to be a teacher.

253
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,310
What if I can't do that?

254
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,470
Then I will help you until you can admit it.

255
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,160
Who do you think you are? Why are you doing this to me when you've just appeared after nine years?

256
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,220
That's what I want to ask you. Why did you do that to me then?

257
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,500
But you— to me—

258
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,290
I thought there was something between us.

259
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,850
You and me what. What was between us?

260
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,010
How do I put it?

261
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:41,620
I thought that there was a lot more between us.

262
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,850
But the more I talk to you about it, I realize that there was nothing.

263
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,540
Hey Son Soo Jeong, do you know?

264
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,150
I want to let you know that things that are not genuine don't last.

265
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,890
You are right. Things that are not genuine don't last.

266
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,390
Isn't this why we are both like this right now?

267
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,920
Do you think you would've done that to me if you were really sincere towards me, Kang Bok Soo?

268
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,710
What do you mean?

269
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,330
I have no time to talk to you about what happened a long time ago.

270
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,030
Go ahead and just fill this out for me.

271
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,040
Seolsong High School Readmission Application

272
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,090
Hey, Son Soo Jeong!

273
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,150
What should I put down for taking time off from school?

274
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,980
I thought you would know the answer to that.

275
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,020
I really don't have any idea why I had to quit school in the first place.

276
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,320
Why are you asking me that?

277
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:41,250
You are still the same as ever when it comes to not having a solution to anything.

278
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,470
And besides, I'm a teacher here.

279
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,600
So don't talk so casually to me.

280
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,960
Yes, Teacher Son Soo Jeong.

281
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,390
Please enter. Let's go inside now.

282
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,660
Hey kids, this is nothing bad at all, I'm telling you.

283
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,880
We are going to have a class that's perfect for your needs.

284
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,710
Isn't it great that you can be with your close friends? Isn't that right?

285
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,210
So don't take this so seriously.

286
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,840
You can't write an anonymous letter to the Department of Education or anything, okay?

287
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,260
Let's hurry up and prepare for class, alright?

288
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,020
Fighting (cheering you on)!

289
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,610
Fighting.

290
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,260
Wildflower class

291
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,650
Nothing has changed here.

292
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,860
This brings back past memories. Don't you think so?

293
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,060
Wildflower Class

294
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,410
This is the wildflower class, a newly made class for troublemake—

295
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,990
What I meant was a class for kids with special needs.

296
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,230
I am the homeroom teacher for this class.

297
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,290
I am relieved since I know at least one person in this class.

298
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:06,080
Wildflower class, huh? Does this mean that we students should survive despite harsh conditions?

299
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,250
Wildflower class. What a cute name.

300
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,270
He is still the same as ever when it comes to being so positive for no good reason.

301
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,230
Bok Soo Oppa!

302
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,780
Quiet!

303
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,730
As you all know, my name is Son Soo Jeong,

304
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,980
and I'm the homeroom teacher of this newly established classroom.

305
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,570
Nice to meet you all.

306
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,850
Teacher, did you get in trouble?

307
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,170
How in the world did you end up being in a classroom, managing kids that are delinquents?

308
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,920
Hey, she's probably playing the role of a person that does trash recycling.

309
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,950
Why don't you guys use those good brains of yours for things that are more productive?

310
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,260
You aren't going to deny it and lie to us anymore?

311
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,410
This is why I like the God-like Soo Jeong.}

312
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,390
There's nothing fake about you, and you are not really affectionate with us either.

313
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,250
Let's get to know each other slowly but surely.

314
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,260
We have a returning student. Everyone here knows who he is, right?

315
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,300
Brave citizen Kang Bok Soo!

316
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,390
Kang Bok Soo, say hello to the class.

317
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:24,710
Hi, my name is Kang Bok Soo. Nice to meet you all.

318
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,990
Nice to meet you too, Kang Bok Soo.

319
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,050
Hi, my name is Oh Sae Ho. Nice to meet you all.

320
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:39,010
Do you guys hear it? The voice of the average male looks going up?

321
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,020
He has a different kind of attraction compared to Bok Soo. Hello there.

322
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,950
Hey, do you want to die? How dare you compare him to Bok Soo?

323
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,770
Quiet, kids.

324
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,890
Class President, you should be the one showing the new student around the school.

325
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,930
Me! Teacher, me! Me! Me!

326
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,590
Why you?!

327
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,540
I want to be the one giving him a tour of the school.

328
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,280
You just take a seat, boy.

329
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,530
No, sir. I will, I mean... What's his name? Oh Se...

330
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,070
Ho... I would like to be the one giving him the tour of the school.

331
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,350
That's the cafeteria over there.

332
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,310
Let's hurry it up.

333
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,450
That place over there is the library. I think that would be the place you might enjoy.

334
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,310
I don't know too much about it since I've never been there.

335
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,230
Anyway...

336
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,820
I think this is a good enough tour of the school.

337
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,390
- Hey, Oh Sae Oh.
- It's Oh Sae Ho.

338
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,880
How about we give you the nickname Oh Sae Yo to make it more friendly and intimate?

339
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,990
Of course, that shouldn't be all that important.

340
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,080
Hey, have you ever been in love?

341
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,120
In love?

342
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,550
Don't look. Don't look.

343
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,510
I got caught because of you! Why are you looking at her?!

344
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,260
Hey, Oh Sae Ho.

345
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,550
You are such an unfortunate guy since you transferred over here a day before an exam and all.

346
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,140
Why? I love taking exams.

347
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,840
It's the most fair game in the world.

348
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,490
Alright man. Fighting!

349
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,470
Fighting.

350
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,290
Student report card

351
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,620
Rank 2 out of 300

352
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,160
Class President, you got number one?!

353
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,160
I got last place! I got 300th place!

354
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,660
Oh, wait a minute. If this is the case, does this mean we will be pairing up again?

355
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,790
Can I have this?

356
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,700
- Thanks.
- Ta-da!

357
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,550
Hey, why do you keep staring at me?

358
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:04,320
I know, right? I wonder why I keep staring at you.

359
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,590
Well then, who should be the class president?

360
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,050
Seung Woo?

361
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,890
Teacher, why should I be your lackey?

362
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:26,510
Alright then, any volunteers?

363
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:30,050
Hey kids, you do realize that a class president gets extra points, right?

364
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:34,090
If there are no volunteers, should I pick someone to be one?

365
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,190
Teacher, I didn't think that you would be so totally authoritative.

366
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,860
Then I'm going to use my authoritative rights to appoint you as the class president.

367
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,300
No, I don't want to!

368
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,050
I'm going to put in an official complaint saying that this is distracting me from my studies.

369
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,790
Hey, you silly So Ra, let's not be so delusional, shall we?

370
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,140
Then who wants to be the class president? According to the school rules, we do need to have a class president.

371
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,760
Just pick anyone, Teacher.

372
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,330
Okay then, should we be fair and pick someone in alphabetical order?

373
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,190
Kang Bok...

374
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:07,030
Soo... is a returning student and also needs time to adapt to the new environment,

375
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:10,040
so the next one will be Kang In Ho. Where's In Ho?

376
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,290
Kang In Ho.

377
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,320
Kang Bok Soo, what's wrong?

378
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,250
Kang Bok Soo!

379
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,230
Kang Bok Soo!

380
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,880
In Ho, what do you think of the idea of being the class president?

381
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,050
I-I don't really want to.

382
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,120
I-I r-really don't want to.

383
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,120
Our dear In Ho is so cute, my goodness.

384
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,190
Me!

385
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:05,330
I would like to be the class president.

386
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,460
Well, our class president will be that elderly man then. Okay?

387
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,610
Alright!

388
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:25,800
Alright. Well then, the class president for our class will be Kang Bok Soo.

389
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,470
Well, see you later, kids.

390
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,730
Hey, come out.

391
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,860
Our In Ho here is really busy trying to level up on his game.

392
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,400
He plays the game for me during breaks and during night class,

393
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,850
and he is a nice kid for doing that for me. So what do you need from someone like him?

394
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,990
So this is a game that he played for you now? But why?

395
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,350
Leveling up is too difficult, and I would have to constantly have my phone in my hand too.

396
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:07,470
I kind of have bad fingers, so he is willing to do it for me since he wants to help me out.

397
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,460
Come out.

398
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,390
What's up with this?
