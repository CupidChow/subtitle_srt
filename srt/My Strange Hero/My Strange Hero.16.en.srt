1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,640
Kang Bok Soo.

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,690
What is he going to do if this catches on fire?

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,140
Hey, wait! wait! Son Soo Jeong!

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,370
Hey, I'm trying to create a romantic atmosphere here, for crying out loud.

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,380
But you're putting them out?

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,920
Geez, I can't help you.

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,150
"Be careful with fire during the winter season." (Public warning during winter season)

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,090
Don't you know it? How many candle lights are there now for heaven's sake? It's dangerous you know.

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,970
I don't know.

10
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,600
I was thinking of buying a new one that's better,

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,720
but I thought it would be better to just start out with this.

12
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,370
Hey Kang Bok Soo, don't you think this is a bit traditional?

13
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,370
At this rate, you're going to get on your knees and propose to me or something.

14
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,790
That ring

15
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,870
is something that

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,360
I couldn't give you nine years ago.

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,090
My heart is kind of like that ring.

18
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,620
There's nothing really special and it just looks like an average thing.

19
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,070
But I always kept it exactly as it was.

20
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,540
Just like that ring there, I have kept my feelings towards you.

21
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,630
Son Soo Jeong.

22
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,360
Would you like to make my dream come true?

23
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,170
To be Son Soo Jeong's boyfriend. Please let me be just that.

24
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,550
Hey, it doesn't fit.

25
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,390
How weird. I thought I got the size right.

26
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,360
Hey, did you gain weight?!

27
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,710
Fine, I did.

28
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,540
No, never mind. I will buy you a hundred of these.

29
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,270
No, never mind.

30
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,030
I like this the best.

31
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,960
♫ The breeze that passed by last winter  ♫

32
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,280
Thank you, Bok Soo.

33
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:20,270
I will never lose the heart that you gave me from now on.

34
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,870
♫ The forgotten memories bloom like a flower  ♫

35
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,820
♫ The forgotten memories bloom like a flower  ♫

36
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,450
Isn't it pretty?

37
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,030
♫ My heart that was dried up after you left ♫

38
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,050
- Now, there are hundreds of them.
- Yes, there are hundreds now.

39
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,000
♫ Is fluttering again ♫

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,070
♫ Love that comes to each of my days  ♫

41
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,430
♫ I’m afraid that love will leave me ♫

42
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,760
Oh, right, right! I prepared and planned our dating route for tonight.

43
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,790
What is it?

44
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,000
We'll be going to all these tasty restaurants one by one like dojo destroyers.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,710
- What do you think?
- I like it.

46
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,140
- Deal?
- Deal.

47
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,840
♫ Will you stop right there?  ♫

48
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,980
♫ Love keeps entering me  ♫

49
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,880
What? What?

50
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,080
Hey...

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,650
What is it?

52
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,680
That's So Ra and Do Hyeon over there.

53
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,020
There's going to be an exam tomorrow, but they are not at home studying.

54
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,660
Hey, I kind of like this because there's a sense of thrill to it.

55
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,080
Hey, if we have to go through another thrilling moment, I'm going to get a heart attack.

56
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,240
Don't wear your uniform on our dates.

57
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,260
When we are at school, stay more than one meter away from me. You got that?

58
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:14,100
Excuse me, Teacher, I don't see In Ho here.

59
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,510
- In Ho? You mean Kang In Ho from the wildflower class?
- Yes, sir.

60
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,880
No, I mean Kang In Ho from the ivy class.

61
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,450
We don't have a Kang In Ho in our class.

62
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,750
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I think you are mistaken.

63
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,950
This is the ivy class.

64
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,930
In Ho probably is in the wildflower class taking an exam.

65
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,730
Quiet.

66
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,560
In Ho...

67
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,260
What the?

68
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,860
- M-M-Mom.
- Ma'am.

69
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,440
How could you do this? How could you do this to me?

70
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,590
How long were you going to fool me for?

71
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,030
Ivy class?

72
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,590
Go die. Why don't you just rather go die, you punk!?

73
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,540
Just go die!

74
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,360
Sis, wait, wait! Stop this. The other kids are watching.

75
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,670
Let go. Won't you let go?

76
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,860
I'm going to die with this punk today.

77
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,620
I worked so hard to raise you!

78
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,650
- Kang In Ho!
- Kang In Ho!

79
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,360
Sis, wait!

80
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,890
Just let go and calm down.

81
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,410
Why didn't you tell me?

82
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,490
You should've told me about the kid's condition as his uncle.

83
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,980
Was it fun just watching because it wasn't your business?

84
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,370
You are no different.

85
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,470
If Kang In Ho's mom is the elder's big sister, then...

86
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,080
He is the boy's uncle.

87
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,860
The beautiful memory of making the elder's nephew the bread errand boy, do you remember?

88
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,360
Award

89
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,700
Award

90
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,370
What's going on here?

91
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,230
Mom.

92
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,660
- Mom.
- What's wrong?

93
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,350
How about we go get something simple like ramen and kimbap?

94
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,330
I want meat. You are so weak because you don't eat a hefty meal.

95
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,070
Oh my, could it be that you are actually worried about me?

96
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,940
Oh my, what are you saying?

97
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,630
My taste buds want me to eat meat today!

98
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,830
Oh, is that In Ho over there?

99
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,150
Oh?

100
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,830
It seems like he ran away from the way he looks.

101
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,750
You are responsible for this too. As his uncle, knowing that your nephew is lying about something big,

102
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,110
you should've scolded him and led him to the right direction as an adult.

103
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,640
You are a collaborative criminal.

104
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,020
But In Ho is everything to my sister though.

105
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,120
So how can I just make that world of hers crumble down like that?

106
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,380
Then what about In Ho's world?

107
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,600
His world had to crumble down sooner or later.

108
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,390
That young kid has lied about something like that for a few years.

109
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,930
He was the one who caused it, but he can't take it all.

110
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,050
Ah, seriously.

111
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,630
Hey, what's up?

112
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,110
What?

113
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,600
Hey, Kang In Ho!

114
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,140
Bok Soo, our nephew here will become something big.

115
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,930
Such a planner and actor. And he also has the skills to forge documents.

116
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,680
He has all three core skills.

117
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,920
It's already obvious what he's going to become.

118
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,530
In Ho.

119
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,110
Why is she here?

120
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm his homeroom teacher.

121
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,710
Kang In Ho, get up.

122
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,950
Go and plead to your mom that you did wrong.

123
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,280
I'm not going.

124
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,140
No, I can't go. I'm not going home.

125
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,240
Hey, Kang In Ho!

126
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,480
Did you not hear Mom telling me to die?

127
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,150
I'm just going to die here.

128
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,050
How dare you say such bullsh**!

129
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,870
Get up. Are you not going to?!

130
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,460
Come out.

131
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,720
Let's die together.

132
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,110
Let's just die together!

133
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,620
Who are you? You're not a teacher, right?

134
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,790
What kind of sports were you trained for?

135
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,030
Judging by your grip, did you learn judo?

136
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,270
In Ho's mother, please just listen to his reason first.

137
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,860
Not all lies have bad intentions.

138
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,650
You know very well that In Ho is not a bad kid.

139
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,910
Why, why are you like this?

140
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,360
What kind of lie is not bad?

141
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,490
What's the reason for you to lie to your mother for such a long time?

142
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,060
Why on earth did you do that?!

143
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,900
Because you...

144
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,350
smiled.

145
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,650
What?

146
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,910
Not like that.

147
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,610
Why?

148
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,300
Like this.

149
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,320
Okay.

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,530
Where did this smart boy come from?

165
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,400
Shall I dance?

166
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,670
In Ho got first place!

167
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,220
You've had a lot of sad things happen to you.

168
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:42,760
I wanted to be a good son and make you smile.

169
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,900
I really worked hard, but when it was useless, what other choice did I have?

170
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,170
So I forged my report card and gave it to you.

171
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,640
I made up awards to show you.

172
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,020
I wanted to make you happy even if it was through lying.

173
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,430
I'm really bad at studying.

174
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,690
There's nothing I want to do nor become. I'm just...

175
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,290
I'm just trash.

176
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,870
I'm sorry, Mom.

177
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,230
What's this?

178
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,020
I was just wondering where you got such strength from.

179
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,620
I know because I've been hit by my sister a lot.

180
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,650
If you did sports, you definitely would get a gold medal.

181
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,720
Will In Ho be okay?

182
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,570
In Ho is a Kang too. Kang because he's strong (Kang sounds like the word 'strong').

183
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,760
He needs to overcome it.

184
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,850
When I see Kang In Ho, it feels like I'm seeing myself.

185
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,780
Maybe, like In Ho, I liked that people

186
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,420
saw a better version of myself than what I really was,

187
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,850
so it feels like I've lived hiding myself.

188
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,930
Hide so only I know

189
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,020
that you're a good person.

190
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,030
Me?

191
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,810
Son.

192
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,350
Our son needs to eat his medicine.

193
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,830
N-No.

194
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:11,390
I'm not qualified to eat these kinds of things anymore.

195
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:18,180
You'll get scolded by teachers in school, and it must be embarrassing to be amongst your peers who whisper about you.

196
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,810
You need to have strength. Hurry and drink it.

197
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,170
You're not trash.

198
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,350
You've been my everything ever since you were in my womb.

199
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,820
I have protected you with all my life.

200
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,960
No matter what everybody else says, you're my precious son.

201
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,170
So straighten your shoulders!

202
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,860
Mom.

203
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,630
What about me? What about mine?

204
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,560
Go to your mom, this is for my son.

205
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,680
Let's go.

206
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:34,430
We're here. Will the secret about your birth finally be revealed?

207
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,680
I couldn't call you my nephew.

208
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,490
I couldn't tell my sister you were in the wildflower class. Do you know how I felt?

209
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,920
Why can't you say "that person is my uncle?!"

210
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,320
Uncle, I'm...

211
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,780
Kang In Ho, that right now is the place that matches you the best.

212
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,900
Believe me, from someone who's experienced.

213
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,570
Are you okay? You mom was very strong.

214
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,760
- That's true. Did she do sports?
- Yeah.

215
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,600
My mom's a gold medalist.

216
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,700
What?

217
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,790
Epic! Olympics? Which sport?

218
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,270
No, it was an Asian game. Sepak takraw.

219
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,880
What? Sepak?

220
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,800
Hey. You don't even know what sepak takraw is?

221
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,770
- You know it?
- Of course.

222
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,490
Son Soo Jeong.

223
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,400
Shall we talk for a bit?

224
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,030
It's something I need to say today.

225
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,030
Soo Jeong.

226
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,750
You asked me a while back

227
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,980
why I keep looking at you.

228
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,280
Why do you keep looking at me?

229
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,990
Son Soo Jeong, I see your loneliness.

230
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,720
I understand what it is like to live while holding thorns (as a defence against attack).

231
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,800
I want to make you happy. To stop your suff—

232
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,080
Oh Se Ho, I'm not you.

233
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,250
Don't see yourself in me.

234
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,390
I don't need your help. And...

235
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,770
I'm not lonely.

236
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,630
Son Soo Jeong.

237
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,020
I'm going to reject your feelings.

238
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,150
I'm not the one who can stop your loneliness.

239
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,460
The reason you're rejecting me...

240
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,600
Is it, perhaps, because of Kang Bok Soo?

241
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,990
Yeah.

242
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,800
I don't understand.

243
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,560
What does that shabby ring do?

244
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,790
Why does it have to be Bok Soo, not me?

245
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,160
You liked Kang Bok Soo as much as I did.

246
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,280
Not sure. I don't remember.

247
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,740
You're going to regret the choice you just made.

248
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,630
It's going to be very hard for you guys from now on.

249
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,670
Don't mess with Kang Bok Soo.

250
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,260
He suffered a lot because of you and me.

251
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,180
Is this who you are?

252
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,140
If I don't do this,

253
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,650
then you'll just remember me as a classmate, a school director,

254
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,570
that kind of nobody, right?

255
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,120
I hated that.

256
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,300
You're the one who made the choice. Tell me if you change your mind.

257
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,630
I'm... always open to you.

258
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,850
Do you want that pathetic girl that much?

259
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,440
Son Soo Jeong.

260
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,060
She is the teacher of that wildflower class you made.

261
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,410
Did you think I wouldn't know about her?

262
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,600
Don't mess with her.

263
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,660
What?

264
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,510
Don't mess with Son Soo Jeong.

265
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,340
Mother, having anger management issues is a sickness.

266
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,990
Se Ho, how dare you.

267
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,200
Don't ever mess with Son Soo Jeong.

268
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,010
I won't borrow your hand.

269
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,930
If I can't get her,

270
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,700
I will destroy her myself.

271
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,800
You shouldn't make mistakes like back then.

272
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,090
You should destroy others, not get destroyed.

273
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,080
Secretary Yoon

274
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,910
Yes, Secretary Yoon.

275
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,680
No, you should proceed as it was.

276
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,120
I will take responsibility for it.

277
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,140
You're going to regret the choice you just made.

278
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,860
It's going to be very hard for you guys from now on.

279
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,410
What is Oh Se Ho thinking?

280
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,790
Kim Myeong Ho?

281
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,030
Hello. Hello. Yes, hello.

282
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,720
Hello. Yes, hello.

283
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,970
You've gotten even prettier.

284
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,490
You've lost weight.

285
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,330
Yes, yes. Nice to meet you.

286
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,290
Where does that jerk think this is to appear?

287
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,550
Long time no see.

288
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,160
Okay, okay. This is Kim Myeong—

289
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,560
You all know him already. As of today, he is reinstated as an administrator.

290
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,040
Since he came back, please get along while working together.

291
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,890
Have you all been well?

292
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:11,020
I feel honored to come back to work with all of you wonderful people.

293
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,690
I will do my best to contribute

294
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,730
to Seolsong High School's endless achievement.

295
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,260
Yeah, yeah.

296
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:29,230
Se Ho. You shouldn't be doing this.

297
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,210
Even if this school is a private school, there are rules to adhere to.

298
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,680
How can you rehire him who committed such a big fraud?

299
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,030
Teacher Park Dong Joon.

300
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,290
This is the director's office,

301
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:46,610
which means that an ordinary teacher like you shouldn't come in here without my permission.

302
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,420
Se Ho.

303
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,450
The private foundation holds full authority over human resources in this private school,

304
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,560
and there is no legal problem in hiring him.

305
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,380
Your personal opinion is even less important.

306
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,860
Do you have anything more to say?

307
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,930
You need to put more weight on your decency as a human being than on a code of law.

308
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:18,060
If you ever think you've done wrong,

309
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,380
always look back at what you've done, Director.

310
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,890
You're still the same, Teacher.

311
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,680
But until when are you going to be like that?

312
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,620
What's wrong with the director? Isn't he too reckless?

313
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,330
How could Director rehire such a person?

314
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,320
I know, right? Kim Myeong Ho used to be a contractor. How can the director hire him as an administrator?

315
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,640
The director works exactly the way his mother used to.

316
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,140
That person was the one who scammed money from contracted teachers

317
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,010
by offering a full-time position for money. I heard that has happened before.

318
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,660
Huh?

319
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,100
Oh my goodness. Does that make any sense?

320
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,550
Our school doesn't have that kind of thing.

321
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:19,880
That's true. Teacher Ma, you should never go around saying that.

322
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,330
Okay, okay.

323
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,870
Why did you come back here?

324
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,420
How dare you came back? From whom are you going to extort?!

325
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,770
What do you mean "extort"? I returned all the money to you.

326
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,350
You're pretending to not know—fifty thousand dollars.

327
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,060
Shut up. Why did you come back?

328
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,930
I came back because I was asked to.

329
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,530
Well, Teacher Son, this is my lifetime workplace as well.

330
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,280
So let's get along, okay?

331
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,710
- It hurts.
- Hey.

332
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,990
Don't pull any bullsh**.

333
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:01,480
This is a school, a place where a criminal like you should not be lurking!

334
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,930
Ah, really.

335
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,160
What makes you so confident?

336
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,230
If I open my mouth, you'll quickly be laid off.

337
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,670
What?

338
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:16,200
Let's get along again, Teacher Son Soo Jeong. Okay?

339
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,170
Hey, student, why are you blocking the way —

340
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,190
Mr. Kang Bok Soo, you look good in a uniform.

341
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,410
Why are you here?

342
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,590
Reinstated. I'm back.

343
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,140
Was it Oh Se Ho?

344
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,710
Why would Oh Se Ho call you back?

345
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,830
That... It's because I did well. He's giving me an opportunity—

346
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:12,790
Just know that that opportunity could be an opportunity for you to go to hell.

347
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,450
What's this?

348
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,830
Did you bring Kim Myeong Ho?

349
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,000
You catch onto things fast.

350
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,780
How can you bring that jerk back when you know what he did to Son Soo Jeong?

351
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,360
That's why I brought him back.

352
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:52,530
But are you even qualified to be worrying about Son Soo Jeong?

353
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:56,210
You're the most dangerous to her.

354
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:01,080
- What?
- You're a uniform-clad student and Son Soo Jeong is your homeroom teacher.

355
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,220
A teacher is dating a student whom she's teaching, and at school too.

356
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:17,290
If the parents and students know about this truth, what do you think will happen?

357
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:27,800
Student Kang Bok Soo, even like this, will you still keep on dating Teacher Son Soo Jeong?

358
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,740
Yeah. I will continue to date her.

359
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,930
No matter what you do, I'm never breaking up with her.

360
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,100
You're going to just blow away the fulltime position that Son Soo Jeong worked hard for?

361
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,750
Oh Se Ho, you won't reveal that.

362
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,350
Me? Why do you think that?

363
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,320
Do you think I don't know why you brought me back to school?

364
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,270
If I throw away this uniform, you won't be able to boast around me.

365
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:59,290
You tried to boss Son Soo Jeong and me around using your power as a director of this school.

366
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,210
Go ahead and fire her.

367
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:06,020
Son Soo Jeong never seeing you for the rest of your life—that's such a good thing.

368
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,420
You've become a lot smarter, Kang Bok Soo.

369
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,360
What wrong did I do to you?

370
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,090
- What?
- Like how I unknowingly hurt Son Soo Jeong,

371
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,210
did I do the same thing to you?

372
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,280
You originally weren't this type of person.

373
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:47,060
What kind of person was I to you?

374
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,160
An idiot who just smiles for nothing?

375
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,130
You were always like that.

376
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:10,400
You pretend to be righteous. You pretend to know everything!

377
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,780
You don't know how I feel.

378
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:26,550
How miserable my life became because of you.

379
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:38,790
You two... can never...

380
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,360
be happy.

381
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,320
My Strange Hero

382
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,640
List all the teachers who were hired by paying the school.

383
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,040
Oh Se Ho, that bastard. I shouldn't leave him alone like that.

384
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,590
I, as expected, like school.

385
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,130
Me too. I like the school that you're in.

386
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,060
Prepare the forced transfer.

387
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,790
This is the reason why I made the wildflower class.

388
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,140
He won't stay still.

389
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,130
That's what I'm hoping for.

390
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,570
I'm going to protect Kang Bok Soo.

391
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,640
Believe in me!

392
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,100
♫ Every day, I get anxious all night ♫
