1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Why are you here?

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,150
It's because I didn't do well on the level test this time. I'm usually in the ivy class.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,850
Keep it a secret from Mom please, Uncle.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,580
Hey, Kang In Ho, tell me the truth.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,760
- It's true!
- Are you trying to trick me again in this situation?

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,340
And what about that game?

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,320
Ah, game.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,990
Because we're friends, we're helping each other out.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,670
If you get to know them, they're actually good kids.

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,390
But it's because you don't really know.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,290
All right.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,570
I'm an imbecile and a shuttle (an errand boy for bullies).

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,120
So why did you return to school

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,660
when you're too old for it?

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,740
Get it together, you punk.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,060
Your mom only lives for you.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,850
You saw what happened to Grandma because of me.

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,840
You've seen it and know about it, but you go through school like this? And lying?!

19
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,120
Uncle.

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,850
Uncle, I'll do anything you say.

21
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,230
Please don't tell Mom.

22
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,780
Do you think lying will solve anything?

23
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,620
Hold on.

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,580
Hey, has Kang In Ho ever kneeled and begged us like that before?

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,660
Nope.

26
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,510
What is that elder?

27
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,640
But what is Kang Bok Soo to Kang In Ho?

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,940
Are they brothers?

29
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,670
Hey! Is the surname Kang— Are they brothers?

30
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,070
Anyway, we can't share our shuttle, can we?

31
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:38,070
Which of the following signifies the author's main argument?

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,550
Who should read this?

33
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,020
Do you want to read this, Bok Soo?

34
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,570
Since it's your first day back,

35
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,780
I'll read this.

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,680
Let's continue next time.

37
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,420
Attack, attack.

38
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,050
Give it.

39
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,720
Should we go watch a movie?

40
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,340
Hey, Kang In Ho!

41
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,570
Go and buy some bul-buhs.

42
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,920
Oh, okay.

43
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,020
Hey!

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,980
What is it?

45
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,430
I can run 100 meters in 11 seconds.

46
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,340
What are you saying?

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,230
I'll buy it. That bul-buh.

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,750
But what's a bul-buh?

49
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,840
Heol.

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,790
Bulgogi burger.

51
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,950
Okay. You record the time.

52
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,820
He's a real psychopath.

53
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,560
Keep upper body at a 45 degree angle. Must reduce wind resistance.

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,420
Move center of gravity to the left. Don't fall down but maintain speed.

55
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,310
My feet remember the height and number of stairs.

56
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,280
Nine, ten, eleven.

57
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,990
Land.

58
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,770
Use athleticism and reflexes to avoid obstacles.

59
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,970
More than In Ho...

60
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,530
I need to be faster than In Ho.

61
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:35,290
♫  If words could make wishes come true  ♫

62
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,320
What can I do for you?

63
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,040
Give me three bul-buhs.

64
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,340
Give me three bobas.

65
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,550
You're fantastic.

66
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,660
My family's hope, In Ho, is being used as a shuttle?

67
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,790
Our In Ho is so pitiful.

68
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,290
More than In Ho...

69
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,250
I need to be faster than In Ho.

70
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,550
Oh, the senior is fast.

71
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,150
Three minutes and 15 seconds.

72
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,560
Was In Ho's greatest record 4 minutes and 28 seconds?

73
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,460
But still, Kang In Ho buying it for us is more delicious.

74
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,440
Don't you think so?

75
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,540
Right.

76
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,430
At this rate, you'll collapse, old man. We're still counting on you for our snacks, In Ho.

77
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,100
Hey!

78
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,340
I'll open it for you! Aren't you surprised?

79
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,500
Hey! Listen carefully to my words.

80
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,860
Our class's shuttle is me now.

81
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,740
I am the shuttle, okay?!

82
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,640
Don't you dare forget it.

83
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,080
This is unbelievable.

84
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,890
Complaint calls have miraculously declined.

85
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,610
Even the protestors outside have stopped demonstrating as well.

86
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,910
But are you really accepting Kang Bok Soo as a student?

87
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,160
He's already a student.

88
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,570
Why do you ask?

89
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,050
I was thinking it might be a temporary event.

90
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,660
Well, we don't know what kind of trouble he'll cause.

91
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,230
While he's at school, he's bound to cause problems, don't you think?

92
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,330
Then I guess he'll cause even more problems.

93
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,960
Make sure to take care of it properly when that happens.

94
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,680
Hey, I think our In Ho

95
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,630
- will make a good janitor in the future.
- Yeah, it suits him.

96
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,110
Good job, Kang In Ho!

97
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,250
Wow, look at this!

98
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,840
Oh, those guys, seriously!

99
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,020
Hey! Put that down and do it.

100
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,030
Hey, you missed a spot.

101
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,760
Come here.

102
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,160
This is not the time for this!

103
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,400
Ah, Kang In Ho.

104
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,060
You're blocking my path of revenge.

105
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,550
My plan is getting derailed.

106
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,800
Request for leave of absence
Reason: Personal

107
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,420
Let go, let go!

108
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,640
I told you not to sneak up on me, Teach.

109
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,200
Stings!

110
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,400
Hey, you punk.

111
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,200
Why are you so serious on your first day back?

112
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,740
Let's go.

113
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,760
What, where? I'm not going.

114
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,060
You punk, I said just!

115
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,660
Go!

116
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,950
Hold on, Teacher.

117
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,160
Here, congrats on being a student again.

118
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,210
How can a teacher encourage his student to drink?

119
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,390
Here you go.

120
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,450
Okay.

121
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,640
Eat a lot.

122
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,010
Although it took some time for you to return,

123
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,810
I knew you would come back.

124
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,300
You're all grown now.

125
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,230
I like wings.

126
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,670
- Hello.
- Okay, okay.

127
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,330
Hello.

128
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,870
What's wrong with him?

129
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,120
Did the kids already drain all your energy?

130
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,620
It must have been hard for Bok Soo to return to school.

131
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,750
Congrats on returning to school, Bok Soo.

132
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,660
I'm sorry that I didn't get to tell you.

133
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,130
I was worried that you would worry.

134
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,700
Of course I'd be worried.

135
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,870
School must be full of pretty high school girls.

136
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,510
Those young kids' eyesight must also be good.

137
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:27,300
Our Kang Bok Soo's handsome face is clearly seen. No matter how pretty I am, my age is like a gangster's (too old to match with the young).

138
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,210
I can't believe I have to watch my handsome Bok So be surrounded by flowers (pretty girls) again!

139
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,440
Teacher, are you Bok Soo's homeroom teacher this time too?

140
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,560
I should tell you to take good care of Bok Soo.

141
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,910
Hold on. I need to go to the restroom.

142
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,130
Where are you going, Teacher?

143
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,010
It must be good, right?

144
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,830
Congratulations!

145
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,540
You don't even say anything.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,920
Three, two, one.

147
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,930
That will be 5000 won.

148
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,040
Don't ever say "5000" to me again.

149
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,310
It's 5000 won, so I said 5000. Should I have said it's 50,000,000 won (sometimes called 5000 for short)?

150
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,800
Hey!

151
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,250
- Son Soo Jeong?
- Son Soo Jeong!

152
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,230
Bok Soo's homeroom teacher is Son Soo Jeong.

153
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:32,030
Are you saying that Son Soo Jeong is at the school that he's attending?

154
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,920
- Calm down, I'm sure there's a reason—
- I heard everything! I'm going to school.

155
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,240
I will go there too.

156
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,340
Why would you go?

157
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,500
Kang Bok Soo, Son Soo Jeong.

158
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,060
I can't see the two of you together.

159
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,900
How did Son Soo Jeong come to be your homeroom teacher?

160
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,700
This isn't even funny.

161
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,890
How did it feel looking at Son Soo Jeong? Did you heart pound?

162
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,980
I told you heart problems run in my family!

163
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,820
Yeah, sure.

164
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,020
So what are you going to do about revenge?

165
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,210
I was concerned thinking you were going to destroy the school.

166
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,300
Hey, how old am I that I would do that?

167
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,560
I know that Oh Se Ho definitely has dirt on him, so I'll get him.

168
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,580
As for Son Soo Jeong...

169
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,670
First, I will see why she did that to me.

170
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,930
Look, you still have lingering feelings.

171
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,120
It's because I'm curious!

172
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,870
I'm really curious about why she did that to me!

173
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,100
Why isn't Teacher Park coming?

174
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,460
Hey, did Teacher Park drink alcohol?

175
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,230
Yeah, one glass.

176
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,820
Teacher Park can get drunk from one glass, then he goes home right away.

177
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,420
- Go home.
- Here.

178
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,230
See you next time, students.

179
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,250
I told them to take extra care since you haven't been here in a while.

180
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,380
Sit down.

181
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,790
Mother, you like seafood as always.

182
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,500
Meat is bad for your body.

183
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,030
Thank you for the food.

184
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,550
You have a lot to do from now on.

185
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,040
We also can't guarantee that something like this won't happen again.

186
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes, I will do my best.

187
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,560
Why aren't you eating? Are you still a picky eater?

188
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,070
It's delicious.

189
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,110
Yes.

190
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,120
So?

191
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,890
Are you okay?

192
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,970
Chef, I'm allergic to shellfish.

193
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,130
Don't use any in my food and be careful.

194
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,210
I'm sorry. It has not been long since I began working.

195
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,280
Your mother said there aren't any foods you avoid either.

196
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,680
She must have forgotten.

197
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,980
Since it's been so long.

198
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,880
Bok Soo!

199
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,370
You didn't get caught in the rain?

200
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,260
No, what's wrong with you? You're acting strange.

201
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,870
So Jeong always does this for In Ho.

202
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,220
I'll try it too.

203
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,170
Did you really go to school?

204
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,530
Mom, kids leave all their books at school nowadays.

205
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,100
Did you know the blackboards even erase themselves?

206
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,410
Is it AI or something?

207
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,770
Can it clean my restaurant too?

208
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,000
Did you eat?

209
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,020
Yeah, I ate.

210
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,520
Why'd you stop?

211
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,240
Its nice to see you wearing a uniform again.

212
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,990
Gosh, so indecisive.

213
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,880
You were just asking my why I'm going back not too long ago.

214
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,220
Let's go.

215
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,360
It's cold.

216
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,510
Oh! Go easy on me. Easy. Easy.

217
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,850
Hey, Kang Bok Soo.

218
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,000
Hey, don't pretend to know In Ho.

219
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,530
Don't go to his class and act like you're all great since you're his uncle.

220
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,410
You'll bring down his class, understand?

221
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,170
Be quiet. You don't even know anything.

222
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,860
What don't I know? I've been a parent for a long time.

223
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,630
Oh, seriously!

224
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,090
Do you really want to speak like that?

225
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,530
Is only your child precious?

226
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,910
Mom, seriously.

227
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,630
Bok Soo!

228
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,370
How embarrassed must In Ho be? And I'm also your kid!

229
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,820
That's right, acting fake doesn't last long.

230
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,850
Isn't that why you and I are like this?

231
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,400
If you were sincere, would you have done that to me?

232
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,460
What do you mean, Son Soo Jeong?

233
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,840
Is it menopause?

234
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,300
You feel stuffy here, right? You can't sleep at night nor digest well.

235
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,790
You keep getting angry and feel like you have a fever.

236
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,740
How did you know?

237
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,730
Did you invest in any stocks?

238
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,450
No.

239
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,330
You're showing the same symptoms as the teacher who's in charge of student affairs

240
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,180
when he lost ₩50 million from investing in stocks.

241
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,950
How strange. Those symptoms are for people who've lost money. It's anger-induced stress.

242
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,320
"Anger-induced stress?"

243
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,840
- Here.
- If I take this, will I get better?

244
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,930
Those are vitamins. Would you get better with those?

245
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,230
Find the source of your anger and get rid of it.

246
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,230
Considering Yi Sang's writings were written during the bleak Japanese colonized era,
Ogamdo 1st Poem by Yi Sang

247
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,960
you can see just how big an effect the era played in his work.

248
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,830
What you feel today through this poem, Ogamdo,

249
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,920
could be feelings of anxiety, depression, and fear, right?

250
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,040
The assignment was to write a parody or a reformation of a poem that you learned this term.

251
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,400
Are you all getting ready?

252
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,520
Did anybody prepare anything today?

253
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,840
The first to present will get extra points!

254
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,460
There isn't anyone, then...

255
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,930
Me! Me, me, me!

256
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,260
Oh, Elder.

257
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,600
Wow.

258
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,850
Okay, then do it.

259
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,650
I've recreated the poem we just learned, Ogamdo.

260
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,980
The title is "50 million won."

261
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,870
The first teacher is scary. The second teacher is scary.

262
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,030
The third teacher is scary. The fourth teacher is scary.

263
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,660
The fifth teacher is scary!

264
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,900
- Enough!
- The sixth—

265
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,930
What kind of poem says that?

266
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,780
The teacher's authority drops to the ground,

267
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,540
and the teacher's sense of duty and consciousness also drop.

268
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,560
So, as a representative of the fifty million citizens who experience terror and anxiety from

269
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,130
five thousand, five thousand,

270
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,130
five thousand teachers, this is a poem that expresses that fear.

271
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,550
Okay, enough for today.

272
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,840
You're so smart and hard to understand, I have no idea what you're saying.

273
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,010
For the rest, I'll check in detail when you submit the performance papers.

274
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,420
Come out for a second.

275
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,740
Yes.

276
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,460
Why are you being so immature?

277
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,530
Hey, Kang Bok Soo, did you return just to do this?

278
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,910
No, I didn't come to do this.

279
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,060
So why did you come?

280
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,740
Is that all... you have to say to me?

281
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,970
What would there be to say between us?

282
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,910
You're a student, and I'm a teacher.

283
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,400
Kang Bok Soo, where are you going?

284
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,490
You don't have anything to say?

285
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:54,060
Then, I'll make you remember.

286
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,960
Where are you—

287
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,600
It's been a really long time.

288
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,250
Has it been nine years?

289
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,070
It's been closed. Come to the counseling room.

290
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,700
It seems open.

291
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,130
What?

292
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,100
Access to rooftop banned

293
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,420
You're here?

294
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,090
It hurts.

295
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,020
How did you know?

296
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,580
Why did you say it?

297
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,660
I don't like her.

298
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:02,150
It's my first time losing in terms of studies, and she keeps ignoring me when I've been treating her well.

299
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,200
She's my girlfriend, you jerk.

300
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,720
So what? What about it?

301
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,770
Do you not even feel sorry for Son Soo Jeong?

302
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,240
So do you not feel sorry for me?

303
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,270
I'm the most pitiful in the world.

304
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,040
Why, huh?

305
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,730
Why are you pitiful?

306
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,760
You don't know anything.

307
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,990
This bastard.

308
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,810
Crazy bastard.

309
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,720
Bok Soo, Kang Bok Soo.

310
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,650
Look at me.

311
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,220
What, you jerk?

312
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,810
Should I just die?

313
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,670
Hey. What are you doing? Get down from there.

314
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,050
Bok Soo, isn't everything just useless?

315
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:46,190
I'm so tired of living.

316
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:54,230
If I jump... everything will get easier.

317
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,750
Hey!

318
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,580
Do what you want.

319
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,380
There's a limit to joking.

320
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,720
Bok Soo.

321
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,970
Kang Bok Soo.

322
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,110
I will really jump, Kang Bok Soo.

323
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,310
Don't go!

324
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,330
Okay.

325
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,670
Goodbye, Kang Bok Soo.

326
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,590
I'm thankful for all this time.

327
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,450
