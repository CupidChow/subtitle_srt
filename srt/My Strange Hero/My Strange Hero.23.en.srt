1
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,710
I understand Teacher Park for wanting you to graduate.

2
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,630
- So Bok Soo—
- I know what I have to do.

3
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,910
I need to expose the school corruption, and I'm definitely going to earn the graduation diploma on my own.

4
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,250
Let go. Let go of me, Teacher!

5
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,180
If something happens to you again...

6
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,500
If I can't protect you this time...

7
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,280
that is...

8
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,630
I won't be able to endure it.

9
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:17,430
So you should focus on the kids.

10
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,570
Poppy tree, bugle weed.

11
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,610
Deer foot, dog dung tree, toothed dandelion.

12
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,590
Although the names aren't pretty and people don't know that they're flowers,

13
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:54,420
wildflowers are flowers that bloom again when stepped on and do not ever die.

14
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,030
You might feel that it's unfair and be upset,

15
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,680
but even if you've been stepped on, you just need to make your flowers bloom again.

16
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,280
The mid placement test? You guys can do it well.

17
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,140
What will Teacher Park do? He won't answer my calls.

18
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,990
I know. What is that familyless man doing and where?

19
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,290
We don't have time to be sad.

20
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,150
This rotten school and Oh Se Ho.

21
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,570
Getting rid of them a day sooner is our revenge for Teacher Park.

22
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,210
Previous Director: Im Se Kyeong.
Current Director of Seolsong Foundation: Oh Se Ho.

23
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,520
Current Director of Seolsong Foundation: Oh Se Ho.

24
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,570
The file you wanted.

25
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,210
Seolseong Highschool Donation Roster

26
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,960
- Verify again if any parents were omitted from this donation list.
- Okay.

27
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,730
Oh, the principal and everybody else knows all of this, right?

28
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,320
Of course, we are all one.

29
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,340
But I still don't have the recruitment list, even though I asked about it a while ago.

30
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,530
Ah, that. It's because I'm sorting it out right now.

31
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,740
You did well.

32
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,390
Then I will be leaving.

33
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,930
- Kim Myeong Ho.
- Yes?

34
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,070
Can you do something else for me?

35
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,520
Though I've vacated the position, thanks to you executives, I always feel so assured.

36
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,560
We are not people who have worked together for only a short time.

37
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,250
There's nothing to worry about, of course. We just carry on doing what we have always done.

38
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,160
Your son is making quite the show too.

39
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,570
He got rid of the teacher who was a headache,

40
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,940
and he is transferring out the trouble students all at once too, I hear.

41
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,650
But your son seems to have a clear grasp of our business.

42
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,140
Do you plan to just hand it to him like this?

43
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,360
That's what I'm curious about too.

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,730
I thought Director Oh Se Ho was only holding the place momentarily.

45
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,300
He works harder than I thought he did.

46
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,060
Since we've seen many occasions of parents getting backstabbed by trusting their kids.

47
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,830
Actually I wanted to meet you for board remedy.

48
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,750
Board remedy? Then the agenda is?

49
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,420
Of course, it's the dismissal of the current director.

50
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,110
He's your son. Would you be okay?

51
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,530
Is blood relation what matters? Our business is what matters.

52
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,900
Really? Oh Se Ho is getting fired?

53
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,110
It seems so.

54
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,460
This is nice. I love this.

55
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,370
She's going to do all the school business with us anyway.

56
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,880
There's no need to seat her son there. She's being wise.

57
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,420
We won't get fired too, right?

58
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,170
They won't be able to fire us. It's already been ten years.

59
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,460
If they fire us, they will all be in trouble.

60
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,110
I'm putting together my survival path too.

61
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,990
You're saving me too, right?

62
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,910
Are you okay?

63
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,510
Oh, hired driver?

64
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,190
Oh, hired driver. Over here.

65
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,570
I shall escort you safely.

66
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,420
Bye.

67
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,230
Even though he drinks that much, he's fine in the morning.

68
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,720
What exactly does he eat?

69
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,190
If only you weren't here.

70
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,050
Lee Chae Min's Mother

71
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,130
Yes, Mother. Does Chae Min really need to be first at just the class mid-year placement test?

72
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,520
We have some issues, so let's just sit back this time.

73
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,090
The year-end test is what matters, so I'll be responsible for sending that to you.

74
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,030
Yes, good night.

75
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,850
Not this mid placement test.

76
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,210
- But I'll get the year-end test paper.
- Mom.

77
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,160
If you did well on your own, I wouldn't have to do this.

78
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,540
Lee Chae Min, don't make yourself pathetic.

79
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,690
If you can't be first here, how do you expect to survive from now on?

80
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:56,090
I'll do better this time, Mom.

81
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Let's sort all this out again.

82
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,740
So this equipment contract is a problem, just looking at the estimate paper.

83
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,170
Each desk in the science lab, 50,00,000 won.

84
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:30,190
And I found on the internet the exact same product for less than 500,000 won.

85
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,750
What kind of inflation is that? It's way too overboard.

86
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,920
And I think we need to verify what we heard the principal say today.

87
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,480
Let's tail Lee Chae Min's mother.

88
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,850
Okay, I'll do the tailing.

89
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,280
If that's true, we need to find the evidence!

90
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,010
Chae Min

91
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,700
- I will cover your eyes.
- My eyes?

92
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,470
For the elasticity of your eyes.

93
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,390
Madam, could you give me your hands?

94
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,120
I will put your phone down for a second.

95
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:18,000
Here we go.

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,710
Hold.

97
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,040
Because you're so stiff, let's do another.

98
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,170
Hold.

99
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,450
I'll keep pulling.

100
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,220
Hold.

101
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,330
Copy

102
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,150
File Transfer

103
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,200
Your massage felt good. Let me get it again.

104
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,750
Okay.

105
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,720
Beak Hak Furniture

106
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,370
Seolsong High

107
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,420
Seolsong High

108
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,310
I am the chief administrator Kim Myeong Ho.

109
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,470
And this is the chief auditor of our school.

110
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,490
Kim Myeong Ho, Lee Kyeong Goo

111
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,870
I heard that the chief administrator was newly hired.

112
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,470
I should have visited you guys first.

113
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,400
Because you didn't come for a long time, I came to see you first.

114
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,020
But, why are you here?

115
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,880
Chief Lee.

116
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,120
Expensive. It's so expensive.

117
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,220
While I was going through the ledger,

118
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:41,370
the meeting table you sold to Seolsong for one million won was found on the internet for a minimum of 173,900 won.

119
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,920
Your predecessor didn't tell you properly?

120
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,080
That was because there is a margin—

121
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,660
What on earth is happening?

122
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,980
You changed your car recently.

123
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,910
- Furthermore, it's a really expensive foreign brand.
- Hang on.

124
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,490
Does it have anything to do with you?

125
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,470
There is a connection.

126
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,010
Our new director is too detail-oriented. Overly.

127
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,640
He scolded that we were ripped off, big time.

128
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,880
What?

129
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,100
That was decided by you guys.

130
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,750
It was a done deal with the previous chief administrator already.

131
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,600
And, do you know how much rebate you guys got from me?!

132
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,300
How much?

133
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,680
Yes. How much was it?

134
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,030
Shall we talk about it seriously while looking over the ledgers?

135
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,350
Checked that supplies were over priced.

136
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,570
Checked that there were records for rebate and double-ledgers.

137
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,250
As I looked into the phone of Lee Chae Min's mom,

138
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,320
the principle sent the placement test papers to her.

139
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,350
I confirmed it.

140
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,880
How audacious.

141
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,480
Leaking the test papers

142
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,800
Distorting the student records

143
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,420
Seolsong High Debate: Job is chosen based on money.

144
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,410
Corruption for supply purchase

145
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,330
Checked that supplies were over priced.

146
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,210
Checked that there were records for rebate and double-ledgers.

147
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,650
Other problems: forced transfer, discrimination based on grades

148
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,520
Good.

149
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,630
We are grasping the clues of their corruption well.

150
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:41,430
Now the point is how to cook this well into a breaking news item.

151
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,400
But seeing what Teacher Park did earlier, there's no point in meeting with reporters.

152
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,800
We need to stage it bigger.

153
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,740
As for the corrupted process of hiring a teacher, it will be perfect if we have an eye-witness.

154
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,590
Who's going to step up?

155
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,060
How regretful.

156
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,150
Need a witness

157
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,650
The list of high scorers on the second-year placement test:
1. Yoon Seong Woo 2. No Yoo Han 3. Im Yoo Jin

158
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,100
Yoon Seung Woo got first place?

159
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,060
Epic!

160
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,040
5th Place: Lee Chae Min

161
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,460
Seong Woo got first place again.

162
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,980
Seung Woo got first!

163
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,200
Awesome!

164
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,280
What happened to Chae Min?

165
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,770
Yoon Seung Woo got first place?

166
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,220
Lee Chae Min, I'll continue to be first.

167
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,100
Look forward to it.

168
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,930
So don't place your life on grades.

169
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:12,050
Ignoring people because of their grades and crying as if the world is ending when your grades fall a little bit.

170
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,320
Is that normal?

171
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,770
What do you know, you jerk?

172
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,760
There's no meaning if I'm not first.

173
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,650
A day where Lee Chae Min can't be first place.

174
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,300
How awful.

175
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,070
What's going to happen to him?

176
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,990
Lee Chae Min, are you okay?

177
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,240
Hey, are you okay?

178
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,360
He's not going to move classes?

179
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,010
Oh Yeong Min wasn't enough, and now even Yoon Seung Woo, who's in first place? Is he crazy?

180
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,170
Yeah, he must be crazy. He kept saying how much he likes the wildflower class,

181
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,700
and he said he isn't moving from there.

182
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,370
Well, I like it too.

183
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,520
He said he doesn't want to come. That gangster-like...

184
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,890
Our Seung Woo is a gangster.

185
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,830
He's a skilled gangster because he's smart.

186
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,360
He has the personality of a gangster because he's kind.

187
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,760
He has the face of a gangster because he's handsome.

188
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,990
How can he be equipped with everything like that?

189
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,760
Student Record: Yoon Seung Woo
Address, names of parents, contact numbers

190
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,590
I only called in Oh Yeong Min and Yoon Seung Woo.

191
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,580
What about Kang Bok Soo? Why is he here?

192
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,990
As the wildflower's class president who takes responsibility...

193
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,690
Please leave.

194
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,500
Maybe it's cause I'm old now, but my butt is heavy

195
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,060
and my legs don't have strength, so I'll sit down first, Director.

196
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,430
Yoon Seung Woo and Oh Yeong Min, please move to the ivy class.

197
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,900
Don't want to.

198
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,450
Same here. Please just let us stay in the wildflower class.

199
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,130
You need to follow the rules of the group you're in.
Since they got high scores on the placement test, they need to move up.

200
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,280
This world doesn't allow you to live on your own terms.

201
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,330
Since you brought it up, I would like to say this.

202
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:29,030
Since our class average went up by 50%, the forced transfer has been canceled, right?

203
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,280
I called it a special transfer by the school principal, didn't I?

204
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,280
I will keep my promise.

205
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,070
I feel sorry that you refuse the offered privileges, such as the transfer and advancement to the ivy class

206
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,430
out of your silliness.

207
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,630
Don't you think that discrimination by class is useless?

208
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,900
Since the first place in the school is in the last-place class, the ranking system is of no use.

209
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,640
It's not effective anymore.

210
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,660
Kang Bok Soo.

211
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,460
S. Crystal said this before:

212
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,420
"Deer foot, dog dung tree, toothed dandelion."

213
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:11,280
"An ugly wildflower, no matter how much you step on it, will bloom again."

214
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:18,860
Thank you very much for giving us the name of "wildflower," Director.

215
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,810
Hyung, I was so scared. You've got guts to have faced him like that.

216
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,730
I know, right? Is it your rule of thumb?

217
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,920
Do you feel like being rebellious with him even when you're on the director's bad side?

218
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,570
Bul-burg!

219
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,810
He's rude as always.

220
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,980
Looking at you makes my nervousness go away.

221
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,520
It shouldn't though.

222
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,020
Why not?

223
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,760
Because Oh Se Ho is looking for a chance to harm us,

224
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,380
we need to be alert.

225
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,060
Don't worry. You have me.

226
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,700
♫ For you ♫

227
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:57,070
Like this... we just have to overcome it together again.

228
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:04,330
♫ Were you the same as me? ♫

229
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,190
♫ I felt shy to talk ♫

230
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,830
I... Should I go inside?

231
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,340
Go home. Your mom is waiting.

232
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,410
No. She's someone who will sleep well if I stay overnight somewhere else.

233
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,390
♫ Sending the name ♫

234
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,790
It's late. Hurry and go.

235
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,660
Go inside then. Sleep well.

236
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,170
Go.

237
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:40,000
♫ What should I say? ♫

238
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,820
♫ Which one will be right? ♫

239
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,600
Hey!

240
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,720
Why do you give up so easily?

241
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,480
What are you doing?

242
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,300
I'm writing in my diary.

243
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,950
I have to write if something good happens.

244
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,740
I had so much fun when I was teasing the vice principal and chief of student affairs.

245
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,020
Then write about this too.

246
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,230
Today, Oh Se Ho got another wise saying from S. Crystal.

247
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,540
"A wild flower will bloom even if stepped on."

248
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,150
Deer foot, dog dung tree, toothed dandelion. You should have said that, too.

249
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,660
I said that too.

250
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,900
You should have seen Oh Se Ho's face.

251
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:55,010
Soo Jeong, do you remember?

252
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,830
Oh Se Ho.

253
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,970
Come to the nurse's room during your self-study time after school.

254
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,680
Wait.

255
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,310
Kang Bok Soo.

256
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,100
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

257
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,330
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

258
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,210
♪ Dear Oh Se Ho ♪

259
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,810
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

260
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,300
Because I heard it was your birthday, I spent some money.

261
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,740
I gave him the information.

262
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,510
- How did you—
- Shh.

263
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,110
Make a wish. Quickly blow it.

264
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,580
Leave out getting first place. You can't do that.

265
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,860
This is my special present.

266
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,390
What's that, Kang Bok Soo? You're going to drink that?

267
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,720
At school? A student?!

268
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,220
It's not my style.

269
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,810
You drank it well though.

270
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,380
Oh Se Ho, are you okay?

271
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,570
My face turned red but I'm totally fine though.

272
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,530
Maybe I am born to enjoy alcohol.

273
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,400
Hello, Teacher.

274
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,350
I was preparing for the exam tomorrow with Bok Soo and Soo Jeong.

275
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,270
What is it?

276
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,160
I haven't seen him before.

277
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,650
Hurry up and greet him, you idiots. It's Teacher Baldy.

278
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,140
Skeleton?

279
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,580
Hello, Teacher.

280
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,840
Ow, my legs hurt.

281
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,810
Nice! We didn't get hit.

282
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,100
Stay upright!

283
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,390
Hello.

284
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
My legs hurt.

285
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,200
It was so nice for the three of us back then.

286
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,050
Wasn't it?

287
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,770
Thank you, Bok Soo.

288
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,000
For staying by my side.
