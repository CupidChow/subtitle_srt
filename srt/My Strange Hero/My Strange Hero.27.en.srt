1
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,500
Then just die.

2
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,860
Just

3
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,430
die there.

4
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,530
Oh Se Ho!

5
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,160
You think everything will get easier if you die.

6
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,800
You think everything will end if you jump from there.

7
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,720
I can assure you

8
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,810
that there's nothing that you can end by dying.

9
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,660
If you jump, you will regret it forever

10
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,390
whether you die or live,

11
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,040
and no one will remember you

12
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,380
because you can never undo

13
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,650
a mistake you made one time.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,020
Oh Se Ho, don't speak nonsense.

15
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,270
As long as you're alive, you can always restart anything.

16
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,020
Chae Min.

17
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,720
Chae Min.

18
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,780
It's not late to live differently.

19
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,080
You'll have another chance.

20
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,310
Hold my hand.

21
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,650
It's okay. Good job.

22
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,160
It's okay.

23
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,360
It's okay now.

24
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,720
Will Chae Min be okay?

25
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,590
He will be fine

26
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,470
and it's a relief.

27
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,670
You were really surprised, weren't you?

28
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,360
How could this situation happen again in front of you?

29
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,160
Nine years ago and now,

30
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,020
why is this something that happens at school

31
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,460
with Lee Chae Min and Oh Se Ho?

32
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,010
The school only pushing for top grades and the misguided parents

33
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,650
don't realize they are ruining their own kids.

34
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,050
This shouldn't happen again.

35
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,190
That's why you are fighting like this now, aren't you?

36
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,890
You caught Chae Min today also.

37
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,940
Is it true that Lee Chae Min really wanted to die?

38
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,840
Everyone knows he stole the answer sheet.

39
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,790
How can he endure that in the ivy class?

40
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,320
He can easily go to the sky class without the answer sheet.

41
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,100
If I did that... ah!

42
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,560
I can't even imagine how it'd feel.

43
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,620
But is the elder involved there again?

44
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,290
Elder will be okay, right?

45
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,590
Where are you going, Yeong Min?

46
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,780
Chae Min.

47
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,850
Seolsong High School

48
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:22,130
At one point, I wanted to do anything to raise my grade.

49
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,570
So are you feeling good

50
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,790
because I am ruined just like you?

51
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,030
Bok Soo told me back then.

52
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,940
He said only we can free our hearts ourselves.

53
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,020
I hope you'll be free, too.

54
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,020
Lee Chae Min, hurry up and come here!

55
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,970
If I was able to save you back then,

56
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,920
would we be different now?

57
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,290
Did you forget?

58
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,310
The one who left go of your hand was me.

59
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,930
Kang Bok Soo.

60
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,250
Help me!

61
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,390
No!

62
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,600
Did you want to run from it?

63
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,590
What do you know?

64
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,340
Don't you think I might have that thought, too?

65
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,860
What are you trying to say?

66
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,130
Don't run away.

67
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,880
Oh Se Ho, you should live differently this time. Don't regret it again.

68
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,210
Is the Seolsong corruption revealed by Kang Bok Soo true?

69
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,360
What did you do with the rebate and bribe money you received?

70
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,620
Is it true that you did all that alone?

71
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,840
I am sorry I caused a society problem.

72
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,110
I'll fully cooperate with the investigation.

73
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,860
How much corruption have you committed?

74
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,580
All vendors are testifying that they paid rebates to Principal Kim Gwi Chang.

75
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,720
You are admitting they were sent to your

76
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,620
and your family members' accounts.

77
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,800
Is this true?

78
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,750
Yes, it's all true.

79
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,210
The amount you embezzled is astronomical.

80
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,120
Why didn't you use a borrowed name for the account?

81
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,860
I was careless on that part.

82
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,460
Kim Gwi Chang, do I look like an idiot?

83
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,880
Who uses their own account for illegal transactions?

84
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,910
I am telling you I did it, so why are you second guessing me?

85
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,440
A large amount embezzlement case is an immediate imprisonment!

86
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,520
Think carefully and reply.

87
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,660
The money was withdrawn on a regular basis. Where did the money go?

88
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,080
Kim Gwi Chang, go home for now.

89
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,890
You are not locking me up?

90
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,420
You are clearly identified and you are admitting your guilt as well.

91
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,050
So I will indict you non-restraint for now.

92
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,570
Yes, thank you.

93
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,940
Is the person who blew the hiring corruption whistle a current teacher of Seolsong High?

94
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,540
Who is it?

95
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,090
Is that the priority?

96
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,270
If you have additional evidence, please bring it to me directly.

97
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,850
Don't expose it on SNS.

98
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,670
Thank you for your cooperation.

99
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,980
Mr. Prosecutor, are you wrapping this up with only investigating the principal?

100
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,750
It is for now.

101
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,510
Do you think it's possible for the principal alone to commit this huge corruption?

102
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,810
The foundation directors— No, I thought at least

103
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,140
you'd investigate the chairperson.

104
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,620
What did he use that huge amount of money on?

105
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,080
All the money was used by the principal personally.

106
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,510
Tens of millions? Do you really think it's possible?

107
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,030
Kang Bok Soo, I will do the investigating.

108
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,710
No, this is too weird.

109
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,600
The world isn't that easy as you think.

110
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,430
This case will be wrapped up like that.

111
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,680
Be careful going home.

112
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,900
Got rejected at once.

113
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,240
Oh Se Ho's mother is quite tough.

114
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,460
She was dancing with swords as soon as she got here.

115
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,350
You guys worked hard.

116
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,960
Since Oh Se Ho got fired, is our mission over, too?

117
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,890
Team Leader Yang Min Ji, we were perfect this time as well.

118
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,270
It's not over yet.

119
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,790
As expected, my Kang Bok Soo.

120
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,870
You are taking the thorny road. We can't end it like this, right?

121
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,950
Yes. Once I start something, I have to see how it ends.

122
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,270
Ultimately, this school is just as rotten as it was nine years ago when

123
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,370
it took Oh Se Ho's words and kicked me out.

124
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,730
No. Perhaps it's even more than that.

125
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,850
The principal did it all alone

126
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,950
makes no sense.

127
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,810
It hasn't been long since Oh Se Ho came back to Korea.

128
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,800
Most of the corruptions happened over 10 years ago, and seeing that prosecutor, I think there was pressure from the top.

129
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,610
Then just who has this wide network?

130
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,600
The principal is ruled out since he volunteered to take responsibility.

131
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,190
Then the end is...

132
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,430
Oh Se Ho's mom, Director Im Se Gyeong.

133
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,400
Thanks for coming despite being busy.

134
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,430
Of course we can't skip out on your business.

135
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,370
We must stick together at times like this.

136
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,020
Indeed, I can trust you assemblyman.

137
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,920
Then, I don't need to worry about the investigation anymore, right?

138
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,800
I already took care of it, so don't worry about it.

139
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,890
I am working on the media, so it'll soon be quiet.

140
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,860
As you know, Seolsong University must be established without a hitch

141
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,660
for your funds to be raised smoothly.

142
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,040
Let's establish Seolsong University and win win together.

143
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,060
Director, Im Se Gyeong

144
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:03,230
Secretary Yoon, reverse everything Se Ho changed. Start with the hires.

145
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,620
Tell them to put the top students from the wildflower class into the ivy class.

146
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,040
I can't believe you were watching the system being ruined.

147
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,820
So soft.

148
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,800
Yes, Ma'am.

149
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:20,790
And Son Soo Jeong. Tell her to come see me.

150
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,070
Administration

151
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,520
Secretary Yoon, you can't do this.

152
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,430
It hasn't been that long since I started in administrative work.

153
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,770
Where is Director Oh Se Ho now?

154
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:38,020
Mr. Kim Myeong Ho, the current owner of Seolsong is the Director Im Se Gyeong.

155
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,280
You can't be doing this to me!

156
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,100
Do you know what I did all this time...?

157
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,170
I won't go down easily.

158
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,070
You guys will be regretting this.

159
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,390
It'll be you who will regret.

160
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:57,710
Did you not know that what you've been doing was all illegal?

161
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,900
If you cause problems, you'll end up taking all the responsibility.

162
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,090
Since the director is on board again,

163
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,550
the school will be stable again.

164
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,730
Let's endure the hardship a little more.

165
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:24,430
Teacher Song! Director said to send Yoon Seung Woo and Oh Yeong Min to the ivy class.

166
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,720
Why those kids?

167
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,910
They don't want to go.

168
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,430
It's not up to me. The blood storm is happening.

169
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,390
You all need to lay low.

170
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,410
Are the kids your toys?! That decision—

171
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,060
You were going to complain, weren't you?! She's looking for you anyway.

172
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,060
Go to her office, Teacher Son.

173
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,960
I am catching on pretty quickly now.

174
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,690
You've called for me, Director?

175
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,740
The prosecution office will contact you soon.

176
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,820
Don't be a witness.

177
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,000
Whistleblower? How dare you in my school?

178
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,600
You shouldn't be like that if you are thinking about Kang Bok Soo, right?

179
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,470
Letter of resignation

180
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:35,100
I've been ready and I broke up with student Kang Bok Soo already.

181
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,880
Since I've submitted a letter of resignation, I don't think you can make threats to Kang Bok Soo using me.

182
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,710
Thanks for taking nice photos.

183
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,130
And please don't speak informally to me.

184
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,420
You should mind your manners.

185
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,850
Take care of this right away.

186
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:08,960
She is quite a moxie. Then, I'll show her another way.

187
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,870
S High School? Kang Bok Soo?

188
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,620
S High School something...

189
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,260
Something big has happened there.

190
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,690
Oh my gosh.

191
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,510
No way.

192
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,550
True identity of Kang Bok Soo/ Kang Bok Soo & female teacher

193
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,800
No way.

194
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,270
Did you see that?!

195
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,240
No, that can't be.

196
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,320
Wow.

197
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,760
No way.

198
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,220
S High School Situation, New Phrase

199
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,510
Kang Bok Soo, the accuser of S High School's corruption, suspicious of an immoral relationship with a female teacher

200
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,180
He was the perpetrator of school violence nine years ago in S High School

201
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,290
The assailant of school violence

202
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,560
Seriously? So he was the one who was responsible for in-school violence?

203
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,990
This is incredible. He's doing this so he can take revenge towards the school?

204
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,140
But why would the assailant of in-school violence take revenge on the school though?

205
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,170
Maybe it's because he's pissed since he got kicked out of the school and all.

206
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,870
Wow, Kang Bok Soo is something.

207
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,230
He completely flipped the school upside down.

208
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,760
Teacher Ma, Teacher Ma!

209
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,020
I am looking at it.

210
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,910
Oh my, what are we going to do now?

211
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,390
Kang Bok Soo, the accuser of the corruption, defamation of one's school with revenge from nine years ago

212
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,610
Defamation of one's school with revenge from nine years ago

213
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,440
Bok Soo, be strong and listen to what I have to say to you.

214
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,100
You know on the internet...

215
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,480
I saw it. And I'm already at school.

216
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,980
I'm really doing alright.

217
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,660
I'll call you.

218
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,580
I'm sorry.

219
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,310
At our school, there are rumors going on about him already.

220
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,710
And there's all kinds of talk about him already.

221
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,630
He already has a reputation for in-school violence.

222
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,840
And so, there are rumors about Bok Soo among the parents of the students at this school.

223
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,660
Would he be able to adapt?

224
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,620
Other students are already scared of him.

225
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,390
Wouldn't it be better for him to just take a GED exam?

226
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,350
Please, sir.

227
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,420
Just this once, sir.

228
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,860
Elder!

229
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,890
What are you doing here?

230
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,040
What the? Why are you spacing out like that?

231
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,550
You looking serious doesn't suit you at all. Let's go already.

232
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,590
Shall we go now?

233
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,510
Let's go.

234
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,270
- Let's get going, sir.
- But you should put your hand down.

235
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,220
Should I?

236
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,040
What the heck? I thought you guys were super close.

237
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,540
Seung Woo, come here.

238
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,550
I thought I was going to freaking die.

239
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,780
Let's go.

240
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,600
Suspicion over the genuineness of Kang Bok Soo's whistle-blowing intention

241
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,050
Kang Bok Soo is truly incredible.

242
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,350
So he planned everything before coming back to the school?

243
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,390
I knew it when he came back to school with his own two feet.

244
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:24,160
Teacher, we don't even know if this whole thing is true or not though.

245
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,050
Why wouldn't it be true?

246
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:32,520
It is true that Kang Bok Soo got expelled for being violent in school.

247
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,320
He put the school through this so he could take revenge for goodness sake.

248
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,440
I wonder if this news article is true?

249
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,060
The one who is responsible for violence in the school, huh? He didn't look like a guy like that.

250
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,970
But he almost murdered a person though.

251
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,780
He pushed off an innocent kid for crying out loud.

252
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,640
He is planning to ruin the school for goodness sake.

253
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,880
Bok Soo!

254
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,380
He's not that kind of kid!

255
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,610
Bok Soo, the Kang Bok Soo that I know

256
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,350
is more of an adult than the teachers here.

257
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:12,770
You should all know what Kang Bok Soo did for the school!

258
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,920
He saved Oh Yeong Min from that glass booth and changed the kids from the wildflower class.

259
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,370
You should all know if you have went into the wildflower class to teach those kids.

260
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,740
He is not trying to ruin the school.

261
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,770
But instead he is actually trying to save the school that's already going under, don't you understand that?

262
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:41,350
Who is that female teacher that Kang Bok Soo is dating anyway?

263
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,690
Hyung, how can you get caught like that?

264
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,900
We worked so hard to protect that secret you know.

265
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,540
Huh? What?

266
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,350
Stop acting already.

267
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,810
No I mean, what are you talking about—

268
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:27,120
You guys all knew it too?

269
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,960
The way God Soo Jeong does her make up has changed completely. I'm not stupid.

270
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,360
I know, right? He was looking like this and sending her little notes like this.

271
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,310
I was trying so hard to pretend that I didn't know anything back then.

272
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,160
Hyung, my acting was super good back then, huh?

273
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,710
I wonder how they were staring at each other with their lovesick googly eyes?

274
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,390
But my lovely device here has it all recorded.

275
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,600
- When did you find out?
- Me?

276
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,190
When my uncle brought the auntie...

277
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,360
I meant, he brought God Soo Jeong over to the house,

278
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,430
and he put her to sleep in Mom's room.

279
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,750
What?!

280
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,420
Wow!

281
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,140
You little!

282
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,080
That's incredible!

283
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,200
What the? So Teacher Soo Jung and this old man are dating now?!

284
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,620
You didn't know?

285
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,020
You all knew?!

286
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,250
Man, I was the last one to find out about anything again.

287
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,490
- Was it that obvious?
- Yes.

288
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,190
Totally.

289
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:22,450
Why aren't you guys asking about that? The thing from nine years ago.

290
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,730
My uncle is not the kind of man that they say in news articles and stuff.

291
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,380
I know, man.

292
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,990
Do we really have to ask that?

293
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:38,250
I know what kind of guy he is after he saved me from that glass booth.

294
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,930
You should just worry about your relationship that's in crisis at the moment.

295
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,120
We already broke up, so don't worry.

296
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,490
You don't have to lie to us since we all found out about it anyway.

297
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,810
I'm being serious!

298
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,910
Fine, who cares. I guess this old man is embarrassed or something.

299
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,680
Since that's what he wants, let's just pretend not to know it.

300
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,940
Go now.

301
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,640
Go back to your seats, all of you.

302
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,160
It's for good times.

303
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,990
What good is it?

304
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,900
What are you doing?

305
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,950
That's so freaking...
