1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,460
Hey, who is on cleaning duty? We need to clean up together,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,580
and I think we need to have it inspected.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,390
Me.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,100
I'll do the cleaning and the inspection check,

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,710
so you can leave, Yoon Seong Woo. Go.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,570
Go, goodbye.

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,520
You and God Soo Jeong will probably be alone together for the inspection.

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,740
Yoon Seung Woo, you talk funny.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,160
- Go now, go.
- Let go of it.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,080
I don't know about you, Elder, but I don't make God Soo Jeong cry.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,220
Well I also hate seeing Soo Jeong cry—

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,290
Hold on, why would you?

13
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,950
Why would you care about her crying?

14
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,770
Why do you think?

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,870
Well, I don't know.

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,300
To add in a rival.

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,970
Step it up, Elder.

18
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,010
Are you guys done cleaning?

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,470
What is this? Why are you alone?

20
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,380
The other one on duty is Yoon Seung Woo.

21
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,330
Did you clean well?

22
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,280
Of course.

23
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:40,270
I'm just so diligent and

24
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,460
so intelligent.

25
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,510
I even got a debate award.

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,990
Is there no prize, Teacher?

27
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,460
Is there really no prize?

28
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,150
Are you crazy? What if we get caught by someone again?

29
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,630
This is a school and you're wearing a uniform.

30
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,590
Is my uniform the problem?

31
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,240
Where should we go now? Do you have anything you want to do?

32
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,350
There is somewhere I want to go with you.

33
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,700
Where is it? Let's go now.

34
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,220
Will you be okay?

35
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,720
Where is it?

36
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,600
You're the front gate, right?

37
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,080
The front gate? Gate? Ah!

38
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,580
Yes! I am! I am the pink front gate man!

39
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,880
This rotten bast***!

40
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,160
Because of that bright pink... when I think about how it rattled my head whenever I walked past it...

41
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,900
This punk, I ought to...

42
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,290
What's with the pink? So senseless.

43
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,770
Our grandma usually talks gracefully.

44
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,680
Is it genetic?

45
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,040
So are you earning money?

46
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,620
A man shouldn't let his wife starve.

47
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,320
I am confident that I will never let her starve no matter how much she eats.

48
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,070
Gambling or being a womanizer—

49
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,090
I don't do that.

50
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,270
You don't lend money to anyone, do you?

51
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,320
I don't even lend to my family.

52
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,400
Are you confident that you won't disappear into thin air

53
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,580
and hurt her like her father did?

54
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,410
Why aren't you answering?

55
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,410
I will never, ever leave her alone.

56
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,780
That good, that's enough.

57
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,290
He's perfect husband material.

58
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:15,230
Soo Jeong, let me marry him.

59
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,010
Hey, sit down.

60
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,460
Hello.

61
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,670
Our Korean teacher is God Soo Jeong, and right now is geography class.

62
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,440
Gye So Ra, you know what class this is?

63
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,890
Your geography teacher is sick and couldn't come in today, so I'm your supervising teacher for self-study.

64
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,550
So be quiet and self-study.

65
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,680
These guys!

66
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,760
Teacher, thank you.

67
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
For what?

68
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,170
Our debate. You made an official complaint, and that's why our awards were returned to us.

69
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,490
Okay, good. I wasn't going to say anything, but I will now.

70
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,890
These guys. You don't study!

71
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,860
You fight with the ivy class!

72
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,870
One person always just films videos!

73
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,300
Unauthorized entry into the broadcasting room! Unauthorized broadcasting!

74
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,410
You punks. Don't you think you are saying you don't care at this level?!

75
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,910
There are rules to keep at school and manners to keep towards teachers.

76
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,900
These kids. Where did you learn all these bad manners?!

77
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,340
Up to this point is my official statement.

78
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,860
What's the unofficial announcement?

79
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,520
You did well.

80
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,590
You guys did well.

81
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,570
That old man knows how to startle people.

82
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,980
He's a fox. An old fox.

83
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,920
You guys are grown up now.

84
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,390
That's right. That's what it means to be an adult.

85
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,680
You don't close your eyes, don't pretend to not see, and you see what is upright.

86
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,060
Seeing what's wrong and fixing it.

87
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,590
That's being an adult.

88
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,410
Having said that, compared to the guys in the class way over there,

89
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,650
you guys are fifty thousand times better. You did well.

90
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,310
Like you guys say "epic," good job.

91
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,110
So study a bit now instead.

92
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,350
I don't like to study though.

93
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,850
Subject Excellence
English

94
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,360
Ivy class

95
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,640
No... it wasn't enough to pick out the winner even before the competition started,

96
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,980
they even made an award certificate?

97
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,850
I found it well, right?

98
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,480
They are just giving it all to the ivy class students.

99
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,730
But I'm really curious.

100
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,330
Why is Lee Chae Min so important that he could pressure the school to change the winner for the debate competition?

101
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,770
And even though Oh Yeong Min took the first hit, he became the offender.

102
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,000
Is a school like that normal?

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,220
There must be a huge stinking deal between the school and parents.

104
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,360
It's not a school, but a business.

105
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,410
Their method of siphoning the money is the same.

106
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,740
We need to turn this upside down.

107
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,660
What are you guys talking about right now?

108
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,930
What is all this?

109
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,220
Award for excellence (expected)?

110
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,270
English Language Competition
Award for Excellence

111
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,620
CEO, your intuition was slow at the crucial moment.

112
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,680
I don't know either.

113
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,950
What should we do? I think the shock of this is overwhelming him.

114
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,610
Deposit Statement

115
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,940
Guys, is this all true?

116
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,550
Teacher, you're surprised, aren't you?

117
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,830
We're still looking for evidence.

118
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:13,680
We'll uncover it and make them pay for the wrong.

119
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,660
The Honor Roll

120
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:24,820
This isn't something you guys should do. I'm embarrassed.

121
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,890
Teacher.

122
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,330
Indictment Bill
Park Dong Joon

123
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:10,610
Complaint about Seolsong School's corruption

124
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm totally surprised by your sudden visit without any warning.

125
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,160
An administrative audit should be done without a warning.

126
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,610
If you were aware of it in advance, that would be more of a problem.

127
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,750
Oh, that. Of course.

128
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,170
Who was it? Who was it!

129
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,720
Who made the report to the Department of Education?

130
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,440
It was me.

131
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:55,590
Teacher Park, if you have the time to make complaints, prepare for your classes properly.

132
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,950
Your teaching evaluation was as low as one point.

133
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,740
Do you think it's only the teachers that evaluate the students?

134
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,240
Take a look at this and spend some time on self-reflection.

135
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,000
Staff Personnel Performance Evaluation

136
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
His teaching methods are so old-fashioned that I can't focus.

137
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,690
Thanks to him, I'm able to study for my other classes during his class.

138
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,000
Please make him retire early.

139
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,190
So you are saying Teacher Park wrote a letter of complaint to the department of education?

140
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,630
Yes.

141
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,380
This man is short-fused, so he can't tolerate injustice.

142
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,050
He probably thought the school can't be like this because it involves the students' affairs.

143
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,720
So is Teacher Park totally on the bad side?

144
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,280
Since his performance evaluation was low...

145
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,650
I think the ivy class students terrorized him on the evaluation survey.

146
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,910
It's retaliation over the debate competition.

147
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,720
How is this man surrounded by enemies?

148
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,270
What will you do now, Teacher?

149
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,610
Are you saying the wildflower class in the complaint letter already received the award back after correction?

150
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,870
Yes, the school discovered the error first and made the necessary measures already.

151
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,150
I am sorry we wasted your time.

152
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:18,240
The complaint wasn't just about the school's violation over a teacher's right pertaining to an in-school competition.

153
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,680
- Since we received the complaint, we must investigate it.
- Gosh.

154
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,750
Don't be like this. Let's solve the problem by talking. By talking.

155
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,580
Hello.

156
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,340
Director.

157
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,940
I'm Seolsong High's Director, Im Se Kyeong.

158
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,270
During the time I left, there seems to be a communication mistake.

159
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,560
Would you like to answer it?

160
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,760
Hello.

161
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,580
Yes. Yes.

162
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,300
Yes?

163
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,050
I'll take care of it that way.

164
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,410
My apology.

165
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,320
I should have checked it more. I'm sorry.

166
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,500
Don't mention it. Sorry to have you come out in your busy schedule.

167
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,540
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,230
Let's go.

169
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,660
Excuse me. Are you leaving like this?

170
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,430
The evidence is lacking.

171
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,640
That's why you are here to find that evidence, right?

172
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,250
Teacher Park Dong Joon, what is it that you want from us?

173
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,030
What do you mean?

174
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,340
There isn't anything we can do.

175
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,320
I am sorry. But even if you face it head-on in the future, the answer will be the same.

176
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,300
But...

177
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,360
Excuse me...

178
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,950
But...

179
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,020
Go leave again. I prepared everything for you.

180
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,590
You always... try to kick me out.

181
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,970
As expected, I shouldn't have put you in that seat.

182
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,750
Complaint letter?

183
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,690
Don't put a blemish on my school and get out at once!

184
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,820
It looks like you're confused.

185
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,990
This is my school right now, Mother.

186
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,060
You've gone crazy, haven't you!?

187
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,800
I've been crazy for a long time!

188
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,100
How could I not be crazy under the likes of you?

189
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,940
Oh Se Ho!

190
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,230
I still have things to do at this school.

191
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,770
If you want to kick me out, wait... or steal it from me.

192
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,910
You are acting quite like my child.

193
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,720
Don't say "my child."

194
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,990
You're not qualified to say that.

195
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,540
Have you ever done anything without my help?

196
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,620
What can you do?

197
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,780
Director Oh Se Ho

198
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,830
President of student government candidate application

199
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,120
What's this?

200
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,620
Let's participate together. This will be good for college acceptances.

201
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,970
Things like this are burdensome.

202
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,230
Will the vice president okay? I'll do the work needed as president.

203
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,790
You want to?

204
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,540
That's good. Then I'll support you well, President.

205
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,210
What? I'm already the president?

206
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,360
What, what, what is this? What are you doing with Oh Se Ho? I want to do it too.

207
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,550
Kang Bok Soo, how could you be the president of the student government?

208
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,580
Have you ever seen the school's last place be the president of the student body?

209
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,260
Shi... so this is how you want to play...

210
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,890
I am normally a very humble person who does not brag,

211
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:43,140
but today is a special day, so I will brag about myself.

212
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,400
That's right.

213
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,080
I... really can't study.

214
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,840
But... I'm handsome.

215
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,830
That's true!

216
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,450
I knew he'd say that!

217
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,200
That crazy thing...

218
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,100
A president who can't study well but is handsome. Don't you think it's cool?

219
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,200
A president who can't study well but will not ignore a friend who is in danger.

220
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,210
A president who can't study well but won't take injustice.

221
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,050
A president who can't study well but has a kind heart.

222
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,390
The president who can show you that simply not being a good student is not a failure in life.

223
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,290
That's why... a president who can be of strength to my friends.

224
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,360
I will become that kind of president.

225
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,990
Seolsong High vote for the president of the student body.

226
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,660
Attention.

227
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,020
Today, I am feeling enormous pride about

228
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,270
the technique I've been using in my teaching.

229
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:13,320
Why? Because the president of the student body is from our class!

230
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,010
Thank you, everybody. This is all thanks to you.

231
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,660
Bok Soo, it's not you. Sit down please.

232
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,280
It's not you. Not you punk.

233
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,380
Oh Se Ho. It's Se Ho. Stand up.

234
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,070
- Why?
- Soo Jeong, stand up.

235
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,610
The two of you, looking forward to your services. Do a good job. Applause!

236
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,320
But still... because I won.

237
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,640
I'm back home.

238
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,610
Mother, I became the president of the student body today—

239
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,820
What exactly do you do right?!

240
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Why are you like this, Mother?

241
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,580
I became the president of the student body today.

242
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,210
You? You lost to him.

243
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,640
The school's last place, Kang Bok Soo. He's the president of the student body.

244
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,930
What are you saying?

245
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,430
Did you manipulate the voting results?

246
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:47,800
Do I have to see my son losing to someone like him?

247
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,920
The school's first place lost to a low-income welfare student.

248
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,050
You lost the position of student body president to a stupid idiot.

249
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,060
How could... How could someone like you be my son?

250
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,490
You're my shame! Shame!

251
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,800
Then what about you? How could...

252
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,280
How could a person like you be my mother?

253
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,000
What?

254
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,320
If I was really your son... even though I'm lacking and a fool,

255
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,620
at least you should love me!

256
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,810
My mother treats me like trash, so who would like me?

257
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:31,430
I also... I also hate myself so much!

258
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,570
Sojeonggak

259
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,660
That's my son's.

260
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,030
Why... only me?

261
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,890
That's what you're going to become when you eat a lot, okay?

262
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,220
Okay, okay, okay.

263
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,380
Bok Soo, I think I really am a flawed person.

264
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,700
I really don't like you.

265
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,120
I despise you.

266
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,410
If it weren't for you,

267
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,180
I wouldn't be going through

268
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,060
this kind of feeling.

269
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,270
Mother.

270
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,220
Bok Soo... Kang Bok Soo...

271
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,640
Kang Bok Soo was the one who pushed you, right?

272
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:18,000
Kang Bok Soo was the one who pushed you off right there, isn't it?

273
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,320
Well... yeah.

274
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,330
Ms. Director, Bok Soo isn't the type of kid who would do such a thing.

275
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,600
He's not the type of kid who would hurt Se Ho like that.

276
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,060
You should ask Se Ho aga—

277
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:48,720
Are you implying that my kid is lying?

278
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,530
Please inform the wildflower class on the process of transferring.

279
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,690
But Director, this is a bit too extreme though.

280
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,670
Do it right away. I think I gave you plenty of time to do this.

281
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,590
But still...

282
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,900
Yes, sir.

283
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,330
Let's go.

284
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,820
The bill of indictment is Teacher Park's work, isn't that right?

285
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,790
Yes, I heard that he admitted it himself.

286
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,270
Let's go and see Teacher Park Dong Joon.

287
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,550
If he has so much to say, he should come and say it directly himself.

288
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,050
I used to be his student, and he is making me feel so disappointed now.

289
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,730
Attention! Attention!

290
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,410
I came here to deliver a message for the director.

291
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,650
Especially for the wildflower class, the director wants to

292
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,120
start a transfer program with the recommendation of the school principal.

293
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,720
And he would like to proceed with the process.

294
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,060
Transfer program?

295
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,900
You mean, us?

296
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,910
So you want us to go to another school?

297
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,020
Basically, yes.

298
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,270
For your academic reports, it could be more advantageous for you to go somewhere

299
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:56,960
where the academic standard is lower than to stay here at Seolsong High School.

300
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,650
For students that don't really want to attend college after high school,

301
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:04,250
you could go to a vocational school to get the kind of job training you need.

302
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,010
That's basically what I'm saying here.

303
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,000
Did you all understand what I'm getting at here?

304
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,820
We will send you a notice separately for more details on the process.

305
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,970
What if we don't want to leave, then what?

306
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,340
Well, that is...

307
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,930
Teacher, I would like to just stay here.

308
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,110
Yeong Min, you can just go to the sky class.

309
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,590
No, I would like to just stay here in the wildflower class.

310
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,980
Teacher, I would also like to just graduate as a wildflower class student.

311
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,460
People like us don't have to leave, right?

312
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,520
The process for the transfer program has already been decided.

313
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,960
We are also planning tours of the schools that we are affiliated with and meetings with parents.

314
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,080
Please select a school that you hope to go to by referring to the notification document.

315
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,580
I would like to emphasize once again that this is all for your own good.

316
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,760
It's to give you an open chance for the better.

317
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,700
Well then, I must get going now.

318
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,260
What the heck?

319
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,910
He's saying all this fancy stuff, but what he's really saying is that they want to get rid of us here.

320
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:36,030
I bet my mom would be happy to hear the news of me transferring.

321
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:44,280
Oh Se Ho, you jerk. So you've finally come to the decision to kick us out, huh?

322
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,800
Teacher Park.

323
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,670
Yes, Director.

324
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:11,660
It seems like you really don't like how things are at the school.

325
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,620
In the word "teacher" (seon saeng), seon means "before" and saeng means "to be born."

326
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,690
Just like the literal meaning of the word, teacher means a person who was born before the person who's learning.

327
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,890
As a person that's walking this path before the children ever will,

328
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:31,480
I think it's important to know along which path to lead them.

329
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,490
The kids tend to follow the exact path that was paved by someone who has walked it before.

330
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:43,560
Teacher Park, can you guarantee that the path you are walking on will benefit the kids?

331
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,520
I don't know if it will benefit them or not,

332
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,080
but I know that at least it will be a path that they won't have to be ashamed of.

333
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,270
I'm pretty sure the kids are aware of that too.

334
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,150
Yes, I do understand your educational philosophy.

335
00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:00,330
But, Teacher, does this school belong to you?!

336
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,570
Our Seolsong...

337
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:14,110
I mean, if you really hate my dear Seolsong, you can just get out.

338
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:20,490
I really do hope that there is a school that fits your educational philosophy here in the Republic of Korea!

339
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,630
I thought that this would be hard for you to write yourself, so I did your work for you.

340
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,040
All you have to do is sign it.

341
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,430
Resignation Letter: Park Dong Joon

342
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,510
Please consider this as a last courtesy from your old student.

343
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,570
As the director of this school,

344
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,530
I will dismiss Teacher Park Dong Joon as of today.

345
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,390
Director, this kind of educational system isn't good for the kids.

346
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,930
The true education that you are talking about is dead.

347
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,980
Teacher Park, you always cry about the sincerity of education,

348
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,750
but the truth is that it's nothing but a pipe dream.

349
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,090
I know about that more than anyone else. You know it too, don't you?

350
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,560
You, to someone...

351
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,290
That's right, you might have been a genuine teacher to Kang Bok Soo,

352
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,380
but to me, you were not.

353
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,050
Se Ho...

354
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:26,750
Teacher Park Dong Joon, I am living proof that your educational philosophy is a failure.

355
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,590
I was your student then, but that boy is dead now.

356
00:29:58,890 --> 00:29:59,810
No, Teacher!

357
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,090
Don't interfere with this, Son Soo Jeong!

358
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,270
Resignation Letter

359
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,320
Director Oh Se Ho.

360
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,530
You are not the owner of this school, okay?

361
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:01,050
My Strange Hero

362
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,310
Would it work if I improved my grades?

363
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,460
I will take your offer. I look forward to it even though it's going to be impossible.

364
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,860
Let's all study.

365
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,520
I can become your dad, your older brother, and even your husband.

366
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,260
So many bad things are happening.

367
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,830
But I'm not afraid like I used to be.

368
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,170
I'm sorry for not being able to take care of you then.

369
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,430
How would things change now? We can't go back and change it anymore.

370
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,890
Are you regretting what happened in the past?

371
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,000
You can sleep over. Are you just going to fall asleep while holding my hand?

372
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,370
I was really trying to endure it, but I won't be able to because of you.

373
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,530
You can't do this to Bok Soo.

374
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,130
Bok Soo didn't do anything wrong.

375
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,120
You keep on mentioning Kang Bok Soo till the bitter end. I'm really disappointed in you.

376
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,500
Your sacrifice will seriously make anyone tear up.

377
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,780
I will expel Kang Bok Soo who is related to this incident.
