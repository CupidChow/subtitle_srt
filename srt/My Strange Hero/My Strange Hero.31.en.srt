1
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,370
You got something incorrect, Prosecutor.

2
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,230
What is it?

3
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,700
I wasn't managing Im Se Gyeong's slush funds, but

4
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,930
I managed the whole thing from the beginning.

5
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,330
What did you say?

6
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:58,880
The culprit behind everything related to the corruption of Seolsong High is not Im Se Gyeong but me.

7
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,970
I am telling you it was me.

8
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,680
Come out! I have something to say. Give me a moment.

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,840
Let go!

10
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,040
Oh Se Ho!

11
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,440
Let go.

12
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,880
I said let go!

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,890
Kang Bok Soo, why are you like this?

14
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,690
Were you lying that you did all the corruption, huh?!

15
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,730
Let me be.

16
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,710
It has nothing to do with you.

17
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,100
You're going to take responsibility for everything?

18
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,900
Yes, this is the best that I can do!

19
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,440
You selfish punk!

20
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,440
Why do you only know yourself?

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,080
This isn't taking responsibility but making the situation more serious.

22
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,650
Is it important to prevent the school's closing by agreeing to a dirty trade with your mom?

23
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,930
Then, how about that school?

24
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,530
It will be in your mom's hands again.

25
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,920
You tried to protect Seolsong High. Wasn't that why gave me all the data?

26
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,020
That was not the right way to take responsibility.

27
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,320
Through lies, you can't save yourself nor the school.

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,720
Snap out of it, Oh Se Ho.

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,030
Kang Bok Soo, Oh Se Ho already confessed that he is the culprit behind Seolsong High's corruption.

30
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,020
It's definitely not Oh Se Ho.

31
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,530
Your testimony has no meaning at the moment.

32
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,720
It was Oh Se Ho who gave me the information

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,410
on how Seolsong's corrupted funds have been used.

34
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,870
If you need me to, I will reveal everything.

35
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,870
Oh Se Ho is not the culprit of this corruption

36
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,830
but the informant.

37
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,690
Perjury?

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,860
What Kang Bok Soo said is true.

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,180
What is the meaning of what Kang Bok Soo said earlier?

40
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,620
Director Im Se Gyeong made a deal with me.

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,520
From now on, I will tell you the truth.

42
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,650
This time, did you tell the truth?

43
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,110
The closure of school will be approved.

44
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,290
That woman has connections in the education department as well as in the political world.

45
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,360
What are you planning to do?

46
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,760
It's not over yet.

47
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,490
How do you feel now?

48
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,050
What is your plan for Seolsong High?

49
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,360
Is it true that Director Oh Se Ho masterminded the corruption?

50
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,260
Can you please share your future plan?

51
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,060
Of my son's wrongdoing... As his mother...

52
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,430
I am in agony over my deep responsibility.

53
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,680
I will cooperate with the police investigation so that he will be severely punished.

54
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,240
Also, just as all this is rooted in my lack of merit,

55
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,310
with the mind of vomiting blood,

56
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,520
the one that is like my child.

57
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,010
I give up Seolsong High.

58
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,680
I apologize for that.

59
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,050
Seolsong High School: Petition for objection to school closing.

60
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,690
Seolsong High School: Petition for objection to school closing.

61
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,710
Seolsong High School: Petition for objection to school closing.

62
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,320
Let's go.

63
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,400
I heard that Seolsong High School's closing is approved. Does that make sense?

64
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,580
There are hundreds of students.

65
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,640
How can the education board cause this kind of damage to the students?

66
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,900
The public is using this opportunity to call for a tighter mandate for private schools.

67
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,980
The education board needs to follow the public sentiment.

68
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,300
We are finishing the sale documents, so put a rush on the school appraisal as well.

69
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,380
Yes, I understand.

70
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,410
Wait. Closing the school isn't the answer.

71
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,530
How can the corruption of one person in the foundation

72
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,710
cause the innocent students to be kicked out of school?

73
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,350
Selling the school...

74
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,920
That's exactly what Director Im Se Gyeong wants.

75
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,490
We should tell the citizens.

76
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,090
Wait.

77
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,440
Director.

78
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,850
Seolsong's closing!

79
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,910
We are against it! We are against it!

80
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,000
The school!

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,580
Belongs to the students! Belongs to the students!

82
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,320
Seolsong's closing!

83
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,350
We're against it! We're against it!

84
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,340
The school!

85
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,060
Belongs to the students! Belongs to the students!

86
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,560
Okay, secret weapon is complete.

87
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,500
How about we just set the place on fire with gasoline?

88
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,980
No, this brother of yours is anti-violence. Never.

89
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,700
Hyung, they're here.

90
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,450
Appraisal? They told you to figure out a price for the school?

91
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,150
The foundation has made the decision to sell it, and the Department of Education has granted permission.

92
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,540
Who said they can?

93
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,850
The kids are still going to school, so who can sell it?

94
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,810
The owner is selling it so we're just doing our job.

95
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,980
Move away.

96
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,880
You can't!

97
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,850
Never!

98
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,340
Never.

99
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,350
You can't!

100
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,620
Go back.

101
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,030
Never.

102
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,110
I feel very sad to see you guys like this.

103
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:16,300
I am very sorry that I could not protect our precious Seolsong because of my son's wrongdoing.

104
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:23,710
However, it can't be that you are trying to interfere with the execution of government duty, right?

105
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:33,120
I believe you will cooperate with me to beautifully end Seolsong.

106
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,190
Let's go inside.

107
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,950
Move!

108
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,380
School is not a place to be bought and sold like a corporation.

109
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,050
It belongs to us and it's about all of our livelihoods.

110
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,710
You should know that what you're doing is stomping on all the children that are supposed to be like your sons and daughters.

111
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,960
Please go back, all of you.

112
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:35,860
Ms. Director, so please don't stomp on the children that are like growing flowers.

113
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:06,260
Kang Bok Soo, you tainted the name of this Seolsong High School,

114
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,290
but it seems like you are disliking the fact that the school is going to be closing down soon.

115
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,750
Kang Bok Soo, who is standing right here, is responsible for causing this mess.

116
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,630
Before he made our school fall apart like this,

117
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,270
our Seolsong High School had made remarkable progress over and over again.

118
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,490
You are all aware, aren't you?

119
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,410
Through selection and concentration

120
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,440
which provides the most excellent system to only the outstanding students of the bunch!

121
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,430
If Seolsong High School does close down, then all of you will end up blaming this all on Kang Bok Soo.

122
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,500
It's because there is no other school that is special like our Seolsong High School anywhere in our nation!

123
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,830
No, ma'am. You are just doing nothing but stomping on everything.

124
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,190
You are doing that to your beloved Seolsong High School and even to your son Oh Se Ho.

125
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,850
Don't compare that loser kid to my beloved Seolsong High.

126
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,940
No, they are no different.

127
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,530
It might seem okay on the outside, but they are both so damaged on the inside.

128
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:54,130
Ms. Im Se Gyeong, both Seolsong High and your son Oh Se Ho aren't mere objects that you can do with whatever you want.

129
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,980
What I'm saying is, they are not your possessions that you can just toss away when you're done with them and sell them off!

130
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,400
This belongs to me! Get out of my school!

131
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,860
I will never move away!

132
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,050
This school belongs to every one of us here. It's not yours.

133
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,380
What are you all doing?!

134
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,620
Aren't you going in?!

135
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,500
If you step away now, are you going to take responsibility for everything?!

136
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,750
This is our school!

137
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,830
I beg of you.

138
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,930
Please, don't kick us out!

139
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,580
The Department of Education has already approved of this,

140
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,300
so please move away or you'll get hurt.

141
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,270
We are just following orders from the top.

142
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,780
Let us go already.

143
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,070
No, you can't!

144
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,500
It's our school!

145
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,930
Ms. Im Se Gyeong,

146
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,110
according to the law on additional punishment for specific economic crimes,

147
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,640
you are arrested and charged with the embezzlement of your business.

148
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,340
You have the right to hire an attorney to go against this claim.

149
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,110
I clearly told you that wasn't my doing and my son's the one that's accountable for all this.

150
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,330
Mr. Oh Se Ho has changed the content of his testimony.

151
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,160
He said that you are the main culprit of this whole corruption scandal.

152
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,590
What did you say?!

153
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,130
Kang Bok Soo, this is because of you, isn't it? You told him about then—

154
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,950
Look here, Ms. Im Se Gyeong, there is nobody by your side now.

155
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:46,120
Ms. Director, the thing that has to disappear isn't this school,

156
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,790
but it's you, ma'am.

157
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,110
Take her.

158
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,580
No! I said, no! Let go of me!

159
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,660
Let go of me!

160
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,770
Let go of me! This is my school.

161
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,340
I said it's my school! I poured my whole life into this, so it's my school!

162
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,070
I said it's my school! It's my school, so I have the right to whatever I want with it!

163
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,140
So how dare you lowlifes tell me what to do?!

164
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,610
You are all worse than little insects!

165
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,350
I'm never going to let you just have your way at all! Never!

166
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:14,190
Ms. Im Se Gyeong, I'm not the one who makes any kind of judgment of you,

167
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,700
but it will be the people who have been watching you all this time.

168
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,220
- Goodbye.
- You—

169
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,750
No, this can't be.

170
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,580
- Let's go!
- No! No!

171
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,510
Let go of me! I told you to let me go!

172
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,290
Let go of me! Let go of me!

173
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,890
I told you to let me go!

174
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,160
How dare you lowlifes tell me what to do?! You are all worse than little insects!

175
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,120
Oh...

176
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,280
This is something else.

177
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,100
Ms. Im Se Gyeong.

178
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,960
Shocking News: Director Im of Seolsong High unmasked. She is responsible for the school's corruption scandal.

179
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,060
People's petition on the Blue House site?

180
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,090
This is incredible!

181
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,650
I know, right?

182
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,880
You all saw them freeze up after watching me plead to them so passionately, right?

183
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,550
I guess they couldn't do anything about it after looking at my beautiful sparkling eyes.

184
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,620
Don't be ridiculous. They backed down because of this you know.

185
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,960
You know that we were all so cool, right?

186
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,600
If I could have, I really wanted just to go get a garbage can and dump it on her.

187
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,090
No, we did well.

188
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,090
This is a nice picture indeed.

189
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,450
But I wonder if anything will change since Ms. Director got arrested and all.

190
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,190
Hey, look at this, check this out!

191
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,520
People's Petition and Suggestions

192
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,310
Huh? Blue House? Petition?

193
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,620
Two hundred thousand?!
Bossy private foundation tries to kick students out of school. Please help stop Seolsong High's closing.

194
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,680
Wow!

195
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,730
This morning, Seolsong High School's director, Ms. Im Se Gyeong

196
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,290
was arrested for embezzling money through her school

197
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,190
according to the law on additional punishment for specific economic crimes.

198
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,920
While Director Im was being investigated,

199
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,690
she falsely testified that it was her son Oh Se Ho who was accountable for everything.

200
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,930
She is being rebuked by the public for her character more than for her actual crime.

201
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,220
Give that to me. I'll do it.

202
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,000
Seriously, girl.

203
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,840
Mom! Teacher Soo Jeong, please come over here!

204
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,660
Why? What's going on? What's up?

205
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:50,760
One million people signed the petition against closing down Seolsong High School on the Blue House website.

206
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,860
The Departent of Education approved of the public petition that was signed

207
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,590
and decided to cancel the closure of Seolsong High School after all.

208
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:01,420
Seolsong High School will start firing all the teachers who were revealed during the public hearing to be involved with the scandal .

209
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,980
And the school will be temporarily managed by the Department of Education.

210
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,430
Due to Seolsong High School's corruption scandal,

211
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:10,650
people are saying that there is too much authority and power in the private school sectors.

212
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,720
According to the public opinion, there are a growing number of people wanting the legislation for private schools to change.

213
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,880
Next news.

214
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,800
I heard you're going abroad again.

215
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,430
Yes.

216
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:34,940
Only if you listen to my favor.

217
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,890
What is it?

218
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:44,730
Teacher, please be Seolsong High's Principal.

219
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,000
Se Ho, I just now began new work.

220
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,210
It's gone under the supervision of the court, so the temporary directors will take care of management.

221
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,580
Being a teacher suits you well, Teacher.

222
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,640
A teacher who is together with the students.

223
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:12,920
I want you to look over and lead Seolsong High to be better than now.

224
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,380
You said you wanted to help me.

225
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,210
Oh Se Ho!

226
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,670
You're running away again? Huh?

227
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,180
Cowardly fool.

228
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,780
If I met you, I wanted to go on my knees.

229
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,330
Go and do that then. You are all talk.

230
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,970
But it's not like I can reclaim your life by doing that.

231
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,280
You know well.

232
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:11,780
I committed an irreversible wrong, and I don't want to console myself that apologizing is enough.

233
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,950
So loathe and hate me, Kang Bok Soo.

234
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,010
Is that really all you have to say? Why did you do those things to me?

235
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,390
I really, no matter how much I think about it, I have no idea why you did that?

236
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,270
I really don't know!

237
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,740
I wanted to become you.

238
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,570
- What?
- I was so jealous of you.

239
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,340
And because I was jealous, I resented you.

240
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,250
Every time I saw you, I became pathetic.

241
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,260
You had no wrong. It's because I'm all wrong.

242
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:58,630
During all this time, I've committed too many wrongs against you.

243
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:04,270
I'm really... sorry.

244
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,020
Se Ho.

245
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,600
Knowing my temper, I want to beat you up till you die but you're right.

246
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,000
Like you said, it doesn't mean my old days would be made up.

247
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,350
But... I.... can't forgive you.

248
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,420
Even so, you should forgive yourself.

249
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:38,450
Because only you know how difficult it was and how hurt you were.

250
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,930
Rosenberg said this. "There are no bad people in this world."

251
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,460
"There are only lonely people."

252
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,920
I'm telling you again, but I can never forgive you.

253
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,930
Go.

254
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,930
Leave. Live well or not.

255
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,000
Do whatever you want. Go!

256
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,130
Teach, the stuff you told me to do yesterday.

257
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,970
I am Seolsong High's Principal, Park Dong Joon.

258
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,470
You guys did well in protecting this school with your strength.

259
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,580
Thank you.

260
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,770
And during those times, because of the actions of bad adults,

261
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,690
you got hurt and had a hard time.

262
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,220
I would like to apologize on behalf of everybody.

263
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,290
From now on, Seolsong High will be different.

264
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:01,590
The glass booths and all the equipment will be used fairly via lottery,

265
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,220
and the lunch will be the same for everyone.

266
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:14,290
Starting from the small things, in order to become a school that is for the students and their desires,

267
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:18,220
I will turn my ear to the student's voices.

268
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,260
In order to make a Seolsong that is together with the students,

269
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,760
I will do my best.

270
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,190
Kids... I love you.

271
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,250
I was waiting for you.

272
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,540
Are you okay?

273
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,680
Would I be okay?

274
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,040
I'm so uncomfortable that I can't live.

275
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,950
Right, tell me your plan.

276
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,360
My plan?

277
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,490
There's no reason for you to just leave me here.

278
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,150
There's none? That's okay.

279
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,000
I have a good plan.

280
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,680
There's an assemblyman you need go visit.

281
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,230
- Meet that person—
- No, I have no thoughts of helping you.

282
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,870
Oh Se Ho.

283
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,280
My plan is to turn Seolsong High into a public school,

284
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,840
so it won't be controlled by the wrong hands anymore.

285
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,400
Are you in your right mind?

286
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,310
Yes, I finally have returned to my right mind.

287
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,320
I hope that the time inside there is medicine to you.

288
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,190
I'll come see you when you've served your time, and as for me, I plan to live abroad as you've instructed.

289
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,420
Se Ho! That...

290
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,310
It's different from the situation last time. Huh?

291
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,700
Goodbye.

292
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,270
Se Ho! Se Ho!

293
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,960
Se Ho! Se Ho!

294
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,770
Come back!

295
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,130
- My son!
- Calm down.

296
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,570
Do you know who I am?!

297
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,600
Let go of me!

298
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,880
Kang Bok Soo, congratulations.

299
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,620
You've succeeded in your revenge.

300
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,470
I didn't know it'd turn out this way, but I do feel good about it.

301
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,630
But I think I am a bit wasted on you.

302
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,750
What'd you say?

303
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,110
I mean you're as meddlesome as the Pacific Ocean. The top bread-shuttle of Korea.

304
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,000
The poop-head idiot and a sister-in-law who is boss.

305
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,810
What about you? You drink five rows of yogurt drinks and eat four servings of meat easily.

306
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,390
You're strong and curse a lot.

307
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,310
It's good that I don't get sick because I eat well.

308
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,050
It's really nice to not pretend to be frail because I'm strong.

309
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,570
No matter where I go, I have no reason to not be confident because I curse. How nice is that?

310
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,800
You're very persuasive and very charming.

311
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,890
Ah, I don't know. So annoying.

312
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,480
I know, right? I am wasted on you, right?

313
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,020
I'm meeting you because it's me. Do you know how hard it is to manage you?

314
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,310
You have such leadership that all the kids are following you.

315
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,520
Your heart is so warm that it's hot, and then it makes other people around you warm too.

316
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,390
And you're so righteous that people like you and then I'm anxious.

317
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,790
You're really not that great. Did you know that?

318
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,280
Why do you keep pushing and pulling me?

319
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,900
Because I'm embarrassed to compliment you.

320
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,930
What do you specifically want to compliment me on?

321
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,020
For coming back to me.

322
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,560
Thank you, Bok Soo. For coming back to me.
