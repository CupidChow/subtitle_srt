1
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,700
For Your Favor: We will do anything for you.

2
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,560
Why would you take out the hiring corruption?!

3
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,430
That is the core of the corruption in Seolsong High.

4
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,290
- Soo Jeong, that's—
- I'll testify.

5
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,250
Secure a witness

6
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,650
I will be the one to show the rotten face of this school.

7
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,440
I will be that witness and proof.

8
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,190
- Soo Jeong.
- You really need a witness.

9
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,700
Did you forget? I am the person of hiring corruption.

10
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,550
But you were conned.

11
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,150
You do know what you're saying, right?

12
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,520
I know.

13
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,020
And I am ready for it, too.

14
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,920
You and I need to talk.

15
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,740
Don't do it, Soo Jeong. Stay out of it.

16
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,090
I will do it. You guys need a witness.

17
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,050
If we need a witness, I'll find him. And even if I can't find him,

18
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,260
- I'm going to find other evidence.
- What evidence?

19
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,260
- Is there better evidence than me?
- Soo Jeong.

20
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,780
The second you are exposed

21
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,780
your time as a teacher will be over.

22
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,190
Do you not understand?

23
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,280
I've been carrying that burden in my heart.

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,330
I was embarrassed that I couldn't stand up proudly in front of the kids.

25
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,730
I did give Myeong Ho money because I was blinded by the full-time employment position.

26
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,070
I knew they were doing bad things but I pretended to be blind to it.

27
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,580
I'm not qualified to be a teacher.

28
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,220
Kids follow the path that was paved by the person who took that path before them.

29
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,860
Teacher Park said that.

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,600
I want the road that I'm walking to

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,890
be one that I won't feel ashamed of in front of the kids.

32
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:41,200
Even if I can't be an outstanding teacher, I want to be a decent guide for them.

33
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,950
So let me testify.

34
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,040
But it was your dream

35
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,710
to be a teacher.

36
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,160
You found that dream for me anyway.

37
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,610
You can find me a different dream now.

38
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,630
An answer sheet was captured in Chae Min's mother's phone.

39
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,110
It's a clear leak of the exams.

40
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,640
The donations are for the payments.

41
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,530
Seeing that these donations are made regularly only during the exams,

42
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,060
these are habitual and don't just happen once or twice.

43
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,610
How could she to this extent?
Donations made to Seolsong High

44
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,890
The corruption is happening various ways.

45
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,880
It seems they did everything to make money.

46
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,700
I was wondering what Chae Min was believing in to be that rude...

47
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,030
It's this.

48
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,350
The fact that Chae Min's mother had the answer sheet is circumstantial evidence.

49
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,890
It can't be direct evidence for Chae Min copying the answer sheet.

50
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,920
If it's true that Chae Min saw the exam answers secretively,

51
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,300
that means he trampled on the hard work of the other students.

52
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,300
I want to be cautious since one student's life is on the line.

53
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,290
I will check it one last time.

54
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,290
Hey, why do you keep on following me?

55
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,910
Don't you know that we broke up?

56
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,120
I know that we broke up.

57
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,670
That's why I'm walking this distance away from you.

58
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:36,170
Go. Keep going on your way, ex-girlfriend.

59
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:44,800
♫ Were you feeling the same as I did, or  ♫

60
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,650
♫ were you too shy to tell me?  ♫

61
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,120
You should go now, ex-boyfriend.

62
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,610
Aren't you being too clingy?

63
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,710
- I'm going.
- Hey, Son Soo Jeong.

64
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,350
You know that life expectancy is 100 years these days, right?

65
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,280
There's no such thing as a lifetime job.

66
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,210
I will find your dream again.

67
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,880
Your second and third dreams, I will find them all for you.

68
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,620
So don't worry too much.

69
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,790
You have me.

70
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,140
Profit Purpose Classified Table

71
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,660
Descriptive. Essay, Questionnaire Ideal Answers, and Scoring Standard.

72
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,500
Let me have your attention, please.

73
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,630
The person in charge of administration as of today is

74
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,210
Teacher Hong Jeong Ae who will take that role.

75
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,400
Please take care of me.

76
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,200
Ah, Teacher Son, you know today is the last day to submit the exam paper, right?

77
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,720
You are the only one who didn't submit it. Hurry up.

78
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,660
Yes, I will send it to you today.

79
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,770
The exam you took for assigning your classes

80
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,410
doesn't have a big impact on college entrance.

81
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,260
What's important is your final exams. You know that, right?

82
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,080
You only need to do well on the finals.

83
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,990
This time, let's have the school's first rank

84
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,860
return to the ivy class for our reputation.

85
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,820
I have faith in you guys.

86
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,960
Especially...

87
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,880
Chae Min! My Chae Min.

88
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,560
Why is a person who does well being like this?

89
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,380
At times like this, you have to keep a strong mind to perform well.

90
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,450
Just do it with your skills.

91
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,810
I get it, so stop.

92
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,820
That punk.

93
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,840
This punk. You were the type of kid to study at home and sleep at school?

94
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,090
No wonder he always sleeps. Does that mean he studies every night then?

95
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,800
Betrayal.

96
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,820
Yoon Seung Woo! Hey! Do you live life by yourself?

97
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,520
Let's study together.

98
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,870
Yeah!

99
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,330
Do you really want to do it?

100
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,960
You want to study in a harsh Sparta style?

101
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,800
We will do it.

102
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,200
Sang Hyeon does study with a tutor—

103
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,150
I don't know this, so can you teach me?

104
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,750
You thought I wouldn't hit you, right?

105
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,410
If it's true that Chae Min saw the exam answers secretively,

106
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,290
that means he trampled on the hard work of the other students.

107

B. Nasalization

Present sitaution of the rebate
Director Kim Ki Ho

111
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,560
I separated all the rebate data for the board of directors as you mentioned.

112
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,680
All of the businesses that each of the directors were a part of that had something to do with the double ledger, the estimated manipulation,

113
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,430
and the amount that these people have privately gained through these transactions are all in this file.

114
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,380
Thank you for everything, Secretary Yoon. I'm sure this wasn't an easy decision for you to make.

115
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,840
Are you ready now, sir?

116
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,270
I've been ready for a while now.

117
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,170
I will get to use these data

118
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,600
but the matter of when I will get to all depends on how Mother reacts now.

119
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,300
Now, we will begin the 49th Seolsong Foundation Board of Directors Meeting.

120
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,880
The chairperson will deliver an opening statement along with her greetings.

121
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,810
Directors, have you been well?

122
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,020
Next, we'll review the urgent issue.

123
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,810
The first urgent issue.

124
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,640
I bring the dismissal of the current director, Oh Se Ho, to the table.

125
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,600
Seolsong High

126
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,230
Please speak up if you have an opinion on this issue.

127
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,010
Although Chairman Oh Se Ho did his very best,

128
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,420
because of the recent petition to the department of education and the parental complaints,

129
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,900
I think he is not competent enough to run the school.

130
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,320
From the beginning, at the time when the school became an issue briefly,

131
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,620
I am afraid that your position was temporary, and you are still too young for the position as well.

132
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,480
Director Im Sae Kyeong, no the previous director is still vibrant, so

133
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:04,320
how about we reinstate her and you take the operation later on in your life?

134
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,200
Does someone else have a different opinion?

135
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,980
- Then we'll vote on this issue—
- I do.

136
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,380
My opinion is different.

137
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,550
49th Seolsong Foundation Board of Directors Meeting

138
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,180
Account holders real name numbers

139
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,540
It's the ledger for the rebates received

140
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,790
from the businesses cooperating with the school and being maintained by each of the directors.

141
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,860
The rebate amount you exaggerated by keeping them in a separate ledger is humongous.

142
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,600
Although I am not competent enough and still too young to be a director holding a temporary position,

143
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,840
previous Director Im Sae Kyeong, who is vibrant, along with the other directors who managed that humongous rebate,

144
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,310
and the business which creates various profit using the school,

145
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,580
I would like to do it together.

146
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,410
Give me a position, too. Isn't it nice to coexist with Seolsong?

147
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,740
If I am the only one left out from such a good seat,

148
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,060
I will be very sad.

149
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,790
As a result of the vote, I declare that the proposal

150
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,590
to dismiss the current director, Oh Se Ho, has been rejected.

151
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,870
I challenged you to take

152
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,880
my school away from me.

153
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,510
Why?

154
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,450
Isn't this the side of me that you wanted to see?

155
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,410
Finding a person's weakness, controlling them, and threatening them.

156
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,690
Are you satisfied?

157
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,520
Satisfied?

158
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,690
You still don't know.

159
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:10,470
No matter what you do, you can't be the son that I like.

160
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,910
It was like that since you were born.

161
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,310
Hearing these kinds of things from Mother is now...

162
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,410
very tiring.

163
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,190
Do you feel refreshed?

164
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,210
I don't know.

165
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:45,050
I knew it would happen, but it's less than what I thought.

166
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,720
For now.

167
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,620
So?

168
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,770
What do you mean so?

169
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,070
I hear Oh Se Ho back-stabbed his mother at the board of directors meeting.

170
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,860
He threw a big punch.

171
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,120
Oh Se Ho, that young man is very extraordinary.

172
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,240
I have no idea where to stand. Is it Oh Se Ho or Im Se Kyeong?

173
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,230
I feel like I need to quickly decide.

174
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,250
Which line do you think looks stronger?

175
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:25,010
A momentary decision determines my retirement.

176
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,170
I'm getting confused.

177
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:32,250
I need to take the strong lifeline so I won't fall on my butt.

178
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,430
But what kind of medicine is this?

179
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,430
Sipjeon Daebo concoction.

180
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,120
You should share good things—

181
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,270
Oh! Mom! What'd you say?

182
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,670
That rude...

183
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,190
You heard, right? The proposal to dismiss the director has been rejected.

184
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,790
Then Director Oh Se Ho is still in charge for now, right?

185
00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:00,150
The truth is, the school became so chaotic after Director Oh Se Ho came on board.

186
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,690
The wildflower class, Kang Bok Soo, and Teacher Park's issue. Problems keep arising with no end.

187
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,410
I am nervous because I feel something big will happen.

188
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,150
It feels like the night before the storm.

189
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,180
That's what my gut tells me.

190
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,110
I also feel just like that.

191
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,810
You need to lie low at a time like this.

192
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,750
Let's all be careful and not get involved.

193
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,330
And, Teacher Son, you checked for errors and the answers for the final exam, right?

194
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,770
Yes? Yes.

195
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,440
Okay.

196
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,910
573 Close Code

197
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,170
Seolsong High, 2018 sophomore second semester
Final exam, ivy class, first hour
Korean

198
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,140
Okay, got the evidence for the exam leak.

199
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,810
Good.

200
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,270
Because it seemed like you couldn't focus these days,

201
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,530
I brought you the answers for the final exam.

202
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,450
You'll be first place this way.

203
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,600
Let's be first place this time, Lee Chae Min.

204
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,820
Mom.

205
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,960
But what if I get caught?

206
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,310
I'm scared, Mom.

207
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,800
I just... I will work harder.

208
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,500
You said you were going to do well this time, but you were ranked fifth.

209
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,650
You're already working so hard.

210
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,680
Your ability is only to that extent.

211
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,300
Chae Min, there's no point if you're not first place.

212
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,920
So what should I do? I should put in effort as a mother.

213
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,220
Thankfully you have a mother who has the ability.

214
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,340
Don't think and just memorize it as is.

215
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,840
Mom will continue to make you first place till the end.

216
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,170
Wait, wait, wait.

217
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,830
A weak woman should not carry things like this.

218
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,070
This... that, there, her... Who is she? That... Sister.

219
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,280
Your sister isn't a woman?

220
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,380
No. That woman is a general. She's like a general.

221
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,210
Our dainty and fragile Miss Jeong Soon, come sit here.

222
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,330
I have something to say to you, Ms. Jeong Soon.

223
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,860
Why are you doing this? You are scaring me.

224
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,840
I'm going to take revenge.

225
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,720
Seriously, boy. Go study!

226
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,270
You worked so hard to finally go back to school, and you want to do what now?!

227
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,140
Studying is not important now. The school is a big mess!

228
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,000
It has totally become one of those shady corporations. So how can I just sit there and watch?

229
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,520
And Teacher Park said something about how a school should be,

230
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,420
but he ended up getting kicked out for fighting for us!

231
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,080
Is that what you want to get revenge for?

232
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,510
They took my school days away from me.

233
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,830
And this is about them messing with the school days of the current students.

234
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,920
That's what I'm getting revenge for.

235
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,490
Then go for it.

236
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,050
If it is that kind of revenge, I approve.

237
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,250
That kind of revenge? What kind of revenge was I going to take then?

238
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:46,250
I was afraid that you might go to that director guy's office and do one of those weird sword dances of yours.

239
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,420
I was afraid that I might see my son on the 9 o'clock news or something.

240
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,120
What do you take me for, Mother?

241
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,540
But I want you to promise me one thing.

242
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,070
Promise me that you will graduate this time.

243
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,550
It's not like you quit school of your own free will.

244
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:03,670
You made the difficult decision to go back to school again,

245
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,550
so let's make sure to graduate this time, okay?

246
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,600
I will.

247
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,630
I will graduate no matter what.

248
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,830
I will make your wish come true, Ms. Jeong Soon.

249
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,230
What the? What is it?

250
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,120
What the heck was that?!

251
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,760
It's about receiving good energy, dude.

252
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,290
You're the number one student in the whole school, so if we receive your good energy we can get more answers right on our exam. Just go back to sleep, dude.

253
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,780
Hurry up and go back to sleep, man.

254
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,590
Go away. Go away!

255
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,120
- Go away!
- Let's get some good energy from you.

256
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,730
Put all of your hands together, everyone. What is a wildflower?

257
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,410
Poppy tree, bugleweed.

258
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,220
Even when those wildflowers are stepped on,

259
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,320
they blossom into something beautiful!

260
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,920
- Now, now!
- Hurray!

261
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,620
Hurray!

262
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,700
2018 sophomore class 2 final exam guide

263
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,900
Wildflower Class

264
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,650
A. Nasalization

265
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,990
A. Nasalization
B. Added.
Direct train.

266
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,620
2018 sophomore class 2
Korean

267
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,560
Hey, did you do well?

268
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,030
Why? You think I lost to you again or something?

269
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,380
You want me to do badly, don't you?

270
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,050
Dude, how can you say that? It's because of that punk Yoon Seung Woo.

271
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,920
I heard that if Yoon Seung Woo gets the best score in the school, then all of the mothers will gather and protest against it.

272
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,820
What kind of protest?

273
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,920
The leak of the test papers.

274
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,780
If someone didn't snatch away the test paper,

275
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,580
how does it make sense that the guy who was in last place became number one?

276
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,190
Quiet, man.

277
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,780
Why does your mom always run wildly at any time and any place for crying out loud?!

278
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,120
Hey Lee Chae Min, you're going too far here.

279
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,170
Get lost, punk ass.

280
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,340
I have to study.

281
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,830
1st rank: Lee Chae Min
2nd rank: Yoon Seung Woo

282
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:57,090
Congrats, man. You are the great and mighty Lee Chae Min after all.

283
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,020
Chae Min.

284
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,800
What do you want?

285
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,590
Is there something you would like to say to me?

286
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,700
Something that you'd want to honestly talk about.

287
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,820
I don't have such things.

288
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,360
You should just leave, I have to study now.

289
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:01,830
Chae Min, there are all kinds of people out there always making mistakes.

290
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,610
Although I'm an adult, even I make mistakes.

291
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,860
But when you get a chance to make a wrong right, and you end up shutting your mouth,

292
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,520
there will be a time when you will surely regret it.

293
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,230
And afterward, you'll feel the pain more than you expected.

294
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,760
Why are you telling me that nonsense all of a sudden?

295
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,880
A mistake that you make in one moment

296
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,950
can ruin your whole life. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

297
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,480
If you have something specific to say to me, why don't you be more direct about it?

298
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,460
You really don't have anything to say to me?!

299
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,020
I'm asking you for the last time. If you don't muster up the courage now—

300
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,820
I'm telling you that there is no such thing like that.

301
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,880
It is true that Chae Min did take the exam with the test paper that was leaked.

302
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,660
I guess the only thing that we have left to do is to pop the news to everyone.

303
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,420
Would you be okay with that?

304
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,330
But Bok Soo, what if things get dangerous for you again because of this?

305
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,760
We broke up so why are you being so clingy?

306
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,180
Reporting it to the media and pressing charges by telling the education department would be useless.

307
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:36,010
We should confidently open up the information the more we go through this, so they won't be able to carelessly do something to us.

308
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,350
It's because they are sensitive to public opinion.

309
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,190
Don't worry. This is something I have to do.

310
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,820
Teacher, I think something is wrong with the answers for the Korean Language exam.

311
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,620
It's the essay question about the change of phonetics.

312
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,960
You're right. I knew that it was wrong.
