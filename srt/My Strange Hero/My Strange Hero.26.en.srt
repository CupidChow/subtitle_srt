1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,580
You haven't made a mistake all these years, so why are you making one now?

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,680
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,270
Ugh, seriously... Quickly submit the corrected one.

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,750
Wait. This is something that could happen. Why are they blowing it out of proportion like this?

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,240
That... Because of this, Lee Chae Min's grades are falling.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,280
Really? Chae Min's mother is going to have a fit again.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,350
I'm way more scared of Chae Min's mother than those mothers whose voices are loud.

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,510
No, but Teacher Soo Jeong.

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,910
Are you saying that Lee Chae Min answered this question correctly but got it wrong?

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,380
How could you get this right?

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,610
The answer choice is totally different from the correct answer.

12
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,180
It's a question that you can't get right.

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,450
Right. This was a short answer type problem, but his answers match to the previously wrong answers. Does that even make sense?

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,680
Moreover, this is a forth level Korean difficulty problem, and

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,770
- Chae Min got it wrong?
- Teacher Hong.

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,870
Be careful of what you're saying. This is about our students.

17
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,340
Do you want to be the subject of gossip?

18
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,860
No wonder. There's no way that I would get such an easy question wrong.

19
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,090
I guess God Soo Jeong was out of her mind since she's the homeroom teacher of the wildflower class.

20
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,310
Hey, Lee Chae Min! Did you also raise your grades?

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,630
But your exam score was a hundred this time.

22
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,080
Be quiet, you jerk.

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,730
No, it's strange.

24
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,370
So originally you got this question right?

25
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,020
The answer choices were totally off, so how?

26
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,490
It's coincidence.

27
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,590
The probability for answering three short answer problems the same as the wrong answers coincidentally...

28
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,240
It's a zero, I think.

29
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,150
Kang Bok Soo.

30
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,410
You seem busy nowadays.

31
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,930
Keep in mind that you're a student at this school.

32
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,160
Even if it's for the sake of Teacher Park who left for you,

33
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,660
I think it's best for you to lie low—

34
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,610
Do not let the name "Teacher Park" come out of your mouth.

35
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,600
Okay, Kang Bok Soo.

36
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,580
You take care of your own work because I'll take care of mine.

37
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,770
Drink it. It's mixed coffee.

38
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,260
It's about that time when your blood sugar level is low.

39
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,060
My hands are about to shake.

40
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,730
It's D-Day today.

41
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,230
Team Leader Yang Min Ji, you worked hard.

42
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,590
I only did my best for my client.

43
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,290
Oh, Team Leader Yang, you seem very professional.

44
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,360
It's professional to receive money and do the work.

45
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,280
We got money from Kang Bok Soo.

46
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,950
That money, let's return it to him.

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,090
Back then, nine years ago, I felt very sorry for Bok Soo

48
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,930
because I couldn't do anything.

49
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,500
This work isn't a client request but my debt payment to Bok Soo.

50
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,970
The debt I carried in my heart to my friend.

51
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,660
CEO, I felt the same way.

52
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,190
Indeed, you are our Yang.

53
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,980
Let's do well until the end.

54
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,490
Since it's for our friend, Kang Bok Soo.

55
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,800
When this is over,

56
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,590
let's go on a trip.

57
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,820
- A trip?
- Yes, let's go.

58
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,370
Us.

59
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,140
Are you serious?

60
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,500
Yes.

61
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,160
It'll be a "Your Favor" company winter workshop.

62
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,850
We get our heads on straight for the new year.

63
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,460
It'll be a time to establish the bright future of our company.

64
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,150
I'm not going. My household doesn't do overnight stays.

65
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,100
Ah, we were going to go just the two of us...

66
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,660
But can Yang Min Ji really not do overnight stays?

67
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,290
Then... my pension reservation...

68
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,360
What are you doing? Didn't we break up?

69
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,820
Why do you keep telling me to come?

70
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,020
Are you the type that is clingy when you date?

71
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,730
I had to be clingy for a bit.

72
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,700
Well, saying that it won't work without me or asking me to date again.

73
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,010
If it's that sort of thing, then keep it.

74
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,310
I don't feel attracted to a woman who clings on without dignity.

75
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,460
Fine, I'll keep it.

76
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,230
I will hide it deep, deep down inside my chest

77
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,600
forever where I can't take it out.

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,180
No... hide it just a little bit so I can find it again.

79
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,680
But what is it?

80
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,660
Bok Soo,

81
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,860
I returned the $50,000 back to Oh Se Ho.

82
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:23,280
I heard you knew. Why didn't you say anything?

83
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,660
Well, it may sounds like an excuse, but

84
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,790
I thought it would be best if you

85
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,210
heard it from Oh Se Ho.

86
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,380
If I told you, you might

87
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,900
be more miserable.

88
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,420
I heard you knew that it was Oh Se Ho

89
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,940
who spread the rumor that I was a welfare recipient student

90
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,390
nine years ago.

91
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,380
I was concerned that you'd get hurt deeply again from that fact.

92
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,290
I was scared of it.

93
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,630
You went through a hard time back then.

94
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,560
And we just now barely resolved our misunderstandings.

95
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,530
I didn't want you to feel guilty again.

96
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,680
I should have told you sooner

97
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,380
but it was difficult.

98
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,740
I'm sorry, Soo Jeong.

99
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,560
There isn't anything else that I don't know, right?

100
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,050
No, there isn't.

101
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,720
No matter what situation we're in, let's trust each other.

102
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,320
Just like you protect me, I'll protect you.

Seolsong High School Recruitment Request List

106
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,970
Kang Bok Soo's revenge has finally started.

107
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,990
I'm getting excited.

108
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,040
Seolsong High Corruption: I want to know that

109
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,890
Yes, hello. I am Seolsong High's returned student, Kang Bok Soo.

110
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,720
The Seolsong High School corruption, which you may think couldn't get any worse,

111
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,280
I am standing here to tell you all about it today.

112
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,980
Isn't this Kang Bok Soo?

113
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,730
You're right. That's Bok Soo.

114
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,360
Because of the adhesion relationship with a college entrance consulting academy,

115
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,310
Seolsong sold the information for a debate competition for money.

116
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:08,940
Of course, we have very close cooperative relationship with Seolsong High.

117
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,920
Especially, for the most important in-school competition,

118
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,850
we are the only one who's getting the information.

119
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,860
Wow, here we go again for Seolsong.

120
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,270
- What's that?
- And...

121
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,380
Like this, it is already decided which student will receive this award.

122
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,030
Of course, this probably isn't for free either.

123
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,820
What? Wow, Elder.

124
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,230
The foundation and some parents connections

125
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,850
What is he saying?

126
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,410
Our school is crazy.

127
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,990
We studied for no reason.

128
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,900
No. It's decided by Seolsong.

129
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,500
Do you know how much money you received from me?

130
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,600
Seolsong High's administration office is paying as much as

131
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,280
ten times the cost for equipment.

132
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,830
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

133
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,560
The number of hits is so amazing!

134
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,610
But the thing is...

135
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,860
They were actually blowing up the cost and getting payback from it.

136
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,030
We got Seolsong and their cooperative businesses'

137
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,670
dual ledgers like this.
Dual ledger

138
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,960
Don't we always promise to donate plenty?

139
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,930
In return for the donation, they leak the exam sheets.
Seolsong High Donation List

140
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,550
Teachers, subjects of respect,

141
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,000
the respective teacher's qualifications,

142
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,530
Seolsong was selling and purchasing with money.

143
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:46,080
Today, we've invited four people who made a big decision to blow the whistle.

144
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,210
I am a teacher at Seolsong High.

145
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,930
At Seolsong High, even the teacher's position is sold for money.

146
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,420
I am someone to whom they made that offer.
[Suspected to be a current teacher]

147
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,370
I, and other teachers as well,

148
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,510
got tempted and made the wrong choice. And there's a list of us.

149
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,350
Seolsong High is already deep in hiring corruption.

150
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,660
If an official investigation is opened,

151
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,660
I will reveal my identity and become a witness.

152
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,080
I can not stand to be embarrassed in front of my students any longer,

153
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,700
so I decided to come forward.

154
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,560
I am so sorry.

155
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,310
In order for us to press charges against Seolsong High School and have the official investigation agency to take action,

156
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,930
we need your help.

157
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,460
Naturally, Seolsong High will try to press charges against me for defamation of character,

158
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,670
but is there any character left to defame in such a school like this?

159
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,190
Next news.

160
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,350
The video that was posted on a streaming site regarding

161
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,300
the disclosure of a high school corruption scandal is the latest hot topic.

162
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,570
Didn't I tell you to get rid of that Kang Bok Soo?!

163
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,600
And he dares to mess up my school like this?!

164
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,270
That Kang Bok Soo is quite something indeed.

165
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,830
Come and see me right away.

166
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,640
Director, so what you're saying now is...

167
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,270
Now that the situation has come to this,

168
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,060
you should take full responsibility, shouldn't you?

169
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,330
Director, did I do this alone? All I did was follow your orders.

170
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,250
That's what I'm saying.

171
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,390
We did it together.

172
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,290
Mr. Principal, you also are not free from this ordeal.

173
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,410
You don't now realize that?

174
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,170
You should think of this as saving the school.

175
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,270
So what you're saying is that I should

176
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,660
take full responsibility for this case all by myself?

177
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,300
What you're doing now is just cutting off your tail, isn't it?

178
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,430
I'm a teacher too.

179
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,100
I have taught students for a long time and I also have numerous students that have gone through me personally too...

180
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,760
I can't do that. There is no way I will do something like that.

181
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,230
Teacher?

182
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,930
You have to be wiser during a crisis.

183
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,080
What are you doing?! Hurry up and get going!

184
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,030
I really don't think I can go, Mother.

185
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,090
What should I do now?

186
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,520
All the kids will find out about it, and everyone will know about it!

187
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,790
You should act more shameless as if there's nothing going on during times like these.

188
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,970
How can I do that?

189
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,100
It's because you have to!

190
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,310
Go to school and say you never did anything like that.

191
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,270
Tell them that it's just a coincidence and to not question you for no good reason.

192
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,190
Mom.

193
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,990
You cannot drop out of school or take a break from it either.

194
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,530
If you do that, it means that you are acknowledging what you did. Don't you get that?!

195
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,450
You can't back down now.

196
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,520
If you can't be shameless, then it's all for over you.

197
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,210
Guys guys, this is incredible. Our school is number one in the search results on the internet.

198
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,890
Isn't this the first?

199
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,060
We did get number one from the search engine once upon a time during that incident with Yeong Min and Bok Soo Oppa.

200
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,290
I didn't know when I was in the ivy class, but I'm realizing now that our school is extreme when it comes to discrimination.

201
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,730
The reason why I was so bad at school was because I'm poor. Can't believe it.

202
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,420
That's not true, man.

203
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,060
Why do you say that? Some people do well just by paying for exam papers.

204
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,020
If I had that thing, I would get a perfect score too.

205
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,560
I guess so, right?

206
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,520
Oh, Elder!

207
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,060
You're here, sir?

208
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,490
You're here, sir? What's up with you sounding so awkward speaking all formally to me?

209
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:59,000
Oppa, you are definitely the main character in my life.

210
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,030
Gye So Ra, you are the one who's the main character in your life.

211
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,210
But is it true?

212
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,620
If it wasn't true, do you think I would've popped the news?

213
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,140
Money was the problem all along.

214
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,230
Snap out of it, man.

215
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,430
You should've talked to me about helping you make the video. The editing style looked a bit old-fashioned.

216
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,160
How can I ask you guys to help me on such a dangerous task?

217
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,010
Then what about you, Hyung? What if you run into danger?

218
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,790
Sir, you should be more gentle with your life. And stop having me worried about you.

219
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,190
Should we be his bodyguards?

220
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,040
What are you youngsters saying now?

221
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,850
Shouldn't we be all friends since we are in the same class and all?

222
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,840
Bok Soo, let's go.

223
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,320
Wow, he has really gone mad.

224
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,130
When it comes to my face, I look old enough to be your hyung.

225
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,570
I agree.

226
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,130
Then because of me, you should... You little punks.

227
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,780
Yes.

228
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,820
What do you mean?

229
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,720
Yes, okay.

230
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,100
Please don't worry. We will contact you as soon as the problem gets resolved. Yes, bye now.

231
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,690
Yes, bye now.

232
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,780
No, that did not happen.

233
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,860
There's no way a corruption scandal like that happened at our school.

234
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,610
No. No, that's not true at all. Of course, ma'am.

235
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,390
Pardon? Evidence?

236
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,690
That's all fabricated, madam.

237
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,250
You shouldn't carelessly question the school like that.

238
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,970
There's no way, never, ever, something like that happened here, I'm telling you. Bye now.

239
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,110
I wonder what's going to happen to our school now?

240
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,580
Don't you think our school will become cleaner once and for all? The corruption seems to be quite enormous.

241
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,690
That's what I'm saying. I can't believe that there's even a hiring scandal out of all this.

242
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,370
So what you're saying is we do have a teacher that was part of that hiring scandal then.

243
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,400
No way, that can't be!

244
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,620
I'm losing my mind because of the parents of these students for crying out loud!

245
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,720
Why do you have to add fuel to the fire now?!

246
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,100
That damn Kang Bok Soo caused a huge problem for us now.

247
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,300
Teacher Son, you really didn't know about this?

248
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,760
No, sir.

249
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,230
But I wonder who the real teacher is that was part of that hiring scandal?

250
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:17,270
I always thought that we didn't have such a thing as that at our school.

251
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,480
We shouldn't question and doubt one another for no good reason, alright?

252
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,930
That's right! It's not like it has been fully revealed anyway.

253
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,820
And also, the person that's pressing charges within didn't come and show his face either.

254
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,290
That person is willing to go through the whole police investigation too though.

255
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,250
That teacher that was part of the hiring scandal...

256
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,340
It's not you, right, Teacher Hong?

257
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,160
Hey!

258
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,620
Are you done talking yet?

259
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,410
My, you startled me. Teacher, I was just joking.

260
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,840
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,090
Forget it. There's a phone call, you should answer it.

262
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,490
Hello, this is Seolsong High—

263
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,860
Yes hello, madam.

264
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,810
No, ma'am.

265
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:13,480
Ah that, that's all fabricated.

266
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,120
Once we get confirmation, we will contact you.

267
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,880
Seriously.

268
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,930
It's Lee Chae Min, right?

269
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,420
Of course, it is Lee Chae Min.

270
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,670
So incredible.

271
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,110
I wonder how he even managed to come here.

272
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,200
Studied till your nose bled.

273
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,490
Kang Bok Soo!

274
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,590
Why are you so confident?

275
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,800
Do you realize what kind of problem you caused the school?!

276
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,340
I don't know, sir.

277
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,690
And by the way, it was the school that caused the problem not me.

278
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,730
Hey kid, do you realize what you just did?! You ruined the lives of these students!

279
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,760
I'm talking about the lives of the students who will be going to good universities! You just ruined it for them!

280
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,620
All I did was tell the truth, and if that truth alone can ruin the lives of these kids,

281
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,550
then does that mean I would be the one who ruined the lives of these kids?

282
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,570
Instead of the people that did something bad that you didn't want anybody to know about?!

283
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,030
How dare you—

284
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,920
Assistant Principal, you need to watch this on T.V.

285
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,200
I would like to state that everything that was revealed here today is all my fault.

286
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,050
Sorry for the trouble.

287
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,990
I will step down from my principal position and take the punishment I deserve.

288
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,200
Seolsong High School Emergency Press Conference

289
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,280
Director, there's a press conference going on out there in the podium.

290
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,270
She's quicker than I expected.

291
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:36,860
So are you saying that you are the one who is responsible for everything regarding this corruption scandal, Mr. Principal?

292
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,170
Yes, it was I who caused all this to happen.

293
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,010
I apologize to everyone here once again.

294
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,780
While I stepped down as the director of the school,

295
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,370
the fact that this kind of corruption, which I wasn't aware of, took place here

296
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,100
makes me want to take responsibility for it all.

297
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,220
Taking full responsibility for this case,

298
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,870
the current director and the principal here

299
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,460
will be dismissed.

300
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,620
And our foundation, for the kids,

301
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,950
will restore this prestigious school in all of this region.

302
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,820
And once again, we will set it straight for the kids. To me, this is really...

303
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,040
Oh, I'm so sorry.

304
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:40,200
This school is really so precious to me, like my own child.

305
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,220
So I will make sure to protect this school.

306
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,560
Regarding this incident, once again I

307
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,310
deeply and sincerely make an apology to you all.

308
00:21:55,130 --> 00:22:02,340
Seolsong High School Emergency Press Conference

309
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,180
Principal, why are you lying?

310
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,050
That's not true. You didn't do it alone.

311
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,880
Everyone saw that CCTV recording that you revealed.

312
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,170
You even let them use your name to open an account?

313
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,100
Yeah, I mean it's not like that.

314
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,300
Mr. Principal, the money exchanged over this corruption is multi-millions—

315
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,180
No. It'll be tens of millions of dollars just calculating 10 years.

316
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,100
You're saying you're the only one who used all that money?

317
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,680
Why are you lying?

318
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,910
I committed all.

319
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,130
I will be prosecuted according to the law. I should accept it.

320
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,490
Being the principal of a high school isn't everything in a teacher's career, is it?

321
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:11,930
Think carefully what your smart investment is for your future.

322
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,810
What does that mean...?

323
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:19,490
If you wrap this incident well, I promise a university president position.

324
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:24,160
No business is like the education business for creating safe profits.

325
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,500
And the best of them all is the universities.

326
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,150
With the funds that I diligently collected from Seolsong High,

327
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,950
I've been painting a big picture.

328
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:38,650
In that blueprint, you were included as well.

329
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,400
No matter what,

330
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,320
you played a big role in my business.

331
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,690
Don't you think you ought to take at least that much responsibility?

332
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,610
And while you are doing it, do it big.

333
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:58,370
Please become the president of Seolsong University.

334
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,670
You know I'm a person who keeps my promises.

335
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,430
Keep in mind.

336
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:13,390
If I break down, your thirty-year teaching career

337
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,890
will be gone, too.

338
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,240
I made the right choice.

339
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,290
Other people take the blame and serve time, too. Then they come out and live well.

340
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,860
Indeed you are good at cutting off tails.

341
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,180
I had it all prepared in case of your mess up.

342
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,490
I see you lose to Kang Bok Soo with these things too.

343
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,320
The timing wasn't good, but it isn't over yet.

344
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,420
It's the end for you, because of that Kang Bok Soo.

345
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,590
Kang Bok Soo, Son Soo Jeong, those people...

346
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:04,120
Whether you hire a hitman or whatever, you could've just gotten rid of them with force.

347
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:11,600
Are you that happy that I'm done for?

348
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,120
I'm your child.

349
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,690
You said earlier that it's a school as precious as your child.

350
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:25,490
I couldn't believe it.

351
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,280
Is your child even precious to you?

352
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,120
Why have I never felt that?

353
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,960
Right.

354
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,370
I never treasured you once.

355
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,110
Mom.

356
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,440
Don't call me that.

357
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,580
I'm supposed to love you no matter how much of a fool you were because I'm your mom? Is that what you said?

358
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,330
If I'm really your son,

359
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:50,490
even if I am lacking and foolish, at least you should love me!

360
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,470
In order to protect Seolsong,

361
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,800
during the time that I made myself harder and stronger, what did you do?

362
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,950
You whined about wanting love. Ah, there's one more.

363
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,730
You became feeble and jumped off, didn't you?

364
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,680
Mother!

365
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,210
When I was being disowned by the family, the only thing I got for a settlement

366
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,990
was this school and you!

367
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,450
I can't believe this is the return I get after I dedicated my whole life!

368
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,480
Aside from being your mom, as a human being,

369
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,510
I really despise a weak person like you.

370
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,250
Mother,

371
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,730
be humane, please.

372
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,660
I hate you.

373
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,570
No. You always cried in front of me

374
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,590
wanting affection like a bast***.

375
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,030
No matter how much I hit you, you wagged your tail.

376
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,420
Did you think I wouldn't know?

377
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,500
You never gave it.

378
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,580
Affection.

379
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,390
How could someone like you be my child?

380
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:16,320
No matter how I much I hate this and am angry, if I die, all of this would probably be yours, right?

381
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,110
Be satisfied with this and go live outside.

382
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,820
I don't need that.

383
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,890
I don’t need that!

384
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,990
You saw this too, right?

385
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,450
Do you think it's true? Who would it have gone to?

386
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,390
It's you, right?

387
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,350
What’s going on?

388
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,910
Lee Chae Min?

389
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,580
What happened to your face?

390
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,000
What happened, Chae Min?

391
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,120
Chae Min, what’s going on? Chae Min!

392
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,220
Chae Min.

393
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,330
Hey, Lee Chae Min!

394
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,140
Chae Min!

395
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,260
Don't come!

396
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,570
If you come, I'll die.

397
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,470
You can't, Lee Chae Min!

398
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,620
Then just die.

399
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,860
Just

400
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,730
die there.

401
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:15,290
