1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,190
What are you going to do? Just go to the sky class.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,020
You'll be first place in sky, and you'll like it too.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,930
Go and clean out your glass booth.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,900
Okay?

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,500
This jerk won't respond!

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,640
Hey! Oh Yeong Min!

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,940
I'm an ivy. I will never go down.

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,090
Go and throw this out.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,200
Because of you, the class atmosphere is ruined, so you should at least make up for it with this.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,690
But this can at least be recycled. What about you though?

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,820
Why am I trash?

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,620
This bast***.

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,890
Oh Yeong Min, this crazy bast***!

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,980
Stop it.

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,580
This guy's nose is bleeding.

16
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,460
Just leave.

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,220
Just pretend you don't know and leave! Everybody leave!

18
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,500
Stop! Stop, stop.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,020
What are you guys doing?

20
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,960
Chae Min! You all go to your self-study rooms.

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,130
What are you doing? Do you want to be punished?

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,890
Where are you going? Oh Yeong Min!

23
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,070
Oh Yeong Min, where are you going?!

24
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh Yeong Min!

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,290
Oh Yeong Min, open the door!

26
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,620
You said you were going to the sky class!

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,070
Oh Yeong Min, open the door!

28
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,130
Yeong Min, let's talk. Yeong Min!

29
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,160
If Director knows, he'll throw a fit!

30
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,250
Open the door!

31
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,510
This is my seat. This is my seat!

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,400
Yeong Min.

33
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:04,630
We plan to install an ivy snack store for the exclusive use of the ivy class.

34
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,710
These are all ideas from the new director.

35
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,110
How precious.

36
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,390
For ivy kids, time going to the store is a waste too.

37
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,950
Oh Yeong Min! Are you not going to open the door?

38
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,510
Why are you inside there?

39
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,820
What's going on?

40
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:22,970
That...

41
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,600
Oh Yeong Min, open the door!

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,170
Yeong Min, open the door.

43
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,410
Do you not have a key, Teacher Park?

44
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,680
Please take the kids out of here first.

45
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,430
Kids, get out of here.

46
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,890
Out. Out.

47
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,810
Out. Go.

48
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,530
Yeong Min! Oh Yeong Min!

49
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,420
That guy is Oh Yeong Min, right?

50
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,650
Contact Oh Yeong Min's mother to take him home!

51
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,650
Oh my, he's not normal.

52
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,350
Vice Principal, escort the mothers out now.

53
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,140
Wait.

54
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,650
- Oh Yeong Min, let's calm down and—
- Hey!

55
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,210
So annoying.

56
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,500
Hey, come out. Come out.

57
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,690
Come out.

58
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,880
Hey!

59
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,380
What are you doing?

60
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,920
What do you think I'm doing?

61
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,320
Can't you see that I'm trying really hard to ignore you here?

62
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,090
Oh Yeong Min, Bob Marley said this.

63
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,930
That only we can make our own minds free.

64
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,550
What gives you hardship is not your mother or this school, it's your mind.

65
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,590
It's nothing now that I destroyed it, right?

66
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:52,830
Although I broke this prison, only you can set yourself free.

67
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,230
How can my kid go to school with a gangster like that?

68
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,610
That's what I'm saying.

69
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,360
Choi Min's mother, we shouldn't be staying still, right?

70
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,120
Let's expel Kang Bok Soo!

71
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,330
That's obvious!

72
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,160
Let's gather a meeting for the School Violence Prevention Committee. Either he transfers or he's expelled.

73
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,800
Think about our kids going to school with that kind of man.

74
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,340
What a drop of class.

75
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:03,810
Let's wait and see how the new director will take care of this situation.

76
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,440
Bok Soo, now...

77
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,960
is not the right time.

78
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,990
Does it hurt a lot?

79
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,450
Of course. This big of a glass shard was in my forehead.

80
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,040
Teacher.

81
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,540
Sorry.

82
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,830
It's cleaned up.

83
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,090
Come here.

84
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,870
I almost died from excessive bleeding.

85
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,800
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,580
Why are you sorry?

87
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:14,860
Still, we are comrades who almost went to death together.

88
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,920
I've got a comrade who went with me into the river.

89
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,350
And that comrade is fighting alone without a gun in this battlefield called school.

90
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,460
I didn't even bring him some crackers.

91
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,030
I don't have the right to be a teacher.

92
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,990
It's okay. You're a temporary teacher.

93
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,670
Hey! I'm a full-time teacher now!

94
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,010
This boy—!

95
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,640
Enough of that. Until your self-study room is cleaned up,

96
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,060
just sleep here.

97
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:52,020
You see, in the past when I was sick, I memorized vocabulary words while I was lying down

98
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,020
because I was anxious.

99
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,810
Should I bring you some words?

100
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,490
No.

101
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,100
Hey.

102
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,170
Why aren't you rough-housing me today?

103
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,150
Ah, why?

104
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,620
I can't say you did well nor say you did wrong.

105
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,150
How did the school turn out like this? Is this right?

106
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,370
That's true. How did the school turn out like this?

107
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,360
I have no idea where to start fixing and how.

108
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,550
If you don't know, who knows?

109
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,490
Hey, come here. Put this on and go.

110
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,770
No, no. Disgusting.

111
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,620
Disgusting? Your mom will be shocked if she sees that.

112
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,790
How long has it been for you to cause an accident!

113
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,730
You said you couldn't tell me I did wrong! Give it to me. I'll do it.

114
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,090
Then did you do well?

115
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,360
You should have done it with words. Why go out first with your body?

116
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,290
What do you do with a mouth? Is it just for eating?

117
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,650
Seriously that talk. I'm just going to go.

118
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,240
Forget it. Whatever.

119
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,500
But you did grow up well.

120
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,690
Hey, class has not ended yet! Come here!

121
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,730
That rascal!

122
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,910
Hey!

123
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,990
You came, son? It's hard, right?

124
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,300
It's definitely not fighting!

125
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,140
I was playing basketball with the kids but I don't know if it's because they're young or whatnot but...

126
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,070
The ball slightly...

127
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,520
Who said anything?

128
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,190
I'll do it!

129
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,700
Give it, give it.

130
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,950
Your son's face is going to wear out if you keep staring like that.

131
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,630
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:15,390
News of your student is already explosive at our school so there's too much talk.

133
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,930
His school violence record is too extreme.

134
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,400
So if I'm being honest with you, the parents are already

135
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,480
well aware of the news of student Kang Bok Soo.

136
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,500
Can he adapt here though?

137
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,010
The other students are already scared.

138
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,710
Wouldn't it be better to take the GED instead?

139
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,470
Please.

140
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,470
Please, just this once.

141
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,700
Just this once.

142
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,190
Why aren't you coming?

143
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,060
The way you look from the back is so... you know.

144
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,770
Your mother is not dead yet, my boy.

145
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,480
Bok Soo, do you want to go eat some spicy rice cakes?

146
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,270
I want to go out on a date with my son. Let's go.

147
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:48,290
Do you have anything that you are expecting from me since I'm going back to school and all?

148
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,770
Like for instance, you would like me to be good at my studies.

149
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,470
Or you would like me to stop getting into fights, that kind of stuff.

150
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,950
They say that when a person does something out of their norm, they end up dying.

151
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,090
You were never really into studying anyway.

152
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:03,390
You are 27 years old already, so you would be a crazy punk if you were still getting into fights at that age.

153
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,450
That's true.

154
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:12,110
Then that means I have nothing to do for you at this rate.

155
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,090
A high school diploma.

156
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,350
All you need to do is get a high school diploma to make me happy.

157
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,860
Side dishes, processed meats, dessert

158
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,740
I'm having a difficult time.

159
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,250
Why are you having a hard time again?

160
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,850
You said that you'd become a permanent full-time teacher, didn't you?

161
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,260
I did become just that, but

162
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,210
this teacher business is not an easy thing to do.

163
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,810
Thievery, getting into fights, sewing, and pointing fingers.

164
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,460
There's nothing easy around here.

165
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,860
There is.

166
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,580
It's called snacking.

167
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,570
Ma'am, you shouldn't be eating the food that you haven't paid for yet.

168
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,290
I always wanted to be a good teacher.

169
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,730
A real good teacher.

170
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,600
I don't want to be the kind of teacher that contributes to suffocating the kids and making them want to just go and die.

171
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,950
What kind of a good teacher do you have in mind for the kids?

172
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,870
A teacher that finds a dream for students that don't have any.

173
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,410
Class president, what is your dream?

174
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,850
I have no such thing as a dream yet.

175
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,760
Then, how about being a teacher?

176
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,300
A teacher?

177
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,780
What do you think I'm doing?

178
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,800
Can't you see that I'm trying really hard to ignore you here?

179
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,910
A teacher that doesn't ignore a student that's having a hard time just for my own survival.

180
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,490
I re-watched the video clip of Kang Bok Soo breaking that glass booth numerous times.

181
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,660
Seriously, there is no solution to that Kang Bok Soo, and it's hard to deal with things after he does it.

182
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,090
But then when I see that, I feel like my stress gets relieved somehow.

183
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,530
Hello, sir.

184
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,640
Yeah... Disciplinary committee, huh?

185
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,530
I was always curious about this from before.

186
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,670
I wonder why people like you so much.

187
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,930
Don't strike up a conversation with me. I feel irritated just hearing your voice.

188
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:47,050
Didn't I tell you that if you keep on interfering with things you are the one who'll get hurt in the end?

189
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,110
Use your head.

190
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,620
Are you grabbing the kids by the tail and stressing them to death because you use your head so well?

191
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,200
You line the kids up by their grades,

192
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,070
and the kids are scared that their grades will drop.

193
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,630
Is this even a school?!

194
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,930
Didn't you tell me before that you hate your mother?

195
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:07,320
But to be honest, both you and your mother are the same breed.

196
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,890
No, I'm different. I'm not trying to make the kids fall behind on purpose.

197
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,240
I made the wildflower class because I do care about the kids that are falling behind from competing with the best.

198
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,450
Don't be so pompous, and look at the reality here instead.

199
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,790
The kids are complaining to death about their suffering and going into strange glass booths.

200
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,120
That's the situation of your school right now.

201
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,760
You'll see. It's going to change.

202
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,640
You'll see how narrow-minded you are.

203
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,430
You'll find out soon enough.

204
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:55,330
Yes, Mother. The school is planning to take disciplinary action regarding that.

205
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,950
So please stop worrying. Yes. Bye, ma'am.

206
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,030
My head hurts.

207
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:05,430
Oh Yeong Min and Kang Bok Soo. Oh, seriously.

208
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,570
You should treat us out to a meal.

209
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,270
Don't even start. Starting last night, we were getting complaints via text message too.

210
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,980
So treat us to some drinks too.

211
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,590
What were they saying?

212
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,630
What do you think they said? Of course, they want Kang Bok Soo out of here.

213
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,620
They were complaining that they are scared of Kang Bok Soo turning their kids into a gangster like him.

214
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,190
And some were saying that this is school violence.

215
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,650
This isn't school violence. There was a reas—

216
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,680
Teacher Son, come to the director's office right away.

217
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,360
Hello there, Ms. Chief Director.

218
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,610
You are all here at the most perfect timing.

219
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,690
You weren't going to report to me about what happened yesterday?

220
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,420
Of course not, ma'am.

221
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,770
I was going to report to you once things cooled down a bit.

222
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,990
What are you doing here? You didn't tell me that you were going to come today.

223
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,320
Do I have to report to you when I'm coming to the school that belongs to me?

224
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,430
Come and have a seat here please.

225
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,080
Teacher Son, you can come in.

226
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,100
I brought her in because she is the homeroom teacher for the student Kang Bok Soo.

227
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,630
Please answer me concisely. What are you planning to do?

228
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,610
- After we go through with the disciplinary committee—
- Expel him from the school.

229
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,820
The thing that Kang Bok Soo broke was a mere glass booth,

230
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,430
but that can possibly end up being the educational philosophy of Seolsong High.

231
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,060
We worked really hard to bring forth this discriminatory system, so if the kids realize that it's easily breakable

232
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,860
it will become more dangerous. So we should stomp on the root of that dangerous thought early on.

233
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,770
I guess that could be possible.

234
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,700
Chief Director's wisdom is so excellent.

235
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,820
They say that violence is a contagious disease.

236
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:16,800
According to the law, expelling a student takes certain procedures from what I know.

237
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,320
Also, Kang Bok Soo is taking up media attention too.

238
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,680
Teacher Son, what do you think about this?

239
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,400
Pardon?

240
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,380
Since you're his homeroom teacher, how would you evaluate Kang Bok Soo as a student?

241
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,440
Teacher Son, are you sleeping there?

242
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,440
I think the chief director is correct on this.

243
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,950
No matter what the situation was, a student shouldn't damage and destroy school property,

244
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,370
so the school must decide to take proper measures accordingly.

245
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,870
That's what I honestly think.

246
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,490
Hello there, Hyungnim.

247
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,180
What Hyungnim?

248
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,220
I did feel good about it.

249
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,130
That damn glass booth. I always wanted to break that thing.

250
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,870
You are a manly man. Bam!

251
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,530
Stop! It's not like you did a good thing.

252
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,890
Students shouldn't be doing that kind of dangerous thing.

253
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,380
You could've been hurt in a major way too.

254
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:15,370
Teacher... My un— so what's going to happen to Kang Bok Soo Hyung?

255
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,310
Can't we just pay back for that stupid glass booth with money or something?

256
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,280
I will help with that. I will contribute 100,000 won.

257
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,720
A hundred thousand won?! Why don't you pay back my 500 won, girly?

258
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,840
He'll probably get expelled from here.

259
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,180
Get expelled?!

260
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,940
Hey, last time when I broke the classroom door, all I did was some volunteer work.

261
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,010
How are the classroom door and the glass booth the same, huh?

262
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,860
The glass booth is the symbol of hierarchical society here, and he broke the crap out of that thing.

263
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,900
Teacher, is it really true?

264
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,060
I know, right?

265
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,330
Am I going to get expelled from here?

266
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,690
Teacher, do you also think that I was wrong here?

267
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,090
Of course, I do. Do you think that you were right to break the glass booth with the chair when the person was sitting inside?

268
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,990
So I should've ignored him even if he was having such a difficult time?

269
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,670
Oh Yeong Min was calling out for help because he was having such a tough time.

270
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,700
So we should just let him be like that?

271
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,970
Even if you didn't step up,

272
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,240
I... No, the teachers would have helped him.

273
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,920
You wouldn't have broken the glass wall.

274
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,860
Kang Bok Soo.

275
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,960
You need to break those kinds of things.

276
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,120
All students are the same, right?

277
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:37,290
That's true, Teacher. I kind of liked it.

278
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,600
What do you like about it?

279
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,680
It's just... I felt like only those kids inside were special.

280
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,780
It felt like there was a boundary line or something between us and them.

281
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,440
But after seeing that border crumble…

282
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,620
To be honest, it was refreshing.

283
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,220
I agree.

284
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,060
Is everybody crazy?

285
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,530
No matter what, we're just the ivy side products.

286
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,760
What does that mean?

287
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,400
All students are the same. Nobody is special.

288
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,090
No, everybody is special.

289
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,780
God Soo Jeong!

290
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,700
God Soo Jeong! God Soo Jeong!

291
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:33,490
God Soo Jeong! God Soo Jeong!

292
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,250
Why am I off the list?

293
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,190
If I am excluded from the disciplinary committee—

294
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,800
You have a special relationship with Kang Bok Soo.

295
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,250
I'm going to complain about this officially to the principal.

296
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,600
Mr. Park, you really love to complain, don't you?

297
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,950
The principal made the decision himself,

298
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,880
so do whatever you wish.

299
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,060
They can't do this to me.

300
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,180
They can't.

301
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,910
Excuse—

302
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:24,660
P-Principal, why am I excluded from the disciplinary committee?

303
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,300
Mr. Park, do you realize where you are? You can't make a commotion here. Get out!

304
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,440
Don't ignore kids just because they're young.

305
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,520
The kids know exactly what's happening to them.

306
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,540
The one that trapped Yeong Min there is the school.

307
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,820
It's the school system.

308
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,960
So Kang Bok Soo broke the system, didn't he?

309
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,250
And we don't want that system to break.

310
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,070
The controversy only came to an end

311
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,520
thanks to Bok Soo returning to school.

312
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,340
We have to give him a chance.

313
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,860
A chance? What can we do?

314
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,610
We already decided on not giving that chance.

315
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,090
Secretary Yoon, what are you doing? Kick him out.

316
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,310
Teacher Park.

317
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,720
Where do you think you are, making all this fuss?

318
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,970
Do you know how hard it was for that kid to get here?

319
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,370
How could even the school do this to him? Principal!

320
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,850
Hold on, hold on—

321
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,590
That teacher is the same as he always was.

322
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,790
Student Kang Bok Soo, where's your guardian?

323
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,670
Do you know how old I am? I'm an adult, an adult.

324
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,820
Yes, I am my own guardian.

325
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,350
Student Kang Bok Soo, is this a joke to you?

326
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:57,070
No, I didn't mean it like that.

327
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:02,520
Student Kang Bok Soo's guardian is here.

328
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,330
Hey!

329
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,530
Why do you not have a guardian?

330
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,480
How did you get here?

331
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,930
I'm sorry for being late.

332
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,380
Bok Soo's mother... You came.

333
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,650
I'm Bok Soo's older sister. How do I look...

334
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,960
Why did the mother not come?

335
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,370
Our mother doesn't know yet.

336
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,100
I couldn't make her come here twice like this.

337
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,990
Is that okay? Parents should know what their kid has been doing.

338
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,430
I heard he has destroyed school property.

339
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,610
Of course, that's wrong.

340
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,710
But... I also heard he saved the student inside.

341
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,680
What do you mean save?

342
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,040
Do you think he was locked up in there?

343
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,150
He should receive punishment for his wrongdoings,

344
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,350
but I came to persuade you that he had good intentions.

345
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:12,560
Although he doesn't say it, he finds it exciting to go to school.

346
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,920
I also thought, "why would he go to school at his age."

347
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,410
But when I see that he still looks good with his uniform and backpack,

348
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:31,650
I think, "That's right. Bok Soo... belongs at the school."

349
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,250
You should punish him for his wrongdoings.

350
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:46,930
But I do think that a place that embraces fixing wrongdoings the way a mom does is a school.

351
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,180
Please give our Bok Soo,

352
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:54,190
our inadequate Bok Soo, one more embrace.

353
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:57,390
I request this of you.

354
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,390
Is a school a daycare?

355
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,750
Leave the embracing at your home.

356
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:07,780
You must also be raising a child. That's not the way you should be.

357
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,640
Your child learns from you.

358
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,160
What did you say?

359
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,110
I'm sorry.

360
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,050
He's also an upright kid who can reflect upon his mistakes.

361
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,250
He said he's sorry.

362
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,420
I'll do things my way so you can leave now.

363
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,590
Excuse me, Sister.

364
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:41,290
No, could Kang Bok Soo's guardian please go outside.

365
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,240
Work hard.

366
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,910
Please take good care of Bok Soo.

367
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:05,230
But because you know you did wrong,

368
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,190
that's a relief.

369
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,110
I am sorry for breaking school property,

370
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:19,310
but I don't think I did anything wrong.

371
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,520
What are you saying this time?

372
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,600
I'm saying I did well. That Oh Yeong Min smiled.

373
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,930
That's probably the first time he smiled like that.

374
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,630
Kang Bok Soo!

375
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:33,800
Don't you know that the world has laws to upkeep and that schools have regulations?

376
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,870
If you've aged, you should have enough common sense—

377
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,950
Of course, I know! I know.

378
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:42,030
Using the excuse of customized education, having that hierarchy system is a regulation.

379
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:46,560
And the resulting benefits along with discrimination are also regulations, but...

380
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,680
S Crystal said this.

381
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,490
S Crystal?

382
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,430
There are a lot of variables to the rules of this world.

383
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,320
Me?!

384
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,610
If you don't know, just memorize it.

385
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,960
S Crystal?

386
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,930
Who is S Crystal?

387
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,820
So just memorize it,

388
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:14,440
because I'm going to be the variable in Seolsong's various regulations.

389
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,250
He must be crazy.

390
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,720
Who are you trying to teach? So arrogant.

391
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,100
Please make that student transfer!

392
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,190
Expel him. He needs to be expelled.

393
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,720
Mother, don't be too upset.

394
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,990
We still have not heard from his homeroom teacher.

395
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:39,700
What does the homeroom teacher, Son Soo Jeong, think?

396
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,530
So you became a teacher to earn money? To live?

397
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,770
Why did a person like that spend 50 million won and still not become a full-time teacher?

398
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,160
But did you know that?

399
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,530
Fakes don't last long.

400
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:17,730
Kang Bok Soo, to Seolsong High,

401
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,330
is the most dangerous student.

402
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:41,530
My Strange Hero

403
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,440
How stupid.

404
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,100
You only were ever to that extent.

405
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:03,960
Bok Soo must be happy.

406
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,150
He has a mother like the ones from dramas.

407
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,500
I mean, did I ask for her help?

408
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
Why did she step up and make it complicated for her too?

409
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,960
You held my hand?

410
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,940
Okay.

411
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,330
Kang Bok Soo, I'm getting old because of you!

412
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,260
I'm dating Bok Soo.

413
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,200
Do you know how Bok Soo lived all this time?

414
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,860
Why is Son Soo Jeong here?

415
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,070
Hey, Oh Se Ho. Was it like that?

416
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,290
Isn't rich trash better than an expelled loser?

417
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:30,620
I, Kang Bok Soo, don't like to lose.
