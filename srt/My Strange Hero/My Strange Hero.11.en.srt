1
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,570
See. I told you I would win, didn't I?

2
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,480
So what's your wish? Should I kneel down?

3
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,590
Was that your wish?

4
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,080
But what are you going to do

5
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,550
I won.

6
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,770
Kang Bok Soo, did you finish clean—

7
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,400
Kang Bok Soo!

8
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,840
Kang Bok Soo, I told you not to cause any trouble

9
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,300
Are you crazy? You've done all sorts—

10
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,620
Why do you care?

11
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,460
Mind your own business.

12
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,630
I'm your teacher, I have to take responsibility if you cause trouble.

13
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,240
First, to the nurs—

14
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,810
What?

15
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,420
Move out of the way. You really—

16
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,000
Why aren't you asking what happened?

17
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,750
Nine years ago and today, why

18
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,420
don't you ask me what happened?!

19
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,660
Tell me now.

20
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,200
I heard with my ears and saw with my eyes.

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,990
What is there to say?

22
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,550
You cut someone's neck with a bamboo sword, and you still have something to say?

23
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,480
I have a good reason—

24
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,570
If there's a reason, is it okay for people to get hurt?

25
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,350
Do you not see that I'm hurt?

26
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,420
You're receiving a punishment right now.

27
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,630
Don't cause more trouble and just clean and go.

28
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,380
Son Soo Jeong.

29
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,430
Let's go. I need to get treated quickly.

30
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,570
Son Soo Jeong living off of government assistance is true. What about it?

31
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,130
Aren't you Soo Jeong's friends?

32
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,600
Did you guys never think about why she would do that?

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,750
We weren't friends though.

34
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,650
Right, how is she a friend?

35
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,700
She just fooled us all.

36
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,470
She looked down on us while acting high and mighty.

37
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,200
Bok Soo, you got tricked too!

38
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,310
When did she fool anyone?

39
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,460
She's never lied. Since the beginning, you guys assumed

40
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,110
that her family must be rich and she must get lots of tutoring.

41
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,980
You guys made things up like that!

42
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,580
She should have told us that it wasn't true!

43
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,540
Do you guys want to tell other people about your family situations?

44
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,760
You made up whatever you pleased.

45
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,480
How did you guys know that?

46
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,290
Oh Se Ho.

47
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,420
What?

48
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,890
It seems that Oh Se Ho liked Soo Jeong.

49
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,550
Because we told him that Soo Jeong doesn't like him, he said he doesn't like someone like her.

50
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,450
That she lives off of government assistance.

51
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,960
That crazy bastard.

52
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,870
Hey, where is Oh Se Ho?

53
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,940
He was on the rooftop earlier.

54
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,440
NO!

55
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,360
Oh Se Ho.

56
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,870
Don't approach Son Soo Jeong.

57
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,340
I said don't approach her!

58
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,510
You're crazy, Kang Bok Soo.

59
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,660
Do you still want to say that?

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,860
Son Soo Jeong.

61
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,150
Yes?

62
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,480
I'll get treated by myself.

63
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,290
Okay.

64
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:42,630
But, Oh Se Ho. Please don't make an issue about what happened today. I ask of you.

65
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,850
Don't worry about it.

66
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,910
Thank you.

67
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,090
Why aren't you asking?

68
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,320
Nine years ago and now, why aren't you

69
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,660
asking what happened?!

70
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,430
What do I have to ask about?

71
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,220
Why did you do that? Why would I...

72
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,530
Son Soo Jeong, don't go in now.

73
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,840
Class President, I heard you live off of government assistance.

74
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,380
I've never lied.

75
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,290
You pitiful girl.

76
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,110
I can't believe she is a low-income welfare recipient.

77
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,590
Kang Bok Soo's hobby is helping others.

78
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,810
No wonder he was treating her well.

79
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,070
He must have done it because he pitied her.

80
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,490
It seems like Bok Soo said something he shouldn't have.

81
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,540
No, there's no way.

82
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,030
Bok Soo said he found you pitiful.

83
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,330
There's no way Bok Soo would have done that.

84
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,260
Didn't he paint your front gates?

85
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,260
Do you not find Son Soo Jeong pitiful?!

86
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,090
Kang Bok Soo.

87
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,180
Did he really do it because he pitied me?

88
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,810
You really... Who told you to find me pitiful?

89
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,250
Kang Bok Soo!

90
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,710
Save Me!

91
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,890
Son Soo Jeong.

92
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,860
Did you really see it?

93
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,100
I didn't see it, but I heard it.

94
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,190
Student, this is an important question.

95
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,180
What did you hear?

96
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,460
I heard Oh Se Ho say to save him.

97
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,450
What?

98
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,770
"Kang Bok Soo, save me."

99
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,500
I definitely heard it.

100
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,630
Hey, Son Soo Jeong. Did you really see it?

101
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,860
You're not lying? You know Bok Soo well. He's not that type of kid.

102
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,410
No. Bok Soo... Why would he push Oh Se Ho?

103
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,570
Is Bok Soo the perpetrator of school violence?!

104
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,490
How am I supposed to know what kind of person Bok Soo is?

105
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,170
Hey, Son Soo Jeong.

106
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,550
You don't believe Bok Soo?

107
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
No.

108
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,270
I don't believe him now.

109
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,840
Hey. You... Bok Soo liked you very much.

110
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,680
What's wrong with you?

111
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,370
Hey, Son Soo Jeong!

112
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,380
Hey.

113
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,240
You know it's not me, right?

114
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,350
Ah, please!

115
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,300
Soo Jeong, you know it's not me.

116
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,720
Why are you lying?!

117
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,450
Teacher.

118
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,710
Teacher!

119
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,590
Seung Woo! You came!

120
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,390
Yeah, well...

121
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,410
Seung Woo! Your parents aren't answering my calls.

122
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,810
Why are you calling those people? Argh, really!

123
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,340
It's because you weren't coming to school.

124
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,210
But do you have to work all those part-times? You have your parents.

125
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,140
I don't have parents.

126
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,170
I don't have those kinds of things.

127
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,710
I know you're doing this as a teacher, but I don't need it so just stop right there.

128
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,470
You're still a minor.

129
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,280
You need parents and a teacher.

130
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,370
I...

131
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,980
Hey, Seung Woo.

132
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,280
You came! If you don't answer my calls anymore, I'm going to kill you.

133
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,580
Stay away from me.

134
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,700
Hey, we were bored without you. Be sure to attend school.

135
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,730
Hyung, what's with your face? Did you fight someone? Did you get hit by someone?

136
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,240
Hey! I fell.

137
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,010
Aiyoo.

138
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,700
Three bulgogi burgers, right?

139
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,420
Record the time.

140
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,760
I'm not eating it (informal to yo - formal).

141
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,220
Why?

142
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,080
Why? Are you tired of bulgogi burgers?

143
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,670
Looking back, there were cheese and shrimp—

144
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,040
I'll... just buy it.

145
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,900
What's wrong with you?

146
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,860
What? That's something new in a long time.

147
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,280
He's not eating it. You should rest, Elder.

148
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,200
Hey, where are you going?

149
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,910
Please don't make an issue of what happened today. I ask of you.

150
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,690
From now on, don't ever ask such a favor.

151
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,490
Ever.

152
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,450
Come inside.

153
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,440
Director, you called us.

154
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,640
Oh, Director! What is that on your neck?

155
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,180
Aigoo, oh my word.

156
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,590
- A band aid?
- Are you okay?
- Did you get hurt?

157
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,850
How is the budget proposal for the Wildflower class coming?

158
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,290
You're talking about the funds for hiring teachers for extra-curricular activities, right?

159
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,580
Aid from the Department of Education and the local government can cover it, but

160
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,720
as expected, there is an issue regarding the equal treatment of students.

161
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,470
Since when has our school considered the equal treatment of students?

162
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:59,090
About that. The disparity between the top performing and failing students...

163
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,170
Now, it's different—

164
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:05,660
We need to offer differentiated support to the students that don't display the aptitude for studying.

165
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,350
From today, the Wildflower class homeroom teacher, Son Soo Jeong—

166
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,840
Please inform her and make it happen.

167
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,430
Yes?

168
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,330
Ah, yes. You're now calling me. I've been waiting.

169
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,630
That, that... no manners.

170
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,100
If the parent's committee find out about this support for only the Wildflower class—

171
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,680
It's going to be chaos. Just chaos!

172
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,900
The parents are very selfish about how they use the funds.

173
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,660
Not only the committee, but if the former director knew about this, he would be—!

174
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,560
- Teacher Ma.
- Yes?

175
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,600
Can I see the exam results for Wildflower's Yoon Seung Woo?

176
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,250
- Seung Woo's?
- Yes.

177
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,490
He always gets a zero. Wait a moment.

178
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,690
Here you go. Looks like he did get them all wrong.

179
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,800
English section

180
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,100
Oh my!

181
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,170
What's with him? He's the unluckiest. He should have gotten at least one correct even with guessing. How could he?

182
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,590
Right, Teacher Ma?

183
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,260
I think I'm the unluckiest person these days.

184
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,300
I keep having this dark energy come to me. It's such bad luck.

185
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,650
Oh my. Don't worry, Teacher Ma.

186
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,580
You have me.

187
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,530
Or he knew all the answers

188
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,120
and purposely dodged them.

189
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,360
Who uses this many A4 papers?!

190
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:18,280
Use both sides of the paper! The school pays for those. These people!

191
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,070
You wouldn't use them like that if you thought they were yours!

192
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:24,670
- Teacher Son. Wildflower Teacher Son!
- Yes?

193
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,300
Director Lee would like to support the Wildflower kids,

194
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,920
so he's asking for you to counsel them.

195
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,470
What is he doing with those losers?

196
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,900
Anyway, please proceed with the counseling.

197
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,350
Okay.

198
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,500
Unknown number: 02-137-73-29

199
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,140
Yes, this is Son Soo Jeong.

200
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,070
Teacher, Son Soo Jeong.

201
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,840
Teacher Son Soo Jeong, I'll give you back the $50,000.

202
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,690
In order to get that money, I ran everywhere.

203
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,320
After work, go to the lockers in the subway train station.

204
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,990
Open the #18 locker.

205
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,950
The password is 4873.

206
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,230
Enter Passcode

207
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,380
What the heck? Where is my 50 million won?

208
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,400
Go over to Seon Oh Park.

209
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,570
Seon Oh Park?

210
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,930
Has he gone crazy?

211
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,220
Next to the swings, under the pinenut tree at the park playground.

212
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:05,920
Fifty million, my 50 million won. I'm sure it has to be right here.

213
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,060
The trashcan for the public restroom that's in the park.

214
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,580
This freaking pine-nut tree!

215
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,620
If you are messing with me, I'm going to curse all three generations of your family!

216
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,190
Fifty mil...!

217
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,250
Ah yes, I just now delivered it.

218
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,680
Alright, bye now.

219
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,800
I'm home.

220
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,330
Hey, delivery.

221
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,520
I'm a student. I'm a student who should be studying.

222
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,830
I'm the head of the family here who is feeding you here.

223
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,150
Aish! Where is it?

224
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,070
This goes to the real estate office inside of the plaza where the intersection is. Assorted seafood and veggie stirfry.

225
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:23,770
Stir-fried seafood and veggies and spicy fried shrimp. They ordered all the main-entree dishes you know. So make sure to be super quick and friendly.

226
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,530
Okay. You go!

227
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,510
Kim Myeong Ho?

228
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,700
Aish! Who the hell?

229
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,010
Long no time no see Kim Myeong Ho.

230
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,670
Aish!

231
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,870
Man, I'm so happy to see you since I haven't seen you in a long time you know.

232
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,090
But it seems like you don't feel the same way as me.

233
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,350
I am also extremely happy to see you

234
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,590
but I feel like we shouldn't be so happy to see each other either.

235
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,240
Let's just have a chit-chat, alright?

236
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,100
Well, just now I saw Oh Se Ho—

237
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,980
What are you talking about?!

238
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,730
I gave it back. I gave it all back, alright?!

239
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,940
I gave all of the 50 million back to Teacher Son, so what else do you need me to say?!

240
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,720
What? What do you mean by that?

241
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,450
If you don't believe me, why don't you go check it out yourself?

242
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,330
Wait, do you really mean that?

243
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,150
You always gamble so I'm wondering where you got the 50 million to even pay it ba—

244
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,510
Hey, Kim Myeong Ho. That 50 million.

245
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,830
Was it from Oh Se Ho?

246
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,450
I can't say any more.

247
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,970
You got a call.

248
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,710
You should pick it up if it's an urgent call.

249
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,030
What?! I'm going okay? I'm right in front of the place anyway.

250
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,650
Ah, seriously!

251
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,880
What's up with the sales? Geesh!

252
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,820
A man gave money to a woman. So what does that mean?

253
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,960
How much?

254
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,280
Fifty million won.

255
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,460
That's true love, man. If it isn't love, it's impossible. Yup

256
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,570
that's right. You can't explain without that.

257
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,040
Could it be that Kim Myeong Ho gave money to Son Soo Jeong?

258
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,990
Right? Am I right? I'm getting goosebumps. That's crazy.

259
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,180
Does Kim Myeong Ho have a thing for Son Soo Jeong?

260
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,050
Man, stop that senseless—

261
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,790
I don't know dude.

262
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,020
Bank account

263
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,050
Bank account

264
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,690
Bank account

265
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,180
But I wonder why he gave it back though.

266
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,030
Something does smell a little fishy though, whatever that may be.

267
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,240
Ah, forget it.

268
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,160
I got my money back. I got my money back and now I'm also a full-time permanent teacher.

269
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,730
Son Soo Jeong, ignorance is bliss.

270
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,320
Seolsong High School Food Pyramid. My 50 million won.

271
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,900
I'm pretty sure it is bliss.

272
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,670
Socrates said this,

273
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,210
"God doesn't ever

274
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,880
reach out to a person who doesn't take action." That's right.

275
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,290
Kang Bok Soo, you are doing a great job, so never give up.

276
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,270
What are you doing?

277
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:17,510
My fellow alumnus is a director already, so I'm able to make a visit to such a place like this. This is great.

278
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,330
Hey man, you should be more honest about it. You didn't even graduate yet.

279
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,450
If you have anything that you're curious about, you should just ask me directly. You shouldn't be hiding out like a little mouse.

280
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,740
You were the one who gave money to Son Soo Jeong through Kim Myeong Ho, right?

281
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,100
You even know Kim Myeong Ho? Kang Bok Soo, you are quite someone.

282
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,240
I did it for someone I like.

283
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,850
Is that such a bad thing?

284
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,930
- You like her?
- Weren't you predicting something like this already?

285
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,940
Don't we look so good together?

286
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,810
Do you think Son Soo Jeong would thank you for it after finding out about all this?

287
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,100
Are you threatening me now?

288
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,800
Why don't you go tell her for me then? You should tell her that Oh Se Ho is a very capable man.

289
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,280
"Oh Se Ho is the prince charming on a white horse who will change your life for the better instantaneously."

290
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,510
If you are not busy why don't you go over there and tell her that for me?

291
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,380
Why are you telling me all this anyway?

292
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,600
It's because Son Soo Jeong is not going to believe in what you say, you know.

293
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,320
What?

294
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,980
You didn't hear me? I told you that she won't believe in anything you say.

295
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,500
Why? You should go check it out for yourself if you don't believe me.

296
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,910
So you can find out if Son Soo Jeong will believe you or not.

297
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,360
Seriously, you crazy little bastard for crying out loud.

298
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,220
Thanks for your compliment.

299
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:51,190
Hey! Ow, don't break it! It's me!

300
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,820
Hey kid, it's me! That hurts you punk! Geesh!

301
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,590
Here.

302
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,100
Please stop eating sweet stuff, sir. Your teeth are going to rot.

303
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,370
Damn kid, stop nagging.

304
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,200
Why did you come out from there anyway?

305
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,340
Because I had something to talk about with Oh Se Ho.

306
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,330
Teacher.

307
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,580
Son Soo Jeong.

308
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,460
Why do you think Son Soo Jeong didn't believe me at the time?

309
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:40,520
If Son Soo Jeong pushed someone right in front of my eyes,

310
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:45,480
then I would think that there must be a reason and that person wouldn't do such a thing.

311
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,760
I would've believed in her even in that situation.

312
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,360
But I wonder why she didn't though.

313
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,180
I wonder if it's because she just didn't like me?

314
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,220
Hey Bok Soo, it seems like you might have something to say Soo Jeong too.

315
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,790
You punk kid.
