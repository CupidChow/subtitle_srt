1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,100
Alright! Yes!

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,090
Frog's back leg (a phrase meaning to smile)!

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,110
What am I good at?

4
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:08,760
My dreams?

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,110
I think I'm good at lying.

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,990
Make a lot of money so I can get a surgery that will make me look younger.

7
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,090
Actually, I...

8
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:13,800
All of it.

9
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,640
A famous author.

10
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,690
I actually have something to counsel you about.

11
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,850
I'm talking about 'fanfic.' It's writing naughty things about idol singers and selling them...

12
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,790
Please don't put any pink lipstick on.

13
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:22,400
I'm being serious here.

14
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,040
It looks dark.

15
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,340
This business brings in a lot of money.

16
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,390
- My dreams?
- I want to hurry up and graduate so I no longer come to this place that I'm so sick of.

17
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,410
Daily Student Counseling Report

18
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,220
Kang Bok Soo...?

19
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,170
We still have a final boss that I need to deal with.

20
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,810
What is it?

21
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,730
Why are you trying to set up a certain mood here?

22
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,410
I'm trying to treat you like a real teacher.

23
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,520
- So, please go ahead and counsel me, ma'am.
- Oh, okay.

24
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,200
What is your dream?

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,720
My dream?

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,430
Well, I don't know. It's been so long since I forgot about it.

27
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,890
Kang Bok Soo. Think carefully before you talk so you can answer me sincerely.

28
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,800
I'm being sincere right now, ma'am.

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,660
Ever since I became just a middle school graduate, everyone would tell me that I was not qualified, no matter what I tried to do,

30
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,350
so because of that, I didn't really think about what I should do with my life.

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,390
Are you protesting against me now?

32
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,980
I'm just being honest with you, that's all.

33
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:42,780
The world was so cold to a person who was supposed to be in school at that age.

34
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,400
Hey, have you heard?

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,770
Kang Bok Soo is going to be kicked out of school.

36
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,740
His life is pretty much f**ed up. I say that Kang Bok Soo's life is pretty much done now.

37
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,570
He freaking deserves to be kicked out of school. How can he push someone off the rooftop like that?

38
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,300
- A guy like that should be just chained up and locked away somewhere...
- HEY!

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,510
How could you be like that to Bok Soo?!

40
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,470
Is Kang Bok Soo a boy who would do such a thing? Have you guys seen Bok Soo ever harass a kid even once?!

41
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,360
Do we have to see that to know?!

42
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,040
But that's what Oh Se Ho said, you know! Same goes for the cops too!

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,020
Hey! When you were harassed by the bullies from next school for your money

44
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,550
Kang Bok Soo was the one who helped you out. Did you already forget?! Bok Soo helped you guys out numerous times.

45
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,360
How could you treat Bok Soo like that? You graceless punks!

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,950
Bok Soo...

47
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,760
Bok Soo is a very nice kid.

48
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,860
You all should know that by now.

49
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,990
Why are you guys constantly pretending otherwise?

50
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,700
Why are you crying for? Stop crying now.

51
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,590
Hey Yang Min Ji, snap out of it. No matter how Kang Bok Soo was in the past,

52
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,650
his life has been turned into trash now.

53
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,360
- So just give up and quit with all this.
- Hey, you.

54
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,250
Say that again. Say that again, you punk.

55
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,130
How is my friend trash huh?!

56
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,560
- Let go of me!
- Hey...!

57
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,180
I said, say that again bastard!

58
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,950
How is my friend trash, huh?

59
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,560
You asshole.

60
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,910
Hey, say that again.

61
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
I said let go of me!

62
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,940
What are you doing?!

63
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,080
Stop fighting!

64
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,630
Grandma.

65
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,430
Why are you crying, my dear?

66
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,970
Grandma.

67
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,970
Who made my little granddaughter cry like this, for heaven's sake?

68
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,620
Why, what happened? Oh my.

69
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,360
- Grandma, I should've just lied about it.
- Huh?

70
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,950
I should've just said that I didn't see it. I should've said that I didn't hear anything either.

71
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,510
I should've just lied about it all.

72
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,410
If I had just done that...

73
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,270
Why would you want to lie?

74
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,820
You didn't do anything wrong. You would be in the wrong for lying anyway.

75
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,680
He's not a kid to do such a thing.

76
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,630
He really isn't a kid that would do such a thing.

77
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,950
Did you go over to him and ask him at least?

78
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:22,120
Did you ask him if he was the one who really did that? Did you take your time to ask him about it?

79
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,550
I just want to forget about it all.

80
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,550
- I just want to erase it all from my head.
- Oh my. What to do here?

81
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,710
Kang Bok Soo, what are you planning to do?! Seriously!

82
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,290
Seriously, what did you do that for?!!

83
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,420
No, I really didn't do it!!!

84
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,410
He said that he wasn't the one who did it.

85
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,690
My son said that he wasn't the one who did it!!

86
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,870
Mom! This is not about whether he did it or not you know!

87
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,820
He got kicked out of school, and on top of that,

88
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,470
he is known for being a problem child so there isn't any place that would accept him either!

89
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,200
What is he going to be doing in the future?!

90
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,850
How else he going to get work?! Seriously, what are you going to do?!!

91
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,810
Son Soo Jeong.

92
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,780
I didn't do anything wrong.

93
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,970
Kang Bok Soo, you shouldn't say stuff like that—

94
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,350
I felt it was so unfair to hear all kinds of insults from people in the past. However, I forgot about all of that.

95
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,790
The reason why I'm not able to forget and am feeling miserable after all this time

96
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:51,010
is because I keep wondering, "Why didn't Son Soo Jeong believe me?"

97
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,270
I think that was the crux of it.

98
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,320
I would've taken your side even if you were going through all kinds of misunderstandings by others.

99
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,680
You know why? It's because I know what you are about. And also I—

100
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,260
Were my feelings that I showed you back then not enough for you?

101
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,500
Why won't you believe me?

102
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,690
Hey! Don't you even feel sorry for Son Soo Jeong!!!

103
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,660
I don't want to talk about the past.

104
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,690
If you don't know, then I've got nothing more to say to you.

105
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,770
Alright, it's all over now.

106
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:56,030
I guess I'm the only one who's been hanging around there by myself. I'm leaving now.

107
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,420
I also thought of it too.

108
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,090
My dream.

109
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,260
Son Soo Jeong's boyfriend.

110
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,860
I wonder if it really is over now.

111
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,550
You're not the only one who had a hard time, you know.

112
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,840
Kang Bok Soo.

113
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,940
Counseling Office

114
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,550
Seolsong High School

115
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:26,150
Umm, there's nothing special to say to you kids. Who is absent?

116
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,530
Kang Bok Soo Hyung is not here.

117
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,360
I wonder if he went volunteering?

118
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,130
No, ma'am. He hasn't been here all day.

119
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,490
He wouldn't even answer his phone.

120
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,420
He told us that he's leaving for school, so where did he go?

121
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,300
Probably, that old man's sleeping in or something.

122
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,820
When one comes to school

123
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,160
the other one doesn't come.

124
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,300
I will try to contact him.

125
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,080
Please stay out of trouble, kids.

126
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,120
Oh, the troublemaker isn't here today after all.

127
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,600
Alright, have fun preparing for your next class.

128
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,690
Kang Bok Soo, what's going on? Are you playing hooky?

129
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,970
Ahh.

130
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,450
Why? You're not the type who would be absent from school no matter what happens.

131
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,360
I know, right? Hey!

132
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,760
Me. School.

133
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,160
School? What about it?

134
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,890
Never mind.

135
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,310
Seriously, man, you're frustrating me here.

136
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,890
Hey, you said you wanted to take revenge. Did you get to even talk to Son Soo Jeong about it?

137
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:42,810
Me. School.

138
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,490
Should I just quit school?

139
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,730
You want to do that? I talked to Min Ji Noona and she helped set everything up for me, just in case,

140
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,960
since I wasn't so sure when you would change your mind about all this.

141
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:01,090
Bok Soo. It's truly late when you think it's too late.

142
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,950
Good thinking.

143
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,310
Resignation Request Form

144
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,150
Let's dine out tonight. Let's eat something expensive. My treat.

145
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,610
Bad Wench

146
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,890
Forget about it. It's his life.

147
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,570
Why call a grown man to school...?

148
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,960
Kang Bok Soo didn't come to school, right?

149
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,800
Why didn't he come? Doesn't he answer his phone?

150
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,250
Oh, man.

151
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,820
If he continues to be absent...

152
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,960
I'll keep trying to contact him.

153
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,820
You don't have to do that! If he wants to come, he'll come.

154
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,350
It's eight minutes past the expiration. If you want it, you can have it.

155
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,310
Oh! Free!

156
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,380
Triangular kimbap has an expiration date within which you can still eat it.

157
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,440
If it's just past the expiration, it's still edible, but only by part-time workers, like you and me.

158
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,160
If you let it continue to sit, it becomes trash.

159
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,540
What are you saying?

160
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,250
Misunderstandings between people are also like that.

161
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,190
If you let it fester for too long, your heart decays.

162
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,710
Sometimes I'm a little afraid of you.

163
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,320
Eat up.

164
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,710
Welcome.

165
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,270
- Son Soo Jeong
- Huh?

166
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,660
What?

167
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,630
What are you doing here?

168
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,430
I-I was thirsty, so I dropped in to buy some w-water.

169
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,380
This far?

170
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,650
The water here tasted good last time when you had beer here.

171
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,850
If you haven't eaten dinner yet, would you like to have a meal together?

172
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,610
Are you buying?

173
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,570
Okay then.

174
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,280
Let's eat here.

175
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,340
Here?

176
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,200
The most harmonious foods from the convenience store are

177
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,860
popping with MSG flavor

178
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,240
and with the extremely harmonious mixture of spicy, salty, sweet, salty.

179
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,290
Spicy, Salty, Sweet and salty. Ta-da-ta-da. Ta Da!

180
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,850
- Son Soo Jeong.
- Uhm?

181
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,840
Have a meal with me.

182
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,070
I am eating.

183
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,360
Let's eat three times as a man and a woman.

184
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,820
If not, then as a friend. If still not,

185
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,140
then as a director and a teacher.

186
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,110
As you've said, I am the boss of all bosses here. Don't you think you should grant my favor?

187
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,130
- Mom.
- Um?
- One more bowl.

188
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,560
You got your appetite back today, didn't you?

189
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,980
Um.

190
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,280
Ah! No, I need to go to the academy. I am late.

191
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,460
I'll get back to my food when I come back.

192
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,900
Okay, see you.

193
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,920
Ah, this is suffocating me.

194
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:52,280
Kang Bok Soo. Why did you make such a big deal when you were going to quit after just a few days?

195
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,470
Kang So Jeong.

196
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,310
What? I am not saying anything wrong.

197
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,530
You saw my In Ho got his appetite back because you quit school, didn't you?

198
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:05,020
It must've been so hard for him to support you.

199
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,150
Don't mind me. You do what you want to do. It's fine with me.

200
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,390
Oh. It's cold.

201
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,880
So cold.

202
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,280
Oh my!

203
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,290
- Teacher, you've come.
- Yes.

204
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,860
I came to use my coupon today.

205
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,850
Ah, yeah...

206
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,600
Please give me samsun jjambbong (spicy seafood soup).

207
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,310
Pricing above $8 on the menu needs five more coupons.

208
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,170
Thanks.

209
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,140
Tell your mother I enjoyed it.

210
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,350
Why tell her when you paid for it.

211
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,020
Still. I am leaving.

212
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,760
Ah!

213
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,610
Are you really leaving?

214
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,440
Of course, I am leaving. Should I live here?

215
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,430
No, because you are leaving without saying anything.

216
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,190
No. "Why didn't you come to school?"

217
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,490
"Will you not come back to school?" Won't you ask things like this?

218
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,520
I wondered if you got your legs broken for not coming to school, but I see you are fine.

219
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,970
I am leaving. Ah, it's cold.

220
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,510
Are you really leaving? Teacher!

221
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,310
Bye.

222
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,500
Where did Kang Bok Soo go leaving his backpack here?

223
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,840
Uh? My backpack.

224
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,360
I left it there because it's vacant.

225
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,220
Teacher, Bok Soo is not here again.

226
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,440
Did he really quit?

227
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,750
Seeing Bok Soo's face is my healing point.

228
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,450
Did the elder faint?

229
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,270
He must've overdone it coming to school every day in the cold at his old age.

230
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,170
Indeed, coming to school is not for everyone.

231
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,020
Ah, I am tired.

232
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,620
I'm going to stop being the cafeteria lady.

233
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,470
Wasn't it you who happily threw down the letter of resignation?

234
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:29,000
What's the point of going to the school when Bok Soo is not there?

235
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,700
Are you really not going to school?

236
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,120
Didn't you say it's too late when you think it's too late?

237
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,270
You all are going to drink coffee, right?

238
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,790
Oh. My employer is going to treat?

239
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,110
Let's go together and drink it there, Bok Soo.

240
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,720
And let's act like it's a date.

241
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,240
Bad Wench

242
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,770
Hey, Kang Bok Soo. Why aren't you coming to school?

243
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,410
Did you forget that our fate is joined? If you don't come to school, I'll get the damage.

244
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,440
It's me, Son Soo Jeong.

245
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,550
Bok Soo's girlfriend.

246
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,390
Why are you answering Kang Bok Soo's phone?

247
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,710
Listen well, I won't repeat myself.

248
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,480
My Bok Soo is not going to school again. I am saying he won't see you again.

249
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,770
So don't call again, and let's not get into each other's business and leave our lives separately. The end.

250
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,090
What do you mean not coming to school...?

251
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,650
Why so suddenly...?

252
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,580
- Let's me talk to Kang Bok Soo. I'll talk directly—
- Son Soo Jeong.

253
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,860
If you are really his teacher,

254
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,150
for his future, you should end this here.

255
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,290
Stop bothering Bok Soo.

256
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,610
What, did I say anything wrong?

257
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,200
Bok Soo. It's not that...

258
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,850
Its okay.

259
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,670
I said it's fine.

260
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,170
I'll leave first.

261
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,380
Oppa.

262
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,990
Is Bok Soo absent again today?

263
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:55,710
Is this rascal really not coming back? Son Soo Jeong, don't you have something to talk to him about?

264
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,840
I think Bok Soo has something to talk to you about.

265
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,250
Teacher Son.

266
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,850
If you have finished counseling with the students in your class, bring the reports directly to the director.

267
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,060
Don't let him call me about them.

268
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,840
Yes.

269
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,810
Teacher, I'm really busy now.

270
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,420
The counseling report completion deadline is today.

271
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,060
Okay. Do your work. Do your work.

272
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,240
I'm a bit late, right? I was just on my way to report to you.

273
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,730
Oh Se Ho, what are you doing?

274
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,240
It's getting late for dinner. You promised to eat with me three times. Let's go. I'm hungry.

275
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,540
Excuse me.

276
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,420
You can just come in and use this facility like this?

277
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,670
You keep forgetting. I'm the director of this school.

278
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,320
I'm the employer of all of the people in this school.

279
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:34,410
What you just said, if it's a joke, it's not funny at all. If you mean it, you are really a bastard.

280
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,870
Okay. I'm a bastard.

281
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,300
I'm not sure about the taste, but considering my effort, give it a try.

282
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,910
I organized the kids' counseling reports.

283
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,550
But is it okay for you to just recruit lectures and give counseling for only the students in my class?

284
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,730
People will probably protest and the committee probably will too.

285
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,880
Are you worrying for me right now?

286
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,750
Huh?

287
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,160
I'm touched that you're worrying for me.

288
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,620
No, not that...

289
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,590
Son Soo Jeong.

290
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,950
I like you.

291
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,870
I like you too!

292
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,580
You're a good employer.

293
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,590
I'm being serious.

294
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,740
Why? Aren't I pretty good?

295
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,150
Think about it well. I'm handsome, rich, and fun—

296
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,460
Maybe not funny.

297
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,710
Liking someone isn't made with conditions.

298
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,080
Is it because of Kang Bok Soo?

299
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:40,060
After that incident, I left Korea like a runaway. I often thought about

300
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,420
whether you were okay.

301
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,720
Whether you were doing well.

302
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,250
I was okay.

303
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,990
It's the truth so...

304
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,250
How you could endure when the other kids probably harassed you.

305
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,570
I felt it was so unfair to hear all kinds of insults from people in the past.

306
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,260
However, I forgot about all of that.

307
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,020
The reason why I'm not able to forget and am feeling miserable after all this time

308
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:10,190
is because I keep wondering, "Why didn't Son Soo Jeong believe me?"

309
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,830
I wasn't okay.

310
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,950
Everything was difficult for me after that day.

311
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:24,290
Ever since I became just a middle school graduate, everyone would tell me that I was not qualified, no matter what I tried to do,

312
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:28,790
so because of that, I didn't really think about what I should do with my life.

313
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:39,500
Son Soo Jeong. I don't want to live in the past anymore.

314
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,130
Why aren't you asking me?

315
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,630
Nine years ago and even right now, why do you not ask

316
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,310
me what happened?!

317
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,780
Let's cover the past.

318
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,230
Were my feelings that I showed you back then not enough for you?

319
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:08,660
No matter where you live, Son Soo Jeong is still Son Soo Jeong.

320
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,160
The front gate is as pretty as Son Soo Jeong now, right?

321
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:20,110
Son Soo Jeong's boyfriend.

322
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,830
What?

323
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,110
I want to live in the present with you.

324
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,050
In this moment right now.

325
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,720
Please tell me now.

326
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,070
I'm sorry. I'll be going first.

327
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,850
Cover the past?

328
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,760
How?

329
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,890
It still hasn't ended for me.

330
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:22,080
Kang Bok Soo, how are you so honest?

331
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,940
Do you really have nothing to be sorry about toward me?

332
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,570
I also believed that I knew you.

333
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:37,730
Were my feelings... laughable?

334
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,370
Yeah.

335
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,260
It's all in the past anyway.

336
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,880
It seems I'm the only one stuck in the past.

337
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,000
Kang Bok Soo...

338
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,850
You're not the only one stuck there.

339
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,960
Large party room available

340
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,370
So Jeong Kak

341
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,150
What is this? Are you making a home visit?

342
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,150
That day.

343
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,990
Nine years ago on that day.

344
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,060
I'll only ask you two questions.

345
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,330
That day on the rooftop,

346
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,230
did you push Oh Se Ho?

347
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,300
Answer me.

348
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,890
Did you really push Oh Se Ho?

349
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,170
No.

350
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,550
It wasn't me.

351
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,100
I didn't push him.

352
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:07,660
Were you the one who spread the rumors about me living on food stamps?

353
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,050
No. What are you saying right now?

354
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,590
That day, I definitely heard you

355
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,710
say you found me pitiful.

356
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:26,750
Did you also... just find me pitiful?

357
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:34,160
Is it because you found me pitiful that you brought me home every day,

358
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,000
smiled at me,

359
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,550
found my dream for me, and painted my front

360
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,210
gates?

361
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,140
Looks like you can't answer.

362
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,870
No. It was because I liked you.

363
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,230
Not because I found you pitiful.

364
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,160
But because I liked you.

365
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,520
I'm sorry...

366
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,430
for asking you too late.

367
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,090
I'm sorry.

368
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:23,640
The time when everything else seemed immature. The time when I believed in someone.

369
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:30,460
I remember that that was the warmest time

370
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,540
of my life.

371
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,220
♫  Are you listening?  ♫

372
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,320
♫  To my falling tears ♫

373
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,550
♫  Are you listening?  ♫

374
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:50,210
♫  My feelings that I can't withstand ♫

375
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,670
♫ To try enduring the day again  ♫

376
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,090
♫  my love cries every day  ♫

377
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:02,950
My Strange Hero
(Bok Soo Has Returned)

378
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:08,060
♫  Are you listening right now? It's so hard. ♫

379
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,800
♫  Even though I'm trying to let you go  ♫

380
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,690
♫  My heart won't let me  ♫

381
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,460
I'll see you at school. The kids are waiting for you.

382
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,150
What are you blatantly staring at this morning? You saw Soo Jeong, right?

383
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,550
I tried to forget you for the past nine years,

384
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,100
but I'm glad that I couldn't.

385
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,590
Do I have to treat the kids well for you to laugh? Shall we eat dinner?

386
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,320
I still haven't eaten pork belly.

387
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,240
Do you still like Kang Bok Soo?

388
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,060
If you don't like him, you don't. You should settle it first.

389
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,890
I've always wanted to come here.

390
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,450
Boundaries are meant to be crossed. Did you forget my dream?

391
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,400
Son Soo Jeong's boyfriend.

392
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,510
I'm sorry for not believing you back then.

393
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,700
I'm really okay now

394
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,560
because you're here next to me right now.

395
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,360
♫ Are you listening to my heart?  ♫
