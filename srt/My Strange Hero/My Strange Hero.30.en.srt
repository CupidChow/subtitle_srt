1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,040
In this place, I think you all know

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,140
that some of you have become teachers through illegal means.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,760
Telling kids to study hard.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,710
For advising kids they can achieve their dreams if they study hard,

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,830
I think you'd be embarrassed, yourself.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,260
Your current positions should be competed for fairly.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,550
To those people who achieved their dreams of becoming a teacher through justified means,

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,740
I'd like it if you return it to them.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,630
I'll accept your letter of resignation quietly.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,680
Fine.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,620
Then we will leave it to your own conscience.

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,010
Are you saying the previous director, Oh Se Ho, orchestrated this from America?

13
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,010
That's right.

14
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,470
As you can confirm through the revealed video clip of him and parents of the students,

15
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,760
Oh Se Ho has participated in this matter more aggressively

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,070
after he came back to Korea.

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,880
Isn't Director Oh Se Ho your son?

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,860
You're accusing your own son with your own mouth?

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,590
Shouldn't a parent

20
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,970
immediately catch her child if they go down the wrong path?

21
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,330
What do you mean a culprit?

22
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,070
Didn't you bring me here as a testifier?

23
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,040
Im Se Gyeong has pointed you as the culprit behind the corruption.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,680
It's not even surprising anymore.

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,190
We were also suspecting you since the beginning.

26
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,530
There should be no reason why the son wouldn't know what the mother is doing.

27
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,500
Isn't the private school corruption your family business anyway?

28
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,340
I have no intention to defend meyself.

29
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,650
Are you acknowledging it?

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,610
I'll take the fifth.

31
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,370
You must know that the situation is unfavorable towards you.

32
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,490
Even so, taking the fifth might not be best for you.

33
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,520
Do you not have anything to say about the video where you were meeting with the PTA chairperson?

34
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,480
Why did you meet her?

35
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,820
What's this? Where did everybody go?

36
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,060
You've suffered a lot, Soo Jeong.

37
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,070
We prepared this to celebrate your new beginning.

38
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,740
Thank you.

39
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,060
I'm really unemployed now.

40
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,060
How are you going to make a living now?

41
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,620
How about being an intern for us?

42
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,610
What intern at a booger-size company?

43
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,000
Team Leader Kang Bok Soo, you keep coming out crooked.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,500
If you keep doing this, I might fire you and instead get Son Soo Jeong.

45
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,080
Would you? You know I am good at various things, right CEO?

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,900
I know. I know very well.

47
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,380
Get a hold of yourself.

48
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,880
You should also get a hold of yourself and find a new job.

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,560
I'll do some part-time jobs for the time being and think about what kind of job I can do.

50
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,850
Because a certain someone hasn't found me my dream yet.

51
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,930
I... think I found your dream.

52
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,500
What is it? What do you think I should do?

53
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,530
A lifetime employment without the worry of dismissal.

54
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,610
It provides food and shelter, four types of insurance, pension, and

55
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,370
no worry for retirement, the best job.

56
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,720
The wife.

57
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,850
Wait, wait! The cake!

58
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,920
Ah, wait! The cake. Oh, oh!

59
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,410
It was really about to drop!

60
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,190
Be careful.

61
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,400
Stop. It's about to drop.

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,620
Stop it, seriously!

63
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,310
Grandma!

64
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,710
My granddaughter is here.

65
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,150
Grandma, I am unemployed now.

66
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,210
I'll be able to see you every day now.

67
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:49,370
It's very refreshing. I can now start from the beginning.

68
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,290
Whatever it is.

69
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,090
Pretty. Aigoo.

70
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,250
You're so pretty.

71
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,510
Thank you.

72
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,510
You're the only one who unconditionally tells me that I'm pretty

73
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,070
so you must live for a long time.

74
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:20,040
Why? The pink gate person doesn't tell you you are pretty?

75
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,960
That's true! There's one more person.

76
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,930
You're so smart, Grandma.

77
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,670
Grandma.

78
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,130
I'm going to live really diligently.

79
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,580
That way, I can live prettily beside you for a long time.

80
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,960
Looking for a part-timer

81
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,350
♫ Whenever I think about you, you suddenly appear ♫

82
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,820
♫ You make my heart flutter and tremble  ♫

83
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,330
♫ Thick traces of you, one by one  ♫

84
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,700
What? What?

85
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,260
Why? What is it?

86
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,470
Nothing.

87
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,180
Seolsong High's previous director Oh Se Ho, pleas fifth on alleged corruption.

88
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,310
You said you wanted to meet me. What's going on?

89
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,610
You. Why did you get hooked with your mother?

90
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,680
I know all about that evidence, but you didn't do anything directly.

91
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,040
It has nothing to do with you.

92
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,570
It's because I'm indebted to you. Why?

93
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,420
Fifth my butt. Just tell them the truth.

94
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,390
That's it, isn't it?

95
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,200
Kang Bok Soo, you don't know.

96
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,310
Nine years ago and even now, the truth that you couldn't say

97
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,730
was because of your mom.

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,390
I don't know you? Yeah, I don't.

99
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,030
Why you are still living as an idiot following the orders of your mom?

100
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,990
Don't you feel so unfair?

101
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,030
Your mom—

102
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,720
Seriously.

103
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,330
Kang Bok Soo, you—

104
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,700
Whatever the reason is, if you lie again this time,

105
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,050
you're going to regret it for real.

106
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,820
You said you wanted to live differently now.

107
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,770
Get a hold of yourself, Kang Bok Soo.

108
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,350
Just leave him alone.

109
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,690
I filed to close Seolsong High.

110
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,330
What did you say?

111
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,080
Why? I can't let you inherit it, can I?

112
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,180
Closing the school won't be that easy.

113
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,050
It'll be over once the board of education approves it.

114
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,550
Don't you think I can pull it off after I spent so much money?

115
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,720
If you close the school, what about the kids?

116
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,700
Who cares? They will transfer on their own.

117
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,980
You really...

118
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,000
I am doing whatever I want with what's mine. So what?

119
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,190
If you don't like it,

120
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,510
why don't you take full responsibility then?

121
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,170
Award for Kang Bok Soo, first place

122
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,360
Award
It will happen if you try!
Kang Bok Soo

123
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,980
He still has this.

124
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,560
Kang Bok Soo, what the heck?

125
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,600
My dear Bok Soo is so talented.

126
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,930
Come down once you're done with cleaning!

127
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,820
Yes, ma'am!

128
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,590
Hey part-timer, shouldn't you be cleaning more thoroughly?

129
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,960
Oh my, still dusty. I can't bear it.

130
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,840
Wipe it down again.

131
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,620
Will do, ma'am.

132
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,730
Your hands seem to be so dull and senseless.

133
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,310
I bet you've only worked while holding a pen instead of doing any of this tiresome and gritty work.

134
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,880
Are you bossing her around now? Are you?!

135
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,920
Are you bossing her around, trying to act like her older sister-in-law?!

136
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,690
Sister-in-law, yeah right.

137
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,970
I haven't approved of their marriage yet.

138
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,570
He is my son. Don't boss around my son's girlfriend.

139
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,590
What the? What are you doing here?

140
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,010
I'm doing some part-time work. Dinner time part-time work.

141
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,700
I get to do some part-time work while I get to see you at the same time.

142
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,810
Hey! Don't do it! Quit right now! The working environment is not good here at all.

143
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,240
And by the way, you should do this from now on!

144
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,880
Do you want to do that?

145
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,690
If you quit working here, I can hook you up with another part-time job that will be more comfortable for you.

146
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,570
- What is it?
- Well...

147
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,450
Tutoring my son In Ho.

148
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,860
Your his auntie now so please help him get into college. Pretty please?

149
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,370
Go back upstairs and go to sleep, please.

150
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,420
Hurry up and just go to sleep already!

151
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,520
But why? I just want to hire someone highly qualified who's jobless which will be good for everyone.

152
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,210
If a girl like her just works here doing nothing but cleaning, it will be a big loss to our country. That would be wasteful to society.

153
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,200
Wasteful my butt.

154
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,650
Please go upstairs now. Just hurry up and go.

155
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,580
Please do me a favor.

156
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,120
Soo Jeong, I thought about your dream.

157
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,010
You should just shut it if you're going to mention anything about me being a practical and faithful wife, okay?

158
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,930
No matter how much I think about it,

159
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:55,750
I honestly think that being a teacher suits you the best.

160
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:13,630
What do you think about studying some more?

161
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,200
Wasn't sleeping man!

162
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,070
That's not true!

163
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,390
S High School's corruption made some commotion recently.

164
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,030
Take a look at this, guys. This school will be closed down soon.

165
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,110
What?! It's going to close down?!

166
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,830
What do you mean?!

167
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,530
They said that they will...

168
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,820
Hey, let me see that.

169
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,550
It has been revealed that they are strongly considering closing down the school.

170
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,120
It's for real.

171
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,900
Regarding the school scandal that's been going on, the S Foundation has been examining themselves thoroughly.

172
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,290
Due to the deep corruption that's been happening,

173
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,870
they made a call that it would be impossible to bring the school back to its normal state.

174
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,160
So they shared their stand on why they submitted a request to the education department to close down the school.

175
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,060
That is Seolsong High School, isn't it?

176
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,140
Last time they...

177
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,100
Yes.

178
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,570
What's this about?

179
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,130
Why in the world are they closing down the school?

180
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,100
Who says they can just close down the school like that?!

181
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,330
The school will close down once they get the approval from the education department.

182
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,740
We are alive and well, so why the heck are they closing the school down?!

183
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,670
Does this even make sense?

184
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,270
Elder, what is he saying?

185
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,100
The foundation and the education department have both made the decision to close down the school.

186
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,390
Get out of my way.

187
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,650
What's going to happen to us once the school closes down, sir?

188
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,090
Mr. Assistant Principal, did you know about all of this?

189
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,470
There's no way that they are talking about closing down the school so suddenly!

190
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,190
How am I supposed to know all that?! I'm the one who should be the most frustrated about this!

191
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,990
How am I supposed to go find a job at this age?!

192
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,220
Closing down the school can't be that easy to do.

193
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,680
And it's not definitely decided yet either, so let's wait and see what happens.

194
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:57,030
It's normal for a private school to have corruption to some degree.

195
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,920
How can they close down the school for something so petty like this?

196
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,950
Teacher! We are teachers for crying out loud, but you're here talking about it as if it's nothing!

197
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,940
- That's so wrong of you!
- What?

198
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,940
What is that supposed to mean?

199
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,810
So are you saying that I'm not even a teacher then?

200
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,620
Stop it, both of you!

201
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,100
Seriously, we should be working together instead of fighting.

202
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:22,330
I'm pretty sure all the parents will be finding out about this sooner or later, so what kind of countermeasure should we take?

203
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,620
Teacher, what does that mean? What do you mean, closing down the school?!!

204
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,710
These people are just thinking of the school as a place to do business till the bitter end.

205
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,620
Is it even possible to close down the school?

206
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,940
The foundation that is claiming to be the owner of the school submitted a request form to close down the school,

207
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,950
and once the education department approves, it is still possible for them to do that.

208
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,630
Like, let's say someone had a fried chicken shop and closes it down

209
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,260
and someone owns a school but doesn't want to run it anymore and wants to close it down.

210
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,990
Although all the students' lives are dependent on it, it's still the same?!

211
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,260
That's how the law is.

212
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,710
What kind of crazy law is this?!

213
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,210
But it's still not that easy for them to approve of something like this anyway.

214
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,380
So let's just wait a little while longer.

215
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,870
We shouldn't be just waiting here. We should do everything in our power to stop them, Teacher!

216
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,400
I looked it up on the internet, and it was saying that if the school closes down, we'd all have to transfer to another school.

217
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,930
What?! Not that stupid transferring schools thing again!

218
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,510
Then this really is considered a forced transfer.

219
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,820
Why are they always doing whatever the heck they want?

220
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,390
The education department won't be able to give them approval for closing down the school that easily though.

221
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,100
But our school is still a prestigious school located in the heart of Seoul.

222
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,300
So they won't be able to that so carelessly.

223
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,890
You didn't see how enormous the corruption of our school is?

224
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,270
This place is a private enterprise.

225
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,420
What if it really does close down? Then what do we do?

226
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,050
We should try to do anything and everything in our power to stop that from happening.

227
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,480
What are you planning to do?

228
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,510
We will help you guys.

229
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,010
That lady has the freshest ideas.

230
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,050
She's going to close down the school just because she can't do whatever she wants?

231
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,690
She likes to do things in such a grand manner.

232
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,570
Seriously, if I could, I would just...

233
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,520
I am confident I can beat the crap out of her if we were to fight one on one.

234
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,280
Her true colors are coming out because she's not a teacher anymore.

235
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,960
Now, now, we are cultured citizens here, so we should be rational and level-headed.

236
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,890
So let's calmly discuss

237
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,690
our countermeasure to stop the school from closing down.

238
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,340
First of all, we should work enthusiastically to go around and tell the whole world about this.

239
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,760
We will help you out.

240
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,210
It's inhumane to close down the school.

241
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,970
What can you kids do to help us?

242
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,470
Anything, we will do anything you ask of us.

243
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,710
Uncle, I don't want to transfer to another school.

244
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,460
Elder, who else will do this besides us?

245
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,120
I know, right? It's our school after all.

246
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,990
We will do anything in our own way to help you out. Please?

247
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,760
You little rascals.

248
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,680
Would it be okay?

249
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,350
Are you guys that confident?

250
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,160
Yes!

251
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,060
Enforcement of opposition to the closing of Seolsong High School

252
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,560
Thank you.

253
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,560

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,630
You're very handsome.

259
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,720
Thank you.

260
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,040
Opposing Seolsong High Closing Undersigned

261

You're done?

262
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:01,040
Hey, wait. Get one.

263
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,890
Thanks.

264
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,790
Hey, friends!

265
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,750
Come here for a bit.

266
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,490
Take look at this and let's sign it.

267
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,040
Hello. Please read this.

268
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,660
What's this?

269
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,120
Let's see.

270
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,460
Elder, this is opposing the closing of Seolsong High for our neighborhood's justice...

271
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,610
I see you are working very hard for your kids.

272
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:35,360
Hey, hurry and sign it.

273
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,470
You said you want to do it, didn't you?

274
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,720
Let's see...

275
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,330
What?

276
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,930
Our store hours are over—

277
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,400
Did you come to eat black bean noodles?

278
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,850
Sit down.

279
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,300
Thank you.

280
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:06,430
I haven't forgotten what you did to Bok Soo.

281
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:11,130
And I am not thankful for you telling the truth now, either.

282
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:18,230
But I do know that you helped Bok Soo out this time.

283
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:25,700
Although I know that my wrongdoings don't disappear even if I do that, I am trying to pay it off right now.

284
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,550
Is it okay that you are doing this to your mother?

285
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:35,690
You didn't get kicked out for giving documents to Bok Soo, did you?

286
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,080
I didn't get kicked out.

287
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,000
But I do think I left on my own, too.

288
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,910
I'm not sure. I feel empty.

289
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:58,190
But she and I both made too many mistakes.

290
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:06,670
Right. Is it true she's planning to get rid of the school?

291
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:15,090
Helping to stop that is my only way to make amends

292
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,320
with Bok Soo and the kids at school.

293
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,420
I'm sorry, Mother.

294
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,580
Back then, when you called me "Mother" and looked at me,

295
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,540
you looked so hungry (for affection), that I wondered how you lived

296
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,870
that you would look at a person with those famished eyes.

297
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,920
Even though you weren't my kid, you still made my heart wrench.

298
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,290
Don't ever do bad deeds like that again!

299
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,960
If you want to do it again, come over here and eat some black bean noodles instead.

300
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,300
I'll hit your backside.

301
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,610
Okay.

302
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,400
Hurry and eat. It must be all bloated now.

303
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:44,570
Yes?

304
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,860
Kang Bok Soo, please come over here for a bit.

305
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,570
We have a few questions for you.

306
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,200
About Im Se Kyeong and Oh Se Ho.

307
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,260
Oh Se Ho?!

308
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,800
Yes, yes, yes.

309
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,830
Bok Soo, I have something to tell you.

310
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,270
Oh Se Ho came? Why?

311
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,860
He ate black bean noodles and left.

312
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,780
Do you think he came because he wanted to eat some noodles? He was sorry.

313
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,190
So did you hit his backside a bit?

314
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,060
If that would make him feel at ease, I'd have hit him 100 times.

315
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:23,720
Madam Jeong Soon, once you get to know him...

316
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,230
Never mind.

317
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,320
Nothing. I'm crazy.

318
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,850
He's going to try and stop the school from closing,

319
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,280
although I am not sure if he can do that.

320
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,070
The school?

321
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,220
I thought you'd come running once you heard about the school closing.

322
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,270
I'm sad.

323
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,310
Well there's no reason for me to talk to someone like you.

324
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,710
We'll stop the school from closing on our own.

325
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,200
Because that school isn't yours but the students'.

326
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,520
You don't need to worry about it. It may not close.

327
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,920
What does that mean?

328
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:24,160
Kang Bok Soo, you've got a good friend.

329
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,250
What does that mean?

330
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,430
If Se Ho gets imprisoned in my place,

331
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,060
I told him I'd cancel the school closing.

332
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,210
It's a tearful sacrifice, right?

333
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,090
Aren't Im Se Gyeong and Oh Se Ho partners in crime?

334
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:00,430
Aren't you the one who managed the funds from America under your uncle's name?

335
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,770
You are going to deny it because of no evidence?

336
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,190
I can put you away with her with circumstantial evidence.

337
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,340
You got something wrong, Prosecutor.

338
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,800
What is it?

339
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,190
I wasn't managing Im Se Gyeong's funds, but

340
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,420
I started the whole thing right from the beginning.

341
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,020
What?

342
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,620
The culprit behind everything related to the corruption of Seolsong High is not Im Se Gyeong

343
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:42,330
but me. I am telling you it was me.

344
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,920
Come out, punk!

345
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,580
I have something to say. Give me a moment.

346
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,800
Let go of me!

347
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,690
Oh Se Ho!

348
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,400
Let go of me.

349
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,890
Let go of me!

350
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,990
