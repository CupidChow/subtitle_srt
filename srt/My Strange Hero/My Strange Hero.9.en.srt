1
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,050
Kang Bok Soo, since the founding day of the school,

2
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,110
you are the most dangerous student we have ever had.

3
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,270
Since your opinion as the homeroom teacher is that way so—

4
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,300
However, the only thing that Kang Bok Soo is in the wrong about

5
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,120
would be the fact that he destroyed something that's part of the school.

6
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,820
And the only disciplinary action we can take would be for him to do some volunteer work for the school.

7
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,770
We shouldn't expel him from the school for this.

8
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,200
So you want to just take care of this by having him do some volunteer work for the school?

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,960
He isn't even an ordinary student here anyway.

10
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,100
Didn't you also just acknowledge that fact, Teacher?

11
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,510
You even said that he has been the most dangerous student since the founding of the school.

12
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,910
Yes, that is correct. He is dangerous, but

13
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,600
Kang Bok Soo is still a student of Seolsong High School.

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,240
He is a student that still has a lot to learn.

15
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,190
If we expel a student every time they do something wrong,

16
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,760
then how many students do you think we would have left by then?

17
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,660
How can you call him a student when he is already over 27 years old?

18
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,810
For now, he is a student since he is still in school.

19
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,400
Does a dangerous student like him still have the right to be protected?

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,050
Protect the remaining good students

21
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,610
and provide students with the best learning environment. Shouldn't that be what school is all about?

22
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,870
We would definitely put a stop to it if he does become a threat to the remaining students at this school.

23
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,230
Who will?

24
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,990
You will?

25
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,090
You are a teacher who barely took off the label of a contract teacher,

26
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,470
and you can't even tell the difference between heaven and earth, so you shouldn't be interfering with any of this.

27
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,320
I will take responsibility for this.

28
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,770
What did you say? What did you say just now?

29
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:25,090
I just said that I will take responsibility for this student Kang Bok Soo.

30
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,030
Then how? How are you going to take responsibility for him?

31
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,750
- That is—
- If Kang Bok Soo makes trouble again,

32
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,110
would you be able to give up your teaching career for it?

33
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,380
If you don't have any confidence whatsoever, the disciplinary action for the student Kang Bok Soo—

34
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,630
Yes, I will be accountable for him.

35
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,970
I will even risk my teaching position for it.

36
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,150
You are aware of the weight that will be following that responsibility of yours, right?

37
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,040
Of course, I am. I might seem like a person that can't tell the difference between heaven and earth,

38
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,200
but I do at least know how to protect her students from harm.

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,840
And even a so-called dangerous student also has the right to be protected.

40
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,780
Due to the selfishness of the parents of some honor students

41
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,660
no one should be expelled. That's what I'm saying here.

42
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,780
Excuse me, Ms. Son Soo Jeong. Do you even know who I am—

43
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,750
Of course, I do, ma'am! You are Chae Min's mother.

44
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:33,450
But you know what? Chae Min and also Bok Soo are both students that I should be looking out for, equally.

45
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,270
All of you have heard everything right here.

46
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,110
You've all heard the opinion of Teacher Song.

47
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,360
I will send this message out to the board of directors representing the committee.

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,490
You used such a word as "accountability" so carelessly.

49
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:54,070
You will have to face the music for that yourself, Teacher.

50
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,530
Oh my, are you alright, Vice Principal?!

51
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,570
Teacher Son! Don't you realize who the representative of the committee is?!

52
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,620
Seriously, how do you handle things like this?!

53
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,670
I have nothing to do with this so you should take responsibility for everything from now on!!

54
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,250
Teacher Son, why did you have to do that?

55
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,310
Hey, Son Soo Jeong.

56
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,900
Are you crazy?

57
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,790
Why are you butting in? I'm asking why you're even risking your teaching position for this?!

58
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,680
I'm your homeroom teacher. If I don't interfere, then who will?

59
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,820
Hey, you were even trying to buy your teaching position with 50 million won—

60
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,830
That's none of your business. You should just say thank you if feel grateful about all this.

61
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,190
Hey! Did I ask you to do any of this?! I'm not grateful at all, okay?! And also,

62
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,310
I really hate it when you interfere with my business!

63
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,890
If that's really the case, then you shouldn't have become my student in the first place.

64
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:49,010
This isn't really for you, but I just wanted to take full responsibility as your teacher.

65
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,740
If you don't want to get involved with me any longer,

66
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,730
then you shouldn't cause any more trouble from here on out.

67
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,860
What do you mean, why? I am the homeroom teacher for the Wildflower class.

68
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,000
But still, why are you going this far for something like this?

69
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,590
All the mothers will be moving towards this together.

70
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,390
If the board of the committee decides to form some kind of public opinion within the group of mothers in the school—

71
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,570
- But Kang Bok Soo is still my student.
- Yes, Kang Bok Soo.

72
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,130
He's none other than Kang Bok Soo you know!

73
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,110
Why did you make such a decision anyway?

74
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,800
Why are you curious about that though?

75
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,650
The bell is about to ring. I have class.

76
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,380
Then, I'll be leaving, Chairman.

77
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,410
That's true. I'm still curious about it.

78
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,090
Crazy! Crazy! Am I in my right mind?

79
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,860
I've only been a full-time teacher for a few days.

80
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,730
Why did I put my position at risk because of that rascal.

81
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,610
No. I am not that small-minded to take revenge on my enemy.

82
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,770
You see who I am, Kang Bok Soo? I'm your teacher.

83
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,500
Gulp! Drink all if it in one shot.

84
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,830
It's bitter.

85
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,560
This medicine is to improve your brain power. My son is already so smart. What can we do if you are smarter?

86
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,180
If you get smarter, I'm scared.

87
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,910
I won't take any! I won't take any!

88
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,820
This is a physical strength supplement.

89
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,250
You already have an abundance of physical energy.

90
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,970
With all that energy, you cause a lot of trouble for your age.

91
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,490
What's the use of eating medicine?

92
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,400
See, aren't I right?

93
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
At a glance, I can get the size of it (I know everything).

94
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,350
Next time, if you get in trouble, come to me and I can tell you exactly what to expect, Uncle.

95
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,980
Don't go too far!

96
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,350
- Why? Now what?
- Don't mess with my son.

97
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,250
Thank you for earlier, Kang Soo Jeong.

98
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,340
Don't cause trouble and just graduate.

99
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,330
I'll work hard and buy you medicine to help you study well.

100
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:55,130
Son, let's go inside. I'll give you a refreshing scalp massage!

101
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,420
Why are you carrying something heavy?

102
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,110
Aigoo! Aigoo! That's okay. I don't want to disturb your studying.

103
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,930
- I'll just take it to the room.
- Aigoo. I told you to go study.

104
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,920
Excuse me.

105
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,620
Why are you here at this time?

106
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,170
You little rascal! Do you know how worried I was about you? You don't answer the phone!

107
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,660
- Wait, wait.
- Why, why?

108
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,750
How could you come to our place to get black bean noodles? Huh?

109
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,260
Everything is closed up. What are you going to do?

110
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,070
What did I do wrong in coming? You brat—

111
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,450
- Aigoo, Teacher. You came?
- Yes, yes.

112
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,990
I came here to use the coupon.

113
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,630
That coupon is to be used before 8 o'clock.

114
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,830
You can't use that coupon today.

115
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,070
Then, then, with my own money.

116
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,900
Instead, I'll prepare you some food, and you can leave after you have your meal.

117
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,920
That's not needed...

118
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,160
- Wait, let's go out. Let me treat you.
- Why?

119
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,300
- Oh. Oh. I'll come again next time.
- Y-Yes.

120
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,510
Ah! I was so worried. What a relief.

121
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,670
Now you're indebted to Soo Jeong.

122
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,450
Shouldn't she do that much when she's paid as a teacher?

123
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,740
Hey, you rascal. Do you think teaching is a job people do only for the money?

124
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,680
Your growth. Your failures.

125
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,320
The reward for being the hand that lifts you up.

126
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,240
That is what teachers live for, you brat.

127
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,600
There are many types of teachers.

128
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,370
For sure, she is doing it for money. That Son Soo Jeong.

129
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,880
How do you know that?

130
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,820
Do you think it was easy for her to do what she did in such a situation?

131
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,660
You should be extremely thankful.

132
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,210
Me? Not at all!

133
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,480
Thankful? Thankful to whom? She caused a problem.

134
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,930
No. Who asked for her help?

135
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,550
Why does she have to step up to put herself in a bad situation?

136
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,160
Right. It seems like you are worried.

137
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,370
Worried? What? She's making her own life miserable.

138
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,240
Aigoo! This brat! Be mature.

139
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,110
Soo Jeong stepped up for an ungrateful student like you.

140
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,340
She's a true master. A true master.

141
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,710
But Teach. Son Soo Jeong...

142
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,280
Why would she go to that extent for me? I'm not really sure.

143
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,080
Why? Do you think she still has remaining feelings for you?

144
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,410
No. That...

145
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,100
No. And, well.

146
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,000
Well, well, that could be. Yeah, well.

147
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,420
I'm not sure who can read Soo Jeong's intention, but as a teacher, she did the right thing.

148
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,750
As a teacher?

149
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,070
She's become a great teacher.

150
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,180
No matter what, from this point on, you guys have a commom destiny.

151
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,110
If you fall, then Soo Jeong will fall too, you rascal.

152
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,700
Hey, get a hold of yourself!

153
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,610
Ah, right.

154
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,830
It's cold as hell. What is it?

155
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,000
Did you perhaps get expelled?

156
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,760
I knew right when you decided to get involved.

157
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,750
No.

158
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,120
Why? Why not? Why didn't you get expelled?

159
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,140
Because of Son Soo Jeong.

160
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,050
What about her? What'd she say?

161
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,590
She said,

162
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,490
"Yes, I'll take responsibility."

163
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,760
"I will even risk my teaching position for it."

164
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,620
"To me, he is a student, no different than other students, whom I must protect."

165
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,870
Like that.

166
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,770
Responsibility? With her full-time position on the line? Wow.

167
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,590
But why? Do you know her weakness?

168
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,890
Does she have lingering feelings for me?

169
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,860
It's going to be complicated then. I went there for revenge.

170
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,610
It's cold.

171
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,480
I'm leaving. From now on, call me for this type of talk.

172
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,250
Son Soo Jeong, why are you making me so confused?

173
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,850
Hey. Oh, hey! Let's go together.

174
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,010
I'm home.

175
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,140
I received a call from Secretary Yoon.

176
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,750
I heard you couldn't get rid of Kang Bok Soo.

177
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,900
It became complicated like that.

178
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,590
- Mother.
- You were always just to that extent.

179
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,730
What more could I expect from you?

180
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,230
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Mother.

181
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,510
Next time...

182
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,800
I won't disappoint you ever again.

183
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,190
You were always just to that extent.

184
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,180
What more could I expect from you?

185
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:37,050
You were always just to that extent.

186
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,770
What more could I expect from you?

187
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,660
Hey. Hey. We're done with all our tests today, but why do you look like you're still in life or death mode?"

188
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,030
- Let's go! I'll treat you today.
- No, it's okay.

189
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,490
Huh? Class President. Class President! Class—

190
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,300
- Do you want to eat black bean noodles?
- Yeah!

191
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,990
Our Bok Soo's friends coming here is great.

192
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,920
He's Oh Se Ho. He transferred here.

193
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,280
Hello.

194
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,890
Handsome. I think he's more handsome than our Bok Soo.

195
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,890
That's not right.

196
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:30,900
Oh, and this is Son Soo Jeong. You saw her then, right? She's my... that...

197
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,380
I'm Son Soo Jeong.

198
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,620
How are you so pretty

199
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,380
and eat so well?

200
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,240
Right?

201
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,810
You're the school's first place.

202
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,320
You're the school's second place.

203
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,400
Why are you guys hanging out with our Bok Soo, the school's last place?

204
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,650
Hey! School's last place is Kyeong Hyeon!

205
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,290
Do you guys have a weakness that he knows?

206
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,280
Do you have to study well to be friends?

207
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,480
That friggin studying. And stop nagging on In Ho, too.

208
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,900
You weren't so good with your studies either, but you're nagging the kids.

209
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,550
Mom!

210
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,290
It's okay! It's okay to not be good at studying.

211
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,270
Why aren't you eating?

212
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,440
It's my first time eating this.

213
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,690
Here.

214
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,890
Thank you.

215
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,450
How is it? It's delicious, right?

216
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,000
I only used good ingredients, so eat a lot.

217
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,580
- I'll eat it well, Mother.
- Oh my.

218
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,260
He said m-mother.

219
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,310
Even his way of speaking is graceful.

220
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,530
Can you say it again? Mother?

221
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,360
Mother.

222
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,860
It sounds so good to hear.

223
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,030
Bok Soo, do you want to say "mother" now too?

224
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,470
Why, Madam Lee? I think it's nice.

225
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,640
- This brat! Th-th-this...to your mom!
- What? What? Try.

226
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,760
- Oh! Oh. Aigoo.
- What? What?

227
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,940
- Mother.
- What're you doing?

228
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,100
Mother.

229
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,820
- Mother.
 - Enough already.

230
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,130
Bok Soo must be happy.

231
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,860
Why?

232
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:10,520
Ah, because his mother is like the ones from dramas.

233
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,750
That's true.

234
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,150
Hey! But is that really your first time eating black bean noodles?

235
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,670
There's a celebrity who only ate beef,

236
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,920
so he ate pork belly for the first time in college. That's the same as...

237
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,410
Pork belly?

238
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,920
You've never eaten pork belly?

239
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,860
Is that delicious too? Should we go and eat it?

240
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,210
It's so unfair that I've eaten black bean noodles eighteen years later than others.

241
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,660
This is the first time you've smiled with your eyes.

242
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,050
You've always just raised your lip corners.

243
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,500
You look better smiling for real.

244
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,990
She has one grandma as her family,

245
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,680
but she is currently hospitalized in Hankook hospital.

246
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,260
Her illness is called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

247
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,900
It's impossible to cure. She's also developed pneumonia as a complication.

248
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,440
The emergency treatment and hospital stay fees

249
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,120
are an issue continuously.

250
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,170
You've worked hard.

251
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,020
Secretary Yoon.

252
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,080
The talk related to Son Soo Jeong...

253
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,980
Please don't tell my mother.

254
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,670
Our Bok Soo Oppa is doing on-campus service, I heard.

255
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,720
There it is.

256
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,990
This is a problem.
2nd Grader Kang Bok Soo: Volunteer work for 5 days

257
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,350
At least five days.

258
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,900
Oh Yeong Min

259
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,510
Seolsong High School

260
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,000
Scrub it well.

261
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,410
Scrub it well as atonement for your wrongdoing with intentions toward a transparent life.

262
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,920
I'm going to check later.

263
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,760
Okay, Teacher.

264
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,300
You are working hard for service, Bok Soo.

265
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,450
Hello, Teacher. Good morning.

266
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,930
It's me. Ma Yeong Joon.

267
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,620
Ah, yes, I know. The English teacher.

268
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:35,140
Uh, perhaps, were you there when I was in school? I'm very sorry if I wasn't thinking... no, don't recognize you.

269
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,270
Look at me carefully. It's me.

270
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,380
Bread shuttle?!

271
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,200
The class shuttle (errand runner)? Ma Yeong Joon?

272
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,570
I'm so happy to see you again, friend.

273
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,790
Thank you for remembering me.

274
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,510
- We were close friends, right?
- Right, Bok Soo.

275
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,190
Before, you helped me out a lot. Now, I will help you

276
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,630
since I am a teacher, and you are a student.

277
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,250
Okay.

278
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,940
Do a good job.

279
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,520
This activity is designed to train your mind

280
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,410
by repeatedly doing a simple task.

281
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,400
I want you to carefully focus on

282
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,070
what you guys did wrong.

283
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,700
Man! I really don't think I can do this!

284
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,390
This takes a lot more energy than it looks like.

285
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,860
Why do I have to do this?

286
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,540
Because we're full of mileage.

287
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,450
Mileage?

288
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,390
Elder, you don't know about mileage.

289
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,450
It's negative points as a student.

290
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,100
What's with your hair?

291
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,370
- Just stop taking pictures! If I become famous, will you take responsibility?
- You're ugly.

292
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,600
What are you talking about? My mom says I'm the most handsome.

293
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,180
You still don't know that she's fibbing?

294
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,080
What is this image again?

295
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,550
The legendary attention whoring student in Seolsong High is entering the Wildflower class.

296
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,130
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

297
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,150
What are you doing?

298
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,240
Starting today, I am in the Wildflower class.

299
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,570
Were you kicked out of the Ivy class?

300
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,600
Hey! Then shouldn't you go to Sky class? Why are you here? Is it because you don't know where you are?

301
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,670
Wildflowers are pretty.

302
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,820
What'd you say?

303
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,590
- I can sit here, right?
- Uh-uh!

304
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,820
I didn't give you permission yet.

305
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,630
Between us? What do you mean "permission"?

306
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,980
What is the relationship between us?

307
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,440
Best friends.

308
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,420
Friend? Hey! I am nine years older than you! "Friends?"
(In Korea, "friend" is usually used for people born the same year.)

309
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,220
You'd better call me, "Hyung."

310
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,790
Yes.

311
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,350
Okay. Everyone go to your seats.

312
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,400
- What are you doing, Oh Yeong Min? Class is starting. Go to your classroom.
- Ma'am?

313
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,560
Teacher, you must not have heard yet. I have moved to the Wildflower class.

314
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,060
What?

315
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,520
Why here? You should go to the Sky class.

316
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,530
I cannot go up by my own effort. Please allow me to go down by my own free will.

317
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,580
Where did Seung Woo go?

318
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,630
He hasn't arrived yet?

319
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,290
He's tardy. Did you call him?

320
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,430
He doesn't answer.

321
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,770
If he comes, tell him to come see me.

322
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,690
Okay. Let's not be causing any trouble.

323
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,670
Get ready for class.

324
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,890
Oh Yeong Min. Come out and see me for a moment.

325
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,810
Hey! Like I was saying...

326
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,620
I know what you're thinking, but

327
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:27,140
Yeong Min, the lesson level of this class is not your academic level. In addition, this class does not receive school support.

328
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,230
This is a battlefield.

329
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:33,630
This is a different atmosphere than you are used to. This place is more hardcore than the Ivy class.

330
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,900
However, I have comrades here.

331
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,130
What?

332
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,890
I'm not lonely.

333
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,330
If I bleed while fighting, there will be someone to put a band-aid on me.

334
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,780
If I fall behind, I have a platoon captain to help me.

335
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,850
Please quickly add me to the class roster.

336
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:08,260
What? Looking at this menu makes you want to go back to the Ivy class, huh?

337
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,880
Now you really regret that you came on your own two feet.

338
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,610
This is a grass field (full of vegetables, usually for the poor). It's healthy food.

339
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,870
You're happy with it! Go.

340
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,750
Go.

341
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,740
Okay.Thank you for the— Agh!

342
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,430
Are you crazy? Why are you here?

343
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,390
Are you crazy?

344
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,450
I already told you I was coming to the school.

345
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,610
Even still. With that determination, go do something else.

346
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,530
Something else? To me, you are my everything.

347
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,790
The company. What about the company?

348
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:52,190
If you are not there, there is no company.

349
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,770
Really!

350
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:00,870
Eat well. From now on, I will take care of your meals.

351
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,360
Noona, can't you take care of your own life? Why on earth are you here?

352
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,460
What are talking about? I am here to take care of you, Kang Bok Soo.

353
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,150
That's why I'm here.

354
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,160
Eat.

355
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,790
Please give me some pork cutlet.

356
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,190
May I have a little.

357
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,990
Can I have a little more?

358
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,940
Thank you.

359
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,060
May—

360
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,050
You still have a good appetite.

361
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,950
So you are still lying? You are quite good at that.

362
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,760
Right! You are really good at feeding us yeot (Korean candy/sounds similar to feeding BS).

363
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,540
Hey! Yang Min Ji! What did I lie—

364
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,580
Now, I will really not let you off.

365
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,280
If you hurt Kang Bok Soo again, I will certainly kill you!

366
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,440
Who are you?

367
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,980
Me? I'm Bok Soo's companion. I've been with him for nine years.

368
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,840
So?

369
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,280
Do you know how Bok Soo has been living all this time?

370
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,300
Do I have to know?

371
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,020
Wow! You are still an a**hole.

372
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,520
I like your attitude. From now on, don't ever get curious about Bok Soo.

373
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,740
That should be fine since I will always be by Bok Soo's side.

374
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,550
You have to bury the evidence for the perfect crime.

375
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,390
Amateurs. They've got a long way to go.

376
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,930
Do better. Kids. Ew!

377
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,730
Bok Soo!

378
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,190
Ah, you startled me!

379
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,900
What are you doing?

380
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,860
Noona, you really know how to surprise someone. Oh, my heart.

381
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,340
I'm cleaning up.

382
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,340
Really? I hear that your heart raced because of me.

383
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:33,870
Noona. You can interpret freely, but you are too much of a free spirit.

384
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,290
But what is that? A new accessory?

385
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,210
- Hold still for a sec.
- You...

386
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:50,350
I must have worked very hard. I'm like a professional now.

387
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,230
Bok Soo, isn't there something here too?

388
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,850
What are you doing? Ah! Oil—

389
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,540
Did you wash your hair?

390
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,120
You must be hygienic since you are now working in the kitchen.

391
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,010
Even still. It's only Bok Soo who looks after me.

392
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,640
Thank you. Shall we go see a movie?

393
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,590
Let's go.

394
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,180
Consulting Room

395
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,080
Let's write this on your textbook.

396
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,510
Copy. Ready. Begin!

397
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,920
In an old fairy tale, the magpie also repaid kindness for a good deed.

398
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,460
The snake and the tiger did the same thing.

399
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,420
But as a human, I must recompense the grace from the teacher.

400
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,400
If I don't, I'm less than an animal.

401
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,780
I am Kang Bok Soo. I'm the kind of person who cannot live owing a debt to someone.

402
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,790
There is something wrong with my digestion.

403
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:11,100
Did I eat too much cafeteria food?

404
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,100
Teacher. I'm being serious.

405
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,800
I didn't say you weren't serious.

406
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,580
Who is this who needs medicine?

407
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,020
I said, it's me. My insides are churning. I feel like I'm going to throw up.

408
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,980
If you don't take medication properly, something serious can happen.

409
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,670
If something happens, is it okay?

410
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,590
Students looking for medicine on someone else's behalf,

411
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,910
why are there so many?
