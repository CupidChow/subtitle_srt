1
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,520
Mr. He, any news?

2
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,800
Thank you.

3
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,600
Hello, Brother Yao.

4
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,039
Yes.

5
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:24,440
I should be around 24 or 5 years old now.

6
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
Brother Hu, it's been ten years.

7
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,560
Don't just look for Hu.

8
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,600
I don't want him to change his surname.

9
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,560
Don't limited to the city, suburbs.

10
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,000
Check Jiangsu, Zhejiang area.

11
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,759
Pay attention.

12
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,240
Especially those bad places.

13
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,400
Bad places?

14
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,560
Are you sure?

15
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,040
Stay still. Let's go.

16
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,200
Let go of me!

17
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,120
Cut the crap.

18
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,920
Behave yourself.

19
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,000
Stop!

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,360
Thank you.

21
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,200
Stop!

22
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,400
I'm talking to you.

23
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,440
Why did you take him away?

24
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,560
Hello, have you seen the man in the photo?

25
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,920
Can't you see the police working? No.

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:35,880
Thank you.

27
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,240
Don't move.

28
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,480
You said police are police.

29
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,040
Police need certificates to solve cases.

30
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,400
What about the ID?

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,520
Are you on the same side?

32
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,079
What if we don't have the ID?

33
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,200
What?

34
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,280
Beat him.

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,880
Come on!

36
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,560
Stop!

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,280
I'm Chief Zhou Mu of the Municipal Bureau.

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,079
Everyone, raise your head and squat down.

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,880
Get down!

40
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,079
Boss.

41
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,800
Take them all away.

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,720
Stop!

43
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,360
Boss.

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,880
Take him back to the station.

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,400
Okay.

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,040
Let's go.

47
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,920
What's wrong? Do you need help?

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,280
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
I was working on a case.

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,440
I had no choice.

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,840
That's enough.

52
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,560
I'm angry.

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,800
So you get angry too.

54
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,360
You know it's annoying.

55
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,560
You...

56
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,280
Give it to me.

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,160
Are you looking for her?

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
You know Hu Juan too?

59
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,120
Yes.

60
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,840
Her sister came to the police.

61
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
It's a long time ago.

62
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,800
There are too few clues.

63
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
We've been looking for her very hard.

64
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,440
She came to us too.

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,160
You...

66
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,440
Me and my friends.

67
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,640
Why won't you listen to me?

68
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,280
Who are you? Why should I listen to you?

69
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,560
What? Catch me?

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,360
Give it to me.

71
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,040
I can catch you.

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,360
They're not good people. I told you.

73
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,280
That's because of the police.

74
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
We all work hard.

75
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,200
Of course.

76
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,120
Mr. Zhou is an honest man.

77
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,360
Don’t fall into my hands one day.

78
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,159
Hu Juan has been found.

79
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,240
Hurry up and inform Hu Li.

80
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,240
This...

81
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800
What should we do?

82
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,280
Yan, go take a look.

83
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,520
Jinjing together.

84
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,160
Let's go.

85
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,120
I'm going to the toilet.

86
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,080
Get the money ready when I come back.

87
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,000
Go to hell!

88
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
Why didn't you drown in the toilet?

89
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,000
You...

90
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,320
If I drown in the toilet,

91
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
where will you find your father?

92
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,840
You can't find your father even if you cry.

93
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,640
Get lost!

94
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,400
How dare you hit me!

95
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,040
Wait and see.

96
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,120
Get lost as far as you can!

97
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,440
What are you doing?

98
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,280
Massage

99
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,560
No problem.

100
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,040
As long as the money is enough,

101
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,000
Female guests are fine too.

102
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,520
Cover your nose.

103
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,720
What?

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,440
Cover your nose.

105
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,600
Who are you?

106
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,360
The more you suck,

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,240
the more you suck, the faster you die.

108
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,720
Are you a doctor?

109
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,440
Do I look like I'm afraid of death?

110
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,800
Look at you.

111
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,960
your sister, Hu Li,

112
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,000
she'll be so sad.

113
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,400
Hu Li asked us to find you.

114
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,120
She wants to see you.

115
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,000
She wants to live her life.

116
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,920
I live my life.

117
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,840
Why do you want to see me?

118
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
What's there to see?

119
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,960
I don't want to see her.

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,520
But she has been looking for you for many years.

121
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,960
She cares about you.

122
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,680
If she sees you like this,

123
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,400
she'll be heartbroken.

124
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,920
What about me?

125
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,360
It's up to me.

126
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,560
It's none of your business.

127
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,360
Get lost!

128
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,240
Hu Juan.

129
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,680
Get lost!

130
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,040
We mean no harm.

131
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,240
Don't do this. Get lost.

132
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,440
She's been thinking about you.

133
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,000
She hasn't changed her name for the past ten years.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,240
She didn't follow her adoptive parents' surname.

135
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,680
I'm afraid you can't find her.

136
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,680
I said I...

137
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
You are Hu Qiang.

138
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,560
Hu Qiang, how dare you come here?

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,000
Get lost!

140
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,200
Juan!

141
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,120
How could you speak to your father like that?

142
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,960
My father died long ago.

143
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,960
You are my father.

144
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,280
Why are you still alive?

145
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,000
Why are you getting mad?

146
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,960
I'll ask you for money for cigarettes and alcohol.

147
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,800
I told you.

148
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,640
I have no money.

149
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,400
No money?

150
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,680
Okay.

151
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,960
If you don't have money, I'll ask someone else.

152
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,720
You know Sumire?

153
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,280
Where is she?

154
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,559
I have nothing to say to you human trafficker.

155
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,760
Say it again.

156
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,720
What are you doing?

157
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,040
She's a clean girl.

158
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,960
Don't touch her.

159
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,080
Come at me if you need anything.

160
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,680
Okay.

161
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,280
Where is Sumire?

162
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,840
If you don't tell me,

163
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,720
I can find her.

164
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,640
My eldest daughter doesn't want me anymore.

165
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,440
I'm looking for my little daughter.

166
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,240
Wait and see.

167
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,920
You want money, right?

168
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,240
Here you are.

169
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,040
All for you.

170
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,720
I need money.

171
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,400
It's all here.

172
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,600
Hu Qiang.

173
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,400
Don't push your luck.

174
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,640
If you go to Sumire,

175
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,240
I'll die with you.

176
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,360
Let's both die.

177
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,080
Although I like money,

178
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,680
From now on,

179
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,920
you're still my good daughter.

180
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,840
Hu Juan.

181
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,320
Don't let Hu Qiang know where Xiaoli is.

182
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,120
As for whether to see her or not,

183
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,280
I'll think about it.

184
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,720
Let's go.
