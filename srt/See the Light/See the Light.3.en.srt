1
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,640
You...

2
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,560
I'm warning you.

3
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,560
Don't let me catch you again.

4
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,480
It's my parents-in-law's.

5
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,240
Is there a problem with bail?

6
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,520
If not,

7
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,039
I'll get going.

8
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,880
A pack of cigarettes.

9
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,120
Coming.

10
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,080
Take a look.

11
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,480
What cigarettes do you want?

12
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,520
Thank you, sir.

13
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,680
Lu Jin-kyung.

14
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,280
What a coincidence.

15
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,600
What are you doing?

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,920
Stop!

17
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,000
Stop!

18
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,000
Stop!

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,680
Stop! Stop!

20
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,480
You asked me to wait for Feng Lei.

21
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,480
You're not that stupid.

22
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,079
Sit down.

23
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,160
Wait for the show.

24
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Let's have a drink.

25
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
You bitch!

26
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,480
Do you really think your husband is dead?

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,240
How dare you come here?

28
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,600
Go back!

29
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,960
Feng Lei, right?

30
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,640
Who are you?

31
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,440
It doesn't matter who I am.

32
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
Let's play a game.

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,320
Can't you see I'm teaching my wife?

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,720
What game are you playing?

35
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,560
Take it easy.

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,280
The game is simple.

37
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,160
Let's rock the dice.

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,520
If you're older,

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,040
I'll have a drink and kiss you.

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,920
If I were older,

41
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,560
I'll slap you.

42
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,520
Have a drink.

43
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,200
it depends on who gets the empty glass in front of us.

44
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,560
If mine is empty,

45
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,680
Wang Yu can go back with you,

46
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,120
I'll go with you.

47
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,520
But if your vacancy is available,

48
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,360
don't bother Wang Yu anymore.

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,360
What do you think?

50
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,400
Do you dare?

51
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,240
If it doesn't work,

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,040
just step aside.

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,920
Let us

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,720
I'll show you what a real man is.

55
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,880
Trash.

56
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,680
Fine.

57
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,160
I'd like to see

58
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,720
what you can do.

59
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,640
Let's go home.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,760
Bro.

61
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,400
I can't afford to lose.

62
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,360
You lost to a woman and you're still so arrogant.

63
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,600
Are you a man?

64
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,240
You broke your promise.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
It's none of your business.

66
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Get lost!

67
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,200
You can't afford to lose and you're scolding me.

68
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,040
Guys, teach him a lesson.

69
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,600
I...

70
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,240
He's quite arrogant. Hit him.

71
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,000
Are you the patient's family?

72
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,800
The patient's condition

73
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,040
may become a vegetative.

74
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,159
You need to be mentally prepared.

75
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,520
Wang Yu.

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,680
Leave him alone.

77
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,760
Inform his parents.

78
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Let's go.

79
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,760
The patient is in critical condition.

80
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,159
Hurry up and get admitted.

81
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,360
so that we can arrange the surgery as soon as possible.

82
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,960
Wang Yu.

83
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,200
Let's go.

84
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,320
Wang Yu.

85
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,240
I give up the treatment.

86
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,320
Wang Yu.

87
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,160
What's wrong, Jinjing?

88
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,760
I'm reborn.

89
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,320
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

90
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,680
Where is Wang Yu?

91
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,840
Jinjing.

92
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,880
Wang Yu.

93
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,640
I'm here

94
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm organizing the files.

95
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,880
After reading these files,

96
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,600
I think

97
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,280
I should do something

98
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,520
for them and for myself.

99
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,200
If you're willing,

100
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,880
you can join us.

101
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,640
Join you.

102
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,800
Join us

103
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,400
and help more people.

104
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,840
Why me?

105
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,680
Because it tells me you are suitable.

106
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Wang Yu has changed a lot.

107
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,400
Maybe what you did is meaningful.

108
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,480
but I still want to

109
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,840
a normal life.

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,680
Bye.

111
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:11,920
Jin-kyung.

112
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,320
Take care of yourself.

113
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,240
Boss.

114
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,480
It's okay.

115
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,440
We'll meet again.

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,280
Wait.

117
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,120
Stay still.

118
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,039
Lock him up for three days and remember.

119
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,600
Head.

120
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,760
Boss, I'll go first.

121
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,320
Zhou Mu.

122
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,480
What's going on?

123
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,440
Nothing

124
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,640
I caught a loser who beats women.

125
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,640
Scoundrel.

126
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,280
What are you thinking?

127
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,600
So many chances to be promoted

128
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,840
to you.

129
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,760
So many big cases.

130
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
I'll chew them and feed them to you.

131
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,520
You don't either.

132
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,600
Why are you fighting with these guys?

133
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,920
Don't you know

134
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,440
Don't you know?
