1
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,040
Si Jiali's notes.

2
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,120
When I was 21,

3
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,840
when I was 21.

4
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,480
I like writing stories about women.

5
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,200
I can say I like creating.

6
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,440
my ideal

7
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,240
independent and powerful image.

8
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,480
At first, no one was interested in my novel,

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,240
But there was only one loyal reader.

10
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,760
wrote to me every month

11
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,440
to express her appreciation for me.

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,680
Her letter supported my confidence in writing.

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,480
[That's how I kept writing.]

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,480
The heavens live up to the people who care.

15
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,760
I finally became a best-selling author.

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,360
[Then, through letters,]

17
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,200
through letters.

18
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,440
Her name is Miaomiao.

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,520
Soon,

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,320
became best friends.

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,520
We often meet.

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,120
Through getting closer to each other,

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,520
I gradually realized

24
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,080
the dark past

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,120
in Miaomiao’s pure heart.

26
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,640
I have something to tell you.

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,680
What is it?

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,680
We often read books and joke together.

29
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,760
She was happy every time we met.

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,320
But I still found

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,880
Miaomiao

32
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,040
in Miao’s eyes.

33
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,560
And after a long time,

34
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,040
I found that she would disappear on weekends

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,600
and then we met again.

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,600
she was very unstable.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,920
Tell me what happened.

38
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,560
I can only help you if you tell me.

39
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,520
That’s when I knew

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,079
Miaomiao lived

41
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,560
under the mental control of an elder.

42
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,760
She wanted to escape.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,520
but she had no choice.

44
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,120
She didn't want to tell me

45
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,280
her name.

46
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,720
She only told me

47
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,760
that person is something that can't be shaken.

48
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,800
This is my first time too.

49
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,680
I was at a loss.

50
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,120
So I gave Miao an idea

51
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,520
to collect evidence of that person.

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,200
I'll report the case with her.

53
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,240
So Si Jiali is the author.

54
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,520
I've been investigating for seven years.

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,760
I really didn't realize

56
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,640
The author and Geum Mu are not the same person.

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,040
Who is Jinmu?

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
I don't know yet.

59
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,079
Let’s see.

60
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,000
Miaomiao.

61
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,160
Miaomiao.

62
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,080
So I waited for her news.

63
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,720
But what I waited for

64
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
was an accident.

65
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,280
Maybe because of me,

66
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,360
because of me.

67
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,600
So I chose to use the rest of my life

68
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,720
to find out the person Miao mentioned.

69
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,000
So on the day Miao jumped off the building,

70
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,080
when Miaomiao jumped off the building.

71
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,159
So the reason why she did this

72
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,280
because of your sister, Miaomiao.

73
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
All these years,

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,080
I’ve been looking for Miaomiao

75
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,520
through various ways.

76
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,280
During this process,

77
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,200
I met a group of comrades with the same goal.

78
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,880
We've been planning for years.

79
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,080
we visited many places

80
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,840
and saved countless women in abyss.

81
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,800
It's salvation

82
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,960
but also for a good result.

83
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,000
Gradually,

84
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,200
we found that person

85
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,200
and confirmed Miao’s condition.

86
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,800
But that person

87
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,360
found our existence.

88
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,480
Yuanshan Nursing Home.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,400
Miaomiao.

90
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:38,960
Zhou Mu.

91
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,360
I understand how you feel now.

92
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,680
But as you can see,

93
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,960
You might be targeted too.

94
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,960
So, calm down.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,520
Okay.

96
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,800
I'll send Qin Shan over first.

97
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:57,720
Let's go.

98
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,440
Hello, nurse.

99
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,720
I want to visit

100
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,400
Patient No. 01023, Zhou Miao.

101
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,800
Who are you to her?

102
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I'm a friend of his brother.

103
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,920
He asked me to take care of him.

104
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,440
This is my ID.

105
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,880
Don't worry.

106
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,560
Come with me.

107
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,080
Okay.

108
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,320
Since he's your friend,

109
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,280
why didn't you come once?

110
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,360
What a pity.

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,440
Such a beautiful girl

112
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,800
fell down from the third floor.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He hit his head and hurt his brain.

114
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,680
Although he was out of danger,

115
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,760
I survived.

116
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,200
But basically no one knows him now.

117
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,480
Right here.

118
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,880
The patient is recovering well.

119
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,680
He's just unconscious.

120
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,000
As her family,

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,520
you should come over and spend more time with her.

122
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,680
Okay, thank you.

123
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,360
Can I

124
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,760
for her?

125
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,040
Now?

126
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,880
Yes.

127
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,800
Are you kidding me?

128
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,560
At least tomorrow.

129
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,280
And his family has to come in person.

130
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,320
Bring the proof.

131
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:31,920
Okay.

132
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,920
I'll stay here with her tonight.

133
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,560
But...

134
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,240
Don't worry.

135
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,760
I'll rest outside.
