1
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,640
This girl needs help.

2
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,680
We accept this request.

3
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,960
But you live outside.

4
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,640
It's not convenient for us to communicate.

5
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,319
Yeah.

6
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,039
It takes half a day to inform someone.

7
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,880
Is there a hotel nearby?

8
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,480
What?

9
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,320
Motel?

10
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,120
No.

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,440
Not to mention the hotel,

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,560
Not even a bridge.

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,760
All right, stop acting.

14
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,080
Come back to live these days.

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,800
If you have any news, we can communicate at any time.

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,920
Let’s perform together.

17
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,200
How is it?

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,440
Any progress?

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,880
No.

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,840
The key point.

21
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,720
I can't touch it now.

22
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,520
Any news from the police?

23
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,200
I haven't seen Zhou Mu these days.

24
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,080
Qin Shan knows nothing about it.

25
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,200
I think we're in the wrong direction.

26
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,760
Are you

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,560
also looking for the murderer who killed my sister?

28
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:34,800
Sit.

29
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,120
What else do you know?

30
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,600
you can tell us.

31
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,240
I only remember that my sister told me

32
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,440
she left in a foreign car.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,120
She said it was too late.

34
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,440
and asked me to wait for her at the door.

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,280
But I waited for more than two hours.

36
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
but I couldn't.

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,560
Until the next morning,

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,840
I knew something happened to her.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,680
The foreign car was only half an hour away.

40
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,960
What could happen?

41
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,840
Are you sure she got on a foreign car?

42
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,440
I saw her in a foreign car.

43
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,360
A foreign car?

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,040
I threw it

45
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,200
I threw her in front of the school.

46
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,120
Yang asked me the next day.

47
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,079
Why didn't you call me?

48
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,280
You can't even do that.

49
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,600
But

50
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,200
the woman was so tender the night before yesterday.

51
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,960
She's so tender that she can squeeze water out.

52
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,600
You're bragging.

53
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,320
Show it to everyone.

54
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,920
Yes.

55
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,880
Really?

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,520
Show me.

57
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,280
I'll blow it.

58
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,880
I'll show you today.

59
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,960
Hurry up.

60
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,680
Slow down.

61
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Don't break it.

62
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,840
He Wang.

63
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,440
You've ruined such a young lady.

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,960
She looks like a student.

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,800
Hina!

66
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,800
You...

67
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,640
You're so pretty.

68
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,440
You ruined

69
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,520
is ruined by you.

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,160
Get lost!

71
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,160
I'm lucky in love.

72
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,920
Give it to me.

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,360
Wang.

74
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,560
Do you have to

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,920
at night?

76
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,120
Listen, newcomers.

77
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm telling you

78
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,600
Photos are very important.

79
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,440
Why?

80
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,240
Why

81
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,760
You know nothing.

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,560
We used to do things after we fainted.

83
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,840
We used to threaten people when they woke up.

84
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,600
Right?

85
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,240
Yes.

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,840
The problem is

87
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,440
if she meets a tough woman one day,

88
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,200
she pretends to agree,

89
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,880
and call the police. What should we do?

90
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,600
What should we do?

91
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,800
At this time,

92
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,280
this photo

93
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,240
will be useful.

94
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,080
All women are shameless.

95
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,200
As long as we tell her,

96
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,120
If you call the police, I'll spread the photo.

97
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,520
If I go in,

98
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,960
don't be a human.

99
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,040
Wang.

100
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,480
You're really something.

101
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,080
That's a good move.

102
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,400
Yes.

103
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,480
The key is

104
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,320
we have the photos.

105
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,440
We can do whatever we want.

106
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,520
Look.

107
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
Brother Wang

108
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,440
is capable.

109
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:36,800
That's right.

110
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,640
Enough.

111
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,120
Let's call it a day.

112
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,120
I just received a message today.

113
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,240
The higher-ups asked us to be safe.

114
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,040
Cao Cong.

115
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,480
How could you be so careless?

116
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,600
You all just joined the alliance.

117
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,160
I told you to behave when you just got here.

118
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
It's a bit unfair indeed.

119
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,920
But it's a side door.

120
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,600
We have to follow the rules.

121
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,640
First,

122
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,960
you can't do anything on the 15th of every month.

123
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,320
Because these two days is the city's inspection.

124
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,280
and patrol outside.

125
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,640
Second,

126
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,240
One woman can't do twice.

127
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,880
Understand?

128
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,760
Yes.

129
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,680
Third,

130
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,560
You can't touch an official's lady.

131
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,840
and foreigners.

132
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,720
This is the rule of our alliance.

133
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,080
Follow the rules and live happily together.

134
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,600
It's against the rules.

135
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,240
I...

136
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,520
Got it.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,880
Rules

138
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,280
Follow the rules.

139
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,360
There's nothing we can do.

140
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,880
We're working for that gentleman.

141
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,680
Why are we still talking about rules?

142
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,480
He Wang.

143
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,480
Our alliance

144
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
thanks to the gentleman

145
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,560
to cover up for us.

146
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,920
So just do your job.

147
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,840
Don't break the bottom line.

148
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,760
We don't know who's covering up for.

149
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,960
I'll take someone to sell it in other places.

150
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,640
He Wang.

151
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,720
The lights are off. Keep up.

152
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,240
Three, three, six, three, four.

153
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,760
Girl,

154
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,040
Are you in a movie?

155
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,039
No.

156
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,280
You look like a star.

157
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,000
You flatter me.

158
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,640
I'm just an ordinary person.

159
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,840
Can you be 18?

160
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,520
A student?

161
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,240
Are you thirsty?

162
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
There's soda in the back seat.

163
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,680
Take it if you're thirsty.
