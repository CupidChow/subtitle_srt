1
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,040
Go!

2
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,240
Go!

3
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,960
Keep up.

4
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,280
Zhou Mu.

5
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,840
Stop fighting!

6
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:04,800
Go!

7
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:05,560
Go!

8
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,880
Chase them!

9
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,400
Go!

10
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,400
Stop!

11
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,600
Get out of the way!

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,720
Mu.

13
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,920
Uncle Gao.

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,200
Run! Why don't you run?

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,920
Mr Chen.

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,760
What's going on?

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Director Zhou. Mr. Gao.

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,520
Excuse me.

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,000
I have something to do with them.

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,360
Something to do with them?

21
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:37,800
Mr. Chen.

22
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,240
It seems that you and my godson

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,880
between you and my godson.

24
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,080
So you're Mr. Gao's godson.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,160
Since Mr. Gao is here,

26
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,880
everything will be fine.

27
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,720
It's okay. Let's go.

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,960
Zhou Mu.

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,440
You've grown up.

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,360
I know

31
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,440
why you don't want to go to Nanjing.

32
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,640
No.

33
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:30,840
Take care.

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,160
Thank you.

35
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,440
Remember to give me your ID.

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,920
Jia Jia, let's go.

37
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,000
Do you think

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,280
you feel very accomplished?

39
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,120
What do you mean?

40
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,760
Lu Jin-kyung.

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,079
You ruined my plan.

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,720
You're not good enough and you're good at it.

43
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,080
You...

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,280
Look what you're doing.

45
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:10,920
I...

46
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,360
Lu Jin-kyung.

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,760
You're alone today.

48
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,480
to work overtime.

49
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,040
Lu Jin-kyung.

50
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,079
You can't do such a small thing well.

51
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,320
I really don't know

52
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,240
What are you doing here?

53
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,560
Lu Jin-kyung, how many times have I told you?

54
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,600
Do what you can. Get lost if you can't.

55
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,680
There are many people to replace you.

56
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,520
Lu Jinjing, people like you

57
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,320
in Shanghai.

58
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,520
Who are you to get mad at me?

59
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,680
Are you out of your mind?

60
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,200
I asked you to come

61
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,560
to solve my problem.

62
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,519
not to trouble me.

63
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,160
It seems that Zhou Mu didn't find anything.

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,480
I knew the clue was too secretive.

65
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,280
He'll follow the list.

66
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,880
Isn't that the girl who rejected you?

67
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,440
Jin-kyung.

68
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,920
Your friend

69
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,120
seems to need help.

70
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,280
Find a chance to help her.

71
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,200
What are you doing?

72
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,760
Nothing, I'm just looking.

73
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,880
Is the sun out at night?

74
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,440
When did Scarlett become so kind?

75
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,000
Drive quickly.

76
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,280
Okay.

77
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,720
Mr. Song.

78
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,880
Have you received the receipt from the court?

79
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,760
You girls broke my head.

80
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,200
You must give me an explanation.

81
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,600
Otherwise,

82
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,920
the consequences are up to you.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,080
Made 0837.

84
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,280
Don't worry.

85
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,960
I will

86
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,440
give you a perfect explanation.

87
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,920
Lu Jinjing

88
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,280
He ruined my plan.

89
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,720
I must be out of my mind.

90
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,360
Sir, I'm sorry.

91
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,480
Let me clean the table.

92
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,040
Thank you.

93
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,800
Lu Jin-kyung.

94
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,440
Come here.

95
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,680
Director

96
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,520
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,560
Please give me another chance.

98
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
I will make up for my mistakes at work.

99
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,840
Jin-kyung.

100
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,560
I usually like you.

101
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,400
Really?

102
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,520
But you let our old customer

103
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,840
of our old customers.

104
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,120
You’re ruining our company.

105
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,840
If our company

106
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,200
if we don’t do anything,

107
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,120
what should I tell them?

108
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,400
I don't care about other things.

109
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,800
In the future,

110
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,720
we have to work with them in depth.

111
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,320
About this,

112
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,680
Think about it.

113
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,800
He wants to rape me.

114
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,440
Don't talk nonsense.

115
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,440
It's a matter of mutual love.

116
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,080
Why are you being so harsh?

117
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,680
Besides, everyone saw it.

118
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,320
you were drunk.

119
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,680
And Mr. Chen

120
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
helped you

121
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,280
and take care of you.

122
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,000
Go to Mr. Chen's house

123
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,920
to Mr. Chen.

124
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,640
and finish what you should do.

125
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,040
This thing

126
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
will be over.

127
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,880
Absolutely impossible.

128
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,240
Then why are you here?

129
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,040
From now on,

130
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,559
you're fired.

131
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,559
Fired?

132
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,000
You're fired.

133
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,320
It's like...

134
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,240
to frame Mr. Chen?

135
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,360
After it was exposed,

136
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,280
he even bit Mr Chen instead.

137
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,440
Now,

138
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,840
doesn't work with us anymore.

139
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,120
Besides,

140
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,240
they sue you for intentional assault.

141
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,480
We didn't ask you to compensate.

142
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,120
because we didn't ask you to compensate.

143
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,360
Nonsense!

144
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,600
I'm talking nonsense.

145
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,960
What can you do to me?

146
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Xu Jia Jia.
