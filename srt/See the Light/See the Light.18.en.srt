1
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,760
Where did the boss and Yan go?

2
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,519
None of your business.

3
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,400
Why not?

4
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,000
Where is Si Jiali?

5
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,920
She's the boss.

6
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,160
We're employees.

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,000
How can an employee know where the boss is?

8
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:19,880
She's committing a crime.

9
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,240
I'm saving her.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,880
A crime? That serious?

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,160
Eldest Young Master...

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,240
Detective, hurry up and save her.

13
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,400
Talk nicely.

14
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,280
Jin-kyung.

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,479
Where are they?

16
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't know.

17
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,440
If someone dies today,

18
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,200
none of you will get away with it.

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,600
Neither can I.

20
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,560
Don't worry, Young Master.

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,360
We don't kill people in a decent business.

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,560
If you want something to happen to her,

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,440
don't say anything.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,160
Wait.

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,600
It doesn't matter if I say it or not now.

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,560
It should be over soon.

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,920
What the hell is this place?

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,160
Don't you remember this place?

29
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,240
Congratulations on your release, Young Master Zou.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,320
It's you.

31
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
It seems

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,560
you remember who I am.

33
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,240
Who doesn't fear death?

34
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
It's you, old man.

35
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,320
Is this place

36
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,840
familiar?

37
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,079
Don't be mysterious.

38
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,360
Just cut to the chase.

39
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,000
Yan.

40
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
is my only belief

41
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,920
since my husband passed away.

42
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,440
She has always been sensible and smart.

43
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,000
and obedient.

44
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,920
I never argue with anyone.

45
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,760
Everyone envies me.

46
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,800
I have such a good daughter.

47
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,840
And all the good things

48
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,200
are torn apart by you.

49
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,840
You made us separated forever.

50
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,880
You asked me to send him off.

51
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,040
All these years,

52
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,800
I've been waiting for you to come out.

53
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,120
Today,

54
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,760
I finally have you.

55
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,080
It's not that big.

56
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,440
just for money?

57
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,320
Come on, how much do you think?

58
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,240
I'll give you all.

59
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,840
In your eyes,

60
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
my daughter's life

61
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,600
with money?

62
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,440
Don't waste your time.

63
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,480
Because of that bitch,

64
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,080
because of that bitch.

65
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,560
What else do you want?

66
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,320
I asked you

67
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
in court.

68
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,440
I'll ask you again today.

69
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,880
Zou Shixuan.

70
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,920
Why did you kill my daughter?

71
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,080
Why?

72
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,800
Why?

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,160
Why is it so annoying?

74
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,520
She kicked my life.

75
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,520
She didn't want me to pursue her.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,640
She died.

77
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,960
Besides, why is she

78
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,040
so playful?

79
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,000
She died

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,680
she died.

81
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,000
You don't know how to play.

82
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,159
Is this how you disregard human lives?

83
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,680
It seems that I didn't teach you well

84
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
I didn't teach you well.

85
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,480
Don't waste time.

86
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,720
Tell me how much you want.

87
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,480
I'm waiting for a drink.

88
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,400
Is it enough?

89
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,360
Is it enough?

90
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,760
I have plenty of money.

91
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,080
Is it enough?

92
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,320
I'll give you all.

93
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,840
Stop it.

94
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,080
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,280
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,040
That's what my daughter begged you, right?

97
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,800
I'll give you all the money.

98
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,840
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,800
Do you think money can kill people?

100
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,400
You can do whatever you want with money?

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,280
Don't worry.

103
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,920
It doesn't hurt the vital part.

104
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,000
Seven Knives.

105
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,320
Where is he?

106
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,680
He's gone.

107
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,680
Zou Shixuan is not dead.

108
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,400
But he won't be able to get out of bed for the rest of his life.

109
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,840
Since the murderer has left,

110
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,840
we'll put this case aside.

111
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,520
The police will issue a warrant later.

112
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,320
If she comes back within a year,

113
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,480
we will still investigate her.

114
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,040
If you cross the line again,

115
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,720
I will catch you.

116
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,640
Lu Jin-kyung.

117
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,240
I’m leaving.

118
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,600
Zou Shixuan and Gu Xiaoyan were high school classmates.

119
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,640
I know.

120
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,679
many tragedies

121
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,880
when the truth is revealed.

122
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Because the people around the victims

123
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
are devils who reach out their hands.

124
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,800
What do you mean?

125
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,520
What you care about the most

126
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,640
The most important person in your life.

127
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,280
Uncle Gao.

128
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,720
Although the case is closed,

129
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,360
I can't tell good from bad.

130
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,640
You mean the kidnapping case?

131
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,680
The foreign car case

132
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,800
these people helped you secretly.

133
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,880
It’s undeniably their credit.

134
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
When I was investigating Miao’s case,

135
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,840
I felt someone was helping me.

136
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,160
But I'm not sure if it's them.

137
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
But I’m sure

138
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,640
they must know about Miao.

139
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,480
In this world,

140
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,680
is either black or white.

141
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,320
You should stay away from these people

142
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,440
in case you get yourself in trouble.

143
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,120
Got it, Uncle Gao.
