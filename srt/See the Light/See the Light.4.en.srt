1
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,440
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

2
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,319
for supporting our police station.

3
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,360
Next, Mr. Gao will speak to you.

4
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,880
Everyone,

5
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,240
Up to now,

6
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,039
the ships at the crossing dock

7
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,039
from London.

8
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,720
These

9
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,640
are the results

10
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,920
by all of you.

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,880
I, Gao Hongshan,

12
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,400
as the co-representative of the political and business world,

13
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,080
Thank you for your hard work.

14
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,479
So,

15
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,960
in my name,

16
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,120
in my own name.

17
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,600
200,000 won.

18
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,000
Keep up the good work.

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,720
Thank you.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,480
Mu.

21
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,640
Talk to Uncle Gao.

22
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,440
Put your work aside.

23
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:33,680
Gao.

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,720
He has no manners at all.

25
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,400
Do you hear me?

26
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,720
Zhou.

27
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,360
It's okay.

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,480
Mu is a detective now.

29
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,480
It's normal.

30
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,560
Right, Mu?

31
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,720
By the way,

32
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,120
Nanjing has a few central positions vacant.

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,560
Your dad and I want to recommend you.

34
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,720
Uncle Gao.

35
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,800
I'm a detective now.

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,240
It's good. I don't want to be a leader yet.

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,920
I can't do it either.

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,080
Nonsense.

39
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,480
Do you understand?

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Do you think everyone has this chance?

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,880
Zhou.

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,240
It's good that he has his own ideas.

43
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,120
Also,

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,680
listen to Mu in the future.

45
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,040
Don't be so impatient.

46
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,440
Okay, I'll listen to your opinion.

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,680
Tell me what you think.

48
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,680
How could you be late

49
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,560
such an important meeting?

50
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,640
I went to catch the traffickers.

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,480
Is catching human traffickers more important

52
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,000
or the commendation meeting?

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,920
He may have something to do with Miao.

54
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,880
Mu.

55
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,120
Today is Miao’s 16th birthday.

56
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,880
Come back early.

57
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,240
Miaomiao.

58
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,920
Miaomiao.

59
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,560
Put him in the car.

60
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,040
Someone's coming.

61
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,760
Drive!

62
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,480
Go. Go.

63
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,680
Miaomiao.

64
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,400
Miaomiao.

65
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,920
Miaomiao.

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,240
Miaomiao.

67
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,680
Miaomiao.

68
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,720
Uncle Gao.

69
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,920
I have no appetite today.

70
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,360
As for being a leader,

71
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,840
I'm still young.

72
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,920
I don't want to have tea in the office so early.

73
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,360
Take your time.

74
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,880
I have work to do.

75
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,640
Excuse me.

76
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,120
Mu.

77
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,200
Mu.

78
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,440
Mu.

79
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,240
Yan.

80
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,880
The human trafficker Tiger Li was arrested.

81
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,440
Someone testified that he was involved in a missing person case seven years ago.

82
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,760
We'll know

83
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,080
and we'll know.

84
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,920
I'll go take a look.

85
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,960
Who are you?

86
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,600
Why did you tie me here?

87
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,880
Are you crazy?

88
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,880
Do you know who I am?

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,360
I'm Tiger Li from Suzhou River.

90
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,240
I'm a tiger.

91
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,120
King of Beasts.

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,360
I'll bite whoever I catch.

93
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,720
Seven years ago,

94
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,600
Do you know the girl who jumped off the building?

95
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,080
It's a misunderstanding.

96
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
What do I know?

97
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,480
Seven years ago?

98
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,840
Oh my god.

99
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,159
Please let me go.

100
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,960
I have a wife and children.

101
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,480
They can't live without me.

102
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,960
I have to take care of my wife.

103
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,000
They all need me.

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,080
Brother! Brother!

105
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,159
Hey.

106
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
What tiger Lee?

107
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,440
This is a paper tiger.

108
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,440
He's not a good guy either.

109
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,400
What should we do?

110
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Throw it to the police.

111
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,280
As usual.

112
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,520
Why does she appear in every case?

113
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,000
In the dark,

114
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,160
every photo of her

115
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,760
has a bloody story behind it.

116
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,880
On Zhou Mu's wall,

117
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,440
on Zhou Mu's wall

118
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,880
is related to Miaomiao’s disappearance.

119
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,520
What’s the connection

120
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,040
between these complicated cases?

121
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,040
Although Si Jiali and Zhou Mu are both in the dark,

122
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,280
the game of fate

123
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,080
has already tied them together.

124
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:26,600
Hit!

125
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,080
One.

126
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,600
A big hotel at the Bund.

127
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,360
Guest Zhao Wenyu Chen Huafeng Lv Army

128
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:22,640
Ben guest Ding Haibo Zhou Guanghua

129
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,600
Girls, take your heart, Ning Lijun, Zhang Liting.

130
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,080
