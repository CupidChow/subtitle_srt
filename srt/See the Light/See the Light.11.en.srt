1
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,680
Sister.

2
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,240
Why didn't we stop Hu Qiang just now?

3
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,760
To protect Hu Li.

4
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,840
Hu Li is the last belief and dignity

5
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,080
in this world.

6
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,800
We can't stop it.

7
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
nor take it away.

8
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:17,720
But...

9
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,520
Jin-kyung.

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,080
It's okay.

11
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,480
she met us, didn't she?

12
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,080
Boss.

13
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,840
Someone asked me to give this to you.

14
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,400
It's a gift for you.

15
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,080
Where is he?

16
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,160
At the door.

17
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,120
Let's go.

18
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,120
You're her dad, right?

19
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,280
You're...

20
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,520
Juan's sister, right?

21
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,680
Yes.

22
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,840
Juan told me she had a fight with you today.

23
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,280
She asked me to come here to apologize to you.

24
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,360
Bah!

25
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
That girl.

26
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,960
Is she that kind?

27
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,920
What kind of apology does she have?

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,120
I heard that Juan has a sister.

29
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,560
She's really rich now.

30
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,200
Living in a foreign house and a foreign car

31
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,880
Compared to the money Juan sold meat,

32
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,280
That's the big head.

33
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,840
No wonder Juan was so generous that she had to pay for it.

34
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,600
She found her way out.

35
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,760
Juan.

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,560
How could she tell me where Sumire is?

37
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,360
You don't know.

38
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,320
But Juan slipped my tongue today.

39
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,640
A slip?

40
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,160
What do you think?

41
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
I think...

42
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,000
we can go to Sumire together.

43
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,160
and see what money

44
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,600
from her foster parents.

45
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,800
But I want this amount.

46
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,400
My baby.

47
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,400
Look at you.

48
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,360
You're so pretty.

49
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,680
Why is your heart so dark?

50
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,360
You can't find anyone without me.

51
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,720
I can't get money without you.

52
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,920
Can her adoptive parents give us money?

53
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,840
She wouldn't have grown up without you.

54
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,480
Yes, you're right.

55
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,000
She eats my food.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,960
Drink mine.

57
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,720
Spit it out!

58
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,640
Let's go get money.

59
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,360
It's not time yet.

60
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,360
What time?

61
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,120
Now.

62
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,800
Hu Juan.

63
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,280
Hu Qiang

64
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,080
won't bother you and Hu Li anymore.

65
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,400
Thank you.

66
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,440
It's nothing.

67
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,200
Pack up.

68
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,960
We're going to meet Sumire

69
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,560
To see Sumire?

70
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,920
Yes.

71
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,960
Your sister

72
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,000
is really loyal.

73
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,760
It makes sense that your foster parents

74
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,280
to treat you first

75
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,320
and find you a job.

76
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,440
They'll take care of you from now on.

77
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,680
Sumire's adoptive parents.

78
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,800
Do you know what I do?

79
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,560
I know. It's okay.

80
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,360
They don't mind.

81
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,360
A rich family.

82
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,680
You can afford eight.

83
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,720
Don't worry.

84
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,400
I'll get ready.

85
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,560
Okay, hurry up.

86
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,400
Are you going to see my sister?

87
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,240
We'll be there soon.

88
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,320
Great.

89
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,040
I've talked to my parents.

90
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,040
I'll take you home this time.

91
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,640
we'll never be apart again.

92
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,560
Don't cry.

93
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,320
How can I see you if your eyes are swollen

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,040
Pretty

95
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,920
Take care of the house.

96
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,880
Let's go.

97
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,159
What does Sumire's adoptive parents do?

98
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,440
I think they're in construction business.

99
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,640
A decent Confucian.

100
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,960
Sumire is still in school.

101
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,040
She's in her senior year.

102
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,320
She's going to study in Soviet Union next year.

103
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,880
Soviet Union?

104
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,520
It's nice.

105
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,080
Just so so.

106
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Russian is hard to say.

107
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,920
You have to tie your tongue.

108
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,640
That's all. Are you done?

109
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,240
I'll go get changed.

110
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,040
I've always been curious.

111
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,200
Haven't you thought about

112
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
to find each other?

113
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,880
It's okay.

114
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,760
she found a rich family. How about...

115
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,520
Let's not talk about that.

116
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,760
The most important thing now

117
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,800
you'll meet each other soon.

118
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
You should think about

119
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,520
how to

120
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,560
to make up for the regret in the past?

121
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,680
and try to live a good life.

122
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,360
Right?

123
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,080
Right?

124
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,280
Juan.

125
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,720
Juan.

126
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Juan, I'm coming in.

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,680
It's not done yet.

128
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,240
Juan.

129
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,360
Juan.

130
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:35,920
Chen Guodong, Li Bobo, Zhao Zihao.

131
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,280
Zhang Chuan, Wang Zhiqiang, Ma Ming.

132
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:39,800
Zhang, Jie, Zhou Wenjie, Gao, Yuan.

133
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,080
Zhang Yikang, Hao Xin, Zhang MingGuan,
