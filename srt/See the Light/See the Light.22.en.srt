1
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,200
Chief.

2
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,759
Hello, Chief Zhou.

3
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm Qin Shan, the intern assigned to you.

4
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,600
I only take small cases.

5
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,440
not big cases.

6
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,320
You have no future with me.

7
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,240
You should date someone else.

8
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,840
No.

9
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,600
Why?

10
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,680
Because you've been

11
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,240
helping the weak?

12
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,960
In this case, it doesn't matter if you don't make contributions.

13
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,080
That's too little.

14
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,000
Boss.

15
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,520
This time, there are too many interviews.

16
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,400
Our police station

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,440
We don't have enough people. We don't have enough.

18
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,479
Not enough.

19
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,920
You eat and play all day.

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,840
There must be not enough people.

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,760
Search carefully.

22
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,680
To be honest,

23
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,480
The world is in chaos now.

24
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,680
there are many missing women.

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,320
A lot.

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,960
Even if there's someone, look into it carefully.

27
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,920
Boss.

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,760
I've finished the materials last night.

29
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,360
Look.

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,560
Sure, so many.

31
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,160
Do you need me to organize them for you?

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,480
Sure.

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,440
Okay.

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,800
In this chaotic world

35
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,400
Head.

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,760
You showed me the young me.

37
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,880
Stop!

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,520
You showed me

39
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,320
the ambitions and ideals that I still insist on.

40
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,520
When I'm lost,

41
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,840
I can always find hope from you

42
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
and the motivation to move forward.

43
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,480
The greatest luck in the world

44
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,040
is to have a reliable brother

45
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,560
with a reliable brother.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,520
Why?

47
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,640
Why did you leave first?

48
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,680
Qin Shan.

49
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,800
Keep it up.

50
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,480
Yes.

51
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,480
Geum Mu.

52
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,159
The records of the guest room for the past ten years are here.

53
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,720
The people around the victim

54
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,240
is the devil who stretches his hand to them.

55
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,360
The police won't send one person to you.

56
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,640
If you don't want to die, go catch him yourself.

57
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,040
Qin Shan.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,800
Good job.

59
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,000
I got the evidence you left me.

60
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,320
Don't worry.

61
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,520
I will find him and avenge you.

62
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,680
Zhou Mu.

63
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,920
I know who Jinmu is.

64
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,840
You're back.

65
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,600
Have you taken care of Qin Shan?

66
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,720
What a pity.

67
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,320
He's always the focus of training in the bureau.

68
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,360
Who knew this would happen?

69
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,520
I'll send more people

70
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
to find the murderer as soon as possible.

71
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,880
You still care about Qin Shan?

72
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,280
What are you talking about?

73
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,400
Qin Shan is my police after all.

74
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,680
I care about him, right?

75
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,400
So you care about someone else's life too.

76
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,800
Just say it.

77
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,080
Don't be weird.

78
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,560
Do you know who the murderer is?

79
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,080
What are you talking about?

80
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,920
Are you responsible for what you said?

81
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,120
Of course.

82
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,520
I’ll be responsible for what I said.

83
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,680
I will also be responsible for Qin Shan and Miaomiao.

84
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,040
If you have a clear conscience,

85
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,680
why didn't you investigate the case of the foreign car shop for me?

86
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,800
You know the human trafficking group, right?

87
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,520
You know

88
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,480
in the nursing home, right?

89
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,080
No.

90
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,440
What are you talking about?

91
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,920
Miao...

92
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,960
human traffickers and foreign car shops.

93
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,200
What's the connection?

94
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,840
I thought

95
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,400
you only cared about your position.

96
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,680
I didn't expect you to be a beast in human clothing.

97
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,240
You trampled on others' lives

98
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,920
for your own selfish desires.

99
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,920
Even a vicious tiger doesn't eat its cubs.

100
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,520
You're really a disgrace.

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,520
Zhou Mu.

102
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,920
Are you crazy?

103
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,760
Yes.

104
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,760
I'm crazy today.

105
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,600
Today, for Qin Shan,

106
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,400
for Miaomiao,

107
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,600
for the peace of the society,

108
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
for the people.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,400
So Zhou is Jinmu.

110
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,800
Zhou is so stupid.

111
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,120
Not only Miaomiao,

112
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
the human trafficking case.

113
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,320
the opium trafficking case,

114
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,560
and Qin Shan.

115
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,760
From what I know about him,

116
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,159
he won't give up.

117
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,760
Mu.

118
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,240
What do you think?

119
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,320
I...

120
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,520
I want to persuade him to turn himself in.

121
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,760
He even dared to kill Miao.

122
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,760
What else could he be worried about?

123
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,480
What would you do

124
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,560
what would you do?

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,480
You'll suffer the chaos.

126
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
Mu, just do it.

127
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,159
I'll let Gao Ying protect you with you.

128
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,799
Thank you, Uncle Gao.

129
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,200
Do you know what you're doing?

130
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,320
Today,

131
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,600
to bring my biological father to justice.

132
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,280
Sister Yan.

133
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,240
Zhou Mu.

134
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,480
Now is the truth about Miaomiao.
