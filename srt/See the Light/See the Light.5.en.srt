1
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,400
Lu Jin-kyung.

2
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,480
Come here.

3
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:05,840
Director,

4
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,240
This invitation

5
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,880
Take it.

6
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,880
Tonight,

7
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,480
Mr. Chen and Mr. Niu will come.

8
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,120
Do your best.

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,360
Director,

10
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,400
Can I not go?

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,520
Lu Jinjing.

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,320
Don't push your luck.

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,320
I haven't settled with you

14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,920
about your absence last time.

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,000
You're a girl.

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,200
You should dress yourself up.

17
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,760
Look at your outfit.

18
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,440
Look at you.

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,960
Okay, it's settled.

20
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:36,520
Go.

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,720
Don't take me if you think it's ugly.

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,120
I read in the newspaper that day

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,400
is simple, loyal and loyal.

24
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,479
In fact,

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,840
Shanghai is prosperous.

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Ten miles Market.

27
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,120
It's a great harvest.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,400
There's Rong Nai.

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,720
Speaking of which,

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,400
Mr. Chen and Mr. Niu.

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,920
Let me introduce.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,280
the best two young employees

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,280
of Shanghai Firm.

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,520
Lu Jinjing and Xu Jia Jia.

35
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,280
Why are you so confused?

36
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,280
What are you waiting for?

37
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,360
Say hello to Mr. Chen and Mr. Niu.

38
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,040
Hello, Mr. Chen. Hello, Mr. Niu.

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,680
Hello, Mr. Chen. Hello, Mr. Niu.

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,880
I've long heard that

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,920
are the leaders of Shanghai business.

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,840
Thanks for your care.

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,680
What a sweet girl.

44
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,280
Mr. Niu, Jiajia

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,040
is not only beautiful and clever,

46
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,400
And she is the best at telling the truth.

47
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,520
Jia Jia, come here.

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,920
Miss Lu,

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,760
Have a drink.

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,200
Mr Chen.

51
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,720
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,520
I can't drink.

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,440
It's okay.

54
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,480
The wine is not intoxicating.

55
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,880
Director Hong.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,440
Your employee is a bit shy.

57
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,760
No problem.

58
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,720
Lu Jin-kyung.

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,000
Do you still want to work?

60
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,280
Brother.

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,360
Come on

62
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,920
Let's take this chance

63
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's

64
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,280
to celebrate.

65
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,760
Come on.

66
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:23,720
Come on

67
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,240
Come on.

68
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,000
In Shanghai,

69
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,840
all things are snatched.

70
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:28,880
So,

71
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,400
we can make money together.

72
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,640
Let's share it.

73
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,280
Come on.

74
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,600
Come on.

75
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,840
I knew it.

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,520
The wine is not drunk.

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,840
Excuse me.

78
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,880
I need to use the bathroom.

79
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,400
They are all here.

80
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
Yes, Chief Zhou.

81
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,680
These are all the guest records in recent years.

82
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,399
Zhou Cheng Yong.

83
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,560
Lu Jinjing.

84
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,320
Why are you here?

85
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,720
None of your business.

86
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,240
Let me ask you.

87
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,480
Where is Wang Yu?

88
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,920
Also,

89
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,400
you should know

90
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,320
who drank with Feng Lei.

91
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,280
Where did she go?

92
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,760
I don't know.

93
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,240
I've seen her.

94
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,040
If you still think she's righteous,

95
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,080
I can tell you.

96
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,800
She's more dangerous than anyone.

97
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,320
Be careful.

98
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,560
You don't usually wear this?

99
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,320
Are you...

100
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,400
Yes.

101
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,080
I have to wear it for you now.

102
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,400
What's wrong?

103
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,120
Did someone bully you?

104
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,200
Who is that?

105
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,920
Left.

106
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,840
Gao Hongshan, leader of political and business.

107
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
The other one.

108
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,560
Director Zhou Cheng Yong

109
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,960
Zhou.

110
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,160
Your father?

111
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,040
As expected, a dragon gives birth to a dragon.

112
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,040
The mouse's son knows how to dig a hole.

113
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,840
Lu Jin-kyung.

114
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,560
Why are you standing there?

115
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,640
Come here.

116
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,720
You...

117
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,040
Brother, you don't know.

118
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,000
That time,

119
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,159
at Paramount.

120
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240
Mr. Niu. Mr. Niu.

121
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,159
I haven't made a toast to you today.

122
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,200
I'll drink this.

123
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,720
Okay.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,280
Ms. Lu is a good drinker.

125
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,080
You got it.

126
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,760
Here, Miss Lu.

127
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,240
Cheers.

128
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,520
Mr Chen.

129
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,960
I can't drink anymore.

130
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,520
What's wrong?

131
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,720
It's delicious.

132
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,800
Don't you respect Mr. Niu?

133
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,600
You just had a drink for Ms Xu.

134
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,120
How about letting Ms Xu

135
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,760
drink it for you?

136
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,760
No, no, no.

137
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,360
I'll drink.

138
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,159
You're a good drinker.

139
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,440
Come on.

140
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,960
Tonight,

141
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,960
get drunk tonight.

142
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,840
Let me help you get some rest.

143
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,840
Let's go to the bathroom.

144
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,120
Slow down.

145
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,720
How impressive!

146
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,120
Don't move, baby.

147
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,040
Get lost!

148
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,520
Get lost.

149
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,760
Don't move, baby.

150
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,000
Baby.

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,720
Let go of me!

152
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,240
Let go!

153
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,040
Why are you here?

154
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,200
Let's see if you're here to sleep with me.

155
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,520
If so, I'll sweep the yellow.

156
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,440
or I'll save you.

157
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,480
Jia.

158
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,400
Jia Jia.

159
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,400
What's wrong?

160
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,000
Come with me.

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,440
What's wrong?

162
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,840
Who are you?

163
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,440
What do you want?

164
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,679
Who are you?

165
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,640
Do you know who I am?

166
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,200
I'm Chief Zhou Mu of the Municipal Bureau.

167
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,200
I'm warning you.

168
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,040
Don’t do anything stupid.

169
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,720
Chief.

170
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,880
Even the Chief will die here today.

171
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,520
Go!

172
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,000
Go!

173
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,880
Keep up.

174
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,440
Zhou Mu.
