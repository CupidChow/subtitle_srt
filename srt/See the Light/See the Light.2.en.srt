1
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,680
Welcome to

2
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,200
Shenhong Pawn Shop

3
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,080
I need your help.

4
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,160
Have a seat.

5
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,800
Tell me.

6
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,240
My husband

7
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,320
for a long time.

8
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,440
Every time he gets drunk,

9
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,760
I'll be his vent target.

10
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,400
Slap him from the beginning.

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,360
Kick and hit with a chair.

12
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,000
He stepped on me and hit me.

13
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,880
I'll never forget that hysterical pain.

14
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,720
A typical domestic violence case.

15
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,680
Since the Republic of China,

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,800
39 women

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
39 women died of domestic violence

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,560
died of domestic violence.

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,400
Three quarter of them

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,280
committed suicide.

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,400
A man with domestic violence

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,039
never kills himself.

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,920
They use torture day after day.

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,880
year after year.

25
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,120
and pushed these women into the abyss.

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,240
But it's okay.

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,720
We can help you.

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,600
What should we do?

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,960
Hide behind

30
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,520
and wait for a chance.

31
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,240
within five meters.

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,040
and bombs.

33
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,760
I knew this is not a reliable place.

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,920
Let's go.

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,280
It can help you

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,400
forever.

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,600
Right?

38
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,440
We will solve this

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,120
in a better way.

40
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't worry about it.

41
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:47,800
Goodbye.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,079
Really?

43
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,320
You've been to the police station, right?

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,680
Does it work?

45
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,280
Is the so-called legal

46
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,000
a better way

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,200
What is it?

48
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,120
Trust me.

49
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,480
Kill him with one shot.

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,280
Throw the body to Huangpu River.

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,840
and report a missing person to the police station.

52
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
Nowadays,

53
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,400
no one cares about the dead.

54
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,760
No matter what,

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,079
we won't use this method.

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,800
What if I force you to use it?

57
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,880
Say something.

58
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,320
Enough.

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,920
Don't scare the two girls.

60
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,360
Move!

61
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,360
It's okay. He's just kidding.

62
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't be afraid. Sit down.

63
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,560
Come on.

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,520
Congratulations on passing the test.

65
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,920
A test?

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,520
A test about good and evil.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,680
What does it mean?

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,360
It means

69
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,320
we accept

70
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,720
this request.

71
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,440
Tientsin is prosperous.

72
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,600
Jiaxing, be quiet.

73
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,800
Hangzhou.

74
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,720
I like it the most.

75
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,000
Usually in this situation,

76
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,480
we will send you to a city

77
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,360
and arrange a job for you

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,240
to get rid of him completely.

79
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,680
But...

80
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,840
my family is still here.

81
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,800
We can take care of your family.

82
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Get ready to go.

83
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,080
Wang Yu.

84
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,080
Have you really made up your mind?

85
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,920
I can't stand it anymore.

86
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,640
Okay, you can stay at my place for a few days.

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,640
Jinjing.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,840
I still want to go back to my home.

89
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,960
In a short time,

90
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,440
in a short time.

91
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,480
But your parents

92
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,840
are wearing the same pants.

93
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,760
I'm afraid.

94
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,720
Don't worry.

95
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,120
My mom will listen to me.

96
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,360
I contacted her.

97
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,520
It's okay.

98
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,120
Okay.

99
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,840
I'll accompany you.

100
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,520
Mom.

101
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,400
Yu.

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,440
It's good to see you.

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,640
Just go.

104
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,200
Come in.

105
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,800
Auntie, didn't we agree

106
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,920
Just you?

107
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,280
This is my house.

108
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,440
Who's there if I'm not here

109
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,480
I have to bicker with my husband and leave.

110
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,840
You've disgraced our family.

111
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,200
Uncle.

112
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,200
Uncle

113
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,880
Wang Yu was beaten like this.

114
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
You call this bicker?

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,560
Dad.

116
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,440
I can't live with Feng Lei anymore.

117
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,800
Feng Lei was too anxious.

118
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,800
I'll talk to him.

119
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,520
to stop fighting.

120
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,440
You don't mind him hitting Wang Yu,

121
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,200
but you still side with him.

122
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,840
What kind of parents are you?

123
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,880
This is our family business.

124
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,320
Who do you think you are?

125
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,800
All right.

126
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,000
Feng, come out.

127
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,360
You...

128
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,760
How could you lie to your own daughter?

129
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,280
You two live together.

130
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,440
Feng Lei is making money alone.

131
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,560
Please understand him.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,640
Yu, I know I was wrong.

133
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,800
Come home with me.

134
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,360
I brought you a gift.

135
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,200
Don't you always like these shoes?

136
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,800
Let me put them on for you.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,160
I was in a hurry too.

138
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,080
I swear.

139
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,800
I won't do it again.

140
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,600
Please.

141
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,200
I'll kill you.

142
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,160
I'll listen to you from now on.

143
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,800
I won't let you down. Don't hit me.

144
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,360
I'll do anything you want.

145
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
Stop hitting me.

146
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,560
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,560
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,320
Please let me go.

149
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,080
Feng Lei.

150
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,320
Let's get a divorce.

151
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,720
Divorce?

152
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,320
Say that again!

153
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,160
Say it again! Divorce!

154
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,000
Let go!

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,080
Talk nicely. Don't fight.

156
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,800
Tell me.

157
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,480
Are you having an affair?

158
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,800
Feng Lei, I beg you.

159
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,920
Are you having an affair?

160
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,680
Feng Lei, I beg you.

161
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,440
Please don't hit Yu.

162
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,080
It's you.

163
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,280
I beg you, Feng Lei.

164
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,280
You're the one who led Yu astray.

165
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,760
I'll strangle you to death.

166
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,960
It's you.

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,720
You're the one who led Yu astray.

168
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,919
I'll strangle you to death.

169
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,440
Don't move.

170
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,320
Why are you here?

171
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,040
I told you to trust me.

172
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,680
By the way, is my ID you?

173
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,360
Who are you?

174
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,880
Who are you?

175
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,160
Are you her lover?

176
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,520
Cut the crap and copy it.

177
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,040
I'll kill you.

178
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,720
Feng Lei.

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,960
34 years old.

180
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,960
He was sentenced to a life sentence.

181
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,520
One year and two months.

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,720
Four years ago,

183
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,120
he abused his ex-wife.

184
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,600
In the end, the girl committed suicide.

185
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,000
Because it was suicide.

186
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,760
He was released

187
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,720
because of intentional injury.

188
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,360
But that girl

189
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,400
will never wake up again.

190
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,000
And your parents

191
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,320
your parents should know.

192
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
What are you thinking?

193
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,160
The girl who was forced to die

194
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
was thinking.

195
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,120
She is the past you,

196
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
and the future you.

197
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,840
What kind of result do you want?

198
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,840
Give me an answer.

199
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,680
I want him to disappear.
