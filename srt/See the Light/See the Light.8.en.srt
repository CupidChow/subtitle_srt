1
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Let's go to Mr. Chen's house. Okay.

2
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,800
and apologize.

3
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,400
Then finish what you should do.

4
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,520
To keep my job,

5
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,680
to keep my job.

6
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,280
Shouldn't you think about

7
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,840
if it's your problem.

8
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,880
We are ordinary people.

9
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,400
We can't offend them.

10
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,240
Jin-kyung.

11
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,039
We need to control the cost.

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,440
What cost?

13
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,760
feed fee.

14
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,040
Don't hit me.

15
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,120
Don't hit me. I was wrong.

16
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,640
Don't hit me. I'm so good.

17
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,680
Let me give you a massage.

18
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,919
Lu Jin-kyung.

19
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,919
Do you need our help?

20
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,840
It's a matter of mutual love.

21
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,680
Why are you yelling?

22
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,800
Finish what you haven't done.

23
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
That's all in the past.

24
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,840
I'm just talking nonsense.

25
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,640
But who do you think others prefer to trust?

26
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
Mr Chen, it's on me this time.

27
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,320
I’ll give you a younger and prettier one next time.

28
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,200
It is said that Dacheng Firm has resigned

29
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,920
Song Yue and Xu Jia Jia.

30
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,600
All companies related to this case

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,680
[who are related to this case.]

32
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,920
[has been suspended]

33
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,400
mentioned in the recording

34
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,800
to be investigated.

35
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,600
Thank you.

36
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
We're not outsiders.

37
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
What are you doing?

38
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,120
We're old friends.

39
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,320
Lu Jinjing.

40
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,160
What are you going to do next?

41
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,760
Go back to your hometown first.

42
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,480
Although it's done,

43
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,840
I've become the blacklist of the industry.

44
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,800
But I don't regret it.

45
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,320
Lu Jin-kyung.

46
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,560
To be honest,

47
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,600
You asked me why I did this last time.

48
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,240
Yes.

49
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,320
It is said that

50
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,240
the first Heavenly Queen Mother was in charge of the Criminal Law.

51
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
When someone

52
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,040
that cannot be cleared,

53
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,240
she will be punished.

54
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,040
and punish the sins and injustice in the mortal world.

55
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,480
So you're doing this to become her?

56
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,000
Not just me.

57
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
We're both...

58
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,120
Lu Jin-kyung.

59
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,840
I didn't make myself clear last time.

60
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,440
The real reason I'm interested in you is

61
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,040
I saw the fire in your heart.

62
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,040
It's the flame of ideal.

63
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,080
The fire of faith.

64
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,480
It may still be a little flame now.

65
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,320
but it can light up those who need help.

66
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,080
I saw it.

67
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,760
You'll see it one day.

68
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,440
I'm different from you.

69
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,280
I'm not as good as you.

70
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,440
Everyone here

71
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,840
step by step.

72
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,840
No one is born to be strong.

73
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,960
They all need to work hard the day after tomorrow

74
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,480
step by step.

75
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,040
Jinjing.

76
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,760
Look at your best friend Wang Yu.

77
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,120
What was she like before?

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
But now,

79
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,240
confident, strong, and brave.

80
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,240
I trust you.

81
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,600
Before you grow up,

82
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,400
we will protect you.

83
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,720
So...

84
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,600
Lu Jin-kyung.

85
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,680
Are you interested in finding a new job?

86
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,280
Or are you interested in joining us

87
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,200
and light this fire together?

88
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,240
Hello, I'm Lu Jin-kyung.

89
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,480
Nice to meet you.

90
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,200
My sister and I never had a mother.

91
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,200
My dad died early too.

92
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,720
Uncle said he was drunk

93
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,040
and got hit by a car.

94
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,440
My sister and I weren't very sad.

95
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,600
We all thought

96
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,240
we finally said goodbye to

97
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,080
who doesn't care about us.

98
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,760
But unexpectedly,

99
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,240
this is the beginning of a nightmare.

100
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,400
I've never seen my uncle

101
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,400
and never returned to my hometown.

102
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,440
Later I found out

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,520
we were sold

104
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,040
to that man.

105
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,960
Hu Qiang.

106
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,480
Are you done?

107
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,440
Okay, got it.

108
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,960
Okay, let's go.

109
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Okay.

110
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,800
Thank you.

111
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,080
What a bad luck to take this case in the morning.

112
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,520
There's no case in this world.

113
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,600
What's going on?

114
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,000
Kidnapping, looking for my sister.

115
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,720
The case ten years ago.

116
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,320
He went missing last month.

117
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,240
Ten years ago?

118
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,080
Do you really want to take this case?

119
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,160
Qin Shan.

120
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,480
Boss.

121
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,000
Well...

122
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,920
Abduction.

123
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,160
Hu Li.
