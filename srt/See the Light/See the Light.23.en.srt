1
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,120
Mu.

2
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:17,720
Where's your father?

3
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,400
When I interrogated him,

4
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,120
he wanted

5
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,160
shoot me.

6
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,039
In order to protect me,

7
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,759
to protect me.

8
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,280
He killed Gao Ying

9
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,240
he killed Gao Ying.

10
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,320
He ran away

11
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,479
he ran away.

12
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,200
When he wanted to kill me,

13
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,080
he didn't even blink.

14
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm glad you're fine.

15
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,720
I'm here.

16
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,080
I'll support you no matter what.

17
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,000
Mu.

18
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,200
Uncle Gao, I have no children.

19
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,600
You grew up under my nose.

20
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,960
If you don't mind,

21
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,560
take me as your father from now on.

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,640
I'll treat you as my own child.

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,240
Thank you, Uncle Gao.

24
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,160
I will catch him.

25
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,520
for Qin Shan and Miao.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,960
for Qin Shan and Miaomiao.

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,320
Today is an important day.

28
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,720
Relax.

29
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,120
You two.

30
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,400
Sure.

31
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,240
How is it, Mu?

32
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,800
Are you ready?

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,920
From now on, you are my son.

34
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,600
Of course, Jin-kyung is the same.

35
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,600
Here.

36
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,680
Everyone.

37
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,000
First of all, thank you very much

38
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,880
for coming here for my sake.

39
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,680
Today,

40
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,880
to catch up with you

41
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,960
and drink and talk.

42
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,079
Second,

43
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,240
to introduce my son to you.

44
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,400
Zhou Mu.

45
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
Zhou Mu.

46
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,880
Who is this?

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,040
With whom?

48
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,160
I watched Zhou Mu grow up.

49
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,200
I treated him like my own son.

50
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,520
Now,

51
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,240
something happened to his family.

52
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,240
He was left alone.

53
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,440
I

54
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,800
have no children.

55
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,200
So, I accepted him.

56
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,440
From now on,

57
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,600
Zhou Mu is my son.

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,440
Please show me some respect

59
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,920
please show me some respect.

60
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440
Nice to meet you.

61
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,360
Congratulations.

62
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,320
Congratulations, Mr. Gao.

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,320
Congratulations, Mr. Gao.

64
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,920
It's my honour to have you here.

65
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,320
Godfather, can I say something?

66
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,600
Come on.

67
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,640
It's an honor

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,040
to meet you

69
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,159
on such a grand occasion.

70
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,040
I saw many old friends

71
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,040
and many new friends.

72
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,040
As long as they can come today,

73
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,880
are my friends.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,360
My godfather Gao Hongshan

75
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,920
is a famous tycoon in this city.

76
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,520
and powerful.

77
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,600
and the symbol of power in this city.

78
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,920
He's a philanthropist to you.

79
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Entrepreneur?

80
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,560
But he has another identity.

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,440
that you don't know.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,640
He is a

83
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,960
a beast with a human face.

84
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,520
How could Mr. Gao be such a person?

85
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,920
Zhou Mu must be talking nonsense.

86
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,280
Am I right?

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
Mr. Kazuki!

88
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,360
Sure.

89
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,920
Everyone,

90
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
there's a misunderstanding between Mu and me.

91
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Please excuse us.

92
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,840
Take the guests to rest.

93
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,440
Gao Hongshan

94
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,240
Gao Hongshan is afraid now?

95
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,840
Looks like you big shots

96
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,760
more important than anything.

97
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,960
You don't know.

98
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,800
Gao Hongshan

99
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,040
seems to be a big shot.

100
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,159
He turned the table.

101
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,200
Turning hands into rain.

102
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,360
But in fact,

103
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
he has no conscience.

104
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,120
and committed every crime.

105
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,640
Official merchants collusion is a heinous crime.

106
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
He looks glamorous,

107
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,720
but he's actually full of evil.

108
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,600
Many people died in his hands.

109
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,880
Gao Hongshan

110
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
Gao Hongshan

111
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,480
You ungrateful beast!

112
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,600
All these years,

113
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,320
I didn't see through your face.

114
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,640
Zhou,

115
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,600
Aren't you on the run?

116
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,640
What?

117
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
You're the director of the police station.

118
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,920
You're playing this childish trick too?

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,159
Pediatrics?

120
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,680
Yes.

121
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,280
I'm not qualified

122
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,720
as a police chief.

123
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
I can't believe

124
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,120
who sold people.

125
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,159
Those who hurt my daughter are brothers.

126
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,200
I was so blind.

127
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,240
Fortunately, the truth finally came out.

128
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,680
Yes.

129
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,040
The truth has come to light.

130
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,840
Mr. Geum Mu.

131
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,000
You're Scarlett, right?

132
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,680
I'm a little strange.

133
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,320
How did you find out about me?

134
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,360
I’ve been looking for her since Miao died.

135
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,360
I’ve been investigating

136
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,880
who killed her.

137
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,040
But when the truth comes out,

138
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,800
it really drops people.

139
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,320
Miaomiao was so young

140
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,360
who could kill her

141
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
is her most trusted

142
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,920
and most respected.

143
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,600
and a respectable person.

144
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,240
Mr. Gao Hongshan.

145
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,440
Seven years ago,

146
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,320
the girl who jumped off the building

147
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,240
Do you know

148
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,400
we're working for that gentleman.

149
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,120
Why are we still talking about rules?

150
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,600
I just sold the information

151
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,720
to sell the information to them

152
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,840
for some money.

153
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,360
Maybe we've been targeted.

154
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Who is Mr. Geum Mu?

155
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,200
Geum Mu.

156
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,080
It's confirmed.

157
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,840
Jinmu is Gao Hongshan.

158
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,200
I want to kill you.

159
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,960
and avenge Miao.

160
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,120
But when the cases

161
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,440
all the shocking cases

162
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,560
When the mastermind is pointing at you,

163
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,280
I knew

164
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,720
Killing you is not the ultimate purpose.

165
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,760
I'll bring you down.

166
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,960
It's the most important

167
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,040
is the most important.

168
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,920
You guys?

169
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,720
You're overestimating yourself.

170
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,600
Gao Hongshan.

171
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,440
If you surrender today,

172
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,560
for old times' sake,

173
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,080
I might still keep you alive.

174
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,120
If you refuse arrest,

175
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,360
you know the consequences.

176
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,800
Zhou Cheng Yong.

177
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,920
You know my strength.

178
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,280
Gao Hongshan.

179
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,000
For Miao,

180
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,400
and those who died because of you.

181
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
I will make you pay with your blood.

182
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,000
I've been waiting for this moment for seven years.

183
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,040
Can you give me a chance to kill my enemy?

184
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,000
Mu.

185
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,640
Be careful.

186
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,080
Don't let this beast go.

187
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:07,920
Yes.

188
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,440
All unrelated personnel, leave.

189
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,400
Okay.

190
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,920
Good.

191
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,320
All of you have to stay here today.

192
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,360
This city should be shuffled again.

193
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,240
Turn around
