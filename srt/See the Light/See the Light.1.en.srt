1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,440
In a chaotic time and space,

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,160
women can't be treated equally.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,520
A mysterious group appeared in the folk.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,400
[They carry on the women's code]

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,600
Like a meteor that slips through the night

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,080
It lights up the women in the deep mud.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,480
No one knows who they are

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,680
I only know they are from Shenhong Pawn Shop

9
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,000
Extra!

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,800
Extra!

11
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,560
Miss.

12
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,160
Have we met before?

13
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,880
You look like my cousin.

14
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,400
No, you're prettier than her.

15
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,160
You're much prettier than her.

16
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,920
You're a beauty.

17
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,400
That's you, right?

18
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,560
What's your name?

19
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,479
Who are you?

20
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,480
From Anhui.

21
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,320
Or where?

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
Let's have a chat if we're fated to meet.

23
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,680
How many kids are there in your family?

24
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,440
What do you want to eat?

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,520
I'll treat you to dinner.

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,160
Miss,

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,120
How about I buy you coffee?

28
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Let's watch a movie.

29
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,480
Puppy, right?

30
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,440
I'll buy you a cup of tea.

31
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,720
Who are you?

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Chief Zhou Mu.

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,280
Come with me.

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,360
Stop bluffing.

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,680
Don't force me to do it.

36
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
Are you wearing a uniform?

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
Don't bluff.

38
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,680
You really want to fight?

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,240
Come on.

40
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,440
Don't move.

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:48,840
Stop!

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,480
My arm hurts.

43
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,120
What are you doing?

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,640
You bumped into me. Apologize.

45
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
Why aren't you looking at me?

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,960
I don't care.

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,840
Apologize!

48
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,360
Go ahead.

49
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,720
Zhou Mu.

50
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,600
Zhou Mu.

51
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,960
It's you.

52
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,880
How dare you come to the police station?

53
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,680
What? You're a police officer.

54
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,079
You don't have to apologize for hitting someone?

55
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,720
You...

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,600
Like this.

57
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,320
I'm sorry to hit you.

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,520
Now,

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,960
give you some medical expenses.

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,960
Go and see for yourself.

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,760
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,040
Mr. Zhou.

63
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,040
Would you like to meet the director?

64
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,760
Go away. Are you done with the case?

65
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,880
You're a young master.

66
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,800
No wonder he likes to hit people with money.

67
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,960
Don't talk nonsense.

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,920
I can sue you.

69
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,120
Did I break the law?

70
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,880
You...

71
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,440
I'm afraid of you.

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,480
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,520
Take the medical fee and check it out.

74
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,560
I'm busy at work.

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,080
Thank you.

76
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,400
I'm not here to ask you for money.

77
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,520
Qin Shan.

78
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,120
She's the one who stopped me from catching Puppy.

79
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,920
Ask them

80
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,640
about their relationship.

81
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,120
and pay her for the medical bills.

82
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,600
Yes.

83
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,160
What are you doing?

84
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,959
You didn't apologize for bumping into me.

85
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm here to return something to you.

86
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,160
You're talking about me?

87
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,920
Miss,

88
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,080
I have nothing to do with him.

89
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,760
Please come here.

90
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,720
Why do you detain me?

91
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,320
Why?

92
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,080
Wang Yu.

93
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,560
Jinjing.

94
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,720
What? You know each other?

95
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,040
You guys go over there first.

96
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,080
Okay, follow me.

97
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,000
Let me see.

98
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,240
What happened to your injury?

99
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,000
Where else?

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,560
This...

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,560
Can you cooperate?

102
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,159
Pull down a little.

103
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,080
Let me see inside.

104
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,960
No need.

105
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,800
It's not that I don't want to check.

106
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,000
Isn't this supposed to be a policewoman?

107
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,840
We don't have policemen here.

108
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,760
Okay.

109
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,080
Now we've checked the wound.

110
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,880
And then?

111
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,000
Then...

112
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,320
go back and tell your husband.

113
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,680
Why call the police?

114
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,960
Next.

115
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,920
This is domestic violence.

116
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,440
Shouldn't you take care of her husband?

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,280
What should we do

118
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,480
what should we do?

119
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,640
Look.

120
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,840
She's badly injured.

121
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,760
This is intentional injury.

122
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,640
She can be convicted.

123
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,040
Who knows if she fell by herself?

124
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,360
Either you find a witness

125
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,080
If you keep nagging here,

126
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,440
I'll sue you for obstruction of justice.

127
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,840
Fine.

128
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,600
Zhou Mu.

129
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,040
Zhou Mu.

130
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,920
Zhou Mu.

131
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,520
Stop shouting. This is the police station.

132
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,880
This is the police station, right?

133
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,280
We're here to report a case.

134
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,720
She was already bullied.

135
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
but you still bullied her.

136
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,320
You didn't arrest him even though you have evidence.

137
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,800
Why don't you just

138
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,720
instead of bullying the weak.

139
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,480
Look at you.

140
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,880
Who do you think is seeking justice for the people?

141
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,160
Don't worry.

142
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,360
I'm different from them.

143
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,920
You're different. You're just like them.

144
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,920
In my place,

145
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,120
I'll handle all major cases.

146
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,720
Even if the Heavenly King comes, I'll still arrest him.

147
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,600
Wang Yu, come home with me.

148
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,520
We'll figure something out after we go back.

149
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,880
Do you really trust that cop?

150
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,800
I think

151
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,800
he's different from other police officers.

152
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,200
Forget it.

153
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,800
Go somewhere with me.

154
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,480
What is this?

155
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,680
When I was hit by Feng Lei,

156
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,960
when I was hit by Feng Lei.

157
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,480
I didn't believe in these tricks before.

158
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,800
But now I want to give it a try.

159
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,200
Do you really believe this?

160
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,440
The worse result

161
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,760
Can it be worse than now?

162
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,880
I'll kill you.

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,640
How dare you!

164
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,920
How dare you disobey me!

165
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,600
I'll listen to you.

166
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,720
Are you always lying to me?

167
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
Are you trying to lie to me?

168
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,440
How can I hit you if you don't make me angry?

169
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,880
Say something.

170
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,720
If you marry me, you're mine.

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,840
I'll do whatever I want.

172
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,800
When will this day end?

173
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,560
This is it.

174
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,440
Welcome to

175
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,840
Shenhong Pawn Shop

176
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,480
I need help.
