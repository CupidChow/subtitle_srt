1
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,240
Miss.

2
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,880
Aren't you going home?

3
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:01,800
No.

4
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,960
Sister.

5
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,560
Are you okay?

6
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,800
Hot wontons are ready.

7
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,039
Did you quarrel with your family?

8
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,440
I think my parents

9
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,680
care about me at all.

10
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,960
or me.

11
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,960
Dad is finally back for a few days.

12
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,200
and he's going to work somewhere else.

13
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,440
As usual.

14
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,000
Sister.

15
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,680
Actually, since I was little,

16
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,320
since I was little.

17
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
But ever since

18
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,280
he's getting busier and busier,

19
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,560
the days we spent together

20
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,120
became less and less.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,480
I don't want my dad to work in other places.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,520
Because I think

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,920
our life is already very good.

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,320
And I have my parents

25
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,440
by my side.

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,520
I was really happy.

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,079
So I don't want him to go on a business trip.

28
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,960
I just want to get together with them

29
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,079
and enjoy the time together.

30
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,280
Sister.

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,280
I think you should understand your father.

32
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,000
He must want you

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
a better life.

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,360
I don't want you

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,360
after entering the society.

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,800
So,

37
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,200
when he settles down over there,

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,560
he will definitely

39
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,800
your whole family.

40
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,880
Then you can be reunited.

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,880
Right?

42
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,000
But sister,

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,360
If it were you,

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,320
what would you do?

45
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,480
I...

46
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,960
Don't ask me.

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,320
It's so late now.

48
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Why aren't you home?

49
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,360
your family will be worried.

50
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,400
So after eating this wonton,

51
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,480
go back now.

52
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,320
Sister,

53
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,880
you should cherish

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,480
your time with your family.

55
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
When you grow up,

56
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,760
you'll know how happy you are now.

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,360
Here, have a bowl of hot wonton.

58
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,360
Thank you.

59
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,240
Boss.

60
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,160
Through Hu Qiang,

61
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,519
we found dozens of cases

62
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,240
related to him.

63
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,000
He even got involved in other places.

64
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,120
What? Search all the records

65
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,000
in the past three years?

66
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,440
There's no clue.

67
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,400
Exactly.

68
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,440
Besides, land transport is stricter than water transport and sea transport.

69
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,000
The mainland is more rampant than the coast.

70
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,960
I don't understand.

71
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,159
What if it's a large car?

72
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,640
It's impossible.

73
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,280
A large car will be more strict.

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,080
Okay.

75
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,320
Okay.

76
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,520
Private car. Private car will be better.

77
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,560
It can't be a private car.

78
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,000
It's too big.

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,240
A private car can't do it.

80
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,960
There must be order and fixed personnel.

81
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,360
Only fixed cars can do it.

82
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,920
There are so many people and so many cars.

83
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,840
Is there a possibility

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,240
the drivers in these cars

85
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,400
have a normal identity.

86
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,800
Okay.

87
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,080
Thank you, sister. I'm going home.

88
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,480
Bye.

89
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,400
Bye.

90
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,000
Bye, sister.

91
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,640
Breaking news!

92
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,000
[A young girl was raped and abandoned in the wilderness.]

93
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,320
Extra! Extra!

94
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,840
A young girl in blossom was raped and abandoned in the wilderness.

95
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,200
Extra! Extra!

96
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,000
Flower season Girl!

97
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,680
Extra! Extra!

98
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,360
The girl in Flower was raped.

99
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,440
Extra! Extra!

100
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,640
A young girl in blossom was raped and abandoned in the wilderness.

101
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,760
Sir, a newspaper please.

102
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,840
Where is Zhou Mu?

103
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,800
Boss, he has a mission.

104
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,760
I've seen this girl.

105
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,040
Follow me.

106
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,520
When was the last time you saw her?

107
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,159
Here's the thing.

108
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Last night,

109
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,400
in an alley near Gyeonghwa Road

110
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,040
in a alley near Gyeonghwa Road.

111
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,680
I saw a girl next to me.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,120
was in a bad mood.

113
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,840
So I went to comfort her.

114
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,960
After we finished eating, she went home.

115
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,600
I saw her on a foreign car.

116
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,040
Here's your coffee.

117
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,160
I made it myself.

118
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,200
Boss.

119
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,480
Actually, I think Jinjing is a nice person.

120
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,400
Let her figure it out herself.

121
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,360
Shenhong Pawn Shop?

122
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,200
I have a request
