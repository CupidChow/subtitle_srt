1
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,681
Found you!

2
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,186
Hyung.

3
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:22,563
Why do you keep avoiding me?

4
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,068
Hyung.

5
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,945
Don't tell me you just used me and threw me away.

6
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:30,489
No! That night, we...

7
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,989
we only kissed!

8
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,409
So you do remember everything.

9
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,411
Don't you?

10
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,791
But Hyung...

11
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,541
you're pretty talented at running away.

12
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,670
How did we not run into each other even once?

13
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,545
All last week,

14
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,965
the one coming to our place...

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,009
That was you, right?

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,512
No.

17
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:56,056
Since that day,

18
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,682
I haven't been to your place once.

19
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,101
I thought you'd be uncomfortable.

20
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,478
Then...

21
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:04,313
who was that "friend"?

22
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,023
Ah.

23
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:08,025
But Hyung, don't you have anything to say?

24
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,195
Because I have a lot to say.

25
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,702
First of all, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,123
I was too drunk then.

27
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,791
I think I wasn't in my right mind.

28
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,585
I should have been more careful.

29
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:32,550
Anyway,

30
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,846
we were both really drunk that day.

31
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,304
I wasn't drunk.

32
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,061
Let's just pretend it never happened.

33
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,025
You're too young,

34
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,445
and you're my sister's friend.

35
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,364
It'll probably be hard to avoid seeing each other, so...

36
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,157
I don't want to.

37
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:57,826
What?

38
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,373
That was my first kiss.

39
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,168
If you just say we should pretend it never happened,

40
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,045
I guess that's easy for you.

41
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,048
I don't think it'll be easy for me.

42
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,097
You liked it too, Hyung.

43
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,018
And you were the one who started it.

44
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,730
I'm not...

45
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,398
into...

46
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,027
guys.

47
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,706
Is that really so important?

48
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,922
Fine.

49
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,257
Then let's pretend it never happened.

50
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,469
If we're done here,

51
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,264
I can go now, right?

52
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:38,342
Even after that, nothing changed between us.

53
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,684
Oh, hello.

54
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,601
Ah...

55
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:48,936
Is this your first time meeting?

56
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,231
Say hi, this is my friend, Yeon-woo.

57
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,400
Hello, I'm Seung-hyun's friend.

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,693
My name is Yeon-woo.

59
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,405
Ah, right.

60
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:06,371
Except for the fact that Yoon Eun-ho...

61
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,791
treated me like I was completely invisible.

62
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,769
So I did like him.

63
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,353
It was obvious to anyone.

64
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,731
Right.

65
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,025
This is for the best.

66
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,496
Are you coming home late today?

67
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,666
I'm going to work on my thesis a bit,

68
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,918
and then grab a drink before heading home.

69
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:55,336
Why?

70
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,755
Okay.

71
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:00,217
What?

72
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,927
I'm heading out.

73
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,510
See you later.

74
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:20,320
Ah...

75
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,655
My iPad.

76
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,914
Hey, Seung-jun.

77
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,668
Ah, I'm almost there, but

78
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,503
I forgot my iPad.

79
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,380
I'll be right back.

80
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,465
Five minutes, tops.

81
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,092
Alright.

82
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,677
So sorry.

83
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,438
Where is it?

84
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,081
Won Seung-hyun! My iPad...

85
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:21,588
S-sorry!

86
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,556
[Sister's unintentional coming out]

87
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:36,980
Since that day,

88
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,690
I haven't been to your place once.

89
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,405
Hey.

90
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:49,117
Stop being dramatic and look behind you.

91
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,534
Huh?

92
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,289
No, seriously, he's been staring only at you this whole time.

93
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,414
Do you know him?

94
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,096
Why is my luck so bad today? Seriously, please.

95
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:12,349
I asked if you know him.

96
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,311
The way he's looking at me is pissing me off.

97
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,646
No, I've never seen him before in my life.

98
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,315
I'm telling you, he's glaring at me like he wants to fight.

99
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,110
He's my sister's friend, my sister's friend.

100
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:26,403
Your sister? You mean Seung-hyun?

101
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:27,780
Yeah.

102
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,824
Then why is he looking at me like that? Huh?

103
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:32,369
If he's his friend's older brother,

104
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,119
he should be rushing over here, bowing his head,

105
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,621
and it still wouldn't be enough...

106
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,123
Hello.

107
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,295
Oh, hey...

108
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:45,382
So you're our Seung-hyun's friend?

109
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,510
If you're friends with Seung-hyun,

110
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,346
you're like a little brother to me.

111
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:54,056
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Seung-jun.

112
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:54,556
Ah!

113
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:56,643
Well, that's true, but with Suhyun-hyung...

114
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,476
Hey!

115
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,025
You and I need to talk for a sec.
