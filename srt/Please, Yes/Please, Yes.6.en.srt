1
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:11,594
Hyung, this isn't a dream, right?

2
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,867
Until you actually go through it,

3
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:36,036
you just don't know.

4
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,329
Why?

5
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,456
Who said that?

6
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,211
It's just one of those things.

7
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,798
What?

8
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,759
What's this? Suddenly so clingy.

9
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,387
What can I do if I like you?

10
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:54,972
Why?

11
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,722
You don't like this?

12
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:58,934
No.

13
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:00,644
I like it.

14
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,230
Me too.

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,318
Feels like a dream.

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,782
But...

17
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,827
why do you like me?

18
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,623
Just because.

19
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:25,001
I fell for you the moment I first saw you.

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,088
You were my ideal type.

21
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,213
Hyung.

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,340
The first time you saw me?

23
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,385
When was the first time we met?

24
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:37,431
Was it when you came to my place?

25
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,019
It wasn't then.

26
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,148
Then when was it?

27
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,490
The pasta...

28
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,329
...here you go.

29
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:05,876
Thank you.

30
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:27,355
Are you okay?

31
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:47,541
Yes.

32
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,753
Thank you.

33
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:03,934
I did that?

34
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:05,936
Yeah.

35
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,146
But after that, I didn't see you at all,

36
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:10,648
so I was giving up.

37
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:13,235
And then it turns out you're Won Seung-hyun's older brother.

38
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,030
So I just decided to go for it.

39
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:22,869
What a crazy coincidence.

40
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,835
It's fate.

41
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,777
But, is it okay for us to be like this?

42
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,155
Is Won Seung-hyun not coming?

43
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:01,157
It's fine.

44
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,492
She's probably coming home late today.

45
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,079
Well, that's a relief.

46
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,224
We should watch the movie.

47
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,769
Why are you only looking at me?

48
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:32,856
Okay.

49
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:36,525
Or not?

50
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:39,570
Did I read the signals wrong?

51
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,867
You didn't call me over to watch a movie today, did you?

52
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,036
Right?

53
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,121
Ah.

54
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,405
You said she wasn't coming today!

55
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,909
You, get in the room for a sec.

56
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,327
Get in the room!

57
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:37,628
Huh?

58
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,262
These shoes look really familiar.

59
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,309
You're back?

60
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,103
What?

61
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,480
Why did you snatch them so fast?

62
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,731
Did I come back too early?

63
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,483
You guys were having a good time,

64
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:00,527
did I interrupt?

65
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,195
No, no, really, it's not like that.

66
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:03,947
It's just...

67
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,864
he was just about to leave.

68
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:06,657
Hmm...

69
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,117
So he's still inside, right?

70
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,286
I'll just say hi.

71
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:10,996
Ah, wait!

72
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,246
No, no, you really can't.

73
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,291
Why not?

74
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,710
I just want to say hi to my brother's girlfriend.

75
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,045
It's just that...

76
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,838
she's really shy.

77
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,798
Later...

78
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:24,800
I'll introduce you guys properly later.

79
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,552
Alright...

80
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:28,554
You thought I'd fall for that!

81
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:29,306
Hey!

82
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:31,181
Wait!
