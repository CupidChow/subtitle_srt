1
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:05,547
What's this?

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,306
Hey.

3
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,309
Don't tell me you were watching porn by yourself?

4
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,811
P-porn?

5
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:24,148
Oh, right, right. I was watching porn.

6
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:26,652
Ah, shit, so gross.

7
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,487
Why are you saying that so proudly?

8
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:31,280
You're disgusting.

9
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,342
In that tiny space,

10
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,969
you've been like that this whole time?

11
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,347
Hyung.

12
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,641
I feel like I'm going to die.

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,735
Can't we just tell her?

14
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,992
It's not like we're doing anything wrong.

15
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:18,077
She said she already knows

16
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,663
that you like guys.

17
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,541
Still...

18
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,085
Still, just wait a little longer.

19
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,963
I'm just not mentally ready.

20
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,967
Then...

21
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,302
are we going to keep it a secret forever?

22
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:37,097
Us dating?

23
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,807
Let's just do that for a while.

24
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:41,476
Okay?

25
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:47,648
Of course, a secret relationship is thrilling and all, but...

26
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,864
I kind of...

27
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,949
want to show you off.

28
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,463
Hey.

29
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,215
Seunghyun is outside.

30
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,137
I locked the door earlier.

31
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,309
You, really...

32
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,021
I can't win against you.

33
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,079
What? Where are you going at this hour?

34
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:43,829
Oh, I'm just...

35
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,123
going to meet someone right out front.

36
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,835
Don't tell me it's that person from before?

37
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,672
I'll be right back.

38
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,507
Why come back?

39
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,550
You should go sleep with him and then come back.

40
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:00,639
The one I managed to hook...

41
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,224
is your friend.

42
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:20,826
What are you doing here this late at night?

43
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,161
Because I missed you, of course.

44
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:24,913
But,

45
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,706
what excuse did you use to get out today?

46
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,706
To Won Seunghyun.

47
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,668
Well...

48
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,795
She told me not to even bother coming home,

49
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,173
and to just knock you over.

50
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:38,050
Knock me over?

51
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,969
Who?

52
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:39,844
Me?

53
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:41,179
Yeah.

54
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,056
She told me not to come home.

55
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,891
So...

56
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:46,893
Should we stay out all night?

57
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:51,021
You cheeky little punk.

58
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,733
So you don't like it?

59
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:55,318
No.

60
00:03:58,822 --> 00:03:59,780
I love it.

61
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:02,742
Me too.

62
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,577
I love it.

63
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:28,143
What is it?

64
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,226
Why are you so startled?

65
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:30,436
Ah...

66
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,271
A bug just landed on my hand.

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,148
A bug?

68
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,983
There's a bug in our house?

69
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,068
Where? Where is it?

70
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,153
Oh, there it is! Over there, there, there!

71
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,340
Hey, be honest with me.

72
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:01,550
You got a girlfriend, didn't you?

73
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,762
N-no.

74
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,391
No way. That smile is definitely for a girl.

75
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:11,019
My intuition is never wrong.

76
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,811
I'm telling you, it's not true.

77
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,813
Just drink up.

78
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:23,739
Huh?

79
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:24,949
Look who it is!

80
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,701
Isn't this our Seunghyun's friend?

81
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:28,411
Hello.

82
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,956
What a coincidence meeting you all here.

83
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,581
Hey, have a drink with us.

84
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,005
I had no idea that Seunghyun

85
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,675
had such a handsome friend.

86
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,135
And he's a junior from our university, too.

87
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,097
I can't believe I didn't know.

88
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,184
I was a pretty quiet student.

89
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,981
So, do you have a girlfriend?

90
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,985
If not!

91
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,237
How about you hang out with this hyung sometimes?

92
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,364
Ah, come on~

93
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,824
If you have a handsome guy in the group,

94
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,117
the girls really...

95
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,286
Hey!

96
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:13,248
Ah, I'm seeing someone.

97
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:15,625
Ah...

98
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,543
Of course, you are.

99
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,684
This is how you do it, right?

100
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,894
A secret relationship.

101
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,815
I don't want you to be uncomfortable either.

102
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:44,320
But...

103
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,489
this is actually kind of thrilling. I like it.

104
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:51,827
Ah...

105
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:54,079
So he has a girlfriend too.

106
00:06:56,373 --> 00:06:58,918
If you ever break up with her,

107
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,210
let me know.

108
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,295
I'll set you up

109
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,922
on a killer blind date.

110
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,132
Hey!

111
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:06,342
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

112
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,344
Huh?

113
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,224
He's dating me.

114
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:15,476
Eunho...

115
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,061
Huh?
