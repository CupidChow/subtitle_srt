1
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:05,964
Just...

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,383
Go back and tell him.

3
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,512
That you were joking.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,019
Then he'll definitely believe you.

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,272
No.

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,483
It was something I had to say eventually.

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,653
It's not like I could keep it a secret forever.

8
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:31,781
Ah, but still...

9
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,453
I told you I'm not good at lying.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,457
Let's stop this now.

11
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:41,958
What?

12
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,003
The secret relationship.

13
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,089
Ah, seriously.

14
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,593
It's thrilling, but...

15
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,928
isn't it too frustrating?

16
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,597
Right?

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,401
Hey.

18
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,530
Sit down.

19
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,657
I have something to tell you.

20
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,868
What is it?

21
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,954
Why are you setting such a serious mood?

22
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,882
I think it's time I told you too.

23
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,426
So, what is it?

24
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,596
Well...

25
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,432
I mean...

26
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,894
Ah, forget it.

27
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,187
I'll ask you first.

28
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,023
The person you're seeing...

29
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,401
It's Yoon Eun-ho!

30
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:51,820
Huh?

31
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,738
It is, right? Huh?

32
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,031
Well...

33
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:55,949
Wh-what?

34
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,242
How did you know?

35
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,036
I told you, my intuition is never wrong.

36
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,413
I can tell just by looking.

37
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,891
I've seen those shoes somewhere before.

38
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,033
Aren't these Yoon Eun-ho's?

39
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,038
No way.

40
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,182
Why are you so surprised?

41
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,309
A bug just landed on the back of my hand.

42
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,185
A bug?

43
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,728
There's a bug in our house?

44
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:07,896
Oh, there it is!

45
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,688
Over there, there, there!

46
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,480
Where?

47
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,317
Where?

48
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,735
You're dead!

49
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,778
Where's the bug spray?

50
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,532
Huh? Where is it?

51
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:23,912
Are you happy?

52
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,749
So?

53
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,043
Did you succeed in getting him into bed?

54
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,171
What am I...

55
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,798
Hey, you're a real cradle robber, huh?

56
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,717
How could you date someone five years younger?

57
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:38,968
Well, of course, he was the one who...

58
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,803
seemed to like me first, but still.

59
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,474
Hey.

60
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,017
I'm telling you this in advance.

61
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,728
Tell him not to come to me later

62
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,687
for relationship advice or anything like that.

63
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,356
Tell him not to even think about it.

64
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,359
Okay?

65
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,367
[What are you doing? Wanna get a drink?]

66
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,963
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,007
That...

68
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,010
Huh?

69
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,721
Sorry.

70
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,933
For what?

71
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,645
For saying I'd set him up with a girl.

72
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,147
You're angry because of that, aren't you?

73
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,191
What?

74
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,526
Me?

75
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,278
No?

76
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,114
Is that why you weren't answering your phone?

77
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,284
No, I was just...

78
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,327
I was worried you'd feel uncomfortable.

79
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,788
What is there for me to feel uncomfortable about?

80
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:54,168
You said kissing a guy was a bit weird.

81
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,339
Ah, that just meant I don't want to do it.

82
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,091
I, Lee Seung-jun, am not that

83
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,218
prejudiced of a person.

84
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,350
But...

85
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,602
Does he not have any pretty girl friends?

86
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,731
Ah, you know what they say, birds of a feather flock together.

87
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,607
Next to a handsome guy,

88
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,526
there are always pretty girls.

89
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,236
Alright.

90
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,197
I'll ask him.

91
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,241
Nice.

92
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:30,455
So, should I call him "hyung-su-nim"?

93
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,956
Or "hyung-bu"?

94
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,250
Ah, both are a bit cringey.

95
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,632
And so, the secret relationship ended,

96
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,346
and a relationship that was almost like living together began.

97
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,147
Ah, why?

98
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,106
Mmm.

99
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,111
Are you two lovebugs?

100
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,988
Just because he's outed, he thinks he owns the place.

101
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,531
Why?

102
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,532
Can't I?

103
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,785
Yeah, you can't.

104
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,203
Get out, okay?

105
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,454
Scram.

106
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,331
Yeon-woo is coming over today.

107
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,124
So both of you need to clear out.

108
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,543
I don't want to. You get out.

109
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,128
I said get out.

110
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,299
If you don't, should I just call her over? Huh?

111
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,051
Do whatever you want.

112
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,135
Suit yourself.

113
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,679
He must be crazy.

114
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,855
With us,

115
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,274
and Won Seung-hyun...

116
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,154
Be quiet.

117
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,072
Quiet.

118
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,865
I can't see.

119
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,495
I can't see, I can't see.

120
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,830
Hello?

121
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,331
Oh, Mom, what's up?

122
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,667
I'm watching a movie right now.

123
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,628
Huh?

124
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:01,879
Now?

125
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,262
Why, what is it?

126
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,556
Mom is coming over.

127
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,640
Really?

128
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:13,933
When?

129
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,518
Now.

130
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,520
She says she just arrived downstairs with side dish containers.

131
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:18,855
What do we do?

132
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:21,649
What do we do?

133
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,525
Ah, I don't know.

134
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,069
Wait, calm down.

135
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,905
I have an idea.

136
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,247
Hello, I'm...

137
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,623
Seung-hyun's boyfriend,

138
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,333
Yoon Eun-ho.

139
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,338
Mom...

140
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,965
This is my girlfriend...

141
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,841
Park...

142
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,508
Ah...

143
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,136
My name is Kim Yeon-woo.

144
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,396
I still feel weird.

145
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,190
Why?

146
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,609
Introducing myself

147
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,903
as Won Seung-hyun's boyfriend...

148
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,113
Ah, seriously...

149
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,370
That's why

150
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,247
I can sleep with you like this.

151
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,476
And that's why

152
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,938
we can do naughty things like this.

153
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,190
Isn't that right?
