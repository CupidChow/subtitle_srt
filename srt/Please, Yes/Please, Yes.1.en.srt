1
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:08,925
Hyung.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,594
This isn't a dream, right?

3
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,146
How did...

4
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:23,565
we end up like this?

5
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,048
Hey, Won Seung-hyun!

6
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,132
Can we try living with a little common courtesy?

7
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,344
How long are you gonna be so loud!

8
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,480
I've been living in Seoul for six years.

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,983
And living with my flesh and blood for six months.

10
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,860
My patience is starting to wear thin.

11
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,829
Won Seung-hyun, that's enough.

12
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,539
I might just kick you out.

13
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,333
Did Mom pay the deposit for this place, or did you?

14
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,418
All you do is chip in a little extra

15
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,753
for the maintenance fee.

16
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,045
Don't act so high and mighty.

17
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,340
To your sister who's five years younger.

18
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,134
Hey!

19
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,760
You think the maintenance fee is nothing?

20
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,429
If the housing prices in Seoul were just a little cheaper,

21
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,014
I wouldn't be living with you.

22
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,143
It's just money! I can pay you back later!

23
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,394
I'll pay it back! Okay?

24
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,353
Hey!

25
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,690
Ugh, fine, I get it!

26
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,358
What the hell? Don't yell in front of my friend.

27
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,027
Stop making a scene and go inside.

28
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,155
Just be quiet, okay? Just be quiet.

29
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:15,552
Wait, is that the older brother you mentioned before?

30
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,512
Huh? Oh, yeah.

31
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,972
Why? You know him?

32
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,016
No.

33
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,978
It's not that I know him.

34
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:41,433
[Eunyoung] been thinking a lot. this isn't working.
do u even like me? every time we meet it's like...

35
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:52,505
What happened to you saying platonic was fine?

36
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,228
What's wrong?

37
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,188
Why the long face?

38
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,815
Don't tell me it's because we fought earlier.

39
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,025
It's not that.

40
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,527
Then what?

41
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,778
No way, did you get dumped again?

42
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:28,500
Hyung.

43
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,670
So, does that mean you're single right now?

44
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,222
What?

45
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:44,766
Hello.

46
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,894
Sorry for being so loud earlier.

47
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,398
Ah, I'm Eun-ho. Yoon Eun-ho.

48
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,442
Oh... uh, right.

49
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,818
Hyung.

50
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,612
Is it okay if I come hang out here often?

51
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,824
Hey, why are you asking him for permission?

52
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,117
I'm an owner of this house too.

53
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,534
You can just ask me.

54
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,704
Can I?

55
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,083
This is a lot.

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,251
I should say no.

57
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:17,173
Uh, uh... whatever.

58
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,597
I'm screwed.

59
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,159
My sister's friend started showing up at my place like it's his own.

60
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,289
Hi, Hyung.

61
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:51,416
What are you up to, Hyung?

62
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,668
Are you busy, Hyung?

63
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:58,757
At this point, is he even coming to see Seung-hyun,

64
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,132
or is he coming to see me?

65
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,010
And for some reason,

66
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,596
he's suspiciously interested in me.

67
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,264
Hyung.

68
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,184
Did you eat?

69
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,271
Ah... no.

70
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:16,148
Aren't you hungry?

71
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,400
What do you want to eat?

72
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:18,985
My treat.

73
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:24,157
Do I look like I can't afford my own meals?

74
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,077
Oh? Hyung.

75
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,621
Hello.

76
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,628
Ah, Won Seung-hyun just went to the convenience store.

77
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,836
To get some snacks.

78
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,838
Oh, really?

79
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,969
Hyung, did you put on lip balm today?

80
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,396
Ah, I'm just pretty observant.

81
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:57,565
Do people normally pay this much attention

82
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,275
to their friend's brother?

83
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,824
But Hyung, where are you going?

84
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,909
Ah, it's nothing like that.

85
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,786
Perfect.

86
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:12,746
Then sit here for a bit before you go.

87
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,581
I'm so bored right now.

88
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,043
Ah, should I?

89
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:31,682
Hyung!

90
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,309
Yeah?

91
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,684
Hyung, have you seen this?

92
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,440
It's super popular these days. What do you think?

93
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,690
Looks delicious, right?

94
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,693
Uh... I guess so.

95
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:48,657
The smell of fabric softener.

96
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,869
Wanna go eat this together?

97
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:54,621
Just you and me?

98
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,081
Yeah.

99
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,500
No reason we can't, right?

100
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,960
I'm down for it...

101
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,295
You don't want to, Hyung?

102
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,505
No, it's not that.

103
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,050
Yes!

104
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,219
Look, this one here and...

105
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:11,139
I feel like I keep getting dragged into this.

106
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,141
By a kid who's five years younger than me.
