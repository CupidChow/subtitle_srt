1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,342
No, just listen.

2
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:12,137
Is this considered flirting?

3
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,155
Why? What?

4
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,451
You have something in your hair.

5
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,248
I mean, maybe there really was

6
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,501
something in my hair, right?

7
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:44,961
Hyung.

8
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,090
Are you busy?

9
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,557
Hyung, I heard you like the bread from here.

10
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,184
Won Seung-hyun told me.

11
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,313
I was buying some anyway and thought of you, so I bought you one too.

12
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:08,943
Oh, uh-huh.

13
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:12,114
Maybe he just felt weird coming home

14
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,032
empty-handed.

15
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,284
Whoa, so cute, look at this.

16
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,099
Okay, this is a little weird.

17
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,028
Wow...

18
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,322
Hyung, what's with those veins?

19
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,909
Huh?

20
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,369
Do you work out?

21
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:01,579
Yeah.

22
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:11,088
Your fingers are really long, too.

23
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,467
Uh, thanks.

24
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:18,764
Okay, this is f*cking weird.

25
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,563
Hey, but I'm jealous.

26
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,652
When will a girl ever flirt with me?

27
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,199
It's not a girl, it's a guy.

28
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:42,829
This kid is surprisingly popular, I'm telling you.

29
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:47,958
Anyway, it's just... a bit much.

30
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:52,422
Even the way he touches me is so slick.

31
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,382
We're not even friends.

32
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,760
He keeps being all friendly...

33
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,012
acting all close.

34
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,597
He's a really weird kid.

35
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,434
Okay, so let me get this straight.

36
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,603
He's your friend's friend,

37
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,230
but he keeps trying to get close,

38
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,438
and it's weirding you out?

39
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,023
Right.

40
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,902
Well then, when he does that,

41
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,445
is it awkward for you, or do you just plain hate it?

42
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,032
I mean, you normally hate skinship, right?

43
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,036
But just from listening to you talk,

44
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,789
it doesn't really sound like you hate it.

45
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,585
Why, back then with... uh...

46
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:34,422
Yoon-jung? Eun-jin?

47
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:36,882
Eun-young.

48
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:37,925
Ah, right.

49
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:39,260
It's different from when you talked about Eun-young.

50
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,387
Ugh! Is there really anything to talk about?

51
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,097
It is what it is.

52
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:43,974
It's just...

53
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,855
Now that I think about it, I guess I didn't hate it.

54
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,400
Your fingers are really long, too.

55
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,902
Uh, oh, thanks.

56
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:01,282
Hyung.

57
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:07,079
Your ears are red now, too.

58
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:22,637
Then...

59
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,681
why is it that whenever he does that,

60
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:26,349
I just freeze up?

61
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,153
What is it?

62
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,989
What's with the sigh the second you see me?

63
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,824
It's nothing.

64
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:53,293
My sister's friend, who used to visit all the time,

65
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,085
has vanished.

66
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,545
Overnight.

67
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,673
Well,

68
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,844
it's probably for the best.

69
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,681
I don't care at all.

70
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:10,309
Not one bit.

71
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:24,657
Hey.

72
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:25,992
Yeah?

73
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:27,994
That kid...

74
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,079
Is he not coming today?

75
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,039
Who?

76
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,708
You know...

77
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,380
The one who used to come over all the time.

78
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,673
Ah...

79
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,050
Eun-ho?

80
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,052
I told him not to come.

81
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,387
What? Why?

82
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,349
You hate it when I bring people over.

83
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,768
Every time he came, your face would totally harden.

84
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:53,978
So I told him not to come anymore.

85
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,355
That you don't like him.

86
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:58,148
Why would you do that?

87
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,068
I'm fine with it.

88
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,778
What are you talking about? You think I don't know you?

89
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,824
You don't know me at all.

90
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,659
You don't know anything.

91
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:10,744
And besides, who are you to talk to your older brother like that?

92
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,579
Where are your manners?

93
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,295
What's with him?

94
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,177
Seriously...

95
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,681
Just because she said that once,

96
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:32,099
he's really not coming?

97
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:51,452
Whatever.

98
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,788
Like I care.

99
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,980
So that's why.

100
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,983
Of course.

101
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,695
He's handsome and has a decent personality.

102
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,114
No way he wouldn't have a girlfriend.

103
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,739
Seung-hyun isn't home.

104
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,701
I know.

105
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,287
He's not coming, even if you wait.

106
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,207
He's sleeping out tonight.

107
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,795
I came to see you, Hyung.

108
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,338
Me?

109
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,882
That girl from before was just...

110
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:29,926
Forget it.

111
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,346
I'm not that curious.

112
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,228
Hyung, were you drinking?

113
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,854
Yeah.

114
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,565
Then let me drink with you.

115
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:47,318
No thanks.

116
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:50,195
What's a kid like you doing drinking?

117
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,407
I'm not a kid.

118
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,284
I can probably hold my liquor better than you, Hyung.

119
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,631
Can I come in?

120
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,975
Cheers.

121
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:24,771
I can't drink anymore.

122
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,444
Then I guess I win.

123
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,489
This...

124
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,658
This was unfair from the start.

125
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,871
I'm five years older than you.

126
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:42,916
Earlier you were saying you can't drink with a kid.

127
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,208
Jeez.

128
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,170
And besides,

129
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:50,631
before you even got here, I had already

130
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,759
been drinking a lot.

131
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,469
You know that?

132
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,429
Yes.

133
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,599
Then next time, let's have a proper drinking match.

134
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,016
Just the two of us.

135
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,810
No thanks.

136
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,814
Such a smooth-talking kid.

137
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,068
I'm not a kid.

138
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,029
Yes, you are.

139
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,615
You're a kid.

140
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,286
I'm serious.

141
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:23,081
Should I prove it to you?

142
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,377
How are you gonna prove it?

143
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:59,701
Never mind.

144
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,868
What am I doing with a drunk person...

145
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,445
You started it, Hyung.
