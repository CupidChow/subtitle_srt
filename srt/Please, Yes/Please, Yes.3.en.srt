1
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:22,940
Ugh, I'm gonna die.

2
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,277
How much did I drink yesterday?

3
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,161
What's this?

4
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,039
Who is this?

5
00:00:45,507 --> 00:00:48,573
Eunho: Feeling alright?

6
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,469
"You started it, Hyung?"

7
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,945
You've lost your mind, Won Seung-hyun.

8
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,280
You've actually lost it.

9
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,454
What did you do with that kid?

10
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:23,416
It never happened.

11
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,418
First,

12
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,838
since I was drunk, I'll pretend I don't remember.

13
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,130
I'll act like I have no idea.

14
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,923
That should work.

15
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,068
Hey.

16
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:53,822
I have a friend coming over tonight.

17
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,032
Can you just get out for a bit?

18
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,244
Would be great if you came back later.

19
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:01,621
I'll give you 50,000 won.

20
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,583
But make sure you text me before you come home.

21
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,501
Wait a sec.

22
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:08,045
A friend?

23
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,128
Yeah.

24
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,797
So just get out for a while.

25
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,050
Did you sleep well, Hyung?

26
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,594
Why aren't you answering my texts?

27
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:23,184
No, no, I don't need the money.

28
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,101
I'm leaving.

29
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:25,896
I was going to leave anyway.

30
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,981
I can come back tomorrow if you need me to.

31
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:30,942
Just have fun, okay? Relax.

32
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,360
Alright?

33
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,161
Did he eat something weird?

34
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,670
What's the special occasion? A cafe instead of a bar today?

35
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,588
Ah.

36
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,050
Well, I have some homework to do,

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,885
and I need to work on my thesis.

38
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:00,137
We're graduating soon, you know.

39
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,014
Yeah, but since when

40
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:04,434
do we ever meet up to study?

41
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,525
Just from your expression right now,

42
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,777
it looks like you need to crack open a bottle of soju.

43
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,447
Why the long face?

44
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,911
Well...

45
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:26,164
A friend of mine...

46
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,376
apparently kissed someone

47
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,711
five whole years younger.

48
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,300
It wasn't on purpose or anything.

49
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,012
By mistake, 'cause they were drunk?

50
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:45,016
Does kissing someone "by mistake" even make sense?

51
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,688
Well, he was so wasted he couldn't think straight.

52
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:51,773
So it could happen.

53
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:54,108
Anyway,

54
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,902
he said he's been desperately avoiding their calls.

55
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,197
He has no idea what to do with the kid.

56
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,909
Okay, let me get this straight.

57
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,619
You got completely wasted,

58
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,371
and by mistake, with someone five years younger,

59
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,664
you kissed them,

60
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,456
and now you don't know what to do,

61
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:10,458
so you're avoiding them.

62
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:11,793
Is that it?

63
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,710
Exactly.

64
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:16,088
No, no, it's...

65
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,757
It's not my story.

66
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:18,884
Whatever.

67
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,969
But it's just one kiss.

68
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,679
It's not like you have to take responsibility for anything.

69
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,139
What's the big deal?

70
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,182
Did you sleep with him?

71
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,394
No, of course not!

72
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,896
Okay.

73
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,606
I mean, kissing someone five years younger,

74
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,317
a twenty-year-old at that,

75
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,068
and then ghosting them...

76
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,570
is kind of a dick move, not gonna lie.

77
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,449
It might have really hurt him.

78
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,494
It might have been his first kiss.

79
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:50,248
You might have been his first love.

80
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,835
Ah, but what can you do?

81
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:56,378
Hey, if you have no intention of dating him

82
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:57,880
and you're just not feeling it,

83
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,590
ending it early

84
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,760
makes you slightly less of a trash bag.

85
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:07,891
So, I'm officially a trash bag either way?

86
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,851
Pretty much.

87
00:05:12,686 --> 00:05:13,563
Hey, but...

88
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,148
the skinship with him must have been pretty okay, huh?

89
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,985
At this point, don't you have a crush on him too?

90
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,155
What?

91
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,157
Wait, isn't this the same guy

92
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:26,617
we talked about last time?

93
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:28,452
No, no.

94
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:29,829
I told you, it's not about me!

95
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,166
Sure, whatever you say.

96
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:38,963
Hey.

97
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,840
But you...

98
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,512
If you kissed a guy...

99
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,931
how do you think it would feel?

100
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,561
Don't tell me the person you kissed

101
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,646
is a guy.

102
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,817
No, this is seriously not it.

103
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,860
I was just suddenly curious, so I asked.

104
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,362
Suddenly curious.

105
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,532
I don't know.

106
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,286
I've never really thought about it.

107
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:12,289
Ugh, that's a little weird.

108
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,916
Ugh!

109
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,085
Yeah, I don't think I could do it.

110
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,420
Ew.

111
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,755
Right.

112
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,717
He's a guy,

113
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,219
and I'm a guy too.

114
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,221
Twenty years old.

115
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,556
But...

116
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,766
was it really his first time?

117
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,568
I think he was a little clumsy.

118
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,989
But it felt good.

119
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,800
A week has passed since that night.

120
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:11,722
Thanks to my diligent efforts to avoid him,

121
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,391
we haven't run into each other once.

122
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,023
Maybe,

123
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,527
I can just let this fade away

124
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,987
and it'll be possible.

125
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:44,338
Found you.

126
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,048
Hyung.

127
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,467
Why do you keep avoiding me?

128
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,514
Hyung...

129
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,431
Don't tell me you just used me and threw me away.

130
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,184
No! That night, we...

131
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,684
we only kissed.

132
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,188
I knew you remembered everything.

133
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:02,398
Right?
