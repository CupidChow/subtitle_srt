1
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:06,548
What's your deal?

2
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:10,719
What about it?

3
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,931
You were doing a great job pretending I was invisible until now.

4
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:16,391
Why are you acting like this?

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,228
I was just trying not to make you uncomfortable.

6
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,271
Then what about just now?

7
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:23,773
Why did you do that?

8
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,235
That was...

9
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,487
because I was jealous.

10
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:30,197
What?

11
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:35,661
You rejected me, saying you're not into guys,

12
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,079
but then you were standing next to that dude, smiling.

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,956
I said I did it because I was jealous.

14
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,333
Hey, he's just a friend...

15
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,085
I know.

16
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,545
I know that too.

17
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,465
But I was jealous.

18
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,050
Because I like you, Hyung.

19
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:52,677
What?

20
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:57,056
Why are you so surprised?

21
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,768
You knew it all along.

22
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,733
Do you go around kissing people you don't even like?

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,735
I'm not an idiot.

24
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:11,737
That thing I said...

25
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:13,114
you said that for me to hear, didn't you?

26
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,659
Anyway...

27
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,327
as the one who got rejected,

28
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:20,121
I need some time to get over it.

29
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,916
Unlike some people, I'm still just a kid.

30
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:27,503
And in a situation where I've been dumped,

31
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:29,715
if I see something like that, I just...

32
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,304
I can't control myself.

33
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,108
I'll head in first.

34
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,735
Take your time coming in.

35
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,280
And get home safe.

36
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:11,923
What was that?

37
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,300
You guys left looking like you were about to kill each other.

38
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,384
Did you get into a fight?

39
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:29,483
That kid's been acting weird all day.

40
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:53,340
You're back?

41
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,132
Ah! You scared me.

42
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,472
Hey.

43
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,184
Wanna grab a drink?

44
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:21,742
Say it.

45
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:23,452
I'm ready to hear it.

46
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,704
Hear what?

47
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,166
Whatever it is.

48
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,675
From now on...

49
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:40,262
at least lock your door when you do that.

50
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,181
That level of privacy...

51
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,432
I really didn't need to see it.

52
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,186
Is that all?

53
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:52,898
What else?

54
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,070
Should I ask why you were doing that with a girl, or...

55
00:03:58,362 --> 00:03:59,197
I don't know...

56
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,449
if you like girls or something?

57
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,998
I'm not curious at all.

58
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,541
Ah, but you guys are dating, right?

59
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,333
Are you crazy?!

60
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,085
You think I'd bring her home

61
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,586
and do that if we weren't even dating?

62
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,425
What about you?

63
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,050
Anything new with you lately?

64
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:25,222
But what if...

65
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,849
Yeah.

66
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,271
What if...

67
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,440
logically speaking,

68
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:35,400
it was someone you shouldn't be with?

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,318
What would you do?

70
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,695
Why shouldn't you be with them,

71
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,112
logically speaking?

72
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,032
Well...

73
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,327
there's a big age gap.

74
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,746
What, like a twelve-year difference or more?

75
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:49,914
It's not that big.

76
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,291
Then what's the problem?

77
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,791
Is there more?

78
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,547
He's the friend of someone really close.

79
00:04:57,838 --> 00:04:58,715
Hmm...

80
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,257
Is he someone close's current partner

81
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:01,509
or ex?

82
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,802
No, not that either.

83
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:04,971
Then it's fine.

84
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:06,472
Is there more?

85
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:09,893
Well...

86
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,101
the gender.

87
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,898
Then what if, for you,

88
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,025
you suddenly become attracted to guys?

89
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,070
What kind of hypothetical is that?

90
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,820
If I'm attracted to them, I'd just date them.

91
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,614
Just like that?

92
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:24,824
Without any...

93
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,201
doubts or considerations?

94
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,202
Yeah.

95
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,911
If you're attracted to them, what's the problem?

96
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,789
Right.

97
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,331
That's true.

98
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,668
The person you like...

99
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,503
is it a guy?

100
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,295
No, it's not like I like him.

101
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:39,380
What do you mean, "it's not"?

102
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,757
It totally is.

103
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,634
Don't lie.

104
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,717
Hey.

105
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:47,764
If you want to date him, just do it.

106
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,599
You'll only know if you try.

107
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:51,726
Are you gonna marry him the second you start dating?

108
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,894
Or move in with him?

109
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:53,561
No, right?

110
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,563
You'll only know if you try.

111
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,110
Am I supposed to live like this forever?

112
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,030
This is so frustrating.

113
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,500
Where are you going all of a sudden? At this hour?

114
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,461
Just for a sec...

115
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,298
to meet someone.

116
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,967
You're going like that?

117
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,302
Shouldn't you at least put something

118
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,594
on your face?

119
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,806
What, you gonna confess with that pale face?

120
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:31,807
Hey.

121
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:33,309
Do whatever you want.

122
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,273
I'll make myself scarce for you tonight, as a special favor.

123
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,483
Good luck.

124
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,164
Why did you call me?

125
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,876
How did you even memorize my number?

126
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,257
Didn't you delete it without saving?

127
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,552
How could I forget it?

128
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,893
But if you keep calling me out like this in the middle of the night,

129
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,394
I'm going to get the wrong idea.

130
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,731
I'm not a scumbag.

131
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,152
Who said you were?

132
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,528
And...

133
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,989
I'm not an adult either.

134
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:29,949
Huh?

135
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,577
I mean, I also...

136
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:36,706
don't kiss people I don't have feelings for.

137
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:39,416
And I don't forget that easily.

138
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,835
What...

139
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:43,128
does that mean?

140
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,840
It's not the wrong idea.

141
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,677
I like you.

142
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,559
I'm saying I like you.
