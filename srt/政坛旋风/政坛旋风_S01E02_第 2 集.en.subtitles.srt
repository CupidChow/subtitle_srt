1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,803
Attention!

2
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:13,430
SEOUL AIR BASE / THREE MONTHS AGO

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,848
Stand at ease!

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,732
He won't run off.

5
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:28,278
He won't destroy evidence either.
Please stop the investigation into Seo.

6
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,655
The public view on the bribery
of a lawmaker is unfavorable.

7
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,241
It's fabricated,
and this is a political retaliation.

8
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:36,995
The prosecution will investigate,
and the court will judge him.

9
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,040
In Korea,
the separation of powers is in place.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,624
Mr. President!

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:46,004
He flew over ten hours
after addressing the UN General Assembly.

12
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:50,633
Mr. Prime Minister,
please let him rest for the day.

13
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,218
This way.

14
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,349
Join us if you want to save your friend.

15
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,393
I know it takes time

16
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,353
to abandon your pride.

17
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,148
How far are you taking this?

18
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,695
One step farther than you.

19
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,413
Call Seo Gi-tae and ask him
to come to my residence immediately.

20
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,333
And tell him to bring all the evidence.

21
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,794
My brother…

22
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,343
Assemblyman Seo is…

23
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,518
dead, sir.

24
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:55,907
They assume

25
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,159
he took his own life.

26
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,637
ASSEMBLYMAN SEO'S FUNERAL

27
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,485
THE LATE SEO GI-TAE

28
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,324
I went to the United States for a summit

29
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,076
and gave a speech at the UN.

30
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,496
You said you would put a gag
in Seo Gi-tae's mouth

31
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,209
while I had the eyes of the world
focused on me, didn't you?

32
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,128
How dare you kill him!

33
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,381
With all due respect, sir,

34
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,009
are you, by any chance,

35
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,969
reprimanding me?

36
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:45,433
You were the one who asked me
to take part in this, Mr. President.

37
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,109
PRIME MINISTER PARK DONG-HO

38
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,653
I did the dirty work.

39
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,655
You should clean up the mess.

40
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,379
Dong-ho,

41
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,340
this isn't what I intended to happen.

42
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,218
I am really sorry.

43
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,886
How could this be?

44
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,514
My friend,
who deserves an apology, is dead.

45
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,932
Come and see me.

46
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,475
Let's have a chat first.

47
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,311
As president,
you did something you shouldn't have,

48
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,231
so I will do what I must
as prime minister.

49
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,277
Just you wait, sir.

50
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,072
Your days in the Blue House are numbered.

51
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,573
THE WHIRLWIND

52
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:29,078
EPISODE 2

53
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,011
Madam Deputy Prime Minister!

54
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,473
You are hereby relieved of your duties.

55
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,563
That is--

56
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,733
The president's appointing authority
takes effect immediately.

57
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,402
Only State Council members
may attend meetings.

58
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,906
Please leave so our meeting can proceed.

59
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,408
Escort her to her residence.

60
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,035
With respect.

61
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,681
What is it?

62
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,810
Ma'am, it seems like someone tried
to assassinate the president.

63
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,150
Krokodil and methamphetamine
were detected in the president's blood.

64
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,403
Those drugs dramatically increase
blood flow through the heart.

65
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,447
Someone must have brought them in
from the outside.

66
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,825
The Presidential Security Service inspects
the president's meals and medicines,

67
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,453
which are managed by
the personal secretary to the president.

68
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,040
An outsider couldn't have pulled it off.

69
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,388
The data from the hospital's network.

70
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,016
I had it cross-checked by an insider.

71
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,894
Someone close to the president

72
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,480
who's desperate enough to do this…

73
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,981
Only one person fits the bill.

74
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,151
Park Dong-ho.

75
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,298
Sir!

76
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,846
KANG BYEONG-OH / BRIGADIER GENERAL
AT ARMED FORCES CAPITAL HOSPITAL

77
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,764
Who are you?

78
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,735
On the night of October 26, 1979,

79
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:51,781
the president at the time was assassinated
in a Gungjeongdong safe house,

80
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,700
and six men were sentenced to death.

81
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:57,954
By the way,

82
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,250
where does a rifleman aim
to shoot a soldier to death?

83
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,086
The forehead or…

84
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,172
the heart?

85
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,344
Tell me.

86
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,473
Have any of our other presidents
been assassinated…

87
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:20,893
since then?

88
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,112
I will appoint the head
of the Seoul Central DPO.

89
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,155
Call Prosecutor Lee Jang-seok.

90
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,198
Yes, sir.

91
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,497
You will face severe backlash.
The prosecution values seniority and rank.

92
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,624
Appointing Lee to that position--

93
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,502
I will destroy seniority
and disregard ranks.

94
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,799
Is that all?

95
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,642
Everything
the prosecution tries to protect,

96
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,103
I will crush.

97
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,397
This all happened…

98
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,817
because everything…

99
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,946
that was supposed to collapse

100
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,615
didn't collapse.

101
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,847
You know,

102
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,310
Gi-tae had his burial ground prepared
in the middle of all that.

103
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,479
I chose the landscaping.

104
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,939
The inscription,

105
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,984
you should write it, Jang-seok.

106
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,656
Gi-tae left the case to us.

107
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,491
Jang-seok,

108
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,493
no one is off-limits.

109
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,582
"Conduct a thorough investigation
on even those in power."

110
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,793
"No one is off-limits."

111
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,255
That's what bastards
who are off-limits usually say.

112
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:18,803
You stopped the initial investigation…
into the tip-off Gi-tae received.

113
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,431
I had to prevent
the administration's collapse.

114
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,974
Why now?

115
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,313
I have to prevent the country's collapse.

116
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,614
It's time to go to the National Cemetery.

117
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,533
Cancel it.

118
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,869
It's your first official event.

119
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,705
Ministers are waiting.

120
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,667
This is the National Cemetery to me.

121
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,719
If my blood must spill

122
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,930
to bring Kang Sang-un
and Jeong Su-jin to justice,

123
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,015
Jang-seok,

124
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,268
don't hesitate to cut me.

125
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,901
CHOI YEON-SOOK, CHIEF OF STAFF

126
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,197
-Yes?
-The Capital Hospital was hacked.

127
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,869
It's been confirmed by the NIS
and the Intelligence Command.

128
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,163
The president's medical records
were leaked.

129
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,956
We are checking to see
if the North did it.

130
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,876
They had the will but no ability.
It has to be a domestic job.

131
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,920
Block media contact with the first family.

132
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,382
The agents moved the first family
to the villa in Jinhae.

133
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,767
Where's the medical officer?

134
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:09,330
Call the major media outlets and tell them
there's a press briefing in an hour.

135
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,706
We need more time.

136
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,833
If I can get a little more time…

137
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,876
I am sorry,

138
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,129
I cannot give you what I don't have.

139
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,932
HAN MIN-HO / CEO OF NAMSAN C&C

140
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,767
Oh, you finally made it.

141
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,270
Honey, look at these lobsters.

142
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,981
They were caught in Siberia last night.

143
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,778
Siberia somehow reminds me of Lenin.

144
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,363
You know what?

145
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,365
Lenin quit smoking

146
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,243
at the age of 32 in a prison in Siberia.
Here's why.

147
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,119
What are you doing here?

148
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,079
Right.

149
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,873
Mr. Vice Chairman invested

150
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,501
a large sum of money
in our private equity fund again.

151
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,545
People might get the wrong idea.

152
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,297
Each time I meet with you,
Deputy Prime Minister,

153
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,633
coincidently,
his firm gets more investment.

154
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,595
Here's why Lenin quit smoking.

155
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,805
His mother--

156
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:08,764
Today,

157
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,017
So-yeon has a dentist appointment.
You should take her.

158
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,983
Get Mr. Han's car ready.

159
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,826
Anyway, thank you for trusting me
and investing in my firm.

160
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,327
No. Thank you!

161
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,582
I have a very important person
at my table, thanks to you.

162
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,335
See you later.

163
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,568
The first time
you invested with my husband,

164
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,447
you asked me
to introduce you to the president.

165
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,492
And the second time you invested…

166
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,841
Article 84 of the Constitution.

167
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,301
"The president

168
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,930
shall not be charged
with a criminal offense

169
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,642
during his tenure of office
except for insurrection or treason."

170
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,814
But Park Dong-ho tried to assassinate
the sitting president.

171
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,024
That's insurrection.

172
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,319
He will be arrested today.

173
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,946
So?

174
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,116
There will be an early election.

175
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,411
The next president
will come from our side.

176
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:56,872
Then?

177
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,627
Daejin Group's inheritance issue,

178
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,629
I will solve it.

179
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,341
And?

180
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,011
The presidential pardon for your father…

181
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,598
I'll try to make it happen.

182
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,109
"Try"?

183
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,948
You know how the public reacts
to pardons for the conglomerates.

184
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,076
We set the tone first--

185
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,914
If you, pulled into this by your spouse,
can give it a try,

186
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,085
the bastard
who tried to kill the president

187
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,255
will, perhaps, solve my problem.

188
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,929
Sang-un.

189
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,181
The hospital director is with them,

190
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,933
and they have the evidence.

191
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,894
There's a press briefing in an hour.
We need to take measures--

192
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,105
There won't be a press briefing.

193
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,606
Vice Chairman Kang

194
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,276
does not cook up stories but people.

195
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,404
The ingredients are excellent.

196
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,573
I will be the cook.

197
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,284
The inheritance issue
and the chairman's imprisonment

198
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,455
are caused by Park Dong-ho
to achieve conglomerate reform.

199
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,081
That's good.

200
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,333
I suppose he'd be the one to fix it, then.

201
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:27,421
He tried to assassinate the president.
It was an act of insurrection.

202
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,881
Sang-un.

203
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,216
We need to expose the truth.

204
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,847
Only if you are prepared

205
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,725
to expose your own truth.

206
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,238
This is Kang Sang-un.

207
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,908
You might need my help.

208
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,160
Should I come over, sir?

209
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,121
Or will you bring your ass here?

210
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,919
SAFE HOUSE IN SAMCHEONGDONG

211
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,220
The president collapsed
the day before your arrest,

212
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,388
so I thought you were lucky.

213
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,520
But it turned out
that you were a talented man.

214
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,568
I wondered how you manage to live
with all that guilt you carry.

215
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,738
I guess you can add delusion to the list.

216
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,782
Assassination of the president…

217
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,870
I haven't seen him
since the Cabinet meeting a month ago.

218
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,540
-Rejecting a routine report--
-You should go.

219
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,792
Park Dong-ho will show up soon.

220
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,928
Prime Minister Park
will be arrested tomorrow morning.

221
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,012
Why is he coming?

222
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,724
He's determined to come, so I let him.

223
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,892
Also,

224
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,230
I thought I might comfort him
since he is bound to go to prison.

225
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,359
Half the people I meet are scumbags.

226
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,112
The rest are untrustworthy.
So I developed this habit.

227
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,283
I'm sure you wiped the CCTV footage
and access records,

228
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:21,827
but not this.

229
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,716
Well,

230
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,885
I planted a tree in the Blue House.

231
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,138
Some bastard chopped it down
before it could bear fruit.

232
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,934
So I would like you to be my tree
in the Blue House.

233
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,897
Just give me half of the fruit,

234
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,733
and you eat the other half.

235
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,484
I am ashamed

236
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,155
that you saw me
as someone you could threaten.

237
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,371
If the assassination attempt gets exposed,
you will die in prison.

238
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,208
Will death end your suffering?

239
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,253
History will forever remember you as
a traitor who tried to kill a president.

240
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,425
Your wife, Kim Do-hui,

241
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,261
and your son, Park Han-gyeol…

242
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,474
could they live here?

243
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,064
Do you prefer this kind of threat?

244
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,525
Come on, join me.

245
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,570
No one will ever find out

246
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,822
what you did that night.

247
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,742
Our friendship will be all that remains.

248
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,880
I will wait for your call,
Mr. Acting President.

249
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,959
Don't feel regret, sir.

250
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,129
You've done your best.

251
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,258
When many were afraid and remained silent,

252
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,760
you fought until the end.

253
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,934
If I get defeated,

254
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,563
even more people will be afraid of them.

255
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,983
That's what scares me.

256
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:03,947
Jeong-yeon.

257
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,450
I must defeat them.

258
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,455
The night I went to see the president,

259
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,124
I crossed the line.

260
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,210
Once you've crossed the line,

261
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,588
no limit exists.

262
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,693
Assemblyman Park went to the Blue House.

263
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,904
He must be having
a luncheon with Park Dong-ho.

264
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,657
Before he left for the Blue House,

265
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,826
he convened a General Assembly meeting.

266
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,008
These days, it's hard to find
moray fish soup in Seoul.

267
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,886
I eat it a couple of times a year
in my hometown.

268
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,846
I get to eat this now, thanks to you.

269
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,769
When you become
the first president from Gangwon-do,

270
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,145
please invite me to dinner.

271
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,106
I can get a taste of this soup then.

272
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,366
Serving me dessert
before I even finish the meal?

273
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,867
Is it that urgent?

274
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,996
Sir, do you remember the promise I made?

275
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,541
With all due respect,

276
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,961
may I share
how I would make that happen, sir?

277
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,674
This is what could lead you
to the Blue House.

278
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,179
This shows a private equity fund involving
the president's son, Jang Hyeon-su.

279
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:57,185
A few anonymous people invested money
in government-funded projects

280
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,771
with information obtained in advance.

281
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,483
This is a big corruption case
in which they made a large sum of money.

282
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:06,987
I see.

283
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,282
So that's why I convened
a General Assembly meeting?

284
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,119
And you want me
to instigate an investigation?

285
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,038
You're mocked
as the nine-tailed fox of Yeouido.

286
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,499
This is your chance
to lead a political reform.

287
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,436
Cancel the meeting.

288
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,940
Tell everyone
to get on with their schedule

289
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,568
and not to worry about
what's happening in Yeouido.

290
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:47,986
Sir!

291
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,246
Assemblyman Park has influence

292
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,666
over half of the Korean Liberal Party,
so if he makes a move--

293
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,419
Assemblyman Park,
a nine-tailed fox of Yeouido.

294
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:08,548
When shit happens,
politicians throw someone under the bus.

295
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,635
But he doesn't do that.

296
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,054
He protects his people.

297
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,973
That's why he still has nine tails.

298
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,810
Tails he has kept for 30 years.

299
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,562
He won't cut them today.

300
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,816
If it's a private equity fund involving
the president's son, Jang Hyeon-su,

301
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,693
are the people involved

302
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,904
from our side or theirs?

303
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,989
Rotting pus doesn't become your flesh.

304
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:33,990
You must carve out--

305
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,743
Politicians don't act alone.
There are political forces at work.

306
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:41,039
If you kick out the flawed ones
and carve out the stinking ones,

307
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,249
our political forces--

308
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,252
If we reveal our flaws and judge them,
people will recognize it.

309
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,213
Do you play poker?

310
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,507
I placed my bet

311
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,842
to see you play your hand.

312
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,844
Don't ask me to go all in.

313
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,014
Sir.

314
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,308
No need for dessert.

315
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,310
I'll have another bowl of soup.

316
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,022
Still, he won't give up.

317
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,482
Park Dong-ho is

318
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,777
a hound
that even President Jang couldn't tame.

319
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,113
If that hound bites…

320
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,365
-It can't bite me.
-Sang-un.

321
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,957
You see? It can't.

322
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,050
I still have a quarry to hunt.

323
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,845
Now you need to fetch it.

324
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,897
Even if the truth about the assassination
is revealed tomorrow, we don't flinch

325
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,734
until the investigation into
Kang Sang-un and Jeong Su-jin is done.

326
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,906
-Hey, Jang-seok.
-Hey, Dong-Ho.

327
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,869
The CIO requested the transfer
of the private equity fund case.

328
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,040
Not only did the Prosecutor General
order us to drop the case,

329
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,542
but he also

330
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,961
disbanded the investigation team.

331
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,300
Get the Chief Prosecutor here now!

332
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:22,265
I was told that coffee is bad for diabetes
and beer is bad for hyperlipidemia…

333
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,642
LEE JUNG-GWON / CHIEF PROSECUTOR

334
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,227
…so I only drink water wherever I go.

335
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,485
Prosecutor Lee has been investigating
this case for a long time.

336
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,737
Send the case back to the prosecution.

337
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:42,577
It is against the law for the Blue House
to intervene in the investigation.

338
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,663
It's within our authority to mediate

339
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,082
when there is conflict
between the agencies.

340
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,959
The Blue House's authority…

341
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,546
I will look for any precedents.

342
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,883
I am a little slow,

343
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,678
so it may take a week or two, sir.

344
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,304
Mr. Lee!

345
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,348
The higher-ups set the target.

346
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,892
I just pull the trigger, sir.

347
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,197
You can get corporate sponsorship
and support from government agencies.

348
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,450
You've dreamed of setting up
a scholarship foundation

349
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,495
in your hometown
since you were a lecturer.

350
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,250
I will make your dream come true.

351
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,421
Is that your idea?

352
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,591
Or Vice Chairman Kang's?

353
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,053
Right.

354
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,974
You two never disagreed on anything.

355
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,854
I only started it to save the president.

356
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,824
Without an anonymous tip,

357
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,994
Assemblyman Seo wouldn't be dead,

358
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,830
there'd be no duress
on the acting president,

359
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,041
and the president
wouldn't have had a mishap.

360
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,421
I found out recently…

361
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,967
who submitted the tip.

362
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,101
I suppose you didn't have
the courage to expose the truth

363
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,437
or the determination to remain silent.

364
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,528
Please resign as Chief of Staff.

365
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,619
In college,

366
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,580
you were very bright.

367
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,044
I should teach you something now

368
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,463
that I failed to teach you then.

369
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,762
At your age, ma'am…

370
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,308
it's dangerous to be brave.

371
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,436
-Su-jin--
-Please!

372
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,575
Remain silent.

373
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,008
My apologies.

374
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,469
If I wasn't in a rush,

375
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,847
I would've been more polite.

376
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,642
What will happen…

377
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,272
to Acting President Park?

378
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,691
I'm sure he will go down

379
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,902
the same path as the president.

380
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,240
When the first Chief Prosecutor was named,

381
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,951
he was rumored
to be Assemblyman Park's man.

382
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,203
I thought it was just gossip.

383
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,625
Jeong-yeon…

384
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,797
we are going with plan B.

385
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,407
The deputy prime minister came to see me.

386
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,702
She promised you your safety

387
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,954
and demanded your resignation.

388
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,672
I'm sure you and I feel the same way.

389
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,425
Are you ready to go all the way?

390
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,267
What do I need to do?

391
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,733
Not too long ago,
the president's heart stopped right here.

392
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,493
Tonight,

393
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,704
another heart
will stop beating right here.

394
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:52,720
We'll celebrate your 80th birthday
and the company's anniversary together.

395
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,139
We'll also invite foreign guests.

396
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,393
You will be pardoned sometime this month.

397
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,020
Of course, I should be.

398
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,730
KANG YEONG-IK / CHAIRMAN OF DAEJIN GROUP

399
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,816
Because as your only father,

400
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,818
only I can hand the company over to you.

401
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,278
But mark my words,

402
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:13,282
you're not the only son
I can hand my company over to.

403
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,827
I have two more sons.

404
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,335
PRIME MINISTER PARK DONG-HO

405
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,759
This is Kang Sang-un.

406
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,469
This is Park Dong-ho.

407
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,139
Let's meet at the Blue House tonight.

408
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,334
Let's go.

409
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,296
Chief Kim.

410
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,966
I'd like to sit at a table
with my father before Christmas.

411
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,471
I need to resolve
the issue with the inheritance.

412
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,892
The National Tax Service
is troubling me with inheritance tax.

413
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,521
I'm sure you need to
take control of the company.

414
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,149
If you tell me how much you can pay,

415
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,901
I'll go with that.

416
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,369
"A world
where justice flows like a river."

417
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,375
Rivers are full of problems.

418
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,962
Sometimes, it dries up
or overflows from floods.

419
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,965
That's why I'm going to build

420
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:35,675
a reservoir.

421
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:42,640
A reservoir that allows as much justice
to flow as the world needs.

422
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,853
I shut the floodgate
when justice flows against me

423
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:51,399
and open it when it flows in my favor.

424
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:09,876
Aconitine.

425
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,462
It's extracted from a flower
called wolfsbane.

426
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:17,425
It's a drug that kills within five minutes
if taken in a lethal dose of 2 mg.

427
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,928
It's diluted, ma'am.

428
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,432
One can survive if their stomach is pumped
within 30 minutes.

429
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:25,850
If we fail

430
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,935
today…

431
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,729
We will meet in court.

432
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,276
We have been enemies for a long time,

433
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,529
but I hope we'll be friends longer.

434
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,495
Park Dong-ho is…

435
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,332
A hound
that even President Jang couldn't tame.

436
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,877
…a hound
that even President Jang couldn't tame.

437
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,212
If that hound bites…

438
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,797
The hound named Park Dong-ho

439
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,008
will bite me.

440
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,095
Jeong Su-jin was right.

441
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,556
Goddammit!

442
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,824
Why didn't you stop

443
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,868
the fight you cannot win?

444
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,459
Why are you holding

445
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,962
a drink you cannot sip?

446
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,633
Park Dong-ho,

447
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,427
how far were you willing to go?

448
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,597
One step farther than you.

449
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,938
Park Dong-ho!

450
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:07,785
What a relief.

451
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,831
Whether I die or survive right now,

452
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,709
you will not exist…

453
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,795
in my world.

454
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,305
Park Dong-ho.

455
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:43,362
The Security Service apprehended
Vice Chairman Kang of Daejin Group

456
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,658
for the attempted assassination
of the president at the scene.

457
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,954
Two days ago,

458
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,499
the Security Service identified
Vice Chairman Kang as the prime suspect

459
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,918
while investigating the case,

460
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,547
believing that the president's
tragic mishap at the Blue House

461
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,551
was not due to his chronic illness
but by drugs brought in from the outside.

462
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:10,473
After executing a search and seizure
of Daejin Group's executive office

463
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,267
with the Seoul Central DPO,
we found evidence of a substance

464
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,062
that appears to have been used
in an assassination attempt.

465
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,440
We also secured records of his visit
to the Blue House that night.

466
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,442
VICE CHAIRMAN KANG ARRESTED

467
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:25,071
We also confirmed
that he hacked into the hospital's server

468
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:28,949
and stole the president's medical records.

469
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,620
Tonight, to ensure

470
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,622
his own safety,

471
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,458
he even tried to assassinate
Acting President Park.

472
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,877
But he was apprehended at the scene.

473
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,508
Acting President Park was rushed
to the Armed Forces Capital Hospital.

474
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,678
The severity of his condition
is yet to be confirmed.

475
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,272
We don't know his condition yet.

476
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,608
Let me know as soon as you find out.

477
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,653
Park Dong-ho set this up.

478
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,738
The public won't be convinced.

479
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,698
Vice Chairman Kang didn't have a motive--

480
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:14,161
What we have been hiding will surface
as they try to uncover the motive.

481
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,331
We must stop

482
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,459
Park Dong-ho's return to the office…

483
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,381
and the Kang Sang-un investigation.

484
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,552
My cell phone!

485
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,972
Where the hell is my cell phone?

486
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,018
Well done.

487
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,314
You should go.

488
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,151
Park Dong-ho will show up soon.

489
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,948
Prime Minister Park
will be arrested tomorrow morning.

490
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,825
Why is he coming?

491
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,786
He's determined to come, so I let him.

492
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,746
Also,

493
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,251
I thought I might comfort him
since he is bound to go to prison.

494
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,005
SEO JEONG-YEON

495
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,591
He's having his stomach pumped.

496
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,218
The helicopter got delayed
due to bad weather.

497
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,972
He is in critical condition right now.

498
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:28,611
Sir.

499
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,334
Has Acting President Park departed?

500
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,549
The president is…

501
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:58,766
awake.

502
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,537
THE WHIRLWIND
