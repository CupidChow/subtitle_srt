1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,513
Mom.

2
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:18,768
An investigation into Prime Minister Jeong
by the prosecution is imminent.

3
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,647
The prosecution intends to take steps
to summon the prime minister

4
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:27,235
should evidence of bribing justices
and lobbying North Korea be obtained

5
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,487
during a search and seizure
of her residence.

6
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,959
This is Lee Jang-seok.

7
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,628
This is Lee Man-gil,
Prime Minister Jeong's secretary.

8
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,424
Please stop the investigation
into me and my family.

9
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,593
Watch your back.

10
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,516
Look in front of you.

11
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,856
That is CEO Han Min-ho's tablet PC.

12
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:12,238
It contains all Namsan C&C records
from the five years since its foundation.

13
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,492
Investigate everyone by the book.

14
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,535
Just leave me out of it.

15
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,464
Jeong Su-jin has no other options.

16
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,300
She can either sink alone
or vanish with them.

17
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,517
Mr. President. Jeong Su-jin…

18
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,312
Prime Minister Jeong

19
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,940
is on her way
to the prosecutor's office voluntarily.

20
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,654
But a summons hasn't even been issued yet.

21
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,572
LEE JANG-SEOK

22
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,701
Jang-seok.

23
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,703
-Jeong Su-jin's on her way to--
-Dong-ho.

24
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,956
I have Han Min-ho's tablet PC.

25
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,333
Namsan C&C's investor list

26
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:09,671
and the investment details
of President Jang's son are on it.

27
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,133
Guess what, Dong-ho?

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,884
I found out

29
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,596
how those bastards trampled over Gi-tae

30
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,892
and drove him to his death.

31
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,769
All of it.

32
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,293
Are you saying the tablet holds
the truth about my brother's death?

33
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,968
I wonder what kind of world
my brother wished to create.

34
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,181
Chairman Kang Yeong-ik of Daejin Group

35
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,016
and Jo Sang-cheon…

36
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:07,103
Please uproot the remaining weeds
in the Blue House

37
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,063
if I fail.

38
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,028
He wished for a world

39
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,156
in which wrongdoers feel shame.

40
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,912
I want to start over

41
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,081
after sweeping everything away…

42
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,668
in this suffocating world.

43
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,885
It's time that I left the Blue House.

44
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,391
THE WHIRLWIND

45
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,020
EPISODE 11

46
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,706
This has a nice aroma.

47
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,333
I'm glad

48
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,005
there is at least one thing I like
about the prosecution in Korea.

49
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,757
You can have another cup if you'd like

50
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:04,053
because it will be your last one
before you go to prison.

51
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:08,683
The prosecution has obtained the tablet
of Han Min-ho, former Namsan C&C CEO.

52
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,895
It contained recordings of CEO Han
and Vice Chairman Kang conspiring

53
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,149
on ways to deal with Korean Liberal Party
Assemblyman Seo Gi-tae.

54
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,193
When Assemblyman Seo raised
the illegality of private equity funds…

55
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,321
Please stop the investigation into Seo.

56
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,823
…Vice Chairman Kang
diverted money he borrowed

57
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,784
from Seo's friend, Choi Se-won,
CEO of a crypto brokerage,

58
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,161
into political funds…

59
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,830
It's fabricated,
and this is political retaliation.

60
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,124
He left behind a will

61
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,501
asking me to write an inscription.

62
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,754
I haven't even started it.

63
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,806
Jeong-yeon.

64
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,976
I am going to write
Gi-tae's epitaph today.

65
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,565
Wrap up the interrogation
and testimony in the morning.

66
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,443
It's not possible
to adjust my afternoon schedule.

67
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,695
If you knew what I had,

68
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,449
you would've gotten your affairs in order
before coming here.

69
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,953
Go ahead and check…

70
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,333
my husband's schedule for February 21,

71
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,336
which is recorded in his diary.

72
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,015
Send me a summary
of Han Min-ho's diary by date.

73
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,148
There was a human rights lawyer

74
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,734
who devoted his entire life
to the ordinary people

75
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,947
and a politician who fought
against dictatorship in her youth.

76
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,326
But they ended up becoming monsters

77
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,662
fighting against monsters.

78
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,499
Monsters that are enraged
at the injustice of the world

79
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,668
but infinitely tolerant
of their own injustice.

80
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,044
But there was a man

81
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,381
who sacrificed himself to defend justice

82
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,716
while those monsters were busy

83
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,011
covering up their crimes.

84
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,641
His name was…

85
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,603
Seo Gi-tae.

86
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,819
DIGITAL FORENSIC CENTER

87
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,198
During my confirmation process
as a nominee,

88
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,035
I was having trouble
because of Namsan C&C.

89
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,999
For the South to live,

90
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,668
the North must die.

91
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,637
I am sure my husband felt bad.

92
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,601
I guess he wanted to be helpful.

93
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,146
Han Min-ho, Chairman of the NCSR,

94
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,983
and Jo Sang-cheon,
Chief of the Public Security Department…

95
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,571
could do something great together.

96
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,240
Why are husbands so foolish?

97
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,785
What all wives want

98
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,039
is to be understood
and comforted by their husbands.

99
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,088
Instead, the husbands try
to solve the problems themselves.

100
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:36,182
Were you preparing for a cross-examination
with Assemblyman Jo Sang-cheon?

101
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,647
What a shame

102
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,733
that my husband is no longer with us.

103
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,070
This is fabricated.

104
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,821
Everything about…

105
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,159
the private equity fund-related scandals,

106
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,537
the request for Chairman Kang's pardon,

107
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,248
and Assemblyman Seo's suicide
due to being falsely accused

108
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,626
was all true.

109
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,380
All records saved on Han Min-ho's tablet

110
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,966
are true.

111
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,637
Look at that.
Our president says that is the truth.

112
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,856
Guilt by association doesn't apply.

113
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,111
A woman shall not be punished
for her husband's misdeeds.

114
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,446
I will secure more evidence

115
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,365
and subpoena you again.

116
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,954
If you take one step closer,

117
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,789
the citizens of this country

118
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,542
will subpoena the prosecution.

119
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,558
Did you also predict
Park Dong-ho's press conference?

120
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,602
That's the thing about life.

121
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,521
If you try your best,

122
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,065
luck comes to you.

123
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,610
JULY 2, JANG REFUSED A MEETING
JULY 4, JANG REQUESTED AN INVESTIGATION

124
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,486
President Jang's supporters

125
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,488
have been holding their breath.

126
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,533
Let them know
that Jang Il-jun was innocent

127
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,951
and that they have a right

128
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,203
to be enraged.

129
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,169
JEONG SU-JIN

130
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,920
Have you decided

131
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,174
whether you want to sink alone
or vanish with them?

132
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,136
It's difficult to answer,
so I decided to switch the question.

133
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,430
Why did you assassinate Jang Il-jun,

134
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,266
a clean, innocent politician
and proud president?

135
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,605
It's too bad you don't have time
to switch the question for yourself.

136
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,335
We have exclusive coverage of the diary
that was saved on CEO Han Min-ho's tablet.

137
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,296
When Vice Chairman Kang demanded
a pardon for Chairman Kang,

138
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,257
former President Jang
was said to have been enraged,

139
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,803
ensuring he would request
an investigation into his son himself.

140
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,306
Furthermore, he ordered
a thorough investigation

141
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,933
into the private equity fund case,

142
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,144
stating that preferential treatment
cannot be granted even to his son.

143
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,981
CEO Han Min-ho revealed in his diary

144
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,944
that neither threats nor cajoling
worked on former President Jang.

145
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,988
-Prime Minister, what are your thoughts?
-Tell us how you feel.

146
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,911
He was a great leader

147
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,498
and an excellent politician.

148
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,960
We lost President Jang Il-jun,

149
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,337
who was so righteous

150
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,298
and innocent…

151
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,761
for incomprehensible reasons.

152
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,978
I ask you this, Mr. President.

153
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,858
Why did you assassinate President Jang?

154
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,694
It was the day before your arrest.

155
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,946
Were you afraid?

156
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,074
Did you think
you could cover up your crime

157
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,369
if you became acting president
after assassinating the president?

158
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,248
Now you need to tell us

159
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,542
why you took…

160
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,421
President Jang away from us.

161
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,887
Do not bring further disgrace
upon the Blue House.

162
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,435
Do not make more of a mockery of history!

163
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,107
You must stop insulting
our proud president, Jang Il-jun!

164
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,085
I've thought over and over

165
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,923
about why I never suspected the tablet.

166
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,383
If only I'd checked it just once…

167
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,888
I wonder why those who know shame…

168
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,433
are so powerless.

169
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,437
I had a dream

170
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,649
that I squatted and took a dump
in front of Gwanghwamun

171
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,567
in broad daylight.

172
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,485
Oh my!

173
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,241
I was taking a shit on a road
packed with hundreds of people,

174
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:51,330
but because I held my head high
and stared at every single passerby…

175
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,835
they all tried to avoid my gaze.

176
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,337
Oh my.

177
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,631
My shit was as big as the sun!

178
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:03,801
Dong-ho.

179
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,847
No one manages
to smell nice all the time, you know.

180
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,266
Since you work in politics,

181
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,477
you will have to take a huge dump one day.

182
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,187
When that happens…

183
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,398
Jang Il-jun told me…

184
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,441
Don't drop your head down.

185
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,069
…or feel ashamed,

186
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,488
and then say…

187
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,448
"I didn't take a dump."

188
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,534
If I deny persistently,

189
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,621
then even those
who actually saw me shitting…

190
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,084
…will start doubting their memory.

191
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,636
Jeong Su-jin visited Jang Il-jun's grave
to pay her respects

192
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,681
with thousands of his supporters.

193
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,934
She wrote in the guestbook

194
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,730
that she would prove
Jang Il-jun's innocence.

195
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,444
I know his supporters want to believe

196
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,905
that Jang Il-jun never shit in public.

197
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,408
What has this world become?

198
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,160
It doesn't matter.

199
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,661
What matters is

200
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,498
how we are going to navigate that world.

201
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,253
I ordered them
to investigate the tablet PC.

202
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,758
We'll find out if it was tampered with
within a week, ten days at most.

203
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,763
The truth does not defeat lies.

204
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,389
Bigger lies do.

205
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,936
But I want to believe at least this once

206
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,438
that the truth will prevail.

207
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:51,158
Jeong submitted a special prosecution bill
to the National Assembly, sir.

208
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,496
Out of 296 votes,

209
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,540
with 149 in favor and 147 opposed,

210
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,543
the special prosecution bill
has been passed.

211
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,382
Are you saying you recommended
Attorney Choi as a special prosecutor?

212
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,677
He is a far-right extremist
who used to be a prosecutor.

213
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,555
He is someone
Park Dong-ho will never accept.

214
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,141
You're right.

215
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,186
So he should be.

216
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,981
By the authority given to the president,

217
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,150
I exercise my veto
on the special prosecutor bill passed

218
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,569
by the National Assembly.

219
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,990
Cases regarding the bribing of justices

220
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,033
and the authenticity
of Han Min-ho's tablet

221
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,744
will continue to be investigated
by the prosecution

222
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,081
under the leadership
of Chief Prosecutor Lee Jang-seok.

223
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,710
The chief prosecutor leading
the investigation went hiking

224
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,963
on the Blue House grounds
alone with the president.

225
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,132
President Park and Chief Prosecutor Lee

226
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,718
were spotted having a clandestine meeting.

227
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,886
What effect will their friendship have…

228
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,598
Some suspect you of directing
the investigation through Mr. Lee.

229
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,102
What instructions
did you give Chief Prosecutor Lee?

230
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,354
The neutrality of the prosecution
has collapsed.

231
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:03,772
And now…

232
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,610
the Blue House will collapse.

233
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,531
Let's go

234
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,451
to the Trade Union Federation.

235
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,873
As we burn the night of despair

236
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,710
Through blizzards and rainstorms

237
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,714
To the front line
To the front line, to the front line

238
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:32,342
If devoting our youth to this fight

239
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,178
Is the fate of fighters…

240
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,095
KIM JEONG-SU

241
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,765
CHAIRMAN OF TRADE UNION FEDERATION

242
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,017
I understand why
you embezzled union funds.

243
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,480
You did send two of your children
to study abroad.

244
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,404
My husband left me

245
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,782
a commercial building.

246
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,702
With that,

247
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:03,749
you and your kids
will be emancipated from labor…

248
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,212
for the rest of your life.

249
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,967
STOP! ANTI-LABOR POLICY
END! SYSTEM OF INEQUALITY

250
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,222
He promised me a general strike
until Park Dong-ho resigns.

251
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,556
Let's go…

252
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,351
to the Bar Association.

253
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,154
JEONG JAE-MUN

254
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,698
PRESIDENT OF THE KOREAN BAR ASSOCIATION

255
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,951
The life we've lived will be insulted.

256
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,332
History is written by the victors.

257
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,417
Come on.

258
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,128
We must write

259
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,713
our own history.

260
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,136
Democracy is collapsing.

261
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,555
This country is falling apart.

262
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,931
From this moment on,

263
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:05,853
we, the sons of the April 19 Revolution
and the daughters of the June Struggle

264
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,897
who stood against dictatorship
and resisted the military coup,

265
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,025
refuse to be ruled by a murderer.

266
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,736
We cannot tolerate this farce

267
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,407
in which the murderer who killed
the president tries to punish injustice

268
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,992
in the name of justice.

269
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,076
My fellow Koreans,

270
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,495
it is Park Dong-ho
who shall be brought to justice!

271
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,545
A nationwide general strike
will begin tomorrow.

272
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:35,424
Production, transportation, ports,
and logistics will all be paralyzed.

273
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,634
Convene an emergency Cabinet meeting.

274
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,636
Illegal strikes must be suppressed early--

275
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,430
The Minister of Justice is resigning.

276
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,766
He says you are not his president.

277
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,186
Tell the Minister of Interior and Safety
to mobilize--

278
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,856
This resignation letter is from him.

279
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,775
Have you forgotten

280
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,820
that Jang Il-jun taught him everything?

281
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,703
The Government Employees' Union
also declared its participation.

282
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,333
Government agencies
across the country will be shut down.

283
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,629
Jeong Su-jin.

284
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,341
Don't bother trying.

285
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:22,179
None of your orders will be carried out.

286
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,894
I want you to vanish.

287
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,271
If you stand your ground,

288
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,733
I will bring this country to a halt.

289
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,868
The civil disobedience movement
has been going on for the last three days.

290
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,372
Over a million workers have participated
in strikes at over 1,400 factories.

291
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,875
This movement has been spreading
across the country,

292
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:55,337
and over 90% of people think
the president should resign immediately

293
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,756
and be brought to justice.

294
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,676
The Jogye Order, Christian Council,
and the Catholic Priests' Association.

295
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,805
The religious communities
are also demanding your resignation.

296
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,226
Do you think we'll be able to hold out?

297
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,855
LEE JANG-SEOK

298
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,691
Jang-seok.

299
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,109
Please resign.

300
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:21,029
We, the prosecution,
should not be a tool for politics.

301
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,699
Please resign, sir.

302
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:32,749
Dong-ho.

303
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,836
They stopped examining the tablet.

304
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,839
I have no control

305
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,883
over any prosecutors

306
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:43,885
anymore.

307
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:11,705
They're planning an attempt to storm
the Blue House after the rally today.

308
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,169
And they want to remove you physically

309
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,755
if you don't leave willingly.

310
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,218
Park Dong-ho, out!

311
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,554
Park Dong-ho must resign!

312
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,723
Park Dong-ho must resign!

313
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,934
You started all of this for the people.

314
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,561
How come they don't see that?

315
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,479
No.

316
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,482
I have never once

317
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,360
done politics for the people.

318
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,407
I did it all for myself.

319
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,163
I did it because I couldn't stand
the ugliness of this world.

320
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,460
I did it
because I couldn't stand being ruled

321
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,087
by the unrighteous.

322
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,757
I did it all for myself.

323
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,760
So, Jeong-yeon…

324
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,931
do not blame anyone.

325
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,062
We must ensure your safety.

326
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,064
You need to move, sir.

327
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,608
I will get a nearby safe house ready.

328
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:23,860
Is there

329
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,613
anywhere in this country

330
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,324
that is safe for me?

331
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,499
I am going to fight

332
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,502
because I still have

333
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:42,921
something

334
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,090
I can throw away.

335
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,311
After the rally tonight,

336
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:02,482
500,000 protesters
will attempt to storm the Blue House.

337
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,818
I can deploy 10,000 officers
in all three directions

338
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,944
leading to the Blue--

339
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:06,862
Please don't.

340
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,659
I want you to withdraw

341
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,245
the riot police.

342
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,247
The Blue House will not be safe.

343
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,293
You will not be safe…

344
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,338
if you try to guard the Blue House.

345
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,860
SEO JEONG-YEON

346
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,289
I went to the airport.

347
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,666
They told me

348
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,044
I was on the No-Fly list.

349
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,174
Can you find a way for me
to leave the country?

350
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,389
This is a dossier detailing

351
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,392
the political funds of Oh,
mayor of Seoul, and Governor Song.

352
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,686
If you take them down with this,

353
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,107
Jeong won't face any obstacles
in the upcoming presidential election.

354
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,074
I'll look for a boat

355
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,909
so you can leave tonight.

356
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,795
MOM

357
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,508
What should I tell my mom?

358
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,561
I have nothing left.

359
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,314
Nothing at all.

360
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,867
You can call her with this.

361
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,091
-The passcode is--
-I know.

362
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,722
It's the day…

363
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,977
we would've gotten married
if it hadn't happened.

364
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:57,949
Jeong-yeon.

365
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,785
Don't get caught.

366
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,456
I wish you the best.

367
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,730
Jeong-yeon. Seo Jeong-yeon!

368
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,482
Hey, Jeong-yeon!

369
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,027
Come on, open the door.

370
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,154
Open the damn door!

371
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,158
Jeong-yeon, open the door.

372
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,494
Open the goddamn door!

373
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,704
We begin the rally at 6:00 p.m.

374
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,832
with an hour of cultural events
and an hour-long resolution session.

375
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,129
We're going to storm
the Blue House around 8:00 p.m.

376
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,340
The riot police withdrew.

377
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,343
No one will block your way
to the Blue House.

378
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,221
But pushing all the way to the Blue House…

379
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,348
Tonight, you will become Lenin.

380
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,601
History will remember you
as the Castro of Korea.

381
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,104
Convene an emergency Cabinet meeting.

382
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,236
LEE MAN-GIL

383
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,992
The Blue House
will collapse at 8:00 p.m. tonight.

384
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,161
Convene the Cabinet meeting for 9:00 p.m.

385
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,289
I think the prime minister's office
will collapse first.

386
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,751
It's me, Park Dong-ho.

387
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,171
Secretary Lee Man-gil's cell phone

388
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:39,843
has records of many things he saw
when he accompanied you,

389
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,178
such as why you killed Jang Il-jun…

390
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,473
Even if the president wakes up,

391
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,059
he cannot save us now.

392
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,187
…and how he met his demise.

393
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,987
If the protesters set one foot
in the Blue House,

394
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,572
the whole world will know

395
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,366
exactly what you did.

396
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,695
Jeong-su.

397
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:45,033
Hold off on advancing to the Blue House
until you hear from me.

398
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,465
PARK DONG-HO

399
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,551
You can get out there.

400
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,312
High heels and a suit.

401
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,775
Not the best attire for hiking.

402
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:25,907
Start walking.

403
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,343
After the inauguration ceremony,

404
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,973
we drank six bottles of soju
and two bottles of whiskey.

405
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,182
Isn't it interesting

406
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,602
that I never get drunk
when I drink with you, Dong-ho?

407
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,116
Oh, this is great.

408
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,273
I need to speak with the president.

409
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,756
The question hasn't changed.

410
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,258
You either sink alone

411
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,552
or go down with the filth of this world.

412
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,638
Too bad.

413
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,098
You don't have time

414
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,185
to switch the question either.

415
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,171
Can I borrow your phone, please?

416
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,049
There are 500,000 protesters
in Gwanghwamun.

417
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,050
What would happen

418
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,886
if they found out how Jang Il-jun died?

419
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,851
Where do you think

420
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,770
those angry citizens will go?

421
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,815
To the Blue House?

422
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,401
How about your office?

423
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,590
-This is Jeong Su-jin.
-Ma'am.

424
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,218
I got a new cell phone a week ago.

425
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,929
There's nothing important on it.

426
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,776
Tell them

427
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:53,156
to lead the angry protesters
to the Constitutional Court

428
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,490
and the National Assembly.

429
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,050
Jeong-su.

430
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,679
Advance to the Blue House.

431
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,435
The police withdrew,

432
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,270
and so will the security service.

433
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,606
No one in this country

434
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,609
will protect Park Dong-ho.

435
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,744
What a relief.

436
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,997
I now know you have so little

437
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,459
that you're willing to bet
on an empty phone.

438
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,051
In my five-year term in office,

439
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,846
you two will be the only ones
who will keep me grounded.

440
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,099
Do your best

441
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,976
so I don't go astray.

442
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,019
I will!

443
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,817
Keep me in check

444
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,527
so I don't go out of control.

445
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,444
I will!

446
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,702
Jeong Su-jin, you killed the president!

447
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,251
It's a shame you have no proof.

448
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:37,301
I'm going to make
Jang Il-jun's unfulfilled dream a reality.

449
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,686
History will remember

450
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:51,732
that I, Jeong Su-jin,
was Jang Il-jun's heir.

451
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,239
No one in the world will doubt me.

452
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,953
I did not kill President Jang.

453
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,079
That's not true!

454
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,957
You did indeed kill the president!

455
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,753
Dismissing my security service
will prove your intentions.

456
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,929
This indelible trace will be

457
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,890
circumstantial evidence.

458
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,727
This will be conclusive evidence.

459
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,229
Jeong Su-jin.

460
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,398
The president you killed…

461
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,818
is Park Dong-ho!

462
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,520
THE WHIRLWIND
