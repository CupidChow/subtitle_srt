1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,512
I tried to assassinate the president.

2
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,224
Mr. Prime Minister!

3
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:21,062
With these hands,
I wanted to stop his heart from beating.

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,148
Do not forget

5
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,150
that Park Dong-ho's time

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,069
is connected to Jang Il-jun's time.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,322
What is your plan?

8
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,657
I've already told you

9
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,326
that if you cannot remove enemies,

10
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,871
you should control them.

11
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,129
I am the only one

12
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,965
who can control me.

13
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,069
Daejin Group Chairman Kang Yeong-ik
was released

14
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,071
from Anyang Correctional Institute
this morning.

15
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,698
He was sentenced to 12 years
in prison for charges

16
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,826
that included aggravated punishment
for specific economic crimes.

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,246
But he was released yesterday afternoon
after two years in prison

18
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,415
on President Park's special pardon.

19
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,503
He was checked into
the Daejin Medical Center upon his release

20
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,297
for a health check-up
and treatment for a chronic disease

21
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,217
that had worsened
during his time in prison.

22
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:48,566
I hate the bastards
who remove the smell from cheonggukjang.

23
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,528
The smell is what defines cheonggukjang.

24
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,412
Give me the reins to control Park Dong-ho.

25
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:15,426
Park Dong-ho is a hound
that even President Jang couldn't tame.

26
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,428
I will hold onto the reins.

27
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,429
We don't have time.

28
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,141
My brother is on trial
for something he didn't--

29
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:25,562
If you disclose what he didn't do,
then what he did do will be disclosed.

30
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,273
He embezzled company funds,

31
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,651
set up a private equity fund,

32
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:35,155
and made large profits
by stealing national business information.

33
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,323
He used that as bait
to lure in Jang Hyeon-su

34
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,660
to get to President Jang Il-jun,
then falsely accused Assemblyman Seo,

35
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,786
who found out--

36
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,787
Goodness.

37
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,290
It looks like my son has been quite busy.

38
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,086
I will give it to you

39
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,547
if you want to save your son

40
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,091
and abandon Daejin Group.

41
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,765
That's your business.
It doesn't concern me.

42
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,939
I will bring you a list of people suitable

43
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,443
for the minister, vice minister,
and key positions in the government.

44
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,322
That's my business.
It doesn't concern you, does it?

45
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,206
They are a helpful bunch. Use them.

46
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,583
PRIME MINISTER, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER,
MINISTER OF EDUCATION

47
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,338
Filling the Cabinet with your people--

48
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,965
You grab onto those reins,

49
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,761
but I have to hold the whip.

50
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:51,314
PRIME MINISTER JEONG SU-JIN

51
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,730
THE WHIRLWIND

52
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,567
EPISODE 6

53
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,445
There are 3,000 key positions
that the president fills.

54
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,615
And another 25,000 under your authority.
We will fill those.

55
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,285
We'll leave a few positions
for you to fill,

56
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,663
like the chief of staff
and personal secretary.

57
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,706
That's about it.

58
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,751
Lee Ji-hun was involved in a sex scandal,

59
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,462
and Baek Jong-su is morally flawed--

60
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,463
I never thought

61
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,717
someone who helped
the president's assassin

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,427
would be this moral.

63
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,557
Turn a blind eye to their flaws…

64
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,894
and I will do the same for you.

65
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,812
Jeong Su-jin!

66
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,356
In politics, power is superior to morals.

67
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,902
You will have a list of appointees
within the week--

68
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,446
I'd like to see the list today.

69
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,534
They must have worked for Daejin
in politics, law, and academia

70
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,619
while the government paid their salary.

71
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,498
It won't take long
to compile a list of their own people.

72
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,885
Isn't it humiliating for you
to appoint those people

73
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,137
as the heads of government institutions?

74
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,640
The shorter the humiliation, the better.

75
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,978
Don't we owe each other
that much consideration?

76
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,449
29 DAYS EARLIER
THE FIRST DAY OF THE CAMPAIGN

77
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,422
ON THE SAME NIGHT

78
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:56,165
Our campaign strategy and conversations
are being leaked to Jeong Su-jin.

79
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,543
-We need to destroy the watch.
-No.

80
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,670
If we destroy it,

81
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,131
she will stop supporting us.

82
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,259
We undoubtedly need her help
to win the election.

83
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,680
Sir, we should trust the public for--

84
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,681
Seo Gi-tae also

85
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,808
trusted the public.

86
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,397
I once did too.

87
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,614
I will tell the public
the lie they want to believe,

88
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,701
that Park Dong-ho is Jang Il-jun's heir.

89
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,138
Ask Assemblywoman Jeong
to join me for a visit

90
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,056
to President Jang's birthplace tomorrow.

91
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,810
Park Dong-ho!

92
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,397
She will stand next to me
on the campaign podium in major regions.

93
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,985
We must win

94
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,113
this election at all costs.

95
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,327
Assemblywoman Jeong sent over
a list of names for heads of institutions.

96
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,122
The list has about
200 heads of major institutions,

97
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,584
including the National Tax Service
and the Financial Supervisory Service.

98
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,505
Kang Yeong-ik's long-hidden dogs
have finally surfaced.

99
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,342
It is now their turn to feel remorse.

100
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,097
Jang Il-jun's watch
made all this possible.

101
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,560
I am grateful to him
for the first time in a while.

102
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,903
Su-jin.

103
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,076
I told Cheol-min
that you have sensitive tonsils,

104
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,953
so he sent bellflower root juice.

105
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,040
He has loved horses since he was a child…

106
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,086
What?

107
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,549
My husband's recommending
a friend addicted to horse racing

108
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,009
for an executive position
at the Racing Authority.

109
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,346
What do you think?

110
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,891
You know

111
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,978
he hid me in his house
when I was on the run.

112
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,312
Friendship has a price tag?

113
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,439
Listen, Su-jin.

114
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,651
He went to prison for hiding me.
I have to repay--

115
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,236
Did we expect to be repaid

116
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,614
for what we sacrificed in our twenties?

117
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,078
Su-jin.

118
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,914
Ma'am!

119
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,047
I will announce the list of nominees
for President Park's first Cabinet.

120
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,090
BLUE HOUSE - CHUNCHUGWAN

121
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,093
For Prime Minister,

122
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,722
Assemblyman Park Chang-sik
of the Korean Liberal Party.

123
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,973
PRIME MINISTER JEONG SU-JIN(X)

124
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,850
For Deputy Prime Minister
of Economic Affairs,

125
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,977
Lee Jun-il, President of the KDI.

126
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,730
For Deputy Prime Minister of Education,

127
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,940
Ahn Il-sang,
President of Wonil University.

128
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,942
For Minister of Unification,

129
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,445
Min Hyo-seong,
former Vice Minister of Unification.

130
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,697
For Minister of Justice,

131
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,699
Kang Jun-seong, former assemblyman.

132
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,618
For Minister of National Defense,

133
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,037
Song Tae-min,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

134
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,414
For Minister of Interior and Safety,

135
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,042
Choi Young-man,
former Commissioner General of the KNPA.

136
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,797
Out of the 200 heads of institutions
in 19 ministries,

137
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,509
not a single person we recommended
was appointed.

138
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,695
He is waiting for you.

139
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,868
BLUE HOUSE - SANGCHUNJAE

140
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,551
I won the by-election ten years ago
thanks to you.

141
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,137
At the dinner that night,

142
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,766
I remember you enjoying raw anchovies, so…

143
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,394
Enjoy.

144
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,187
You go ahead

145
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,149
because this will be
your last meal in the Blue House.

146
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,573
I am thinking about

147
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,617
sending this recording to YTV.

148
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,915
The National Assembly will begin
discussing your impeachment today.

149
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,543
It won't take long.

150
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,129
I will at least

151
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,965
see you off to prison.

152
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,429
I finished Jang Il-jun off.

153
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,726
I did it with the handkerchief
he had given me.

154
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,144
I forced him

155
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,479
to stop breathing

156
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,690
with my own hands.

157
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,568
That's why, Man-gil,

158
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,154
I have to pick up

159
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,740
where he left off.

160
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:27,371
I think I finally understand why
Jesus sat with Judas at the Last Supper.

161
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,710
He must have seen Judas' devastated face
and thought, "I was right."

162
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,256
Sit down and eat.

163
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,889
It looks like Jeong Su-jin
has lost control of the reins.

164
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,565
How should I handle

165
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,359
the coachman who let go of the reins?

166
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,951
I wrote a novel when I was young.

167
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,955
Copying other writers' work
helps you become a writer.

168
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,835
You should imitate those
you want to defeat.

169
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,756
I will give everything back to you.

170
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,178
It won't take long.

171
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,395
Here is my ring

172
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,606
from our broken engagement.

173
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,737
I will see
if I have anything else to return.

174
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,418
Let's head towards Jeongbal IC.

175
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,630
That way takes longer.

176
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,095
You don't want to go by the AFC Hospital?

177
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,973
How did you feel

178
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,809
as you watched him take his last breath?

179
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,895
I am sure you remember how he looked.

180
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,904
I bet you still hear him scream
even when you cover your ears.

181
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,868
That you see his pain
even when you close your eyes.

182
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,288
You must think to yourself,
"I can't change what I did,

183
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,958
so I need to at least make sure
that it was worthwhile."

184
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,336
I swear to you…

185
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,590
that I will protect

186
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,717
your honor

187
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,386
and your family.

188
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,431
I understand.

189
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,767
What's inside me is also inside of you.

190
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,356
I finished Jang Il-jun off.

191
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,736
I did it with the handkerchief
he had given me.

192
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,070
I forced him…

193
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,490
to stop breathing

194
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,285
with my own hands.

195
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,080
That's why, Man-gil…

196
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,460
I have to pick up

197
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,754
where he left off.

198
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,465
None of this would've happened

199
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,344
if they'd disposed of the rotten apples
when Seo Gi-tae was investigating.

200
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,387
The administration would have collapsed

201
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,599
since the president's son was involved.

202
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,189
You don't cut down a tree
because there are a few rotten apples.

203
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,609
A single bug can cause
even a big tree to rot.

204
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,864
Even a pot of well-cooked rice
contains some burnt parts.

205
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,532
Rotting pus doesn't turn into flesh.

206
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,452
We must live by the same standard
we judged Jo Sang-cheon by.

207
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,418
I am sure

208
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,671
you felt unappreciated

209
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,633
that the president and Kang Sang-un met
behind your back.

210
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,511
Were you upset

211
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,557
that someone you served for ten years
was going to send you to prison?

212
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,190
I sometimes wonder

213
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,860
what would've happened

214
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,032
if Jang Il-jun had discussed
his son's issues with you first.

215
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,873
You led the smear campaign
to get Jang Il-jun elected.

216
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,543
You even fabricated documents

217
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,712
to cover up his election fund issue.
I wonder…

218
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,510
if it could've been you…

219
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,597
sitting in this chair, not me.

220
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,479
I am curious…

221
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,236
as to what made you so upset.

222
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,363
Is it a sense of justice, or…

223
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,036
is it your desire to punish
the colleagues who abandoned you?

224
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,957
How about both?

225
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,627
We are all multifaceted.

226
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,392
Prepare for the impeachment process.

227
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,644
The prime minister hasn't been confirmed.

228
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,229
Also, conduct the legal review

229
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,441
on the acting president in case
the incumbent can't perform his duty.

230
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,986
Park Dong-ho, Jeong Su-jin,
Kang Sang-un, and Jang Hyeon-su

231
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,865
will all be under investigation soon.

232
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,495
Have you not heard?

233
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,664
The recordings of
President Park and Jeong Su-jin

234
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,625
will be released to the media today.

235
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,795
President Park

236
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,297
has already prepared himself for this.

237
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,676
He instructed me to organize
a trip to the US next month

238
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,389
and prepare a draft of his UN speech
by the end of the week.

239
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,934
Those orders came this morning.

240
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,734
I hold your reins,

241
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,696
and you have the whip that can tame me.

242
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,078
I put the president into a coma,

243
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,872
and you killed the president.

244
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,711
If you can forget
how I got to the Blue House,

245
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,092
I will forget
how you finished off the president.

246
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,641
I sincerely thought…

247
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,981
you would sacrifice yourself
and jump off the cliff with all of us.

248
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,363
But you are planning on…

249
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,577
pushing everyone else off
and standing alone on the cliff.

250
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,199
The reason I visited Jang Il-jun
that rainy night

251
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,409
was to clean up the world.

252
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,953
If I were to leave now,

253
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,457
Jo Sang-cheon would still be around
after I was gone.

254
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,920
Chairman Kang would also be around
in the world I left behind.

255
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,692
How could the cleaner leave
when there is still some trash?

256
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,659
I am determined to stay in the Blue House

257
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,620
until I've cleaned every speck of dust.

258
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,419
Ma'am.

259
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,256
Please resign as chief of staff

260
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,508
as soon as
the secretary's office is set up.

261
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:43,802
Sir!

262
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,272
Thank you for the nomination.

263
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,774
I will make sure
that the new administration's tasks--

264
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,985
Park Chang-sik,
the nine-tailed fox of Yeouido,

265
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,948
switched party membership 15 times,
left the party eight times,

266
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,534
and founded six new parties.

267
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,748
An old and diligent migratory bird
from Yeouido

268
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,751
who sometimes gets confused
about which party he belongs to.

269
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,672
We conducted a survey and found
that 70% of the people perceived you

270
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,800
to be an obsolete politician.

271
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,640
This joke seems inappropriate
for an awards ceremony.

272
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:34,227
I will wash away the stains
from your 30-year political career

273
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,564
and give your image a makeover.

274
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,864
This is a list of public officials
who work for Chairman Kang.

275
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,825
I would like these people removed

276
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,286
from politics,
the legal professions, and academia.

277
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:59,127
Using a blacklist to target certain people
is legally problematic.

278
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,381
"Leader of reform
and the eradication of corruption."

279
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,637
Wouldn't that makeover be great
for your presidential campaign?

280
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,233
Ma'am.

281
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,653
Once he is officially appointed
as prime minister,

282
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,863
take over his vacant seat in Yeouido.

283
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,283
We must secure the nomination rights
for the next general election.

284
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,995
We will revolutionize our party
with new people.

285
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,458
While Park Chang-sik
reforms the government

286
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,169
and you try to innovate Yeouido,

287
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,129
can we agree

288
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,132
to delay the fulfillment of my promise?

289
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,804
I am determined to stay in the Blue House

290
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,557
until I've cleaned every speck of dust.

291
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,563
As you wish, sir.

292
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,319
Prepare for your confirmation hearing.

293
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,529
-Especially--
-Excuse me.

294
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,912
Thank you.

295
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,041
-Hello.
-Dad.

296
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,168
MACAU (CASINO HOTEL CELLAR)

297
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,836
Dad, please help me.

298
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,923
These guys are gonna kill me
if you don't send the money right away.

299
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,388
To pass the hearing,

300
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,974
there shouldn't be anything
that would upset the public,

301
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,727
including any issues
related to your children.

302
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,188
Can I count on you?

303
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,982
Of course, sir.

304
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,580
DAEJIN MEDICAL CENTER

305
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,463
I have told you

306
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,967
that half of the world's problems
come from trusting people.

307
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,390
I can no longer be useful to you.

308
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,977
You will not see me again.

309
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,313
I wish you good health.

310
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,024
Are you threatening a sick old man?

311
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,489
I want to take responsibility
for my incompetence and resign.

312
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,119
Park Dong-ho has a list of people
who look after my business.

313
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:42,707
Now, my guys can't even cough
for fear of being noticed.

314
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,210
My goodness.

315
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,796
I am short-staffed. What do I do?

316
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,510
I have no choice but to use
the incompetent coachman for now.

317
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,103
Does that mean
you are giving me another chance?

318
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,523
I hired the ladies
who clean my company buildings

319
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,983
as full-time employees.

320
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,445
They wanted to clean up
their husbands' shit,

321
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,156
so I couldn't let them work as just temps.

322
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,916
Park Dong-ho plans to use Park Chang-sik

323
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,960
to eradicate our people in the government.

324
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,547
We need to get
Park Chang-sik disqualified.

325
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,467
We invested in a casino in Macau.

326
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,389
Come in.

327
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,150
I have a fresh tip-off.

328
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,529
Contact with personnel under inspection
is prohibited by internal regulations.

329
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,074
Forward related information in writing
to the deputy chief prosecutor.

330
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,999
A high-ranking ruling party member's son
has been involved in overseas gambling.

331
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,461
I heard his gambling debt
is 500 million won.

332
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,920
He couldn't pay the debt,

333
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,049
so they are holding him
in the basement of the casino.

334
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,469
I'd be all over this case

335
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,263
if I weren't under investigation.

336
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:29,272
As you are an honorable chief prosecutor
well-trained in special investigation,

337
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,566
I'll leave this
in your capable hands, sir.

338
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,639
Nice!

339
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,226
-What the hell?
-Hey, yeah.

340
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,519
I gave him the file.

341
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,647
Listen, Su-jin.

342
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,317
My wife signed the lease
for a place near the Blue House,

343
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,903
thinking I'd be
the Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs.

344
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,698
She keeps asking me when we are moving.

345
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,120
I see. Okay, I understand. Yep.

346
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,587
God, this is so bitter.

347
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,219
Chief of Staff Choi is said to be
returning to Yeouido.

348
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:45,181
She has been contacting senior members
and other lawmakers within the party.

349
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,309
Let's take it one step at a time.

350
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,898
We've got to get rid of
Park Dong-ho's left-hand man first.

351
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,570
PRESIDENT PARK DONG-HO NOMINATES
PARK CHANG-SIK FOR PRIME MINISTER

352
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,740
THE BLUE HOUSE OFFICIAL RESIDENCE

353
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,663
Those bastards sent this.

354
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,040
My wife collapsed yesterday.

355
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,251
She has been hospitalized.

356
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,671
She never lost her smile,
even when I lost elections,

357
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,799
but she couldn't take this.

358
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,554
You can't wire the money.

359
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,307
Overseas gambling is your son's problem.

360
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,808
You will take a hit from it,

361
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,852
but you will pass
the confirmation hearing.

362
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,937
As soon as you wire the money,

363
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,899
you will be charged for violating
the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act

364
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,650
by providing illegal gambling funds.

365
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,695
How can I abandon my son to save myself?

366
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,199
The prosecution is probably
monitoring your account.

367
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,910
They will be checking
your account, your family's,

368
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,662
and even your relative's accounts
for illegal activities.

369
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,126
We will get help from the local police

370
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,546
in accordance with the law
and its principles.

371
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,591
Principles take time.

372
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,760
My wife is at her limit.

373
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,727
Can you fend off the prosecution?

374
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,314
Lee Jang-seok is in charge.

375
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,441
You are the only person

376
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,485
who can stop him.

377
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,861
RESULTS OF GAMBLING INVESTIGATION

378
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,032
I'll be your go-to guy
for as long as I am the prime minister.

379
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:29,702
The dozens of lawmakers supporting me
will be your shield.

380
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,502
Please help me save my son.

381
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,421
I am asking as a father.

382
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,268
GRAVE OF ASSEMBLYMAN SEO GI-TAE

383
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,568
The prosecutor general wants to resign.

384
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,447
Asking for the new president's trust
is just a formality.

385
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,826
I plan to accept his resignation.

386
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,954
So many issues have been amassed
over the last 70 years,

387
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,831
such as the power to issue indictments,

388
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,376
investigative authority,
and privileges of the former post.

389
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,089
Jang-seok, I want you
to take over the prosecution.

390
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,468
Please create a prosecution

391
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,138
that fights injustice
without becoming one itself.

392
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,602
Get yourself off all your current cases.

393
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,313
Don't make enemies for now.

394
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,523
Assemblyman Park reached out to me.

395
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:46,404
He told me to slow the investigation
and said I should hear from you.

396
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,372
I wondered on the way here…

397
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,544
whether you would threaten me

398
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,588
or ask me for a favor.

399
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,340
Wow, anyway…

400
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,552
what a good friend you are.

401
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,013
You're even getting me a good job.

402
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,557
Come on, Jang-seok.

403
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,975
Drop it

404
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,186
just this once.

405
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,396
You know it won't be just once.

406
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,065
He has a job to do as the prime minister.

407
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:22,982
Is that why…

408
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,863
you are preventing me from doing my job?

409
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,752
Do you remember the Jang Hyeon-su case?

410
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,838
Why didn't you drop it?

411
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:50,927
You should have ordered an investigation
into your son's illegal activity.

412
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,804
President Jang Il-jun

413
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,348
also had a lot to do as the president.

414
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,477
Please resign from your position

415
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,107
because the future you create
shouldn't be a part of history.

416
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,819
Don't ask me to do

417
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,196
what you failed to do.

418
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,542
I intend to do my job.

419
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,962
Transfer me anywhere you want.

420
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,508
If you want a hunting dog
for your administration,

421
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,510
there are plenty in the prosecution.

422
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,429
I can even recommend one.

423
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,222
RESIGNATION LETTER

424
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,328
"I, Park Chang-sik, solemnly swear

425
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,748
that I will speak honestly

426
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:05,293
without attempting to conceal
or embellish anything

427
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:10,757
at the confirmation hearing
held by the National Assembly."

428
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,593
He will acknowledge his son's gambling

429
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,971
but plans to deny
his illegal overseas money transfer.

430
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,182
Everyone has a plan.

431
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:23,603
We will now begin the hearing
for the nominee, Mr. Park Chang-sik.

432
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,815
Please proceed, Assemblyman Min
of the Korean Liberal Party.

433
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:34,614
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE CONFIRMATION HEARING

434
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,242
The extinction
of local communities is serious.

435
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,288
I heard your constituency
will soon be merged.

436
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,749
MIN BYEONG-IL
KOREAN LIBERAL PARTY ASSEMBLYMAN

437
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,253
I can keep that from happening.

438
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,758
Your political career will be over
if your constituency disappears.

439
00:34:56,886 --> 00:35:00,014
A casino manager testified
that he released your son

440
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,058
after receiving 500 million won.

441
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,521
Is it true that you transferred
the money illegally?

442
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,028
Words also carry weight.

443
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,657
The words of an employee of a casino

444
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,159
and the words of
a prime minister candidate

445
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,662
cannot carry the same weight.

446
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,749
Show me the evidence.

447
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,962
Do not rely on hearsay.
Submit the evidence if you have any.

448
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,672
When making inquiries,

449
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,298
you must

450
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,135
accurately confirm the facts

451
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,387
and have a legal basis.

452
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,972
I gave Assemblyman Min

453
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,433
the investigative information
from the Macau Police Agency.

454
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:49,105
I asked you to submit the evidence
if you have any.

455
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,363
ONE DAY BEFORE THE CONFIRMATION HEARING

456
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,991
You got the Political Funds Act passed,

457
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,285
but the money you took…

458
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:07,957
Sure, every politician does politics
on someone else's dime.

459
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,376
I understand.

460
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,884
However, the CIO doesn't agree

461
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,094
with me on this.

462
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,017
Would you rather protect

463
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,352
your constituency or your future?

464
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,984
No more inquiries.

465
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,618
Mr. Min appears to have sided
with Park Chang-sik.

466
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,873
RESIGNATION LETTER

467
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,883
Are you going to continue lying
in this hallowed hall?

468
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,556
Don't ask me to do

469
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,851
what you failed to do.

470
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,814
Do you think you can defeat me?

471
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,733
Do not forget

472
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:20,821
that Park Dong-ho's time
is connected to Jang Il-jun's time.

473
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,561
Hello.

474
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,397
Jang-seok.

475
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,149
Don't change who you are.

476
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,485
How about you?

477
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,946
I am going to change

478
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,323
the world.

479
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:11,998
Breaking news.

480
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,209
The Seoul Central DPO
has just arrested a suspect

481
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,087
for illegally transferring money
to a casino operator in Macau.

482
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,673
The suspect is
the brother-in-law of Mr. Kim,

483
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,592
secretary to Mr. Park Chang-sik,
prime minister candidate.

484
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,387
The prosecution believes
that he illegally sent the money

485
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,723
to the casino
at his brother-in-law's request

486
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,017
and is tracking
Secretary Kim's whereabouts,

487
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,768
but he is currently out of contact.

488
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,564
The prosecution is focusing on
finding Secretary Kim

489
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,150
and said they will further investigate

490
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,319
Mr. Park Chang-sik's involvement.

491
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,839
Lee Jae-cheon, former chairman of the BAI,

492
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,799
and Yoo Hong-man,
former chairman of the KITA,

493
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,470
both turned down a nomination
to be the prime minister.

494
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,681
The administration could look weak
without a prime minister.

495
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,767
Jeong Su-jin will foster
a lame-duck session.

496
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,060
If that happens,

497
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,270
you could be a lame-duck president.

498
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,148
You can run the government
under the deputy prime--

499
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,441
No.

500
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,528
I'll appoint a new prime minister.

501
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,075
Even senior members of the party
are refusing to be nominated.

502
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,869
Elders from all the organizations
are rejecting our offer…

503
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:32,787
There is one!

504
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,376
Someone who agreed to be nominated

505
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,420
and already submitted a consent form.

506
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,381
DAEJIN MEDICAL CENTER

507
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,552
My sincere apologies

508
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,262
for having worried you.

509
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,140
We old people have nothing to do

510
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,184
but worry.

511
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,939
I will now remove
Park Dong-ho's right-hand man.

512
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,191
It's Choi Yeon-sook's Achilles heel--

513
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:06,904
Father!

514
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,990
The Park administration

515
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,660
has decided to nominate

516
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,956
Assemblywoman Jeong Su-jin
as the next prime minister.

517
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,709
She will faithfully carry out
the current administration's tasks

518
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,213
as the deputy prime minister
in the previous administration

519
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,882
and will be an asset
to the Park administration…

520
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,884
I sent documents to Park Chang-sik

521
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,804
as to who made the report
about his son's overseas gambling.

522
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,055
JEONG PIL-GYU

523
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,142
I explained to him how Jeong Su-jin used

524
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:40,938
the media and the prosecution
to slaughter Park Chang-sik and his son.

525
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,899
I sent documents to Jo Sang-cheon

526
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,153
as to who tipped me off
about his half-brother.

527
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,072
Jo Sang-cheon now knows

528
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,200
who reopened his old wounds

529
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,912
to bring him to his knees
during the last presidential election.

530
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:01,417
Park Chang-sik and Jo Sang-cheon
are the leaders of two major parties.

531
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,087
The anger of the two giants
is directed at Jeong Su-jin.

532
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,756
Park Chang-sik will hack her to pieces,

533
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,550
and Jo Sang-cheon will chew her up.

534
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,888
Her family will be destroyed,
and her husband will be exposed.

535
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:14,930
So the question is,

536
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,267
can she survive the hearing?

537
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,438
This hearing will be…

538
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,026
the execution ground for Jeong Su-jin.

539
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,784
THE WHIRLWIND
