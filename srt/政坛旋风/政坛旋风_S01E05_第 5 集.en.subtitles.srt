00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,014
TEN YEARS AGO / SEOUL DETENTION CENTER

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,432
Mr. Kang! The detention warrant…

3
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,060
The detention warrant
for Executive Director Kang was dismissed.

4
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:23,064
As a result, an investigation into
Daejin's slush fund has become difficult.

5
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,524
The prosecution is

6
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:27,986
investigating offshore tax havens
suspected of being hiding places for…

7
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:31,322
I will reapply for a detention warrant
for additional offshore accounts--

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,159
We have new personnel orders.

9
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,828
He is going to the Wonju Office, and I…

10
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,746
Damn it.

11
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,248
They are shipping me
to the Institute of Justice

12
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,332
to organize textbooks.

13
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,253
I am grateful to the court
for stopping unreasonable investigations.

14
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,756
Do you have anything to say
to the investigators?

15
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:52,594
I truly hope
they learned their lesson this time.

16
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,185
We, prosecutors, don't catch
who we want to catch…

17
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,607
but the bastards we can catch.

18
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,612
Go to the Tongyeong office
for a few years.

19
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,030
Learn how to fish while there.

20
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,867
Did you get promoted
for covering up this case, sir?

21
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,038
You need to learn some manners too.

22
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:24,042
Thanks to you, I have learned
you need power to take out the trash.

23
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:36,387
I can gather the disciplinary committee.
Do you want to be debarred?

24
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,515
Climb the ladder

25
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,683
as high as you can.

26
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,646
No matter where you end up,

27
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,482
you will be beneath me.

28
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,451
Laugh away.

29
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,870
You will soon be crying.

30
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:28,481
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING

31
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,861
Oh my, Prosecutor Park Dong-ho.

32
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:38,575
Why did it take you so long to accept
my invitation to the National Assembly?

33
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,536
Sit down.

34
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,084
I had to hang up my hat

35
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,587
while investigating the Daejin slush fund.

36
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,090
Sir, will you put a new hat on me?

37
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,636
How could I not
when I have such quality material?

38
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,016
Leave the cutting and sewing to me.

39
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,227
As a lawmaker,
I'll open a probe into the Daejin Group.

40
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,563
Rotting pus doesn't turn into flesh.

41
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,398
Let's carve it all out.

42
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,650
We will get severe backlash.

43
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,907
To get to you,
they will have to go through me first.

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,244
We have lawmakers
connected to Daejin within our party.

45
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,415
Before the Korean independent activist
Yun Bong-gil set off a bomb at a park,

46
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,709
he swapped watches with Mr. Kim Koo.

47
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,420
Don't you think that meant

48
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,715
they wanted to share responsibility
for their past and future lives?

49
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,723
Whatever you do from now on,

50
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,808
you will have my full support.

51
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,256
My goodness! It's still broad daylight.

52
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,008
I can't wait till sunset
to celebrate this with a drink.

53
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,719
Wait. Before we do that…

54
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,267
can you take a picture of us, Ms. Jeong?

55
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,184
Of course.

56
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,814
One, two, three.

57
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,315
ONCE AGAIN,
THE KOREAN LIBERAL PARTY

58
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,192
With one day left
until candidate registration,

59
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,821
there are reports of discord
due to friction between Mr. Park Dong-ho

60
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,823
and the leadership of his party.

61
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:46,911
Mr. Jo of the New Conservative Party
submitted his declaration of candidacy

62
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,913
at the NEC this morning.

63
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,833
Amidst the controversy
over the candidate replacement,

64
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,877
Mr. Park is yet to register
as a candidate--

65
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,302
The acting leader of the party is refusing
to sign your declaration of candidacy.

66
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,638
A general meeting is currently in session.

67
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:14,105
We will now vote on
disqualifying Mr. Park's candidacy.

68
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,358
All those who agree, please stand.

69
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,405
GENERAL MEETING
OF THE KOREAN LIBERAL PARTY

70
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,711
Tomorrow is the last day of registration.

71
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,839
There is not enough time
to replace the candidate.

72
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,258
You can't choose defeat
because you don't have time.

73
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,094
Some believe it to be antiquated
to replace a candidate

74
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,805
elected through a primary
due to low approval ratings.

75
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,810
Some despicable transactions occurred
during the primary election.

76
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,814
I ask you this, Mr. Park Dong-ho.

77
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,441
Can you truly claim…

78
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,568
WILL THE KOREAN LIBERAL PARTY
REPLACE THEIR CANDIDATE?

79
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,029
…that your candidacy was earned fairly?

80
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,114
RESOLUTION TO TERMINATE
PARK'S CANDIDACY PASSED

81
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,830
THE WHIRLWIND

82
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,792
EPISODE 5

83
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,879
30 YEARS AGO / THE SECURITY BRANCH

84
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,686
Jeong Su-jin!

85
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,146
Speak up, bitch!

86
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,103
LEE MAN-GIL

87
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,652
Ma'am, Park Dong-ho has disappeared.

88
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,157
He has been off-grid since last night.

89
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,826
The advisory group visited his home
to ask him to resign,

90
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,119
but he never came home.

91
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,498
-And the campaign committee?
-They've sent out the election material.

92
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,582
It doesn't seem like

93
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,542
he will resign.

94
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,839
There is a difference
in approval rating of over 20%.

95
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,967
He cannot possibly win.

96
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,390
If it's a fight worth fighting,
we will have to try.

97
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,518
The Central Committee will convene soon.

98
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,978
Immediately after the announcement,

99
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,105
the Central Committee will elect me,

100
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,484
the second-highest ranked candidate
in the primary, as a candidate.

101
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,444
I have my declaration of candidacy ready.

102
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,988
Whether to lose with Park Dong-ho

103
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,074
or to win with Jeong Su-jin…

104
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,202
Is it a difficult choice?

105
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,666
I doubt you want to see the world

106
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,584
ruled by Jo Sang-cheon.

107
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,213
I wonder if you cried…

108
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,091
or

109
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,926
laughed…

110
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,305
when President Jang

111
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,267
died by your hand.

112
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,355
The death of the president

113
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,149
freed you from the prosecution's scrutiny.

114
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,330
You will have the power

115
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,166
to nominate anybody
for mayoral, gubernatorial,

116
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,919
and metropolitan area heads.

117
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,547
A future promised
by someone who hides the past.

118
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,092
Can it be trusted?

119
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,010
Is that why…

120
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,931
you chose

121
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,892
to trust Park Dong-ho?

122
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,064
Do you know

123
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,899
what Park Dong-ho did…

124
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,405
to the late president?

125
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,453
I tried to assassinate the president.

126
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,247
Mr. Prime Minster!

127
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:30,046
He confessed his assassination attempt
and put his fate in my hands.

128
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,924
That is why I trust him.

129
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:39,305
The deadline for candidate registration
is coming up this afternoon,

130
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,390
but Mr. Park Dong-ho
has not yet registered.

131
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,519
The Korean Liberal Party is holding
a Central Committee to switch candidates.

132
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,481
Four hours from now,
the Korean Liberal Party will face

133
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,485
the situation of failing to register
a candidate for the first time in history.

134
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:57,948
Thank you.

135
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,367
Thank you so much.

136
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,672
Nine years ago,

137
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,050
when we lost
our first presidential election,

138
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,885
President Jang and I

139
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,514
started drinking here just after midnight.

140
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,142
We drank more than ten bottles
with just one snack.

141
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,356
He really loved soju.

142
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,402
Four years ago,

143
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,904
everyone was excited

144
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,323
when Jang Il-jun won,

145
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,243
thinking everything would be different.

146
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,956
Please resign from your position.

147
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,749
Because the future you create

148
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,251
shouldn't be a part of history.

149
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,424
If only we hadn't informed
Deputy Prime Minister Jeong at that time…

150
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,426
The president's son, Jang Hyeon-su,

151
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,679
profited exponentially
from a private equity fund.

152
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,805
Using that as a pretext,

153
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,100
someone connected
Vice Chairman Kang to the president.

154
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,144
We need to find that person.

155
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,400
Who gave you

156
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,069
this dossier?

157
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,779
I trusted her

158
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,740
because of how she had led her life.

159
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,617
For receiving a bribe
from a high school classmate,

160
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,244
the chairman of crypto brokerage--

161
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,832
It's political retaliation,

162
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,126
a warning not to dig further
into the fund case.

163
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,627
Listen, Gi-tae.

164
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,715
The government is investigating to find
the party responsible for the case.

165
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,925
-So just hang on--
-I talked to the prosecution.

166
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,304
The person who used
the Political Funds Act

167
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,098
and orchestrated this charade
to silence me

168
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,142
is Jeong Su-jin.

169
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,394
I should've known…

170
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,774
that what had changed wasn't the world

171
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,942
but the people who came into power.

172
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,239
I trusted you.

173
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,824
The people also trust

174
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,577
that the Jang administration is fair.

175
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,121
I don't want to break…

176
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,000
their trust.

177
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,796
A world of fairness…

178
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:19,924
and justice.

179
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,886
Those who promised to make
this world heaven on earth

180
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,222
turned this place into hell.

181
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,226
Jeong-yeon.

182
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,395
Do not trust anyone
who promises you the future.

183
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,314
Whatever the future holds,

184
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,359
they will try to own it.

185
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,403
You will be different.

186
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,784
I've given up on the future.

187
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,918
But if the world I want to create comes,

188
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,296
I will not be in it.

189
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,473
Park Dong-ho's whereabouts
have been confirmed.

190
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,393
But…

191
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,526
Su-jin.

192
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,907
It's been a pleasant visit.

193
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,077
How Lenin came to quit smoking--

194
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,037
Registration ends at five o'clock.

195
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,039
If you don't resign right now--

196
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,708
That's why I am here.

197
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,085
Because time is on my side now.

198
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,299
Since it has been a while,

199
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,593
this is going to be my treat today.

200
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,510
Soon,

201
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,221
the Central Committee will be meeting.

202
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,265
-We will have the course meal.
-Yes, ma'am.

203
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,477
This will take us about two hours.

204
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,479
If we fail to attend,

205
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:02,067
the Central Committee will be stalled
due to a lack of quorums.

206
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,362
With all due respect,

207
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,116
none of you will be getting
a nomination, will you?

208
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,663
Joining the quorum of 200

209
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,457
or joining this table of ten,

210
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,792
which of the two do you think

211
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,420
would be more beneficial to you?

212
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,592
Please relax and enjoy.

213
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,135
Today,

214
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,387
our meeting

215
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,640
will strengthen your network.

216
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,941
You either help me
to become the president…

217
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,527
or…

218
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,624
choose the world in which Jo Sang-cheon

219
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,043
is the president.

220
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,723
MEMBERS' OFFICE BUILDING

221
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,738
ASSEMBLYWOMAN JEONG SU-JIN

222
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,534
JEONG SU-JIN/THE DECLARATION OF CANDIDACY
FOR THE 21ST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

223
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,247
SECRETARY JEONG HYE-IN

224
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,796
Ma'am, I can't find
your declaration of candidacy.

225
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,091
We have the document.

226
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,884
Burn it.

227
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,482
All righty,

228
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,027
where is Han Min-ho?

229
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,612
The chairman of the NCSR.

230
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,740
Tell me where he is.

231
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,708
I'd be able to manage
in Jo Sang-cheon's country.

232
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,920
Would you?

233
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:32,885
I don't know.

234
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,929
-I really don't.
-Su-jin.

235
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,474
Don't you miss your mom?

236
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,976
Do you want to get out?

237
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,895
Or would you rather…

238
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,608
we bring her here?

239
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,410
We have two hours

240
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,871
until registration closes.

241
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,457
Then, Jo Sang-cheon will be the president.

242
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,210
You, Jeong Su-jin,

243
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,879
will have made it happen.

244
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,533
Connect me to the acting leader.

245
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,998
This is Jeong Su-jin.

246
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,502
Please sign the document.

247
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,349
The National Election Commission received
Mr. Park's declaration of candidacy

248
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,017
thirty minutes before the deadline.

249
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,435
The conflict within the party

250
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,480
regarding the candidate replacement
appears to have been resolved.

251
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,899
Ms. Jeong, who advocated
for candidate replacement,

252
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,734
has joined the campaign committee

253
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:16,780
and stated that they will work as a team
to win the presidential election.

254
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,242
Why is Jeong Su-jin
part of our campaign committee?

255
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,910
She will be an asset.

256
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,746
She has influence
over President Jang's supporters.

257
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,999
She will help with all her heart.

258
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,127
My world will be a nightmare for her,

259
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,714
but Jo Sang-cheon's world
would be a living hell.

260
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,551
GRAVE OF PRESIDENT JANG IL-JUN

261
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,599
20 DAYS TO THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
OFFICIAL START OF THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN

262
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,383
My husband wore this watch for ten years
ever since he became an assemblyman.

263
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,636
Although his time was up,

264
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,305
I am glad

265
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,808
we have someone
who can pick up where he left off.

266
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,396
Don't you think that meant

267
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,984
they wanted to share responsibility
for their past and future lives?

268
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,131
Rotting pus doesn't turn into flesh.

269
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,925
Let's carve it all out.

270
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,386
I will not forget the path
he intended to go down

271
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,555
when he first put on this watch
ten years ago.

272
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,735
You will win back the supporters.

273
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,571
Your visit to the grave

274
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,491
with the first lady today
legitimized your succession.

275
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,620
And that watch is
like a holy grail to them.

276
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,999
From now on,
I will be in charge of his schedule.

277
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,253
Attending the groundbreaking ceremony
for Jang Il-jun Memorial Hall

278
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,630
and his Memorial Foundation ceremony,

279
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,716
and giving a speech
at his memorial ritual…

280
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,093
We will dedicate our schedule to winning

281
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,387
the votes of Jang Il-jun's supporters.

282
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,891
Please show your supporters
that you are wearing Jang Il-jun's watch

283
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,810
during all future events.

284
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,814
We must win.

285
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,156
In my first trial yesterday,

286
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,283
the prosecutor requested
the maximum sentence.

287
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,452
The sentencing hearing is next month.

288
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,913
If you appeal in an appellate court
and appeal to the Supreme Court,

289
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,000
it will take more than a year.

290
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,543
Do not rush.

291
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,544
I did it for you--

292
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:21,340
I know this all happened
because you tried to get me pardoned.

293
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,300
I will take over from here.

294
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,302
Dad.

295
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,637
A father has to put out the fire
his son started.

296
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,814
Now I have heard your plan.

297
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,274
Sang-jin,

298
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,860
make sure to get her anything she needs.

299
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,195
Yes, sir.

300
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,032
KANG SANG-JIN
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF DAEJIN GROUP

301
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,995
It may not be possible to save

302
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,748
both Vice Chairman Kang and Daejin Group.

303
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,708
If that is the case…

304
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,340
I have three sons

305
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,175
but only one company.

306
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,555
You do the math.

307
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:30,075
NORTH KOREA SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHES ICBM
PACIFIC TARGET HIT

308
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,993
At 08:13 this morning,

309
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,747
North Korea launched an ICBM, Hwasong-15.

310
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,501
It is reported that Hwasong-15
successfully entered the atmosphere

311
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,421
and hit its target in the Pacific Ocean.

312
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:47,008
It could be risky for us
to comment on North Korea right now.

313
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:52,347
I've been given
a strong vaccine dose for North Korea,

314
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,349
so I am probably immune to it.

315
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,311
Let's detonate the bomb

316
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,732
that North Korea shot today
in Park Dong-ho's face.

317
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,944
Article 3
of the Inter-Korean Summit Agreement.

318
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:10,782
"South and North Korea will cease
any military provocations

319
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,327
that harm peace and coexistence."

320
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,122
We stopped

321
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,959
the loudspeaker broadcasts in the DMZ

322
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,712
and reduced the frontline positions.

323
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,047
North Korea developed an ICBM

324
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,425
while our hands were tied
behind our backs.

325
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,344
ICBMs are now targeting the US…

326
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:35,015
Providing aid to North Korea
is President Jang's core achievement.

327
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,641
If we put a stop to it,

328
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,810
his supporters will be upset.

329
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,606
But if we continue,
the moderates will turn their backs on us.

330
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,742
The Jang administration's support is
limited to medical and humanitarian aid,

331
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,160
and the UN also approved--

332
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,829
They bought weapons
with the money we gave them,

333
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,332
and you want to keep giving them more?

334
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,168
My fellow Koreans,

335
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,754
at this critical time,

336
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,089
you must not choose someone

337
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,301
with a dubious view
of the nation as president.

338
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,515
We can't pick someone
with a dubious view of the nation.

339
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,975
37 YEARS AGO / BAR EXAM INTERVIEW ROOM

340
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,394
Your father has been taken to North Korea…

341
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,525
"We are born into this land,
charged with the historic mission

342
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,109
of regenerating the nation!"

343
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,862
"It is the time to establish
a self-reliant defense within

344
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,990
and contribute to the co-prosperity
of humanity outside our borders

345
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,743
by revitalizing
the eminent spirit of our ancestors!"

346
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,912
We live in a divided nation

347
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,166
with hundreds of thousands of people
pointing guns at the MDL.

348
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,627
Catch a communist
if you want to avoid suspicion.

349
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:47,879
Yes, sir.

350
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,298
I have dealt with 12 cases of espionage

351
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,300
and three cases of insurrection.

352
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,843
I, Jo Sang-cheon,

353
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:58,431
have devoted my entire life
to protecting the Republic of Korea.

354
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,767
Tell me, bitch!

355
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,440
I will say what needs to be said
to North Korea.

356
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,652
I will be the president
that North Korea will fear.

357
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,571
My fellow Koreans,

358
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,030
this presidential election

359
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:18,201
is the second Korean War!

360
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,589
North Korea conducted
an additional nuclear test yesterday,

361
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,259
causing a 4.1-magnitude earthquake
in Seoul and the metropolitan area.

362
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:38,555
North Korea has now secured the ability
to develop tactical nuclear weapons

363
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:42,100
that can target and strike
the Korean Peninsula within ten minutes.

364
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,685
Jo Sang-cheon!

365
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,021
North Korea may have nuclear weapons,

366
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,856
but South Korea has

367
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,942
me, Jo Sang-cheon!

368
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,737
I will

369
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,907
keep our country safe!

370
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,245
JO SANG-CHEON FOR NATIONAL SECURITY

371
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,169
The Jang administration
had the most conciliatory policy.

372
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,755
Why did the North do this now?

373
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,882
I don't understand them.

374
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,844
Don't try to understand
unreasonable people.

375
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,682
We need to revise our campaign strategy.

376
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,392
If we stay on this path,

377
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,102
we will lose the election.

378
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,486
This is Park Dong-ho.

379
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,363
I have something from the NIS.

380
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,990
I'd like to show it to you.

381
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,464
I put it aside
when I was sent to work at the NIS.

382
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,261
My cousin had a big dream.

383
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,221
I thought this might help someday.

384
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:46,808
Take it.

385
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,352
It's a gift from

386
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,188
your senior secretary for civil affairs.

387
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,735
That position is

388
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,113
in charge of the prosecution
and the inspectorate.

389
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,409
His keen eye can distinguish

390
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,203
between what to go after

391
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,497
and what not to go after.

392
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,584
So he won't go after you
or the private equity fund case.

393
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,711
Of course.

394
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,337
But he will go after those

395
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,798
who are a threat to you.

396
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,607
Well…

397
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,041
You've given me too much.

398
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,965
Leaving the past behind

399
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,009
hurt.

400
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,179
Jeong-yeon.

401
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,641
I will give everything back to you…

402
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,315
including the five years
we spent together.

403
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,615
It won't take long.

404
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,034
I have given up one thing.

405
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,371
You should also give up one, at least.

406
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,042
Even if I have to give up everything,

407
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,670
I will bring you to justice…

408
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,340
no matter what.

409
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,759
Jo Dal-hyeon, Jo Sang-cheon's father,

410
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,553
was kidnapped by North Korea in 1978,

411
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,597
remarried in Jagang-do camp,
and had a son there.

412
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,895
Jo Sang-cheon's brother is in North Korea.

413
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:02,193
No, his brother died
during the North Korean famine in 1996.

414
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,705
During the famine,

415
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,792
millions of people starved to death,

416
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,715
but those who had relatives in Japan
or families in South Korea survived.

417
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,552
They secretly sent US dollars over.

418
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,015
Jo Sang-cheon

419
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,767
sent US dollars to the North…

420
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:45,361
The key to the Blue House
is in my hand, sir.

421
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,450
The position of president
comes with enemies.

422
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,995
If you cannot remove them,
you should control them.

423
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,121
I will gladly…

424
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,750
serve you, sir.

425
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,969
Mr. Jo Sang-cheon argued
at a press conference today

426
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,013
that we must be armed with nuclear weapons

427
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,057
if North Korea does not denuclearize

428
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,725
and also demanded Mr. Park Dong-ho

429
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:19,020
make his position clear
on the North Korea issue.

430
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,566
North Korea's nuclear test widens
the gap between the two candidates to 10%.

431
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,278
If this continues,
Mr. Jo Sang-cheon will likely be elected.

432
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,521
The key to the Blue House

433
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,481
is in my hand, sir.

434
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:11,990
We must win.

435
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,575
I must win.

436
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,829
Because the future you create

437
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,498
shouldn't be a part of history.

438
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,724
This is Park Dong-ho.

439
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,643
I will give you what you asked.

440
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:42,770
Can I get

441
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,815
the material right now?

442
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,829
PARK DONG-HO'S CAMPAIGN CAMP

443
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:11,924
I have heard

444
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,721
they gave you something
in exchange for a seat at the table.

445
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,767
I had no choice.

446
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,688
The day Jang Il-jun met
with Kang Sang-un for the first time,

447
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,400
he said he had no choice.

448
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,701
I won't let you become
another Jang Il-jun.

449
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,828
You asked me for one month

450
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,247
to turn the world upside down.

451
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,084
I have that promise in a safe in my room.

452
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,220
The Jang administration

453
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:01,265
gave North Korea over $700,000,000.

454
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,227
If Mr. Park Dong-ho

455
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,521
is elected president,

456
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,314
I will be so worried.

457
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,276
-How much will he give them?
-$5,000.

458
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,657
$5,000!

459
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,494
On September 17, 1996,

460
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,455
did you give that money
to your father in Chinese territory

461
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,832
along the Amnok River?

462
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,460
During the North Korean famine in 1996,

463
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,921
were you not contacted
by a broker asking for help

464
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:34,465
on behalf of your father, Jo Dal-hyeon?

465
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,346
Your father sent a letter.

466
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,184
He said they had nothing to eat,
and they were starving to death.

467
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,020
What are we going to do, Sang-cheon?

468
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,065
You see,

469
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,775
the presidential debate

470
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:56,320
is all about discussing policies
for the future of the country,

471
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,780
not private matters--

472
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,366
Talk about a dubious view of the nation.

473
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,451
You must not choose someone

474
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,246
with a dubious view
of the nation as president.

475
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,084
This is Mr. Jo's immigration record
during that time.

476
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,132
CHINESE TERRITORY
ALONG THE AMNOK RIVER IN 1996

477
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:25,725
I have an affidavit from the broker
who arranged contact within North Korea.

478
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:32,773
Who did you give that $5,000 to
by the Amnok River at that time?

479
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,359
Well…

480
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,123
Father has been sick
for a little over a month.

481
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,418
He will recover quickly
once he eats rice and meat soup.

482
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,753
Wait.

483
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,297
Your name is…

484
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,216
My name is Jo Sang-min.

485
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,259
Jo Sang-min!

486
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,720
Is it true that you gave $5,000

487
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,014
to Jo Sang-min,
your half-brother in North Korea?

488
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,443
My oh my.

489
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:21,614
I just made sure
my starving father had something to eat.

490
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,867
I don't know what all the fuss is about.

491
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:25,993
My goodness.

492
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,413
I guess you don't care about your family

493
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,499
as long as you have a full belly.

494
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:32,833
He took the bait.

495
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:37,255
We have missiles flying over our heads,
and you're bringing up my family history.

496
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,632
Family history becomes
the history of the nation.

497
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,009
North Korea just tested
its nuclear weapons.

498
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,054
They intend to turn
this country into an inferno.

499
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,597
Who was behind the nuclear test?

500
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,144
Go ahead.

501
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:56,190
A nuclear physicist who graduated
from Kimchaek Tech and studied in Russia.

502
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,527
The hero of the Republic and the backbone
of their nuclear development.

503
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,028
Jo Sang-min.

504
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,239
JO SANG-MIN

505
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,575
Jo Sang-min

506
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,830
is also playing a leading role
in the development of neutron bombs.

507
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,500
It's not the Jang administration's aid
that's destroying our land,

508
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,752
but Jo Sang-min,

509
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:20,047
Jo Sang-cheon's brother,
who carries out Kim Jong Un's orders.

510
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,095
I

511
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,347
have dedicated myself

512
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,393
to my country for the past 40 years!

513
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,896
"Our lives should pursue
a democratic spirit against communism

514
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,523
and devotion to our nation!"

515
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,776
"That is the foundation
to fulfill the ideals of a free world!"

516
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,986
Jo Sang-min also

517
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,572
has dedicated himself to his country.

518
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,907
22 YEARS AGO
KIMCHAEK TECH INTERVIEW ROOM

519
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,200
The magnificent sun

520
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,078
Absorbed its energy from Mt. Baekdu…

521
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,079
JO SANG-MIN

522
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,459
And it brings mercy to all the people…

523
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,461
"The future of a glorious,
unified homeland

524
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,339
that will forever be passed down
to future generations…"

525
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,300
Revolution, revolution…

526
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,642
At that time,

527
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,937
had Mr. Jo not given $5,000 to his brother

528
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,106
and had Jo Sang-min
not endured the famine,

529
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,859
they would not have been able
to develop nuclear weapons.

530
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,662
Wait, hold on a second.

531
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,045
What?

532
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,922
Got something to say?

533
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,802
Goodbye, Jo Sang-cheon.

534
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,061
The presidential election exit polls
will be announced in one minute.

535
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:01,065
This presidential election
recorded a voter turnout of 72.4%.

536
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:04,193
This election was held
due to the death of President Jang.

537
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,820
The president-elect

538
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,739
will begin running the government
without a transition team

539
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,492
after a simple inauguration ceremony
tomorrow morning.

540
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,078
We are about to find out
who will take responsibility

541
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:18,374
for this nation of change and hope
after the chaotic past few months.

542
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,542
Nine!

543
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,584
Eight!

544
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,752
Seven!

545
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:22,711
Six!

546
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,713
Five! Four!

547
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,632
Three! Two!

548
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,050
One!

549
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,970
PRESIDENT-ELECT
PARK DONG-HO

550
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:58,914
Park Dong-ho!

551
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:03,544
Park Dong-ho!

552
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,340
Park Dong-ho!

553
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,530
"I, Park Dong-ho,

554
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:35,743
do solemnly swear before the people
that I will faithfully execute the duties

555
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:40,080
by observing the Constitution,
defending the state,

556
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:44,168
pursuing the peaceful unification
of the homeland,

557
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,796
promoting the freedom
and welfare of the people,

558
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:52,092
and endeavoring
to develop the national culture."

559
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,783
Thank you for taking on
the chief secretary position, ma'am.

560
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,286
Lee Cheol-min as
the senior secretary for political affairs

561
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,081
and Bae Jong-su as the senior secretary
for personnel affairs,

562
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,375
but for the senior secretary
for civil affairs--

563
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,211
I cannot bring in a prosecutor
who is undergoing inspection.

564
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,674
I am Prosecutor Lee Han-yong.

565
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,593
We are here to investigate
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Jeong Pil-gyu.

566
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,514
What?

567
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,059
Please cooperate.

568
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,691
THE BLUE HOUSE

569
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,229
I tried to assassinate the president.

570
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,733
Mr. Prime Minister!

571
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:35,404
With these hands,
I wanted to stop his heart from beating.

572
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,665
You will appoint
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Jeong

573
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,584
as the senior secretary for civil affairs,

574
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,794
just as you promised.

575
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,299
How… did you get that?

576
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,846
I knew of its existence.

577
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:07,561
He confessed his assassination attempt
and put his fate in my hands.

578
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,900
And you led me to its location.

579
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,861
I won't let you become
another Jang Il-jun.

580
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,738
You asked me for one month

581
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,990
to turn the world upside down.

582
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:21,867
I have that promise

583
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,119
in a safe in my room.

584
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,082
Thank you for refusing
to shake my hand yesterday

585
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,585
when the exit polls came out.

586
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,337
I was able to leave the venue early

587
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,923
to sneak into that room.

588
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,063
Do not forget…

589
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,109
that Park Dong-ho's time

590
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,363
is connected to Jang Il-jun's time.

591
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,033
What is your plan?

592
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,077
I've already told you

593
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,371
that if you cannot remove enemies,

594
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,541
you should control them.

595
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,350
THE WHIRLWIND
