00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,184
7 1/2 HOURS UNTIL THE ARREST
OF PRIME MINISTER PARK

3
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,603
<i>A day before the prime minister's summons,</i>

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:25,775
<i>the prosecution, giving up their days off,</i>
<i>is working to spur the investigation.</i>

5
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,320
<i>The prosecution is confident</i>
<i>in proving its accusations</i>

6
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:34,034
<i>and intends to request a detention warrant</i>
<i>when the interrogation ends tomorrow.</i>

7
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:38,788
<i>To prepare for the unprecedented arrest</i>
<i>of a sitting prime minister,</i>

8
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,458
<i>the Seoul Detention Center</i>
<i>has completed repair work</i>

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,585
<i>on the building</i>
<i>ready for the prime minister.</i>

10
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,005
<i>The prime minister</i>
<i>is accused of accepting a bribe</i>

11
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,215
<i>from Mr. Choi,</i>
<i>the chairman of a crypto brokerage,</i>

12
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,218
<i>under the pretext</i>
<i>of defusing a tax investigation.</i>

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,481
THE BLUE HOUSE

14
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,667
Oh my.

15
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,754
This orchid was fine yesterday.

16
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,051
When it comes to being troubled
by someone I considered my own,

17
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,763
orchids and politics are the same,
wouldn't you agree?

18
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,141
It was you<i>, </i>Mr. President, who pruned me.

19
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,812
But <i>you </i>challenged me first.

20
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:48,650
I tracked down the slush funds distributed
by the Daejin Group to politicians

21
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,110
while doing my job, sir.

22
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,448
And I discovered money
that you shouldn't have received.

23
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,411
JANG IL-JUN
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

24
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,038
Have I ever made you feel unappreciated?

25
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,916
No, sir.

26
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,003
Have I failed
to provide adequate positions

27
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,756
for your people?

28
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,640
I made you the prime minister
as you have a good head on your shoulders.

29
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,145
Dong-ho.

30
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,523
Was it that difficult

31
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,484
to cover up my shortcomings
with the position I gave you?

32
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,571
"I will end
corporate-government collusion."

33
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,157
It was your campaign promise, sir.

34
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,286
I made so many campaign promises.

35
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,121
"I will complete conglomerate reform."

36
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,039
It was in your inauguration oath, sir!

37
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,749
That oath…

38
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,878
You wrote it, didn't you?

39
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,102
It was five years ago today.

40
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,274
The day you collapsed from a heart attack.

41
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,277
I carried you on my back.

42
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,279
And you rushed to the hospital.

43
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:21,159
If I had waited for an ambulance,
I might have died.

44
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,286
You saved my life that day.

45
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,749
Do you regret saving my life?

46
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,043
Sir, I have no regrets…

47
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,672
about that day…

48
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:44,974
or today.

49
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,204
Dong-ho.

50
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,415
You fell into a deep swamp.

51
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,834
Don't hold out your hand to be saved.

52
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,879
Anyone holding your hand
will get sucked in with you.

53
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,133
Don't scream for help either.

54
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,427
Whoever hears your scream

55
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,097
will get hurt just as much.

56
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,523
Goodbye.

57
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,722
I know how much you want to help,

58
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,976
but I also understand
that you can't help me, ma'am.

CHOI YEON-SOOK
THE CHIEF OF STAFF

60
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,215
The prime minister doesn't have
enough evidence or witnesses, sir.

61
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,635
The prosecution will arrest him,

62
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,138
but he won't be found guilty.

63
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,141
Sir, is it really necessary to--

64
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,814
For the trial,

65
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,776
find someone who can get the job done.

66
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,744
I suppose my preferences
are changing with age.

67
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,667
When I was in the opposition party,
I liked judges who kept their principles.

68
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,253
Now that I am here,

69
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,424
judges who understand what I want--

70
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,057
Mr. President!

71
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,451
<i>Don't hold out your hand to be saved, sir.</i>

72
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,708
<i>Don't scream for help either.</i>

73
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,256
<i>I made your heart beat again…</i>

74
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,468
<i>but now I will make it stop.</i>

75
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,395

78
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,409
IF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY IS VACANT

79
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,203
OR THE PRESIDENT IS UNABLE
TO PERFORM HIS OR HER DUTIES

80
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,496
THE PRIME MINISTER ACTS FOR HIM OR HER

00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:23,294
SEO JEONG-YEON
PARK DONG-HO'S SECRETARY

82
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,676
<i>The prime minister has arrived.</i>

83
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,143
How is the president?

84
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,062
I bid him farewell.

85
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,065
I'm sure he is gone by now.

86
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,609
No one will suspect anything.

87
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,529
His most trusted secretary
witnessed the incident.

88
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,197
There won't be an autopsy.

89
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,658
He had a history of heart attacks.

90
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,703
Once the Blue House calls,
set up a Cabinet meeting.

91
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,330
I'll release a statement in the morning.

92
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,582
6 1/2 HOURS UNTIL THE ARREST
OF PRIME MINISTER PARK

93
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,925
Look, Jeong-yeon.

94
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,012
We didn't just kill the president.

95
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,724
We saved this country.

96
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,564
Are you not

97
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,691
terrified, sir?

98
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,442
I am…

99
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,035
also

100
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,121
afraid.

101
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,419
I hesitated,
wondering if there was another way.

102
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,590
<i>Kang Sang-un,</i>
<i>the Vice Chairman of Daejin Group.</i>

103
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,260

<i>to punish that bastard?</i>

00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,853
<i>Jeong Su-jin, the Deputy Prime Minister,</i>

106
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,689
<i>was there another way to punish her?</i>

107
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,987
I hoped there was another way
to drag this rotting country

108
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,364
out of the swamp.

109
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,575
I really did.

110
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,668
I'll draft the statement, sir.

111
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,295
Give me some guidelines.

112
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,764
One. The government will put every effort
into maintaining public safety and order.

113
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,893
One. The military shall strengthen
the perimeter defense--

115
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,365
Seo Jeong-yeon.

116
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,623
The president…

117
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,714
is still alive, sir.

122
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,054
I've sent the Daejin medical team.
They'll be there in ten minutes.

123
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,557
The director of the AFCH is
the attending physician.

124
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,893
{\an8}The cardiology team he's been under
since the election is also there.

125
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,937
<i>Let those pricks do the check-up.</i>

126
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,021
Leave the surgery to us.

127
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,773
Our surgical and clinical skills--

128
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,276
<i>The probability of a successful surgery</i>
<i>will increase,</i>

129
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,861
as will the suspicion.

130
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,823
<i>Public suspicion</i>
<i>that Daejin Group is behind the president.</i>

131
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,451
The president collapsed at dawn,

132
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,203
and the Daejin Medical staff
operated on the president.

133
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,331
<i>Why did the president entrust his heart</i>

134
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,501
to a private medical institution
instead of a designated hospital?

135
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,590
I can't answer that.

136
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,143
<i>If the president dies,</i>

137
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,979
<i>Prime Minister Park will become</i>
<i>the acting president.</i>

138
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,775
<i>Then… you and I</i>

139
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,402
<i>will end up facing the same court.</i>

140
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,987
It won't happen.

141
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,157
I started this because I didn't want
to walk the same path as you.

142
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,874
{\an8}5 HOURS UNTIL THE ARREST
OF PRIME MINISTER PARK

143
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,586
Two hours ago,

144
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:20,758
the president's blood flow rose to twice
its normal level due to an unknown cause.

145
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:25,179
<i>A sudden increase in blood flow</i>
<i>concentrated in his narrowed blood vessels</i>

146
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,681
<i>created a bottleneck in the blood supply.</i>

147
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:33,062
We considered cardiovascular intervention,
but due to the damaged blood vessels,

148
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,398
the prognosis was determined
to be uncertain.

149
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,234
We ultimately decided

150
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:43,155
to open his chest and perform
a coronary artery bypass graft.

151
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,867
This involves transplanting a blood vessel
from another part of the body.

152
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,495
My husband,

153
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,081
when will he return to the Blue House?

154
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,542
According to case studies,

155
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,420
this surgery has a survival rate
of less than 20%.

156
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,978
JEONG SU-JIN
HOW ABOUT SOME COFFEE?

Bury anything you've seen,

160
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,880
and we'll do the same

161
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,591
regarding your prosecutor's summons.

162
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,053
If you and I look the other way,

163
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,765
the world might get slightly darker.

164
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,184
But you know

165
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,687
that people adjust to the dark in no time.

166
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,400
If I step down,
you and Vice Chairman Kang will be safe.

167
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,444
So will you, Mr. Prime Minister.

168
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,322
I promise you.

169
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,500
Should I notify the press…

170
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,838
that you are resigning, sir?

171
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,263
"Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone."

172
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,600
With these words,
Christ sent everyone away.

173
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,314
Why didn't they…

174
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,152
throw rocks at the sinner?

175
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,367
Those who question the sins of others

176
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,703
must also prepare
to expose their own sins.

177
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,458
Choi Se-chang, Governor of the FSS,
was digging into Daejin's slush funds--

178
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,001
He was firmly determined.

179
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,171
Assemblyman Seo was accused of bribery
while digging into Daejin--

180
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,423
You also fell into the same swamp…

181
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,386
but have a way out.

182
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,555
Well, the president is…

183
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,186
You are one lucky man, sir.

184
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,235
If I have any luck left,

185
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,738
I should use it to take you down.

186
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,582
Watch your step.

187
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,128
If you take one step closer,

188
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:45,879
then…

189
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,218
you will be crushed, sir.

190
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,599
Sang-un, mobilize the prosecutors.

191
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,477
If the PM fails to arrive
at the DA's office at 9:00 a.m.,

192
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,478
arrest him.

193
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,396
<i>Su-jin.</i>

194
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,648
We have an arrest warrant
issued by the court

195
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,692
in case he fails to comply with a summons.

196
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,778
The president has
a 20% chance of survival.

197
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,449
If the surgery wraps up before 9:00 a.m.,
he will be the acting president--

198
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,784
No, the surgery will not be finished.

199
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,997
Sir, how could they possibly go that far?

200
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,290
That's not possible.

201
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,169
The governor of the FSS,
Assemblyman Seo, and Minister Bae…

202
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,755
They responded with common sense
and got crushed.

203
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,299
If they managed
to get to a sitting president,

204
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,468
they'd do anything to a dying one.

205
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,344
To the National Assembly.

206
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,658
During the primary,

207
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,953
I met a lot of female lawmakers
at the campaign office.

208
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,124
During the presidential election,
I visited ten campaign locations a day.

209
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,585
But now,

210
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,171
there is nothing I can do.

211
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,925
He is fighting all alone.

212
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,469
It must be so terrifying.

213
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,973
To die alone in the operating room.

214
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,687
Or to have people find out
that he accepted dirty money for his son…

215
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,106
Madam Deputy Prime Minster!

216
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,859
…then falsely accused the prime minister,
who dug into the facts

217
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,487
and ordered his arrest.

218
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,490
-That's enough, ma'am.
-Which would the president fear more?

219
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,748
You can't help the president
in the operating room, ma'am.

220
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,049
But you can protect the honor
of the man who lived for his country

221
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,137
since you're the first lady, ma'am.

222
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,101
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING

223
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,103
The president has collapsed,

224
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,813
the country is in crisis…

225
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,481
PARK CHANG-SIK
KOREAN LIBERAL PARTY LEADER

226
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,067
…and the prime minister
only wants to save himself.

227
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,530
I'm laughing because I pity the country.

228
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,206
Are you that scared to go to prison?

229
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,667
-No, sir.
-Then what?

230
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,670
Is the acting president position
that desirable?

231
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,382
Yes, sir.

232
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,926
Ten years ago,

233
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,512
you recruited me into politics, sir.

234
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,805
A year ago,

235
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:46,185
you were the one who snatched up
the position I'd been eyeing.

236
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,854
I am the sapling you planted, sir.

237
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,523
Please nourish me
to be a flourishing tree.

238
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,612
I will use that tree to make your coffin.

239
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,532
-Get out!
-Second-in-command now, as always.

240
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,201
You bastard!

241
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,537
Despite being a leading
presidential candidate for 15 years,

242
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,915
you've never won a presidential primary.

243
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,168
I'll make
your long-awaited wish a reality.

244
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,338
With all due respect,

245
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,302
may I share my thoughts…
as to how I would make that happen, sir?

246
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,014
{\an8}3 HOURS UNTIL THE ARREST
OF PRIME MINISTER PARK

247
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,770
Excuse me, sir.

248
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,565
The first lady requests
that the surgery continue until 9:00 a.m.

249
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,622
Let's continue.

250
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,165
Yes, sir.

251
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:56,213
{\an8}2 HOURS UNTIL THE ARREST
OF PRIME MINISTER PARK

252
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,632
Will Assemblyman Park accept the offer?

253
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,801
He is a greedy but incapable man.

254
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,469
Can we trust him though?

255
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,721
I am counting on his greediness.

256
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,481
This is pointless, sir.

257
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,822
<i>The Sixth Commandment,</i>

258
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,991
<i>"Thou shalt not kill."</i>

259
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,618
Will God listen to a murderer's prayer?

260
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,999
If God only listened to
the prayers of the righteous,

261
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,669
the world wouldn't have become
what it is now.

262
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,673
<i>The surgery will continue until 9 a.m.,</i>
<i>when the arrest warrant takes effect.</i>

263
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,800
10 MINUTES UNTIL THE ARREST
OF PRIME MINISTER PARK

264
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:42,759
Ten minutes left.

265
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,178
Request a detention warrant.

266
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,098
I've already talked to the judge.

267
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,979
It looks like
the prosecutors are here, ma'am.

268
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,897
I can see

269
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,359
the end of Prime Minister Park.

270
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,136
Last year,

271
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:31,016
the president sent over his physician
when I was having my back surgery.

272
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,518
He was like a royal physician of old.

273
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,437
I couldn't sit back and do nothing.

274
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:40,317
These are the chiefs of cardiac surgery
at renowned university hospitals in Seoul.

275
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,701
Gentlemen, please sit down.

276
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:55,123
Repairing the president's heart
is not an easy task.

277
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,294
Give the fella a pep talk
if he gets nervous and makes mistakes.

278
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,423
By the way,
he taught the fella in college.

279
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,969
Give him a pat on the back
if he has done a good job.

280
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,390
Oh, this gentleman was his adviser
when he was an intern.

281
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:16,603
And that gentleman
certified the fella as a specialist.

282
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:20,649
Please keep an eye out
and guide and encourage him.

283
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,163
2 MINUTES UNTIL THE ARREST
OF PRIME MINISTER PARK

284
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,583
The surgery is over.
They will report the result soon.

285
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,925
Sir, I am Bae Han-cheol,
a DA at the Seoul DPO.

286
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,052
This is an arrest warrant.

287
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,224
Reschedule a summons and get back to me.

288
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,478
Today--

289
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,688
I prefer to escort you quietly, sir.

290
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,987
It's a valid court-ordered warrant
as per due process.

291
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,159
The more the country reels,
the more we should abide by the law.

292
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,077
How did the surgery go?

293
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,372
It's none of your concern, sir.

294
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,044
It has become <i>your </i>concern now.

295
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,173
Article 71 of the Constitution.

296
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,301
"If the president is unable
to perform his or her duties,

297
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,470
the prime minister shall act
for him or her."

298
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,933
The more the country reels, the more
we should protect the Constitution.

299
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,436
Article 84 of the Constitution.

300
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,648
"A sitting president shall not be charged
with a criminal offense,

301
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,400
and the same shall apply
to the acting president."

302
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,737
An able prosecutor would know that.

303
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,073
Nothing has been announced yet.

304
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,741
Come on. Escort him.

305
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,034
The acting president

306
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,870
directs the prosecution
through the Minister of Justice.

307
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,580
If I direct

308
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,251
the prosecution
in your interrogation room,

309
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,044
what do you think

310
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,296
my first order will be?

311
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,555
<i>At two o'clock this morning,</i>

312
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,684
<i>the president collapsed</i>
<i>due to a heart attack.</i>

313
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,521
{\an8}He was brought to the AFCH
after being given first aid

314
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,815
and went into surgery at 4:00 a.m.

315
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,402
<i>After undergoing</i>
<i>over five hours of surgery,</i>

316
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:14,447
<i>the president unfortunately</i>
<i>fell into a coma.</i>

317
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,826
In cooperation with local
and international specialists,

318
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,203
<i>the medical team plans</i>
<i>to use protective hypothermia.</i>

319
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:24,207
<i>However, we cannot guarantee</i>
<i>the president's recovery at this time.</i>

320
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,504
The president has collapsed,

321
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,716
but our country has to keep going.

322
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,218
As acting president,

323
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,013
I will set the laws
and principles straight.

324
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,808
<i>I will crush those who sleep in injustice.</i>

325
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,436
<i>I will judge those</i>
<i>who reign above the law.</i>

326
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,231
{\an8}<i>I couldn't stop</i>
<i>what happened to the president,</i>

327
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:52,485
<i>but I will stop the tragedy</i>
<i>that could befall our country.</i>

328
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,572
PUNISH THOSE WHO REIGN ABOVE THE LAW

329
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,624
As per security regulations,

330
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,501
the presidential security detail
is in effect, sir.

331
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,671
The hospital said the president
will be monitored for a month.

332
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,301
If they determine
that he cannot be revived,

333
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,511
the opposition party will demand
an early election.

334
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,640
I'm sure they will.

335
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,643
Then one month is all you have, sir.

336
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,897
One week to take control of the NIS,
the prosecution, and the police.

337
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,816
One week to dig into
the president's son, Jang Hyeon-su.

338
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:36,571
One week to catch Jeong Su-jin
and Daejin Group.

339
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,450
And one week to toss
all the garbage out of this world.

340
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,078
I have enough time,

341
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,871
but only if a friend joins me.

342
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,543
INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE

343
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,181
Hey, Jang-seok.

344
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,308
LEE JANG-SEOK
FORMER PROSECUTOR - SEOUL CENTRAL DPO

345
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,791
It's still broad daylight.

346
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,253
I thought it was night
because of my dark future.

347
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,841
This is only the beginning.

348
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:41,928
A witness will appear
on the evening news to testify

349
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:45,473
that Park Dong-ho received a bribe
from the chairman of a crypto brokerage.

350
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,476
Someone who saw something
that didn't happen.

351
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,021
Nice work finding a witness.

352
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:57,152
"The public won't tolerate
an acting president who took a bribe."

353
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,489
That's the editorial title
of tomorrow morning's <i>Daehan Daily</i>.

354
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,701
"A country ruled by criminals
where crime is rampant."

355
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,328
That will be in the <i>Economic </i>column.

356
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,789
Starting today,

357
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:13,501
all of this country's media
will tear Park Dong-ho apart.

358
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,462
You know the drill.

359
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:19,174
The media can even make fools
out of elected presidents.

360
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:20,884
The acting president.

361
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,137
How many days will that bastard last?

362
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,305
How many days

363
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,141
are <i>we </i>going to last?

364
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:35,148
<i>Prime Minister Park is meeting</i>
<i>with Prosecutor Lee Jang-seok as we speak.</i>

365
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:42,071
My wife wants to go back
to our hometown with the kids.

366
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:44,908
Jang-seok.

367
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,993
All I have left is severance pay

368
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,995
after 20 years of being a prosecutor.

369
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,289
Dong-ho.

370
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,125
I'd like to stop here.

371
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,464
Okay. Do as you wish.

372
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,216
That's good news.

373
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:08,056
The prosecutor who risked demotion
and disciplinary action to dig into Daejin

374
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,725
is moving to the fresh-aired countryside.

375
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,103
The vice chairman of the Daejin Group
will be delighted.

376
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,272
That's enough.

377
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,651
The prosecutor who questioned him

378
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:23,071
about transporting Daejin Group funds
to the Blue House is resigning.

379
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,366
Good for Deputy Prime Minster Jeong.

380
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,910
Why

381
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,246
do I have to do it?

382
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,915
There are 2,000 other prosecutors
in Korea.

383
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,543
But nobody is bothered.

384
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,002
So why?

385
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,629
Why me again?

386
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,422
Because Gi-tae left this world to us.

387
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,055
Gi-tae's 49-day funerary rites
ended yesterday.

388
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,519
Jang-seok, you endured it all.

389
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,689
And Gi-tae threw in the towel.

390
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,282
He left behind a will

391
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,618
asking me to write an inscription.

392
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,455
I haven't even started it.

393
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,750
What should I write?

394
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,378
"A dirty politician
who received illegal funds"?

395
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,089
"A man who died
fighting against injustice"?

396
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,559
I will direct the brush.

397
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,770
You prepare the ink, Jang-seok.

398
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,068
<i>Lee Jang-seok has</i>
<i>a lot of supporters in the prosecution.</i>

399
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,779
What would happen
if he resumes the investigation

400
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,115
under the acting president's protection?

401
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,246
Today,

402
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,165
or maybe tomorrow…

403
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,795
we must make Prime Minster Park resign

404
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,672
before he strikes.

405
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,550
Reach out to the opposition party

406
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,637
to file a resolution
to the National Assembly for his removal.

407
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,768
Assemblyman Park is siding
with Park Dong-ho.

408
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,312
We are short on votes anyway.

409
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,606
Politics isn't just arithmetic

410
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,691
but mathematics.

411
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,527
There are variables

412
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,822
and unknowns the opponent isn't aware of.

413
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,451
It will pass.

414
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,371
We haven't finished our meal.

415
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,207
As I said,

416
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,835
I started this
because I didn't want to be with you.

417
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,353
The results of the president's blood test.

418
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,773
An unexpected substance was detected.

419
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,984
I thought I needed to report this.

420
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,793
Mr. President!

421
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,040
By law, we cannot prosecute
the acting president.

422
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,834
-There is no way.
-We must hit people around him.

423
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,879
I doubt anyone has the courage
to do so right now.

424
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,089
Courage comes from fear.

425
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,052
Fear that I will be finished
if the other gets power.

426
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,848
<i>I am Bae Han-cheol, a DA at the Seoul DPO.</i>

427
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,976
This is a search warrant
for Seo Jeong-yeon's home.

428
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,394
{\an8}SECRETARY SEO JEONG-YEON'S HOME

429
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,229
{\an8}-Oh my!
-It's going to be okay.

430
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,255
<i>Deposit certificates totaling</i>
<i>hundreds of millions of won were found</i>

431
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,092
<i>in the home of Seo Jeong-yeon,</i>
<i>secretary to Acting President Park.</i>

432
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,385
<i>The prosecution speculates</i>

433
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,514
<i>Ms. Seo Jeong-yeon kept some of the funds</i>

434
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,975
<i>that Acting President Park received</i>
<i>from the chairman of a crypto brokerage.</i>

435
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:12,819
Do you have a system that can analyze

436
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,363
drug ingredients?

437
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:20,034
The prosecution is demanding the source
of the deposit certificates be revealed.

438
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,496
There's no way
to prove something we didn't do.

439
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,499
When are they voting?

440
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,253
In ten minutes, sir.

441
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:34,715
If it came out of the secretary's home,
isn't it obvious whose money it was?

442
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,758
This is

443
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,093
<i>a disgrace to the country.</i>

444
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,887
<i>You know what this country went through</i>
<i>to get this far!</i>

445
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:45,268
<i>I will go against my party</i>
<i>and vote on the side of the people.</i>

446
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:50,106
<i>As a member of the ruling party,</i>
<i>I apologize to the people.</i>

447
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,443
Let's convene the Cabinet.

448
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,404
No time for a meal.

449
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,739
Tea will do, then.

450
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,659
The National Assembly hasn't voted yet.

451
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:02,702
No, it's over.

452
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:08,082
In this situation,
who would put their name on the line

453
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,294
to protect Park Dong-ho?

454
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,462
<i>I hereby declare</i>

455
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:17,884
<i>that the resolution for the resignation</i>
<i>of Acting President Park has been passed.</i>

456
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,981
The National Assembly failed us.

457
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,192
Sir.

458
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,153
If we don't control the Cabinet,

459
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,571
we…

460
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,574
We are doing the right thing.

461
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:44,785
Smile.

462
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,829
Fear belongs to them.

463
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,909
My apologies. I only have coffee for two.

464
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,209
STATE COUNCIL CONFERENCE ROOM

465
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,087
Resignation letters
from all the Cabinet members.

466
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:41,217
If you do not step down
by midnight tonight,

467
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,221
the Cabinet will resign en masse.

468
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,431
Something like that.

469
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,477
Do you mean to paralyze the government?

470
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,772
With pleasure if I could remove you.

471
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,109
To drive this country into a quagmire?

472
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,486
I will get hurt if I don't.

473
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,696
Deputy Prime Minister!

474
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,035
I will not give up this seat that easily.

475
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,496
An admirable decision.

476
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,207
I'll propose a National Unity Government.

477
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,043
-If I throw a few ministerial positions--
-It has failed.

478
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,632
"We do not recognize
Prime Minister Park as acting president

479
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,135
and will not communicate with him."

480
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,890
It's a joint declaration
of opposition party leaders.

481
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,854
It should've been announced by now.

482
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,530
This country is reeling because of you.

483
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,035
Think of the country,

484
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,829
Mr. Prime Minster.

485
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:05,092
It is a new drug composed
of krokodil and methamphetamine.

486
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,555
It has the effect of doubling
the blood flow and heart strain.

487
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,266
For healthy people,
it strengthens hallucinations.

488
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,685
To those with abnormal heart function,
it's fatal.

489
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,728
Thank you.

490
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:16,729
Okay, ma'am.

491
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,519
The opposition party leaders
are on hunger strike,

492
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,686
demanding your resignation.

493
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,980
The Cabinet members are refusing to work.

494
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:01,857
No one is

495
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,026
now

496
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,945
on your side, sir.

497
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,072
No.

498
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:09,782
There is someone…

499
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,370
and one thing that I can throw away.

500
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,064
PRIME MINISTER PARK DONG-HO

501
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,531
This is Choi Yeon-sook.

502
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,158
I'd like to speak with you.

503
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,326
I'll be there, ma'am.

504
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,621
I'll be waiting.

505
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,433
<i>The Presidential Security Service</i>

506
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:22,271
can only subdue and arrest people
who harm the president, ma'am.

507
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,108
Please tell us
who we need to arrest urgently.

508
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:28,694
Please stand by.

509
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,525
The Blue House Secretariat
cannot intervene in politics.

510
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,737
Conflicts with the National Assembly
and the Cabinet members.

511
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:59,201
I understand your position
as acting president is difficult,

512
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,453
but I can do nothing.

513
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,336
I'm sure you were upset

514
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:15,175
that the president you served
for ten years betrayed you.

515
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,390
Mr. Prime Minister.

516
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,561
That night,

517
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,148
when you met with the president,

518
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,986
did you bring anything
other than resentment?

519
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,033
I tried to assassinate the president.

520
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,622
Mr. Prime Minister!

521
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,498
With these hands,

522
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,169
I wanted to stop his heart from beating.

523
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,880
Daejin Group has power over the president.

524
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:53,881
No matter what!

525
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,592
For any reason!

526
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,386
Murder can never be justified.

527
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,098
You cannot avoid legal punishment.

528
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,517
I intend to delay it, not avoid it.

529
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,362
<i>I tried to assassinate the president.</i>

530
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,532
<i>Mr. Prime Minister!</i>

531
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,369
<i>With these hands,</i>

532
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,455
<i>I wanted to stop his heart from beating.</i>

533
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,339
"I will become a president

534
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:38,676
that makes those who elected me
proud to have done so."

535
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,387
That was in his inauguration speech.

536
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,392
"Arrest the prime minister
who is shaking up Daejin Group."

537
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,268
Isn't that his latest order?

538
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,566
The chief of staff is
to follow the president's order.

539
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,695
Two conflicting orders from the president.

540
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,197
Which will you follow?

541
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,044
Are you conflicted?

542
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:16,547
Then

543
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,717
I'd like to ask not Choi Yeon-sook,

544
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,469
the Chief of Staff to the President,

545
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:26,014
but Choi Yeon-sook,
the first-term lawmaker of ten years ago,

546
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,893
who devoted her life
to wiping away the tears of the weak.

547
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:33,772
Just one month.

548
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,900
Will you please give me

549
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,986
just one month…

550
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,407
to turn the world upside down?

551
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,702
<i>Two conflicting orders from the president.</i>

552
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,996
Which will you follow?

553
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,097
The president's condition is improving.

554
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,603
A moment ago,
he even regained consciousness.

555
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,068
Ms. Choi.

556
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,611
Seven years ago,

557
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,198
I did you a favor, madam.

558
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,038
It's time for you to reciprocate.

559
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,720
SANGCHUNJAE

560
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,486
I wanted to host a dinner
for all the ministers

561
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,947
working hard for this country.

562
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,283
But it was hastily prepared…

563
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:57,708
The president's prognosis
is improving significantly.

564
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,877
-What a relief.
-That's great.

565
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,296
He regained consciousness for a moment.

566
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,842
He delivered an important message
to the first lady.

567
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,804
May I, madam?

568
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,360
"Devote attention
to national defense and security

569
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:29,281
so that the people will not be in fear."

570
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,911
"Give Prime Minister Park
your full support

571
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,663
so he may lead the Cabinet
and run state affairs."

572
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,336
In a month, or even less,

573
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,671
the president will return to his office.

574
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,673
Until then, Prime Minster Park--

575
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,300
I must check, ma'am.

576
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,638
An hour ago, the hospital director said
the president's condition--

577
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,515
Anyone who chooses to leave now

578
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,936
will be regarded
as having left the president's side.

579
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,485
What I mean is confirmation is needed.

580
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,987
I can't follow the order
until I confirm the facts--

581
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,614
Madam Deputy Prime Minister,

582
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,159
are you saying
you do not trust the first lady?

583
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,673
Mr. Prime Minister.

584
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,927
Please run state affairs

585
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,389
as per the president's wishes.

586
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,619
There will be a delay
with the dinner service.

587
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,830
Please continue.

588
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,445
As acting president
of the Republic of Korea…

589
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,157
I hereby declare

590
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:38,660
the commencement
of the 85th State Council meeting.

591
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:45,167
The first item on the agenda is
the dismissal of a State Council member.

592
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,713
Madam Deputy Prime Minister…

593
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:55,135
you are hereby relieved of your duties.

594
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:10,317
THE WHIRLWIND
