1
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,144
TWO MONTHS AGO

2
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,086
The Nobel Peace Prize
is humanity's greatest praise and respect

3
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,257
awarded to those who have
warmly reached out their hands

4
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,052
to places that God's hand couldn't reach.

5
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,220
It's time to announce the winner.

6
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,683
The winner
of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize is…

7
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,565
the president
of the Republic of Korea, Jang Il-jun.

8
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,402
The Nobel Committee is proud

9
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,614
that the Nobel Peace Prize
has been awarded

10
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,657
to the greatest human being.

11
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,786
We hope that the future
President Jang dreams of

12
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,413
will become a proud history for humanity.

13
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,751
Dong-ho!

14
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,215
My dream finally came true!

15
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,304
You helped me get this far!

16
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,478
Now… I will help you achieve your dream.

17
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,065
-May I ask you a favor?
-Sure!

18
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,776
Everything I have is yours.

19
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,236
Ask for anything.

20
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,738
Tell me what you would like.

21
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,202
Please resign from your position.

22
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,247
A few days ago,

23
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,916
President Jang Il-Jun faced death.

24
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,543
Tonight,

25
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,004
Acting President Park Dong-ho
is also facing death.

26
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,134
Convene an urgent meeting
of the top military commanders.

27
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,511
This is a national emergency.

28
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,393
Four specialists
from Hangang Hospital's drug center

29
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,811
will treat Park Dong-ho.

30
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:25,895
We're here by order.

31
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,022
The order came from the chief of staff.

32
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,357
Stop them.

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,067
KANG BYEONG-OH

34
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,110
I already have.

35
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,403
Remember

36
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,614
that anyone capable
of reviving Park Dong-ho

37
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,075
should not be permitted to enter the ER.

38
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,327
They are preventing
the hospital staff from entering,

39
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,414
saying outside personnel are prohibited.

40
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,541
How's the acting president?

41
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,168
He is still unconscious.

42
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,171
He brought me back to my senses.

43
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,715
Now I should bring him back to life.

44
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,008
General.

45
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,386
May I request an urgent personnel order?

46
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,805
Ms. Seo,

47
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,682
go talk to the director.

48
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,106
It's the general's office.

49
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,819
This is Kang Byeong-oh
of the Capital Hospital.

50
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,281
Yes, sir.

51
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,870
Congratulations on your promotion.

52
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,539
Report for duty
at the Armed Forces Medical Command.

53
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:31,628
Sir. You have been given full authority
over the Capital Hospital.

54
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,090
-What the hell?
-We're taking over.

55
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,592
-Get out!
-Check his blood pressure.

56
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,136
-It's cardiac arrest!
-It's ventricular fibrillation.

57
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,472
-Step back!
-100 joules, ready!

58
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,431
Clear!

59
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,773
If I fall apart here,

60
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,442
Jo Sang-cheon will rule the world.

61
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,903
Dong-ho,

62
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,615
do you want those bastards
to control the Blue House again?

63
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,242
If that scared you,

64
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,620
you should have ordered an investigation

65
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,789
into your son's illegal activity.

66
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,833
You shouldn't have joined Kang Sang-un.

67
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,551
Take responsibility and resign.
I'll keep you from being arrested.

68
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,694
The presidential election is next year.

69
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,780
I will help you to sit

70
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,116
where I am sitting right now.

71
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,286
I have no intention
of cleaning up the seat you soiled.

72
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,772
Do you think you can defeat me?

73
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:20,945
I must!

74
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,369
Because the future you create

75
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,747
shouldn't be a part of history.

76
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,708
THE WHIRLWIND

77
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,587
EPISODE 3

78
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,006
He began breathing on his own yesterday.

79
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,924
5 DAYS LATER

80
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,176
Blood flow to the heart
is returning to normal levels.

81
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,429
-I will do my best for his recovery--
-Don't rush.

82
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,183
He has chronic heart disease.

83
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,312
He must recover safely

84
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,189
and slowly.

85
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,196
Your liver somatic index is still high.

86
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,198
You need to rest for a few more days--

87
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,909
Jeong Su-jin,
a third-term incumbent assemblywoman,

88
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,246
is contacting less experienced lawmakers.

89
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,123
Leaving the hospital is too risky.

90
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,834
Kang Sang-un is not talking.

91
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:02,171
You still have toxic substances in you.
It may still be fatal.

92
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,508
What they hope for will not happen.

93
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,474
I'm trying to set up
a special investigations unit.

94
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,685
We have no time to assemble
an experienced team.

95
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,478
Use the existing workforce.

96
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,189
Nobody here has done
anything like this before--

97
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,484
In a week, he'll be able to talk.
He'll return to the office.

98
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,695
The president is regaining consciousness.

99
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,951
When the president recovers,

100
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,620
drag him to the Blue House
in a wheelchair if necessary.

101
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,539
Fire Park Dong-ho first.

102
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,542
The case…
was sent back to the prosecution.

103
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,546
As it pertained to the assassination
of a head of state,

104
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,257
it must have been
beyond the CIO's capacity.

105
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,928
Dozens of people from the prosecution
have taken my money.

106
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,722
The chief prosecutor in charge

107
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,224
is Lee Jang-seok of the Seoul Central DPO.

108
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,272
To get to me,

109
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,608
he needs to go after Jang Hyeon-su.

110
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,986
-The president's family--
-Nothing is off-limits for Lee Jang-seok.

111
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,114
And I have nowhere to retreat to.

112
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,165
Let me be the cook this time.

113
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,085
You pay the bill up front.

114
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,056
Ikseong Accounting Firm.

115
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,933
Accountant Bae Dong-su.

116
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,101
He is a partner at the firm.

117
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,147
I will tell him to get the file ready.

118
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,359
Take it or shred it, whatever.

119
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,986
So this is the end
of your husband and my--

120
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,530
He has a soft spot for people

121
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,573
and even more so for money.

122
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,285
Never approach him again.

123
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,210
Fifty politicians
will introduce this bill.

124
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,547
Most members of our party will agree.

125
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,259
If the NCP leader agrees,
the Special Prosecution Bill will pass.

126
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,637
If there's talk about this bill,
the prosecution will lose momentum.

127
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,223
In the meantime,
the president will return.

128
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,314
Wait a few days.

129
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,192
And keep your mouth shut
unless you're eating.

130
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,121
Ma'am.

131
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,957
A summons has been issued
to Jang Hyeon-su.

132
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,838
The president's son, Jang Hyeon-su,

133
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,965
is coming to the DPO this morning.

134
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:55,428
Supporters of President Jang gathered
at the Central DPO this morning,

135
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,055
demanding the investigation
into Mr. Jang be halted,

136
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,518
claiming that the prosecution had
ulterior motives for instigating the case.

137
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,314
Mr. Jang is suspected of anonymously
investing in a private equity fund

138
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,190
that profited greatly

139
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,943
by investing in businesses
related to government policies,

140
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,362
like the solar business
and the sale of Namsan Bank.

141
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,072
JANG HYEON-SU, PRESIDENT JANG'S ELDEST SON

142
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,075
After interrogating Jang Hyeon-su,
the prosecution plans to subpoena

143
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,494
high-ranking political figures
involved in the case.

144
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,289
In light of the progress
made in the investigation,

145
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:27,251
the prosecution is confident it will prove
the charges against Mr. Jang.

146
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,342
The president has a 50% approval rating
in his fourth year in this office.

147
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,593
That's not all!

148
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,679
There is public sympathy as a result
of the attempted assassination.

149
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,140
Investigating the president's family is--

150
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,224
We must investigate

151
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,269
to find out why Kang Sang-un
tried to assassinate the president.

152
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,485
Chairman Kang of Daejin Group
was arrested.

153
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,570
Kang Sang-un asked for a pardon,

154
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,281
but President Jang Il-jun
acted on principle.

155
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,826
Kang Sang-un impulsively tried
to kill him out of resentment.

156
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,037
Isn't that the scenario
I presented to you?

157
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,374
Look.

158
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,961
When lost,
look to your elders for guidance.

159
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,214
Just follow this scenario--

160
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,925
The prosecution
will conduct the investigation.

161
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,679
The court will be the judge.

162
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,057
You're a fool.

163
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,186
Wise people sicken me.

164
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,898
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING

165
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,073
What is the NCP's position
on the Special Prosecution Bill?

166
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,367
I want to talk to a few more people.

167
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,327
Have you not yet decided?

168
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,080
I need to hear what others have to say.

169
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,290
Out of respect for your party,

170
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,960
we'll let you recommend
candidates for the investigation.

171
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,170
A few years ago, you faced difficulties

172
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,298
when caught up in an unrelated case
the prosecution investigated.

173
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,429
I believe your party wants
prosecution reform as much as we do.

174
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,769
We should not let this country become

175
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,480
a republic where prosecutors
control politics.

176
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,112
Sir.

177
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,162
Your hearing aid is now repaired.

178
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:33,043
Well, everything was quiet
and peaceful without this.

179
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,714
One, two, three.

180
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,885
Now, you can tell me.

181
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,639
Why have you come to see me?

182
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,730
The Special Prosecution Bill
by our party--

183
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,356
Testing, one, two, three!

184
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,984
Oh, come on.

185
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,404
Oh no! The battery ran out.

186
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,407
Charge the battery and bring it back.

187
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,452
I am so sorry.

188
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,205
Right now,

189
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,665
I can't hear anything you say.

190
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,715
If the New Conservative Party disagrees,
the bill will be nullified.

191
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,344
Jo Sang-cheon will enjoy the infighting
between me and Jeong Su-jin.

192
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,554
He is wise, after all.

193
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,224
Listen.

194
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,477
Politics is just like farming.

195
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,729
You plant potatoes on barren land

196
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,106
and harvest crops from fertile land.

197
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,568
The Korean Liberal Party is the land
President Jang cultivated.

198
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,197
If we want to keep farming here,
we must keep our supporters satisfied--

199
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,575
That's exactly what a life-long
tenant farmer like you would think.

200
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,743
Park Dong-ho!

201
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,498
I also bet so I could see your hand.
Don't ask me to go all in.

202
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,639
Go see Mr. Bae Dong-su.
He's a partner at Ikseong Accounting Firm.

203
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,517
He should have a file
that Kang Sang-un gave him.

204
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,269
-Get the file and--
-Ma'am.

205
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,399
Accountant Bae Dong-su
of Ikseong Accounting Firm

206
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,484
was arrested
by the prosecution this morning.

207
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,781
He is known as the safekeeper
of Vice Chairman Kang of Daejin Group

208
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,326
and played a key role in accumulating
the vice chairman's illegal slush funds

209
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,078
and political lobbying.

210
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,247
Accountant Bae Dong-su

211
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,500
is the safekeeper
of Vice Chairman Kang's slush funds.

212
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,669
He certainly knows

213
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,131
where the slush funds
from Kang Sang-un's reserves went.

214
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,635
And Jang Hyeon-su?

215
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,972
According to Article 148
of the Criminal Procedure Act,

216
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,599
I refuse to answer.

217
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,809
He is refusing to testify.

218
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,102
But it won't be long

219
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,646
until he breaks.

220
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,150
If the president returns…

221
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,486
can we survive?

222
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,411
I am going to make him talk.

223
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,666
Assemblyman Park will know

224
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,836
that investigating the first family
will weaken his political power.

225
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,296
He can persuade Park Dong-ho--

226
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,798
The only person
who can persuade Park Dong-ho

227
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,884
is Park Dong-ho himself.

228
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,055
But there is someone who can stop him.

229
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,807
Only one person.

230
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,852
ARMED FORCES CAPITAL HOSPITAL

231
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,357
I heard that you can speed up recovery

232
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,026
by stimulating a recovering patient.

233
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,030
Is it called shock therapy?

234
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,698
Due to his chronic heart disease,

235
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,117
I have been ordered
to ensure his stable recovery.

236
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,621
It came from the chief of staff…

237
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,168
as well as the acting president.

238
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,547
They said what matters is not how quickly
he recovers but how stable he is

239
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,882
without any side effects--

240
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,969
Isn't it the doctor's prerogative
to make decisions…

241
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,222
about treatment?

242
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,765
I am a soldier.

243
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,018
Acting President Park is
the current commander-in-chief.

244
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,835
I'm sure she said she would cover up

245
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,296
your son's crime
if you join Vice Chairman Kang.

246
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,509
Did Jeong Su-jin keep the promise

247
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,761
she made a year ago?

248
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,444
I'm sure she also said
your son would be safe

249
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,280
if Assemblyman Seo were silenced.

250
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,826
How about the promise
she made six months ago?

251
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,370
Did she keep that?

252
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,923
She must have said
your son would not be charged

253
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,926
if he refused to testify

254
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,346
during the interrogation.

255
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,640
That was yesterday or today.

256
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,519
Will she keep that promise?

257
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,528
Assemblywoman Jeong is a sinking ship.

258
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,829
I am simply offering you a chance

259
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,043
to get off that sinking ship, ma'am.

260
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,430
Hey, Su-jin.

261
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,182
Prosecutors barged in.

262
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,893
I blocked the front door,

263
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,104
but they brought
the police and firefighters--

264
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,819
I'm a prosecutor
in the Anti-Corruption Department.

265
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,780
We will execute
a search and seizure warrant.

266
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,823
Hide the ledgers.

267
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,742
Destroy any trace
of Kang Sang-un's investment.

268
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,160
It's too late.

269
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,246
I forgot to replace the server.

270
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,164
Open the door, Mr. Han!

271
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,166
People might get the wrong idea.

272
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,669
Each time I meet with you,
Deputy Prime Minister

273
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,004
coincidently,
his firm gets more investment.

274
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,632
Su-jin, what am I going to do?

275
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:58,137
He tried to assassinate the president.
It was an act of insurrection.

276
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,180
We need to expose the truth.

277
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,974
Only if you are prepared

278
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,185
to expose your own truth.

279
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,613
Your son will have to testify

280
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,324
about how much money
Kang Sang-un gave him,

281
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:24,246
how much he gained investing that money
in Han Min-ho's private equity fund,

282
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,623
and what Jeong Su-jin did

283
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,792
to hide the truth.

284
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,341
Acting President Park
is meeting with the first lady.

285
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,094
He's demanding a confession from her son.

286
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,347
Even if the president wakes up,

287
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,725
he cannot save us now.

288
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,814
If he cannot wake up and save us…

289
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,207
What if he doesn't wake up?

290
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,426
Park Dong-ho started this.

291
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,306
But I'll have to finish it.

292
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,311
Ma'am.

293
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,455
I don't believe you have…

294
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,127
the courage to watch.

295
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,880
If the truth gets out,

296
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,425
the country will tremble.

297
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,344
Your son will be granted leniency.

298
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,515
You have always

299
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,434
put your family

300
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,186
before your country.

301
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,649
I know you to be an unwavering person.

302
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,235
Do the same this time.

303
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,719
I will not say

304
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,305
that I am sorry.

305
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,558
I know you will make…

306
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,605
the same choice as I would.

307
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,900
I promise…

308
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,618
I swear…

309
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,665
that I will protect

310
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,876
your honor

311
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,670
and your family.

312
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,343
The flag that we held up high together…

313
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,346
30 YEARS AGO

314
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,056
I will protect it…

315
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,103
until the end.

316
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,979
JEONG SU-JIN

317
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,567
JANG IL-JUN / CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER

318
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,819
Five!

319
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,862
Four! Three!

320
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,864
Two! One!

321
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,408
ELECTED PRESIDENT

322
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,710
Jang Il-jun!

323
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,208
NOVEMBER 27, 2022, 15:20

324
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,211
DEATH OF PRESIDENT JANG IL-JUN
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

325
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,155
They declared his death at 3:20 p.m.

326
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,657
The cause appears to be
acute respiratory failure.

327
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,036
I'll set up a cabinet meeting
to discuss funeral plans.

328
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,538
Assemblywoman Jeong was by his deathbed.

329
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,248
And the doctor?

330
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,417
When it happened,

331
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,003
he was at a ceremony
for the new hospital director.

332
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,133
I had forgotten

333
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,553
that Jeong Su-jin
could also do what I did.

334
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,987
The president collapsing the day
before my arrest was no coincidence.

335
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,989
I made it happen.

336
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,242
Then he passes away

337
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,620
just before she is arrested.

338
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,998
Is that a coincidence?

339
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,786
You agreed with me by leaving the room

340
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,916
and choosing to be an accomplice
by not informing the MP.

341
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,464
That's because we are in the same boat.

342
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,843
Lee Man-gil.

343
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,890
I'll speak informally from now on.

344
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:46,813
Don't be afraid.

345
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,149
That's on me.

346
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,115
Let's get to work.

347
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,618
We have a lot to do.

348
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,831
He was a person who withstood

349
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,376
the tyranny and oppression
of two previous republics.

350
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,089
But he could not bear the shock
of an investigation into his family.

351
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,803
After receiving reports
that his son was summoned for questioning,

352
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,931
he went into respiratory failure.

353
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:25,018
Are you saying that malicious prosecution
was the cause of death?

354
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,107
Acting President Park, I ask you this.

355
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,985
You defamed a great man of modern history

356
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,529
and brought him to his end
by trampling on his family.

357
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,365
Do you feel better now?

358
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,203
I'm warning you,
Chief Lee of the Seoul Central DPO.

359
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,999
The prosecution must immediately cease
any unreasonable investigations.

360
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,087
President Jang's death
is a travesty of justice

361
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,340
committed by the established power
in this society

362
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,716
and the malicious prosecution!

363
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,552
Any final words from the president?

364
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,305
He strongly wished

365
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,642
for the people to accomplish
prosecution reform.

366
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,228
PRESIDENT'S LAST WISH,
PEOPLE TO ACCOMPLISH REFORM

367
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,022
He also apologized…

368
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,864
to the people

369
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,493
for leaving behind such a difficult task.

370
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,210
Acting President Park held
a cabinet meeting this morning

371
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,672
to offer a state funeral
for President Jang.

372
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,716
The funeral will be held for five days,

373
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,844
and he will be buried
at the National Cemetery.

374
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:45,140
President Jang was a civil rights lawyer
who fought for workers and ordinary people

375
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,560
and was the second Nobel Peace Prize
recipient in our nation's history.

376
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:52,230
Today, two days
after the death of President Jang,

377
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:56,067
it is estimated that over a million people
visited a memorial altar

378
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,778
set up in over 100 locations
across the country.

379
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,989
There is still an endless line of people

380
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,908
waiting to pay their respects
to President Jang.

381
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,808
My goodness, he's gone so suddenly.

382
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,225
Do you think you can defeat me?

383
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,393
I must!

384
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,731
Because the future you create
shouldn't be a part of history.

385
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,572
You've been standing
by this altar for two days.

386
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:29,202
Is that how you show you're
President Jang's political successor?

387
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,998
Funerals are the best political events.

388
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,668
The March 1st Movement occurred
during Emperor Gojong's funeral.

389
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:40,129
The June 10th Movement occurred
during Emperor Sunjong's.

390
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,384
He was a great man.

391
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,303
Park Dong-ho started this.

392
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,349
But I'll have to finish it.

393
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,228
He left big shoes to fill.

394
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,860
Like those in the North,
people are sentimental.

395
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,530
You're using a dead leader
to sway public opinion.

396
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,448
"Et tu, Brute?"

397
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,122
After Caesar's death,

398
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,376
it was Augustus who beat Antony to power.

399
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,296
The people chose him.

400
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,511
They also put Hitler
on the Führer's throne.

401
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,181
I'll ensure our citizens
don't make the same mistake.

402
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,605
The executive chairman
of the funeral committee,

403
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:42,609
an ex-officio position,
will be Acting President Park.

404
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,947
Will the investigation
into the president's family cease now?

405
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,536
Mourning and the investigation
are separate issues.

406
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,288
MEMORIAL ALTAR OF THE LATE PRESIDENT JANG

407
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,373
Once the funeral proceedings are over,

408
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,042
the investigation will resume.

409
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:03,004
Acting President Park is determined
to continue the investigation

410
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,548
as all people
should be equal before the law.

411
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,258
-No way!
-He just died! Come on!

412
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,885
This is political retaliation.

413
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,303
-Right!
-It absolutely is.

414
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,056
This is wrong!

415
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,368
It's not safe here, sir.
I have requested backup.

416
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,327
Please wait.

417
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,039
I will escort him.

418
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:43,252
If governmental powers are used
as a country's leader fears its citizens,

419
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,046
it will diminish its status.

420
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,969
In front of foreign media outlets
such as the BBC, CNN, and NHK,

421
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,389
will you show yourself
clashing with citizens?

422
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,645
I protected you today.

423
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,441
Tomorrow, you will have
to secure the exit yourself.

424
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,901
You will have no exit.

425
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,154
The investigation will continue.

426
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,656
The president said

427
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:58,036
your main strength lies
in envisioning the impossible.

428
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,913
But invariably,

429
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,250
one's strength will eventually become

430
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,878
one's downfall.

431
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:13,152
I heard Assemblywoman Jeong
was by his deathbed.

432
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,695
I was curious

433
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,074
as to why you declined
the investigation into his death.

434
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,745
You should.

435
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,541
Why not perform an autopsy
to determine the exact cause of death?

436
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:31,462
It will reveal exactly what caused
the problem with his heart

437
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,047
and why he collapsed.

438
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,801
If you want to, say so.

439
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,010
I will persuade

440
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,971
his family.

441
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,142
We can leak information to the media
about the investigation

442
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,477
into Jeong Su-jin and her husband--

443
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,272
Do you have more bad news for me?

444
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,736
Tomorrow, at the funeral,

445
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,782
the bereaved family will not allow
your commemorative speech.

446
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,871
The person who gets the most attention
at a funeral becomes the next leader.

447
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,330
That's how politics works.

448
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,583
Commemorative speeches are that important.

449
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,584
So who is it?

450
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,837
Who is going to make
the commemorative speech?

451
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,720
I am sorry

452
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,889
I couldn't protect you.

453
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,516
It was a pleasure

454
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,269
to be a fellow citizen.

455
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,939
It was an honor to be part of the history

456
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,192
that you made.

457
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,945
The day you were elected,

458
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,948
you wiped away my tears

459
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,036
with this handkerchief.

460
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,341
Today, I will use this handkerchief…

461
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,595
to wipe away the tears of the first lady.

462
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,224
I will protect your son's future.

463
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,561
I will fight against
the despicable established power

464
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:14,273
that tarnishes your honor
and disparages your family.

465
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,402
Mr. President,

466
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,072
we will take care of

467
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,950
the world you left behind.

468
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,994
May you rest in peace.

469
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,376
Thank you for everything.

470
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:42,635
Though there would be no love, honor

471
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:48,599
Or fame for us

472
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:55,022
We pledged to march on

473
00:37:55,606 --> 00:38:01,487
Until the end of our days

474
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:20,381
And though the years go by

475
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:26,220
The rivers and mountains will remember

476
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:32,476
The fervent cries we evoke

477
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:38,399
As we become woke

478
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,902
3 DAYS LATER

479
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,746
Most prosecutors
have returned to their old positions,

480
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,540
and just a few unimportant people
remain in the unit.

481
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,045
Sir!

482
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,965
CONTROVERSY
AS JANG INVESTIGATION SUSPENDED

483
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,967
I could've come to you had you called me.

484
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,846
A man who took office only yesterday
intends to stop the investigation today.

485
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,182
No one is exempt.

486
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,851
We will take this investigation
all the way.

487
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,728
That is my principle.

488
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,399
The prosecutor general met
with the first lady

489
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,069
and apologized for conducting
an ineffective investigation.

490
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,403
Investigation, my foot!

491
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,407
Scammers and thieves
are loving this situation.

492
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,661
Now that the prosecution is in turmoil,
front-line prosecutors can't do their job.

493
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,247
It's all because of that principle.

494
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,168
You may be a senior prosecutor,

495
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,213
but you should follow my orders
as your superior.

496
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,467
Says the chief prosecutor,
who refused to follow

497
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,928
the prosecutor general's instructions.

498
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,180
Mr. Jeong!

499
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,642
I've been ordered to conclude
the private equity fund investigation.

500
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,020
The prosecutor general's order.

501
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,106
Let's obey it. Come on!

502
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,951
If the referee blows the whistle,
you have to leave the field.

503
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,745
This is a big problem.

504
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,915
We need a culture of giving in.

505
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,125
JEONG PIL-GYU

506
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,962
I'll get rid of the troublemakers
within a few days.

507
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,005
Thank you.

508
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,007
We can get together for a meal--

509
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,555
I am sorry.

510
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,889
PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL REPORT

511
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:34,807
It's my fault.

512
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,018
Transfer your shares to Cheol-un

513
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,604
and walk away from Namsan C&C.

514
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,232
You can go fishing or whatever.

515
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,569
Su-jin, I would really like to--

516
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,862
I am sorry.

517
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,115
All this happened because I trusted you.

518
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,158
Namsan C&C--

519
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,706
Ma'am, the public opinion polls are in.

520
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,461
According to a recent election survey,

521
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,173
Assemblywoman Jeong is ahead
with an overwhelming approval rating.

522
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,301
It also shows
her approval rating is higher

523
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,011
than the combined ratings

524
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,680
of all the other candidates
in the Korean Liberal Party.

525
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,059
When the first lady was moving out,

526
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,687
60 Korean Liberal Party members
saw her off.

527
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,690
They probably plan to run
in the next general election

528
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,234
using their ties to the former president.

529
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,862
More than half of the ministers
are planning to resign.

530
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,906
They no longer show up to work.

531
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,409
They think serving in your administration
would be political suicide.

532
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,497
In this situation,

533
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,750
it would be impossible
to run the government.

534
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,339
I will

535
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,050
resign from my positions…

536
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,386
as prime minister…

537
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,765
and acting president.

538
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:01,727
Sir.

539
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,272
This is a fight I cannot win.

540
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,652
The acting president is holding
a press conference

541
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,362
to announce his resignation.

542
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,157
I am resigning from my positions

543
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,035
as prime minister

544
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,954
and acting president.

545
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:25,376
I apologize for failing
to fulfill my duties and stepping down

546
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,962
during a national crisis.

547
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,257
The prime minister's official residence
is clearing out.

548
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,676
Ma'am.

549
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,427
The Blue House is now empty.

550
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,763
It's awaiting a new owner.

551
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,685
I will

552
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:46,188
take a step forward
towards a bigger dream.

553
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,275
I, Park Dong-ho,

554
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:54,321
announce my candidacy
for the upcoming presidential election.

555
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,494
I am picking a different fight.

556
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,290
The new fight I choose

557
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,917
is the presidential election.

558
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,295
People say,

559
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,047
"Darkness shall never prevail over light."

560
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,674
There is no light in this country.

561
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,719
Darkness fights even darker forces,

562
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,805
pretending and claiming to be light.

563
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:23,475
Jeong Su-jin's approval rating
within the party is 65%.

564
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,227
Yours is 6%.

565
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:26,979
Can you win?

566
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,400
I cannot win on my own.

567
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,498
From the moment you asked for time
to turn the world upside down,

568
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,668
you have never once been on your own.

569
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,547
I will

570
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,924
clear away the darkness on the left,

571
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,885
crush the darkness on the right,

572
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,554
and create a new light.

573
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,182
I, Park Dong-ho,

574
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,268
am leaving the Blue House tonight.

575
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,689
I will return as the president…

576
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,109
chosen by the people.

577
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,906
That's a promise.

578
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:27,414
THE WHIRLWIND
