1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,094
PARK DONG-HO

2
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,637
It's like having a nuclear weapon.

3
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,932
It poses the greatest threat
when your finger hovers

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:18,810
over the button.

5
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,399
You pushed the button first.

6
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,817
JEONG SU-JIN

7
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,320
It's me.

8
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,113
We are all set.

9
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,616
The materials for the press are ready.

10
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,951
The support groups
will soon make their move.

11
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,374
The combined viewership rating is 40%,

12
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,336
which means 20 million people
will be watching you.

13
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,547
You will say

14
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,051
that Prime Minister Park came to see you

15
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,762
the day before President Jang collapsed.

16
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,972
Prime Minister Park came to see me

17
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,683
the day before President Jang collapsed.

18
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,561
He looked desperate.

19
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,021
He looked desperate.

20
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,440
Prime Minster Park

21
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,944
was facing arrest
on bribery charges at the time.

22
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,572
He said that he would not go down
on false charges.

23
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,367
-He had to see the president.
-He had to see the president.

24
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,326
But President Jang…

25
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,745
But President Jang refused to see him,

26
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,164
so he asked me
to arrange a meeting for him.

27
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,334
We must not let a murder suspect

28
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,545
shake up the government
with his baseless accusations.

29
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,965
Assemblyman Park Chang-sik,
please stop the proceedings.

30
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:26,062
Jeong Su-jin seems to be controlling
the younger lawmakers.

31
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,690
-This situation needs--
-This is what Prime Minister Park said.

32
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,650
"This country will have

33
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,569
a new president tomorrow."

34
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,157
He said he'd gotten everything ready

35
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,117
to stop President Jang's heart.

36
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,248
He promised

37
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,293
to fix Daejin's legal issues
when he was acting president.

38
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,294
I refused.

39
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,171
He also offered

40
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,674
to sort out Daejin's line of succession
once he became president.

41
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,426
I rejected his offer.

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,679
I met President Jang afterward

43
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,640
and sincerely warned him

44
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,517
to watch out for Park Dong-ho!

45
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,354
But that night,

46
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,316
President Jang's heart stopped

47
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,984
right in front of

48
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,777
Park Dong-ho.

49
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,367
These prison interview records show…

50
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,662
that Prime Minister Jeong

51
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,789
visited Kang Sang-un

52
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,709
three times last month alone.

53
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,504
Prime Minister Jeong must explain

54
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,799
why she visited the man
suspected of assassinating the president…

55
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,679
and what she promised him
to get him to defile

56
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,766
our sacred democracy with lies.

57
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,189
I've sent the Daejin medical team.
They'll be there in ten minutes.

58
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,567
The director of the AFCH
is the attending physician.

59
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,570
The cardiology team he's been under
since the election is also there.

60
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,698
Let those pricks do the check-up.
Leave the surgery to us.

61
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,284
This was a phone call

62
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,789
with my old friend,
Prime Minister Jeong, on November 18th.

63
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,291
When President Jang collapsed,

64
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,002
I was in my Daejin Group office.

65
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,923
I was too far away
to get my hands on President Jang.

66
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,805
I was terrified of a world

67
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,891
in which the person
who assassinated the president

68
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,060
later got elected president.

69
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,064
I would like to thank
my old friend, Prime Minister Jeong,

70
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,527
for visiting me three times
and encouraging me to tell the truth

71
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,570
when I was silenced by fear.

72
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,912
That's a lie.

73
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:52,875
I did not meet
with Vice Chairman Kang Sang-un.

74
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,338
I could disclose
the full schedule and itinerary

75
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,549
of my time as prime minister
to the public.

76
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,676
-Then the truth--
-I'm sure you erased it all.

77
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:06,723
As well as the Blue House visitor log
and CCTV footage for that night.

78
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,102
But there's one thing he missed.

79
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,734
This is a picture

80
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,987
of his car entering
the Blue House that night!

81
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,622
Mr. President,

82
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,624
you told me

83
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,961
you'd gotten everything ready
to stop President Jang's heart.

84
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,887
These are the pictures

85
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,974
of his secretary procuring drugs
to stop President Jang's heart.

86
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:55,855
I've now told you all exactly
what Park Dong-ho really said to me.

87
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,859
My fellow Koreans,

88
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,527
you must find out

89
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,030
what Park Dong-ho did.

90
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,835
As suspicions spread nationwide

91
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,963
that President Park was involved
in former President Jang's death,

92
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,342
senior Blue House officials
are avoiding contact with the media.

93
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,136
The president canceled
all scheduled meetings

94
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,013
and hasn't left the Blue House
for three days.

95
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:34,852
1,280 civic groups have formed an alliance
to demand the president's resignation.

96
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,687
They held a rally in Gwanghwamun.

97
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,776
After the rally, the citizens marched
toward the Blue House,

98
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,195
demanding the truth
and the president's resignation.

99
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:50,034
Step down, Park Dong-ho!

100
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:57,083
Step down, Park Dong-ho…!

101
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,484
THE WHIRLWIND

102
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:14,243
EPISODE 9

103
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,165
There was another president
who was assassinated long ago.

104
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:25,087
The director of the KCIA,
who assassinated the president,

105
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,716
met with the army chief of staff.

106
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,432
He was accused of being an accomplice,
so he was taken to the joint headquarters,

107
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,892
tortured,

108
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,896
and demoted to private
from four-star general.

109
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,862
People will be wondering

110
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,823
who Park Dong-ho visited

111
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,494
the morning President Jang collapsed.

112
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,540
With all due respect,

113
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,709
may I share my thoughts
as to how I would make that happen, sir?

114
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,424
The president was absent.

115
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,970
So we discussed national security issues.

116
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,597
That's a good excuse.

117
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,227
President Jang Il-jun's enraged supporters

118
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,438
are now seeing the world through my eyes.

119
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,067
It's a shame.

120
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,405
They used to think for themselves,

121
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,743
but now, they flock
in the direction I play the flute.

122
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,080
LEE JUNG-GWON
CHIEF PROSECUTOR - CIO

123
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,623
Hello, this is Lee Jung-gwon.

124
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,545
You won't be able to stand
the sound of the pipe.

125
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,060
It's me.

126
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,813
Release him.

127
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,081
You can go now.

128
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,005
BLUE HOUSE - SANGCHUNJAE

129
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,518
Dong-ho.

130
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,979
Let's get out of here.

131
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,067
Resign from your post
and turn yourself in, then--

132
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,652
I must complete the task

133
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,654
Gi-tae left for me.

134
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,201
The people have turned their backs on you,
and lawmakers are aiming at you.

135
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,453
You have no one

136
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,122
on your side in this country.

137
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,583
How about you?

138
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,344
I'm going to testify…
at the National Assembly investigation.

139
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,098
I'll tell the truth about what I found

140
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,809
and what you did.

141
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,021
Dong-ho,

142
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,774
it's over now.

143
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,194
I still have some…

144
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,825
of the power given to the president left.

145
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,662
We are from the NTS
Investigation Division 4.

146
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,373
We are here to conduct
an urgent tax audit on Daejin Motors.

147
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,975
"What do we do with this rotting world?"

148
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,768
We're asking the same thing.

149
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,398
But we have different answers.

150
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,112
I'm going all the way to the end,
trusting my answer is the right one.

151
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,281
-Come on, Dong-ho.
-I know you will too.

152
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,706
You're a man who can't stand
this stench of this world.

153
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,126
But you love smelly foods

154
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:33,961
like skate,

155
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,464
gwamegi, and stinky tofu.

156
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,091
Jang-seok.

157
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,262
I will eat the stinky stuff…

158
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,267
before you have to.

159
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,361
Remember this stench.

160
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,364
It is what you need to go after.

161
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,120
I solemnly swear

162
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,415
before the National Assembly
Investigation Committee

163
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,001
that I will speak honestly

164
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:17,296
without attempting
to conceal or embellish anything

165
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,218
as per the Act on Testimony
before the National Assembly.

166
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,806
And if there is any falsehood
in my statement,

167
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,226
I shall be punished for perjury.

168
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,311
Lee Jang-seok,

169
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,647
April 5, 2023.

170
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,234
THE LATE HAN MIN-HO

171
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,071
I wonder if Park Dong-ho knew

172
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:47,034
that sending the two prosecutors
who were investigating him overseas

173
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,786
would hinder him.

174
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,914
It was an unreasonable personnel order.

175
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,502
I believe it was an attempt
to prevent an investigation.

176
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,921
And handing Lee Jang-seok over to the CIO

177
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,048
would be a trap for him.

178
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,092
I also believe

179
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,137
the Blue House pressured the CIO
into arresting me.

180
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,437
And that those closest to him

181
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,400
would hurt him the most.

182
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,736
There are sufficient grounds

183
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,490
to confirm the suspicion
of President Park's involvement…

184
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,330
in the assassination…

185
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,878
of President Jang Il-jun.

186
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,797
Tell Assemblyman Jo Sang-cheon

187
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,301
to submit the motion for impeachment.

188
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,012
Yes, ma'am.

189
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,768
The National Assembly submitted a bill
to the plenum to impeach President Park.

190
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,020
The impeachment will pass

191
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,481
if two-thirds of the members
of the National Assembly approve.

192
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,400
All the New Conservative Party members

193
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,777
and a majority
of the Korean Liberal Party…

194
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,571
Do you think you can defeat me?

195
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,698
I must.

196
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,619
Because the future you create
shouldn't be a part of history.

197
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,790
KANG YEONG-IK - CHAIRMAN OF DAEJIN GROUP

198
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,302
This is Park Dong-ho.

199
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,514
The National Tax Service
raided Daejin Motors.

200
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,516
Park Dong-ho now has a dossier

201
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,186
on our cosmetic accounting.

202
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,442
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY VOTES
ON PRESIDENT PARK'S IMPEACHMENT

203
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,530
SAFE HOUSE IN SAMCHEONGDONG

204
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,740
I heard

205
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,909
that you have something
that belongs to me.

206
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,746
It seems you'll be leaving
the Blue House soon,

207
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,165
so why would you carry such a heavy load?

208
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,333
I remember

209
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,377
you telling me about

210
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,046
how you would have your son
carry my burden.

211
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,467
I cannot bring

212
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,345
a dead man back to life.

213
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,849
Of the 296 registered Assembly members,

214
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,143
295 members voted.

215
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,145
With 218 in favor,

216
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:24,984
I hereby declare that the bill
to impeach President Park has been passed.

217
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,739
I will pay a generous price for it

218
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,574
and help your family

219
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,785
to live abroad.

220
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:40,207
Your son will be taken care of
until he graduates from college--

221
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,418
I intend to get back to the Blue House.

222
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,591
Have the Constitutional Court
reject the impeachment motion.

223
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,395
Who would pay a fortune
for a broken knife?

224
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,691
I have a dossier detailing how you
overstated factory construction funds

225
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,028
and embezzled $500 million.

226
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,906
You don't possess the power

227
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,325
to stab me with that knife.

228
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,911
Power hates a vacuum.

229
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,414
Who do you think will seize

230
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:21,957
the power I lose?

231
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,213
What should I do first
when I am acting president?

232
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,215
It will go to Jeong Su-jin

233
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,636
and Kang Sang-un, whom she promised
a future in exchange for his lies.

234
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,265
Will you be okay

235
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,643
with Sang-un being the one
to wield this broken knife?

236
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,527
SEOUL NATIONAL CEMETERY

237
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,572
Vice Chairman Kang Sang-un said

238
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,034
that he wants Chairman Kang

239
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,703
and Kang Sang-jin to be arrested
before his release

240
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,208
and that he'll change his testimony
if you deny his request.

241
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,089
We both heard your son's rage right here.

242
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:12,841
Father!

243
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,178
I trusted you!

244
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,567
The abandoned prince will return.

245
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,780
He seems to be capable of slitting
the king's throat with the broken knife.

246
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,827
What makes you think
that this sickly old man

247
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,871
has the power to dismiss an impeachment?

248
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,250
Give yourself some credit.

249
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,133
I do, but…

250
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,969
You are wondering

251
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,054
if I can be trusted.

252
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,650
If the impeachment is denied

253
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,778
and I return to the Blue House,

254
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,114
half of my presidential power

255
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,408
will be in Chairman Kang's hands.

256
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,743
All government power

257
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,955
will serve in favor of Daejin Group.

258
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,748
Anything you seek

259
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,085
will be given to you in spades.

260
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,051
You have an opportunity
to control the Blue House.

261
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,596
Chairman Kang,

262
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,515
you are very fortunate.

263
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,873
I WILL BRING JUSTICE AND EQUALITY
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

264
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,420
Su-jin.

265
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,466
I hope to leave my mark…

266
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,929
on history.

267
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:27,351
JEONG SU-JIN, ACTING PRESIDENT

268
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,148
I will strengthen

269
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,984
our military readiness
to forestall North Korean misjudgments

270
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,320
and launch an investigation

271
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,323
into the funds sent overseas
by the top ten companies.

272
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:47,496
The chaebol has reigned
without being challenged for far too long.

273
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,959
Anyone suspected of misappropriating
someone else's hard-earned money

274
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,545
will be severely punished,
regardless of their status.

275
00:20:56,546 --> 00:21:00,592
No one will be off-limits
in the new Korea.

276
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,305
Father, Park Dong-ho's offer is poison.

277
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,432
Let's drink it

278
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,520
now that we have an antidote.

279
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,073
Assemblyman Park Chang-sik
is setting up his campaign camp,

280
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:26,326
Mayor Oh Jin-cheol announced
his intention to run in the primary,

281
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,830
and Governor Song Min-tae is also
gearing up for the presidential race.

282
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,833
They're all behind us…

283
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,422
because we had a head start.

284
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,027
BLUE HOUSE - SANGCHUNJAE

285
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,529
Sangchunjae is
within the Blue House complex.

286
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,698
You need our permission to--

287
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,284
As of today, I am in charge
of the Chief of Staff's office.

288
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,663
"During the impeachment process,
the acting president oversees

289
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,292
all institutions
under the president's direct authority."

290
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,420
Am I wrong?

291
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,926
Tonight's attendees will be

292
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,971
30 assemblymen of the ruling party

293
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:31,892
and someone who does not need
a Blue House background check.

294
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,162
YOO JEONG-MI, FORMER FIRST LADY

295
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,714
If I had known you were coming,

296
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,716
I would have properly…

297
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,510
You didn't seem like

298
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,930
someone who liked to share
everything you knew with me.

299
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,770
How much did you know about
what happened that day?

300
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,413
Are you planning to get

301
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,332
the former first lady's support
in front of the lawmakers?

302
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,337
Don't be afraid.

303
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,425
As long as Park Dong-ho falls,

304
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,802
I won't harm you.

305
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,353
Do not get in my way.

306
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,108
If you get hurt…

307
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,528
I will be very upset.

308
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,876
Mother,

309
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,627
help me.

310
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,054
Please be seated.

311
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:41,897
I must admit

312
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,691
that all of us politicians here

313
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,361
have built our political careers
under the guidance

314
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,197
of President Jang.

315
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,701
The former first lady prepared this event

316
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,121
to remind us of the spirit
President Jang embodied.

317
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,881
I would love to know
what President Jang would tell us

318
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,551
if he were here

319
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,846
to witness these chaotic times.

320
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,318
Ma'am.

321
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,079
On the night

322
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,208
of November 18th…

323
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,419
when…

324
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,843
President Jang collapsed…

325
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,931
Prime Minister Park Dong-ho

326
00:25:58,932 --> 00:25:59,766
was…

327
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,148
with me.

328
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,035
Mother, come on, help me!

329
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,496
Father is

330
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,291
no longer with us, Mother!

331
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,294
You will have no one left

332
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,337
if I go to prison.

333
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,428
It's true that Prime Minister Park
came to the Blue House…

334
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,641
but he felt he had no right
to see the president,

335
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,059
so he came to my residence

336
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,478
and sat down with me

337
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,772
for some tea.

338
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,567
Ma'am!

339
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,445
Is your dead husband all you care about?

340
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,405
What about me, your living son?

341
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,950
Do you not care about me at all?

342
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,328
Both Jang Il-jun and I

343
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,456
have failed
to raise our children properly.

344
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,877
The impeachment was a plot
against President Park.

345
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,214
What my husband and I want…

346
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:19,095
is for President Park
to return to the Blue House…

347
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,518
and continue to embody

348
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,313
Jang Il-jun's spirit.

349
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,778
The impeachment trial took a turn today,

350
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,364
as the former first lady
refuted the allegation

351
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,283
that President Park
assassinated her husband.

352
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,493
THE CONSTITUTION

353
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,828
The Constitutional Court of Korea
is currently holding

354
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,914
the third hearing
of the impeachment trial.

355
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,749
According to an opinion poll,

356
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,627
48% of people believe
impeachment to be justified,

357
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,420
while 48% believe it to be unfair,

358
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,549
highlighting just how divided
public opinion is.

359
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,680
It is now up to the Constitutional Court.

360
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,141
Constitutional adjudication
is very political.

361
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,936
It hinges on public opinion.

362
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,773
The people are confused
as to who is telling the truth.

363
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,110
So are the justices.

364
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,032
Let's beat Jeong Su-jin

365
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,117
to the punch.

366
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,203
You want to bribe
the Constitutional Court justices?

367
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,834
I'm simply providing guidance
to those who are on the fence.

368
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,760
The fate of this country depends on

369
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,056
the nine Constitutional Court justices.

370
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,476
JEONG SU-JIN STARTED
A GROUP CHAT "JUSTICE"

371
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,813
Justice Lee Gil-seob,

372
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,232
Justice Baek Jong-il,

373
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,318
Chief Justice Choi Yong-hwan,

374
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,405
and Justice Kim Gyeong-jin…

375
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,783
are all on our side.

376
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,201
KIM GYEONG-JIN HAS JOINED THE CHAT

377
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,705
We need a two-thirds approval
for the impeachment to pass.

378
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,457
We need six justices.

379
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,917
We need to bring in…

380
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:15,879
two more.

381
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,595
Where is it?

382
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:24,929
Wait!

383
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,514
Here it is.

384
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,397
Oh boy!

385
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,445
You were the judge

386
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,323
who favorably led
the trial of his future in-laws.

387
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,579
CASE FILE: RETURNING OF LAND
BELONGING TO STATE

388
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,664
You breached judicial impartiality.

389
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,252
You failed to uphold the law.

390
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,090
Why don't you uphold the Constitution
just this once?

391
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,430
MIN SANG-CHEOL HAS JOINED THE CHAT

392
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,975
It seems like only yesterday
that your son was going to study abroad.

393
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,560
Did he already graduate?

394
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,937
Yes, sir.

395
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,856
He says he is building a startup.

396
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,400
Well, all he has to do is "start,"

397
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,486
and I'll get it "up" and running.

398
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,618
Father.

399
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,663
Jeong Su-jin currently has five

400
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,665
of the nine Constitutional Court justices.

401
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,460
I thought the other four
would be siding with us,

402
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,588
but Assemblyman Jo

403
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,841
is already in contact
with Justice Song Tae-ho.

404
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:43,883
CHAIRMAN KANG YEONG-IK

405
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,346
Crush him…

406
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,889
JUSTICE SONG TAE-HO

407
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,851
…or be crushed.

408
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,188
We have secured the six justices we need
to uphold the impeachment motion.

409
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,481
SONG TAE-HO HAS JOINED THE CHAT

410
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,618
Sang-jin, stay abroad for a while.

411
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,414
I will bring you back when this is over.

412
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,790
Father.

413
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,463
I guess this is where we part ways.

414
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,548
Chairman Kang,

415
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,217
do you always give up so easily?

416
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,888
I've always avoided fights
I am unlikely to win.

417
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,806
If I wait long enough,

418
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,559
I'll come across a match I will win.

419
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,563
I have three justices on my side.
I just need one more.

420
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,899
We got one
by guaranteeing his son's future.

421
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,943
Another one by purchasing
his family's failing factory.

422
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,111
And the third one…

423
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,408
I barely managed to get three justices.
I don't see how--

424
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,661
Jeong Su-jin's got
six justices in her pocket.

425
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,914
You have the power to move the world.
How come--

426
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,625
Jeong Pil-gyu opened case files
in the prosecutor's office.

427
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,879
Assemblyman Jo bought off a justice
who's an ex-public security prosecutor.

428
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,380
You should've done the same.

429
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,883
If she took one step,
you should've taken two!

430
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,719
I took one step
to find Jang Hyeon-su's drugs

431
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,805
and another step to move the first lady.

432
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,309
But I seem to be walking slowly.

433
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:21,773
Jeong Su-jin has taken
three steps already.

434
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,029
Then I will hand the broken knife

435
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,157
to Kang Sang-un.

436
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:38,915
I still have enough power
to keep myself out of trouble.

437
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,543
I'm too old to go all in

438
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,965
with a losing hand
just to see what cards are hidden.

439
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,093
I need to at least protect

440
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,970
the chips I have left.

441
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,117
I need 100 members
of the National Assembly

442
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,244
to win the primary.

443
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,079
I will get on it, ma'am.

444
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,084
I must secure a majority of votes

445
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,962
to win the presidential election.

446
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,005
I know you will.

447
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,218
Jeong-yeon.

448
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,315
Man-gil,

449
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,194
you are coming to the Blue House with me.

450
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,579
Victory is ours.

451
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,211
The outcome
of President Park's impeachment trial

452
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,172
will be announced today.

453
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,465
THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT

454
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,466
Resign!

455
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,720
We will now announce the verdict

456
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:20,141
of docket number 2023-B1,
the Presidential Impeachment Case.

457
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,686
As all citizens
of the Republic of Korea know,

458
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,648
the Constitution is the basis
for the existence of all institutions,

459
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,233
including the president,

460
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:33,196
and people are the source
from which such power originates.

461
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,783
The Court is well aware of this

462
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,369
and, as such, will proceed
with this verdict as an involved party

463
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,581
standing before a court of history.

464
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:49,754
The motion for impeachment
of the respondent, President Park…

465
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,882
BREAKING NEWS
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S DECISION

466
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:53,800
…is denied.

467
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,240
CHOI YONG-HWAN LEFT THE CHAT

468
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:21,119
With the authority granted by the people,

469
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,163
the Court hopes and believes
that this judgment

470
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:29,210
will end further division
and disruption of public opinion…

471
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,711
I assume you recognize this.

472
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,101
You gave this tea set
to the former first lady in Spain.

473
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,023
I heard you and the first lady

474
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,403
enjoyed a movie together.

475
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,450
The Bridges of Madison County.

476
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,746
A film about not forgetting
a short-lived love.

477
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,291
The Court also hopes

478
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:12,420
this decision will serve as a foundation
for the pathway to unity and recovery.

479
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,174
I do not want you to suffer humiliation.

480
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,217
Please protect this country.

481
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,304
The Court also believes
that the Constitution and the rule of law

482
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,222
should not be shaken

483
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,641
under any circumstances.

484
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,769
They are the values

485
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,980
that we must uphold together.

486
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,365
PARK DONG-HO

487
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,587
This is Jeong Su-jin.

488
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,631
Come to the Blue House.

489
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,799
Hand all your work over to me.

490
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:32,250
Abolish the amended Enforcement Decree.
That's an abuse of power.

491
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,672
What did you promise Chairman Kang?

492
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,967
Also, disband
the public-private joint committee.

493
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,260
That's unnecessary.

494
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,096
He saved the president from impeachment.

495
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,307
Did you promise him half the Blue House?

496
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,647
President Jang only promised
to pardon Chairman Kang.

497
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,900
You're sat here as president today
because you couldn't tolerate that.

498
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,531
Just tell me

499
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,950
what you promised him.

500
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,288
I don't have any promises to make

501
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,748
other than bringing you to justice.

502
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,918
My husband is dead,

503
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,838
so you have no proof

504
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,258
connecting me to Daejin Group.

505
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,598
That is why

506
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,517
I created some.

507
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,981
I have three justices on my side,
and I just need one more.

508
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,816
We got one
by guaranteeing his son's future.

509
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:42,153
Another one by purchasing
his family's failing factory.

510
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,280
-And--
-You should've done the same!

511
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:47,366
If she took one step,
you should've taken two!

512
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,299
How far are you willing to go?

513
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,137
Chairman Kang took two steps.

514
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,475
You took three steps.

515
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:16,896
And I went…

516
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,775
one step further.

517
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,494
This is evidence against those
who manipulated the Constitutional Court.

518
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,123
This is where you come in.

519
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,501
Why?

520
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,421
He got himself out of the swamp, so why?

521
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,590
He didn't get out of the swamp.

522
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,718
He walked into one

523
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,679
with Jeong Su-jin,

524
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,516
holding Chairman Kang's hand.

525
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,195
He once said,

526
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,782
"What do we do with this rotting world?"

527
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,827
"We're asking the same thing."

528
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,590
"We go all the way to the end,
toward our own answers."

529
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,180
Jesus said…

530
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,309
"Let he who is without sin

531
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,812
cast the first stone."

532
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,441
And everyone left.

533
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,278
Because anyone who casts stones at others

534
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,488
must be prepared

535
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,783
to have stones cast upon them.

536
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:57,830
From now…

537
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,169
until my last moment in the Blue House,

538
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,045
I have

539
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,715
far too many stones

540
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,384
to cast.

541
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,597
That is why

542
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,350
I would like to… step forward…

543
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,313
to be hit by the first stone.

544
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,920
In 2022,

545
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,172
on November 18th…

546
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,926
I went to the Blue House.

547
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,014
I, Park Dong-ho…

548
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,809
attempted to assassinate…

549
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,147
former President Jang.

550
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:20,955
THE WHIRLWIND
