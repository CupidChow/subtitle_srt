00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,803
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT

2
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:13,179
It is my honor, sir.

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,018
I will serve you as prime minister,
just like you served President Jang.

4
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,690
I also intend to do
what I must do as prime minister.

5
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,943
After all, you are the one

6
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,612
who made me come this far.

7
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,787
My fellow citizens,

8
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,499
today, I humbly accept the position
of the first prime minister

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,917
of the Park administration.

10
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,087
I would like to express
my deepest gratitude

11
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,922
to President Park,

12
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,718
the members of the Assembly,
and the citizens

13
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,554
for entrusting me to lead the Cabinet.

14
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,682
A country that is strict
with the privileged

15
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,476
and kind to those less so.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,104
A society of hope
where poverty is not passed down…

17
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,529
Hey, Jeong Su-jin!

18
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,702
I'd like an apology first.

19
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,664
"I won't talk about private equity funds,

20
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,751
so clear me of all charges against me."

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,839
"I want to return to Daejin Group
as a good businessman

22
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,634
who got falsely accused
and imprisoned by Park Dong-ho."

23
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,264
You're the one who suggested this.

24
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,602
-My first trial ruling is coming up.
-You get three chances.

25
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,397
-Park Dong-ho became president.
-He'll crumble.

26
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,319
-You can't beat the president.
-Park was able to beat his.

27
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,953
Keep your mouth shut.

28
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,330
Your eyes too.

29
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,793
I'll put you back

30
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,797
in the vice chairman seat at Daejin Group.

31
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,176
Make sure you keep

32
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,013
your cell tidy in solitary confinement.

33
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,059
Park Dong-ho will be in it soon.

34
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,229
So…

35
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,191
eat

36
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,819
only what I give you.

37
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,349
Make…

38
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,311
the appointment.

39
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,572
WHIRLWIND

40
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,786
EPISODE 8

41
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,426
SAFE HOUSE IN SAMCHEONGDONG

42
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:47,495
KANG YEONG-IK
THE CHAIRMAN OF DAEJIN GROUP

43
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,925
Chairman Kang checked out of the hospital.

44
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,264
He seems to be meeting
with the president at the safe house.

45
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,022
Your son and I made a pact

46
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,275
that if he reveals what he did,

47
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,027
I will also expose

48
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,779
my deed to the world.

49
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,656
But unfortunately,

50
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,826
Prime Minister Jeong Su-jin

51
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,661
has her hand covering his mouth.

52
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,414
Can you remove it?

53
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,500
What will you put

54
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,253
in my hand in return?

55
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,343
This is one of my men.

56
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,012
You will find him useful.

57
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,390
He will demand the position of CEO
of the National Pension Service.

58
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,313
The National Pension Service
invests 900 trillion won in stocks.

59
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,068
That's more than twice
the national budget.

60
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,488
Daejin's stock price will skyrocket
if a tenth of that money is moved,

61
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,366
and Chairman Kang
will make trillions of won.

62
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,159
Do you intend to use

63
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,871
the national pension fund
as seed money for Daejin Group?

64
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,748
I will use as much as I need

65
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:17,960
and return whatever is left
to the country's treasury.

66
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,881
Are the hundreds of billions
in illegal slush funds not enough--

67
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:26,260
That happened about ten years ago…
when you were a prosecutor.

68
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,805
PROSECUTOR PARK DONG-HO

69
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,682
I'll reapply for a detention warrant
for additional offshore accounts…

70
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,020
I had to rush to sell
my overseas stocks and corporation bonds

71
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,730
to dodge the investigation,

72
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,149
so my assets got cut in half.

73
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,193
And five years ago…

74
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,114
As a lawmaker,
I'll open a probe into the Daejin Group.

75
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,117
…when you led the investigation
while you were a lawmaker,

76
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:53,329
my assets were again halved
while being moved to a Swiss account.

77
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,832
I had five fingers,

78
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,211
but I could only save my thumb,

79
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,463
thanks to you.

80
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,260
If you want a favor from me,

81
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:11,180
you will have to help me
make up that loss.

82
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,311
Will Park Dong-ho agree to that?

83
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,108
A lion will never eat rotten flesh,

84
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,403
even when on the verge of starvation.

85
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:28,990
That is why…

86
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,912
it ends up dying.

87
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,709
I made a mistake.

88
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,671
I thought you were a person
with good judgment.

89
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,882
I regret wasting your valuable time

90
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,134
since you'll soon be back in prison.

91
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,095
There will be no harm done to the country.

92
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,932
I intend to manipulate
my subsidiaries' stock prices

93
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,601
using the government's money.

94
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,897
Simply put, I need a short-term loan

95
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,900
from the country
to reorganize the group's succession plan.

96
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,991
So you want to overthrow Kang Sang-un

97
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,703
and have Kang Sang-jin take his throne.

98
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,797
Does Kang Sang-un know of your intention
to cut him out of Daejin Group entirely?

99
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,925
It doesn't matter to me.

100
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,637
After all,
he's never getting out of prison.

101
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,348
Mr. President, I plan to have Sang-un

102
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,226
carry your burden on his shoulders.

103
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,645
If he did assassinate the president,

104
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:45,608
he would be sentenced to life in prison,
no matter how hard I tried to save him.

105
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:54,200
So you'd rather keep him in prison
for the rest of his life as a murderer?

106
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,039
If we can all get what we want

107
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,041
by sacrificing one man--

108
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,710
Father!

109
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,509
Father!

110
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,973
I trusted you!

111
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,934
You should trust me from now on,
Kang Sang-un.

112
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,478
I need the account number

113
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,398
from which the investment given
to Han Min-ho came.

114
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,525
Macau Bank.

115
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,568
Hey, son!

116
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,861
Eight,

117
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,115
two, one,

118
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,243
nine, one,

119
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:38,869
zero,

120
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,746
three,

121
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,083
one!

122
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,721
Secure the Macau Bank account
through the NIS.

123
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,181
Tell the FSS to get
the domestic transaction records.

124
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,683
Yes, sir.

125
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,859
Have all 25 prosecutors
and 40 investigators of the CIO

126
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,402
assigned to the Han Min-ho case.

127
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,155
We are short-staffed, sir. We also have--

128
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,489
This is the first order

129
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,659
given to the next minister of justice
in the Park administration.

130
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,459
Anything else?

131
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,715
NAMSAN C&C

132
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,383
I am Investigator Lee of the CIO.

133
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,969
I am looking for
Director Jo Il-gyu of Namsan C&C.

134
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,180
Director Jo Il-gyu?

135
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,557
Who is in charge of the case?

136
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,351
-I am not sure, sir.
-Ask him!

137
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,936
I need to know who it is
so I can pull some strings.

138
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,940
Hello? Su-jin.

139
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,275
Su-jin!

140
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,820
-The CIO got to Il-gyu--
-I know.

141
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,989
I need to go to the office
to find out more…

142
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,408
JEONG PIL-GYU

143
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,744
Hey, Su-jin.

144
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,622
This guy who was dispatched
to the NIS told me

145
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,041
that Kang Sang-un squealed.

146
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,127
They found the Macau Bank account.

147
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,093
Damn it.

148
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,846
Who do those CIO bastards think they are?

149
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,809
Listen, why don't you take
this opportunity to fix up the CIO Act…

150
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:25,726
How much?

151
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,105
How much did Vice Chairman Kang put in?

152
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,486
Five billion won at first,

153
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,905
then ten billion won, and…

154
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,534
Do you know
which account the money came from?

155
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,537
A Macau Bank account.

156
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,170
Hey, Su-jin.

157
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,765
Who is in charge
of Namsan C&C's accounting?

158
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,185
Park Tae-sik, ex-president
of the NCSR Unification Committee,

159
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,730
and Oh Cheol-min, who helped me
when I was on the run--

160
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,941
Send them somewhere
Park Dong-ho can't reach them.

161
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:14,900
Quickly!

162
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,498
Walk away from Namsan C&C.

163
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,460
Su-jin, I would really like to--

164
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,753
I am sorry.

165
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,714
All this happened because I trusted you.

166
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,761
I founded Namsan C&C
and grew the business--

167
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,095
I'm not asking.

168
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,182
-Walk away from the company.
-Jeong Su-jin!

169
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,313
Who the hell do you think I am?

170
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,701
We tracked the cell phones
of Namsan C&C's key personnel.

171
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,578
They appear to be at Incheon Port.

172
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,915
They seem to be attempting
to avoid the Departure Prohibition Order.

173
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,834
Ask the Coast Guard
to crack down on smuggling fishing boats.

174
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,044
Their patrol boats

175
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,963
are busy cracking down
on illegal Chinese fishing boats

176
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,299
under an order
from the Prime Minister's Office.

177
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,640
On the day Mr. Kim Koo was caught
by pro-Japanese police and tortured,

178
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,767
he wrote in his journal,

179
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,895
"If the pro-Japanese live this diligently,

180
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,148
I need to fight even harder
for our independence."

181
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,027
Convene the NSC!

182
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,034
I received HUMINT from a secret source.

183
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,369
NSC (EMERGENCY SECURITY MEETING)

184
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,411
As we speak,

185
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:54,458
subversive forces operating in Korea
are attempting to flee the country.

186
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,587
Mobilize all available
Naval Air Force assets,

187
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,716
including special-purpose aircraft
and airborne warning aircraft.

188
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,025
I have been told
that you convened an NSC meeting.

189
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,987
What is the national emergency
that I should not know about?

190
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,072
Prepare to travel abroad next week.

191
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,701
I want you to give the keynote speech
at the Global Security Council in France.

192
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,746
Any reason you want me out of the country?

193
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,543
Need I remind you why someone like you
should be out of the country?

194
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,342
SO-YEON'S DAD

195
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,058
Tae-sik and Cheol-min
were arrested in international waters.

196
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,019
They're being transferred to the CIO.

197
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,319
You mobilized national assets
for your own purposes.

198
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,032
Did I not mention
that I've learned so much from you?

199
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,576
You're probably planning to

200
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,621
finish off Namsan C&C while I'm gone.

201
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,872
I will see you off,

202
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,041
but the CIO will greet you on your return.

203
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,794
The deputy prime minister
will attend the conference instead--

204
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,883
You fell into a deep swamp.

205
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,928
Don't hold your hand out to be saved.

206
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,680
Anyone holding your hand
will get sucked in with you.

207
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,058
Don't scream for help either.

208
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,186
Whoever hears your scream

209
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,146
will get hurt just as much.

210
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,775
Goodbye.

211
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,380
The CIO is investigating
Park Tae-sik and Oh Cheol-min,

212
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,674
two of the key figures
overseeing Namsan C&C finances,

213
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:10,010
who attempted
to flee the country last night.

214
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:14,640
Mr. Park and Mr. Oh are said to have been
in charge of managing Namsan C&C funds

215
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:18,018
and are presumed to have
key knowledge of the company.

216
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,439
Having secured the slush fund account
of Vice Chairman Kang,

217
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,068
the CIO is now focused on proving
how Namsan C&C obtained those funds

218
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,820
and if any compensation was given.

219
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,699
The CIO announced its intention
to summon Mr. Han,

220
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,577
stating that an arrest warrant
would be issued if he failed to comply.

221
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,917
I lost a lot of money
investing in futures overseas.

222
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,379
I put the rest in cryptocurrency
and ended up losing it all.

223
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,923
Namsan C&C never profited

224
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,051
from national projects
through political relations.

225
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,804
Even I wouldn't buy that lie.

226
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,098
You really think the CIO will?

227
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,352
Can you please testify

228
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,771
that Su-jin knew nothing

229
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,108
about the business between us?

230
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,697
You want to keep your wife out of this…

231
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,037
so she can find a way
for you to have a future.

232
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,831
Regardless of your sentence,

233
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,959
you'll get pardoned and reinstated
when appropriate.

234
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,337
With your wife's help,
you will be a free man again.

235
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,756
Sir, please--

236
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,806
You know, the CIO is quite capable.

237
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,643
I gave them an egg,

238
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,438
and they made steamed eggs,

239
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,690
rolled eggs, and an omelet.

240
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,362
The CIO even found

241
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,825
the Bangkok BDA account
linked to the Macau account.

242
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,082
You know the money I gave you
in the last general election

243
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,335
came from that account, right?

244
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,265
Then…

245
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,688
how much did you tell them?

246
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,235
When two people are being investigated
for the same crime,

247
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,947
the one with the biggest mouth
gets released first

248
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,117
for having cooperated.

249
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,208
I had no idea that I had such a big mouth.

250
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,254
Tell Su-jin

251
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,214
that I will get her second-tier lawyers

252
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,508
after I get myself the best ones.

253
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,678
Mr. Vice Chairman!

254
00:18:58,887 --> 00:18:59,763
Sir.

255
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,181
Please…

256
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:08,981
Eat it.

257
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,484
All I can give you right now

258
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,153
is this egg.

259
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,453
I am so ashamed
of looking up to someone like you.

260
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,807
Why can't I abandon…

261
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,644
someone like you?

262
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,424
Twenty years ago,

263
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,012
when you ran
for office for the first time…

264
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,184
you lost the election by 12 votes.

265
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,150
What would've happened if you had won?

266
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,991
I would've become a good politician.

267
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,748
It's been over ten years now

268
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,877
since you got caught
for violating the election law

269
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,797
while preparing for your last run.

270
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,010
Thanks to that,

271
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,764
you were able to run for office

272
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,225
in my district, Su-jin.

273
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,358
You can get through this.

274
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,986
I know you can.

275
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,122
You've been to prison twice for violating…

276
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,795
the National Security Act
and the Assembly and Demonstration Act.

277
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,133
I remember…

278
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,932
hundreds of thousands of students
gathered in front of the prison,

279
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,726
chanting your name.

280
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,612
I was proud of you…

281
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,992
back then.

282
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,083
I am…

283
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,047
proud of you

284
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,799
the way you are now.

285
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,404
Get some rest.

286
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,156
I will finish…

287
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:48,992
the bottle.

288
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:55,559
"I wish to gaze up to heaven with no hint
of shame until I draw my last breath."

289
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,370
Just like this verse from a poet
who lived through the colonial era,

290
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,207
I have lived with no hint of shame.

291
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,172
Your car is ready.

292
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,674
He left his last words.

293
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,384
The police.

294
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,052
Call the police right now.

295
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,638
He received more money
you were unaware of.

296
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,640
In the last election,

297
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,186
he provided campaign funds
to over 100 candidates in your party,

298
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,938
and more than 50 of them won the election.

299
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,358
If your husband gets summoned,

300
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,444
and the truth comes out,

301
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,197
the Korean Liberal Party will collapse.

302
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,616
He is my husband, the father of my child!

303
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,451
I can't just let him die.

304
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,994
You let President Jang die.

305
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,664
Helped it happen, even.

306
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,877
If your husband lives,

307
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,047
those 50 lawmakers
will be finished, ma'am.

308
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,007
Even if he comes back,

309
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,426
he won't be able to save us.

310
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,055
If he can't save us by coming back,

311
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,974
then he shouldn't come back.

312
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,684
Lee Man-gil!

313
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,061
This is what he wants.

314
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,357
He said he was ashamed
of the last decade of his life.

315
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,025
I wish…

316
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:33,782
to leave this life honorably
as former Chairman Han Min-ho…

317
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,413
of the NCSR.

318
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,083
That's what he wished for.

319
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,475
I have fought against dictatorship
and injustice all my life,

320
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,437
but the blade of political investigations
was too sharp and painful.

321
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,440
I can no longer watch

322
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,360
as innocent colleagues are dragged away

323
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,903
and friends are arrested.

324
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,658
I swear to my beloved country
and its history…

325
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,036
that I am innocent.

326
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,081
I truly hope

327
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,502
that there will never be
another unfortunate victim like me.

328
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,298
Han Min-ho.

329
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,719
EMERGENCY CALL 112

330
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,854
This was found next to his body.

331
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,509
Su-jin,

332
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,803
I hope to leave my mark

333
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,596
on history.

334
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,708
Han Min-ho!

335
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30,834
I promise…

336
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,169
Han Min-ho!

337
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,798
…I will remember you
as you were in our youth.

338
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,785
After I complete the task

339
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,121
you left behind…

340
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,169
honey…

341
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,548
we will cry…

342
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,594
together…

343
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,645
when the time comes.

344
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,898
Victims abducted by the North
can be compensated by law.

345
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,567
According to the law,

346
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,571
only martyrs, patriots, and fallen heroes
can be deemed

347
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,740
a "person of distinguished service
to the state."

348
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:27,909
But let me see

349
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,163
if I can find a way to ensure your father

350
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,375
receives that recognition.

351
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,964
Well, if my father

352
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,010
is recognized
as a person of distinguished service--

353
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,471
Your supporters will love you even more.

354
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,481
Oh my. I don't know what to say
about this incredible gift.

355
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,943
Then… what can I do for you?

356
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,042
Jeong Su-jin, director of
the NCSR's Cultural Propaganda Division,

357
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,879
and Jo Sang-cheon,
chief of the Public Security Department…

358
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,593
could do something great together.

359
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,248
PRESIDENT PARK DONG-HO

360
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,427
TO: THE CHIEF PROSECUTOR
SEOUL CENTRAL DPO

361
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,146
PARK DONG-HO

362
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:09,529
I started hiking when I was demoted
and assigned to the Institute of Justice.

363
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,949
As I climbed rocks and hills,

364
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,785
I wondered what I should do…

365
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,040
and what Gi-tae would say
if he were next to me.

366
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,927
Gi-tae believed in the Assembly.

367
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,515
Even if it takes time,
follow the law and principles--

368
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,017
That's why he failed.

369
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,020
My brother failed.

370
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,564
Is that why you went to Artemis?

371
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,067
SIX MONTHS AGO

372
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,539
Jeong-yeon, did Dong-ho send you there

373
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,416
to get that drug?

374
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,294
I'm sure he suggested

375
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,088
that you help him kill Jang Il-jun.

376
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,089
No, he didn't.

377
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,385
At the funeral hall,

378
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,682
I heard Gi-tae ask me to stop
Jang Il-jun's heart and seize power.

379
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,061
During the 49-day funerary rites,

380
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:26,397
I heard him cry out for me
to punish Jeong Su-jin and uphold justice.

381
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,733
I heard him clearly.

382
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,819
As his friend, how did you miss it?

383
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:39,118
I am a prosecutor of this country.
I enforce the law.

384
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,288
Where was the law when Jang Il-jun
drove my brother to his death?

385
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,210
Where was the prosecution
when Jeong Su-jin hid the truth?

386
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,632
Even if it takes time…

387
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,301
feels unfair,

388
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,720
and makes you shed tears…

389
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,723
I believe

390
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,811
the world is moving
in the right direction.

391
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,858
And I should do the best I can

392
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,903
while enduring and holding on.

393
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,327
I just went to the club

394
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,830
with a friend, had a beer, and left.

395
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,207
I know

396
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,253
my alibi will not hold up
once you start investigating.

397
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,257
So please take your time.

398
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,847
Consider it a favor to my brother.

399
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,683
Jeong-yeon.

400
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,854
Some seek to tarnish the world,

401
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:53,317
but the greater threat comes from those
who strive for change in their own time,

402
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,403
like you

403
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,405
and Dong-ho!

404
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,868
This is a list of Cabinet members
who will work with me.

405
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,038
It contains the names of ministers
and the heads of 17 ministries.

406
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,959
You are exceeding your authority!

407
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,046
The president has the power
to appoint ministers.

408
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,839
And the PM has the right to nominate them.

409
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,551
I'll also transfer the authority
to vet personnel to my office…

410
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,934
because you will soon be removed
from the Blue House.

411
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,610
What should I do first
when I am acting president?

412
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,738
Tell me.

413
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,036
I'll tell you this.

414
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,665
Death does not grant absolution.

415
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,088
Then I will tell you this.

416
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,132
Presidential power

417
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,760
does not grant absolution.

418
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,895
Mr. President.

419
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:02,154
Assemblyman Jo of the NCP
held a press conference this morning

420
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,032
to demand
a National Assembly investigation

421
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,952
into the death
of former President Jang Il-jun.

422
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,791
Jeong Su-jin, director of
the NCSR's Cultural Propaganda Division,

423
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,794
and Jo Sang-cheon,
chief of the Public Security Department…

424
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,048
could do something great together.

425
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:30,975
Assemblyman Jo raised suspicions
about President Jang's sudden death--

426
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,693
It's like having a nuclear weapon.

427
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,155
It poses the greatest threat
when your finger hovers…

428
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,075
over the button.

429
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,207
You pushed the button first.

430
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,969
The New Conservative Party announced
that it would dispel public suspicions

431
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,180
regarding former President Jang's death

432
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,724
via a thorough
National Assembly investigation.

433
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,311
Chief Prosecutor Lee
has left for the National Assembly.

434
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,605
Once he is sworn in and testifies,

435
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,940
this all might end today…

436
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:26,238
Seoul Central DPO's Chief Prosecutor Lee
will testify as a witness today.

437
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:30,368
All eyes will be on him
as he clarifies his stance on the matter.

438
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,586
Turn around

439
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,923
and tell them you are not coming.

440
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,300
Come on, Jang-seok!

441
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,468
This started

442
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,764
when Jang Il-jun tried to hide something
that couldn't be hidden.

443
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:52,848
Dong-ho.

444
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,601
-You're doing the same--
-Just one month!

445
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,813
No, one week. That's all I'm asking.

446
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,066
I promised Gi-tae
I'd bring Jeong Su-jin to justice.

447
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,776
I will keep that promise.

448
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,237
I'll dig into the equity fund case.

449
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,949
You will soon be removed
from the Blue House.

450
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,785
I must stay here.

451
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:14,829
I am the only one--

452
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,497
I'm sure Jang Il-jun also said

453
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,207
that only he could do the job

454
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,960
and that he should be immune to punishment

455
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,254
because no one could make
a difference but him.

456
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,464
Lee Jang-seok.

457
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,675
Those who are generous to themselves

458
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,385
are destroying this country.

459
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,929
People like you and Jang Il-jun.

460
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,807
I promise you this.

461
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,810
Once you take responsibility
for your crimes,

462
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,979
I'll bring justice to those

463
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,106
who made you do what you did.

464
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,358
I will.

465
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,488
What should I do first
when I am acting president?

466
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,575
Dong-ho!

467
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,726
Jang-seok,

468
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,644
no one is off-limits.

469
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,898
"Do a deep dive on those in power."

470
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,941
"No one is off-limits."

471
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,820
That's what bastards
who are off-limits say.

472
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,334
Carry out the plan.

473
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,857
I am Investigator Lee of the CIO.

474
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,610
Sir, you are under arrest
on suspicion of bribery.

475
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:29,129
THE WHIRLWIND
