1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,885
FIVE MONTHS AGO

2
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,680
The Nobel Committee in Oslo, Norway,
announced today

3
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,599
that President Jang has been selected

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,810
as the Nobel Peace Prize laureate.

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,938
He is the second person
in the Republic of Korea's history…

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,774
Take responsibility and resign.
I'll keep you from being arrested.

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,737
…to be honored with the Peace Prize,
the most prestigious Nobel category.

8
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,614
We will now hear
from our Norwegian correspondent, Gong.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,326
The Nobel Committee emphasizes
that President Jang is a leader

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,789
who protects the human rights of workers,
ordinary people, and the poor in Asia

11
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,333
and highly praises his efforts
to narrow the wealth gap

12
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,170
and provide welfare to ordinary people.

13
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,219
The presidential election is next year.

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,305
I will help you to sit

15
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,766
where I am sitting right now.

16
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,726
I have no intention

17
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,770
of cleaning up the seat you soiled.

18
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,649
Do you think you can defeat me?

19
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,151
I must!

20
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,154
Because the future you create

21
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,073
shouldn't be a part of history.

22
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,965
I'll get you an invitation
to the Harvard University Asia Center.

23
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,928
Since you are interested in welfare,
the Royal Swedish Academy might be good.

24
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:35,845
Take a break.

25
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,391
We've had the same dream
for the last ten years--

26
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,393
But we've lived in different realities.

27
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,563
While I investigated
Kang Sang-un's slush funds, you--

28
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,024
We reformed the economy
and kept peace in the peninsula.

29
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,528
If the administration wavered,
everything would have collapsed.

30
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,698
-If it hadn't been for us--
-Why did you oppose the dictatorship?

31
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,076
They also achieved industrialization.

32
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,286
-Mr. Prime Minister!
-Why did you resist the coup?

33
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,165
They also championed the cause
of lifting the country out of poverty.

34
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,501
Was their cause

35
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,336
any different

36
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,004
from yours?

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,051
What's the difference?

38
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,138
They thought
this nation would collapse without them.

39
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,597
You share their arrogance.

40
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,894
You may hold a different shield,
but you wear the same armor.

41
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,994
The prosecution will come after you.

42
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:47,834
It looks like the police, the NTS,
and the NIS will all get busier.

43
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,881
You will be completely crushed.

44
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,343
I thought we were on the same path.

45
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,512
You are the ones who strayed from it.

46
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:01,931
Just wait.

47
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,769
Park Chang-sik will hack her to pieces,
and Jo Sang-cheon will chew her up.

48
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,899
Her family will be destroyed,

49
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,610
and her husband will be exposed,
so the question is,

50
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,779
can she survive the hearing?

51
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,993
This hearing will be

52
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,246
the execution ground for Jeong Su-jin.

53
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,416
THE WHIRLWIND

54
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,754
EPISODE 7

55
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,590
Ahead of Nominee Jeong Su-jin's hearing
for prime minister,

56
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,425
suspicions about Namsan C&C,

57
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,637
an equity firm headed by her husband,
are growing.

58
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,724
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING

59
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,393
Five billion won,

60
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,604
ten billion won,
and another ten billion won.

61
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,730
SOLAR CELL BUSINESS PLAN

62
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,566
Your husband took
so much from Kang Sang-un.

63
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:41,364
What would a man's little lady be doing
at her husband's business meeting?

64
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,368
Did you get this from the Blue House?

65
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,204
Your confirmation hearing

66
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,623
will cause quite a commotion.

67
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,973
Oh my, it's so bloody hot today.

68
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,563
If you were to turn a fan on for me,

69
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,775
I might consider
turning the expensive AC on for you.

70
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,863
What I mean by that is

71
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:25,074
that if you save me first,
I will save you too.

72
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,576
You forgot

73
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,079
that I never cooperated with you

74
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,415
despite being waterboarded for six days.

75
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,086
People say
politics is the art of possibility.

76
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,924
Only humans create art.

77
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,719
Look, lady!

78
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,055
Do you remember what I said back then?

79
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,140
What did you say?

80
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,352
I will

81
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,645
protect

82
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,731
our chairman.

83
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,443
I will protect

84
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,739
President Jang's honor and his family.

85
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,534
If I die,

86
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,287
I'll create a wall with my bones
and a river with my blood

87
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,794
so your filthy hands
can't reach President Jang and his family.

88
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,804
It's me.

89
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,181
Add another witness
to the list for the hearing.

90
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,519
Jang Il-jun's son, Jang Hyeon-su!

91
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,396
Please, sir!

92
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,899
Put Jang Hyeon-su on the stand
and badger the shit out of him.

93
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,824
If Park Chang-sik chews you up
and I sink my claws into you,

94
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,494
you'll wish you were back
in that torture room.

95
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,918
When news broke that Jang Hyeon-su
had been asked to appear

96
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,378
as a witness at the hearing,

97
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,714
President Jang's supporters
began protesting at the National Assembly,

98
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,134
demanding an end
to political manipulation.

99
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,262
Some protesters clashed with the police

100
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,556
while attempting
to enter the Assembly Building.

101
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,642
This hearing is not about Jeong Su-jin.

102
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,396
It is an all-out war between those
who wish to tarnish Jang Il-jun's honor

103
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,148
and those trying to protect it.

104
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,941
About the charge against your husband--

105
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,235
It's a rumor, conspiracy,
and manipulation!

106
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,824
I am prepared to get hit

107
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,951
by the stones they throw.

108
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,708
If I fall, mark the spot with a flag
and a plaque that reads,

109
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,002
"In the Jang Il-jun era,

110
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,297
justice prevailed."

111
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,716
Jeong Su-jin!

112
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,017
Thank you for accepting

113
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,310
my invitation.

114
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,579
I was told you left these in the annex.

115
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,331
Do you recognize them?

116
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,044
Seven years ago,
you bought these during your trip

117
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,505
to Spain.

118
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,764
Caesar's wife was
once suspected of infidelity.

119
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,726
When Caesar chose to divorce her, he said,

120
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,980
"Caesar's wife must be above suspicion."

121
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,275
The same applies to Jang Il-jun's wife.

122
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,736
Ma'am.

123
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,906
You shouldn't worry.

124
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,450
Your secret is safe with him.

125
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,207
People only become true friends

126
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,001
when they share their secrets.

127
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,754
I will keep yours.

128
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,133
Will you keep mine?

129
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,644
WE SUPPORT JEONG SU-JIN
PLEASE PROTECT PRESIDENT JANG

130
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,230
There's going to be a rally
to support you this weekend.

131
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,316
We are expecting more than 10,000 people.

132
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,361
I never expected it to go that far.

133
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,493
This, however, I did expect.

134
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,330
PARK DONG-HO

135
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,809
I gave him that
after his first year in office.

136
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,228
President Jang cherished it.

137
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,609
He used to cut off the rotten leaves
whenever he had time.

138
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,029
He probably never thought
he would become rotten.

139
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,873
A public opinion poll was conducted.

140
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,500
More than 60% of people think

141
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,253
the private equity fund case
is political manipulation.

142
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:33,633
Your ability to turn personal corruption
into political conflict…

143
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,011
I thought I knew you well,

144
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,137
but I was wrong.

145
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,639
I still have much to learn.

146
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,478
Stop giving Park Chang-sik
private equity fund-related information

147
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:50,524
and leaking Namsan C&C accounting files
to Jo Sang-cheon.

148
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,697
If you do, I will stop too.

149
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,287
I might invite the former first lady
to our weekend rally.

150
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,251
Her tears will trigger

151
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,629
a political explosion.

152
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,973
She can't go.

153
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,023
She is about to board a plane.

154
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,826
Why did you suddenly decide
to leave the country?

155
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,829
I have been interested
in the World Food Conference

156
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,163
for quite a long time.

157
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,289
Some say you are trying

158
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,459
to avoid getting caught up
in political conflicts before the hearing.

159
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,841
Isn’t the hearing a private matter
for Assemblywoman Jeong?

160
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,469
There is a verse in the Bible.

161
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,515
"Thou shalt not take
the name of the Lord thy God in vain."

162
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,852
I am asking you, Assemblywoman Jeong,

163
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,898
to refrain from mentioning
the late President Jang Il-jun's name.

164
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,156
If Jang Il-jun were Jesus,
that would make her Mary.

165
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,993
Is this a fight between Mary and Peter

166
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,996
or Mary and Judas Iscariot?

167
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,212
Why won't you back down?

168
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,966
If you had taken just one step back,

169
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,261
none of this would've happened!

170
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,846
Because you people

171
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,766
are behind me.

172
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,311
In front of me,

173
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,313
I have a friend who died.

174
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:57,735
He

175
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,029
keeps approaching me.

176
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,364
So I step back…

177
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,495
out of shame
for not having lived as he did.

178
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,413
And because

179
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,124
there is something I must do…

180
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,920
before I grab onto his hand.

181
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:23,427
So you think I am advancing,
but in reality, I am backing away.

182
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,020
You are also…

183
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,982
going to perish.

184
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,445
I have made my peace with that.

185
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,199
I just hope I survive long enough

186
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,993
to lay you to rest.

187
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,300
Send the gift I prepared
to Chief Prosecutor Lee.

188
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,562
BLUE HOUSE - SANGCHUNJAE

189
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,815
Abalone, sea urchin,
octopus, and even octopus minor.

190
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,485
I heard Gi-tae's mother
still dives for these in her seventies.

191
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,362
Gi-tae really liked them.

192
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,199
Since he's no longer with us,
she sent us some.

193
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:28,826
You go ahead.

194
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,579
You know

195
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,916
that prosecutors don't eat
with suspects during interrogations.

196
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,171
On November 18th,

197
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,633
when Jang Il-jun collapsed
from a heart attack…

198
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,053
were you at the Blue House?

199
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,772
That night at 1:26 a.m.,

200
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,442
you left
the Gwanghwamun Government Complex.

201
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,570
Five minutes later,

202
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,030
at 1:31 a.m.,

203
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,574
you turned right on Samcheong-dong.

204
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,327
Two minutes later, at 1:33 a.m.,

205
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,621
you drove into the alley.

206
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,789
That alley only leads

207
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,917
to the Blue House.

208
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,671
I got a tip-off.

209
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,548
I have to look into it.

210
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,592
If you can't answer…

211
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,220
I'll have to investigate.

212
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,561
Kang Sang-un assassinated the president.

213
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,481
I believe he is already on trial.

214
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,319
At 1:20 a.m.,

215
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:49,406
40 minutes before the president collapsed,
Kang left the Blue House.

216
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,333
I believe

217
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,294
Kang is not denying the murder charges.

218
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,048
Remaining silent doesn't mean
he's admitting to a crime.

219
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,303
Dong-ho.

220
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,598
Is your silence an admission to a crime?

221
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,144
As a prosecutor, I want to hear

222
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,231
why you came here that night.

223
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,734
As a friend, I want to know

224
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,361
why you've been hiding it.

225
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:44,837
JEONG SU-JIN

226
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,382
Yes.

227
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,844
The gift you bestowed upon me
was so generous

228
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,054
that I sent a few photos to thank you.

229
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,682
If that's not enough,

230
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,435
I can send more to your friend.

231
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,147
If you stop here, sir,

232
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,232
I will do the same.

233
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,089
Let's eat, okay?

234
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,343
-These are from Gi-tae's mother.
-Dong-ho!

235
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,846
Just be my friend today, not a prosecutor.

236
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:41,810
Does that mean

237
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,147
that you will face me
as a suspect one day?

238
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,108
Not today though.

239
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,921
Get Park Chang-sik
and Lee Jung-gwon right now.

240
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,966
We have three days left
until Jeong Su-jin's hearing.

241
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,512
It is irrational to replace
the hearing committee members now.

242
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,347
It's irrational, indeed.

243
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,516
Let me be irrational too.

244
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,479
Is your son's habeas corpus review today?

245
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,946
Three former prosecutors have replaced
three of the hearing committee members.

246
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,781
They are planning

247
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,159
to turn the hearing into an interrogation.

248
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,494
The CIO,

249
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,789
"Completely Idiotic Office."

250
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,668
You have been ridiculed enough,
so it's about time

251
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,587
you got some applause.

252
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,218
The CIO is said to be
investigating Namsan C&C.

253
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,513
The prosecution
has strengthened their team.

254
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,727
Jeong Su-jin convened a meeting
of senior leaders at noon today.

255
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,021
She will ask for
their support in the hearing.

256
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,192
I will also have a luncheon at noon
with senior leaders at the Blue House.

257
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,721
I will keep your afternoon open.

258
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,098
-You need to rest--
-Tell the governor of the FSS.

259
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,058
-Namsan C&C…
-Sir, please.

260
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,193
My friend Jang-seok

261
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,361
is getting close.

262
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,574
I need to at least

263
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,784
clear his way to Jeong Su-jin.

264
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,369
And if possible,

265
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,788
I just want to…

266
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,542
delay him from coming my way.

267
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,594
LEE JANG-SEOK

268
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,306
It's me.

269
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,350
It's Gi-tae's birthday today.

270
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,977
I will bring the cake.

271
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,195
GRAVE OF ASSEMBLYMAN SEO GI-TAE

272
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,281
He said he would survive

273
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,660
until there was no room…
on the cake for all the candles.

274
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,167
Dong-ho.

275
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,129
Kim Eung-chan and Oh Yoo-jin

276
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,465
are both highly skilled.

277
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,676
We put together a team.

278
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,428
They will be requesting a visit.

279
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,351
I got another tip-off.

280
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,061
TO: THE CHIEF PROSECUTOR
SEOUL CENTRAL DPO

281
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,949
At 1:36 a.m.,

282
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,493
you went to the Blue House.

283
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,037
At 2:00 a.m.,

284
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,416
the time at which
Jang Il-jun collapsed from a heart attack,

285
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,917
you left the Blue House.

286
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,422
A coincidence.

287
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,425
Too many coincidences
is not a coincidence.

288
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,012
I asked to see
the visitor log for that day,

289
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:46,888
but it has been deleted.

290
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,684
Someone who had the authority to delete it

291
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,437
must have done so for a reason.

292
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,986
I just hope it isn't

293
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,740
the reason I am thinking of.

294
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:08,827
Dong-ho.

295
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,166
I'm launching an investigation.

296
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,212
If there is an unfair personnel order--

297
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,547
I promised you.

298
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,090
If you need my blood

299
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,593
to bring Kang Sang-un
and Jeong Su-jin to justice,

300
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,386
don't hesitate to slash me.

301
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,013
I want you to keep your promise.

302
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,099
If I meet my end

303
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,684
and you are

304
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,937
the only one left sitting here,

305
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,565
I want you to create the world

306
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,442
I wish to see.

307
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,738
Jang-seok, do what you have to do.

308
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,784
I ought to try harder at my job.

309
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,706
I have a lot to do.

310
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,875
Let's go.

311
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,781
I am Seo Jeong-yeon,
secretary of the Blue House.

312
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,412
Everything I say from now on

313
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,622
comes from President Park.

314
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,132
The Daejin Group's vice chairman,
Kang Sang-un, who's currently imprisoned,

315
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,593
will appear as a witness
at nominee Jeong Su-jin's hearing

316
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:52,722
and address all suspicions
related to Namsan C&C.

317
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:57,310
Namsan C&C is an investment firm headed
by the husband of the nominee, Ms. Jeong,

318
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,522
and is accused of making
tens of billions of won in profits

319
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,941
using information
on government-funded businesses.

320
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,069
Daejin Group is said to have invested
in Namsan C&C's…

321
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,571
Only if you are prepared

322
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,823
to expose your own truth also.

323
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,410
Come on, Su-jin.

324
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,953
I…

325
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,664
I want to survive.

326
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,669
JO SANG-CHEON,
NEW CONSERVATIVE PARTY

327
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,403
This is Jeong Su-jin.

328
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,700
Oh my, it has been 30 years
since we shared a meal.

329
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,537
I suppose you didn't have
much of an appetite in the torture room.

330
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,457
You barely finished
half of your yukgaejang.

331
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,922
Vice Chairman Kang Sang-un
is planning to testify at the hearing.

332
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,679
You can't sell when there is no buyer.

333
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,101
Why don't you hitch a ride on my wagon

334
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,729
all the way
to the prime minister's office?

335
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,902
Aren't your supporters abandoning you

336
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,571
for sending money to North Korea?

337
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,953
Some say your political career is over.

338
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,882
The 30 years I spent
knocking the commies down

339
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,552
taught me something.

340
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,229
For the South to live,

341
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,566
the North must die.

342
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,206
Did I startle you?

343
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:40,181
Jeong Su-jin, director of
the NCSR Cultural Propaganda Division,

344
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:44,060
and Jo Sang-cheon,
chief of the Public Security Department…

345
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,275
could do something great together.

346
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,106
Sang-un is appearing at the hearing?

347
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,232
Oh my.

348
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,195
The older kids get,
the less they listen to their parents.

349
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,325
He may break laws,
but he never dares to disobey his father.

350
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,786
I guess you gave him

351
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,456
permission to attend the hearing.

352
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,338
I am too old to stay awake for long.
I need to take a nap.

353
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,341
Many things will happen while you sleep.

354
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,263
Assemblyman Jo Sang-cheon will
raise suspicions that you were behind…

355
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,392
-Ma'am!
-…the private equity fund-related scandal.

356
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,565
I've spent my whole life
avoiding true accusations.

357
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,611
You think lies can take me down?

358
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,378
There is a first time for everything.

359
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,467
NOMINEE JEONG MEETS
WITH CHAIRMAN KANG IN PRIVATE

360
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,928
Reporters will swarm here in ten minutes,

361
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,930
wondering why you secretly met

362
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:47,892
with a nominee whose political career
is about to end in a scandal.

363
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,484
Twenty years ago…
Which presidential election was it?

364
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,863
…you contacted a North Korean official

365
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,699
and asked them to fire bullets
at the Military Demarcation Line.

366
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,663
That official is now a big shot,
ranking fifth in the Workers' Party,

367
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,290
and you remain in contact.

368
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,339
Ask him for a favor.

369
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,924
He will demand a lot of money.

370
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,926
Double the asking price. It is urgent.

371
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,553
If someone finds out,

372
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,181
it's a violation of sanctions,
and it could jeopardize--

373
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,891
I doubt you'll mind the sanctions.

374
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,393
It means Daejin will survive until then.

375
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,245
I will leave you to it.

376
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,499
I hope to hear from you

377
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,877
before I face the reporters.

378
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,022
Give us a statement.

379
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,398
What did you discuss?

380
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,609
Tell us what you talked to him about.

381
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,738
What brought you here?

382
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,490
How do you know the chairman?

383
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,670
I WILL DO TO YOU
THE VERY THING I HEARD YOU SAY

384
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:54,561
"I will do to you
the very thing I heard you say."

385
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,441
Vice Chairman Kang and I
went to the same college.

386
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,571
I came to see my friend's sick father.

387
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,157
-What did you talk about?
-Give us a comment.

388
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,493
I wish him a swift recovery.

389
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,246
He has a lot on his plate.

390
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,083
RYANGGANG PROVINCE, NORTH KOREA

391
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,295
Here is the sentencing from
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

392
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,796
and the Korean People's Army.

393
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,507
For the South to live…

394
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,927
You have become
a tool of propaganda by the South,

395
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,346
and you have soiled
the dignity of our country.

396
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,559
Therefore, you will be executed
in the name of the party and the people.

397
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,520
…the North must die.

398
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,872
The father of Assemblyman Jo Sang-cheon

399
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,666
and four of his family members
living in North Korea

400
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,086
are said to have been executed en masse.

401
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,340
The Korean Central Broadcasting Committee
delivered the news today,

402
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:09,218
criticizing Mr. Jo Sang-cheon,
former New Conservative Party leader,

403
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,304
labeling him "an enemy of the Republic."

404
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,431
A poor older brother

405
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,559
bought some food

406
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,103
for his starving younger brother.

407
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:25,234
And for that, the North Koreans killed
his father using anti-aircraft guns!

408
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:29,614
Look! Does it make sense
to call a witness now?

409
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,240
Shame on you!

410
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,533
How old are you?

411
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,536
JEONG SU-JIN'S
PRIME MINISTER CONFIRMATION HEARING

412
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:43,962
Jeong Su-jin, director of
the NCSR Cultural Propaganda Division…

413
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,131
I, Jo Sang-cheon,

414
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,008
will take the lead in eradicating

415
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,636
pro-North Korea forces!

416
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,890
Jo Sang-cheon!

417
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,935
…and Jo Sang-cheon,
chief of the Public Security Department…

418
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,647
could do something great together.

419
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,659
The hearing started two hours ago,
and they haven't asked a--

420
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,620
Jo Sang-cheon's men
are requesting a new witness.

421
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,163
Whoever it is, just accept it!

422
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,124
It's you, sir.

423
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,210
They requested you

424
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,295
as a witness for the hearing.

425
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,175
They want to question you
about the equity fund case

426
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,136
since you were the prime minister--

427
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,638
-I'm going to the National Assembly.
-It's a political assault.

428
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,891
A sitting president
appearing as a witness at--

429
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,184
It is only once I am there

430
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,688
that the hearing will start,
and Kang Sang-un will testify.

431
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,106
Sir.

432
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,614
-How can I help you?
-We are from the Central DPO.

433
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,699
Hold on, please.

434
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,542
Jo Sang-cheon's men have requested
a new witness,

435
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,461
the former first lady.

436
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,756
She is not even in the country.

437
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,384
Jo Sang-cheon is trying
to dissolve the hearing.

438
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,596
How could Jo Sang-cheon possibly

439
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,808
conspire with Jeong Su-jin
to have his own father executed?

440
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:23,895
I did it.

441
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,736
Jang Il-jun was like a father to me,
and I stopped his heart.

442
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:32,820
To Jeong Su-jin,

443
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:37,158
Jang Il-jun was like a father,
and she killed him.

444
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,493
And now Jo Sang-cheon…

445
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,832
I had forgotten…

446
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,127
that they could do

447
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,880
the same thing I did.

448
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,811
LEE JANG-SEOK

449
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,817
Mr. President,

450
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,403
please let the Internal Affairs Team in
to conduct an investigation.

451
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,825
Jang-seok, your request is denied.

452
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,537
-Dong-ho.
-Chief Prosecutor Lee Jang-seok!

453
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,333
Dissolve the team instantly.

454
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,794
I will no longer tolerate
any investigation

455
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,755
based on groundless intelligence
related to a sitting president.

456
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,257
This is an executive order!

457
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,846
Transfer Prosecutor Kim Eung-chan
to the US

458
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,181
and Prosecutor Oh Yoo-jin to Germany.

459
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,477
Prosecutor Lee will not give up
even if you cut off his limbs.

460
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,604
He will come crawling.

461
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,940
That's who he is.

462
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,156
It will merely delay him…

463
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,243
but I need the extra time.

464
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:09,959
Come on!

465
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,465
We have now concluded
voting on the appointment

466
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,051
of Prime Minister nominee Jeong Su-jin.

467
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,804
Of 296 registered members,

468
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,806
257 are in attendance,

469
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,225
and 142 voted in favor.

470
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,478
Therefore, the appointment motion
has been passed.

471
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,366
"I present this certificate of appointment
to Jeong Su-jin."

472
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,494
"You are hereby appointed
as prime minister."

473
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,915
"President Park Dong-ho."

474
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,884
It is my honor, sir.

475
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:05,181
I will serve you as prime minister,
just like you served President Jang.

476
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:08,059
I will do what I must do
as prime minister.

477
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,188
I also intend to do
what I must do as prime minister,

478
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,898
just like you did.

479
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,359
Please resign from your position.

480
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,529
But do not make me repeat
your last decision.

481
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,283
How dare you!

482
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,371
After all, you are the one

483
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,207
who made me come this far.

484
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,274
THE WHIRLWIND
