1
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,891
"What do we do with this rotting world"?

2
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,393
We're asking the same thing.

3
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,188
But we have different answers.

4
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,235
I'm going all the way to the end,

5
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,780
trusting my answer is the right one.

6
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:36,870
7 MONTHS AGO

7
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,964
Half perished in the battle
against the Japanese

8
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,301
and the other half during the Korean War.

9
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:57,682
My grandfather always said he felt guilty
for being the only one who survived.

10
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:03,438
FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF KOREA

11
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,151
Drink.

12
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,864
It's from my grandfather, squad leader
of the Korean Liberation Army.

13
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,287
Dong-ho.

14
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,458
Please uproot the remaining weeds
in the Blue House

15
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,086
if I fall.

16
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,805
In 2022, on November 18th,

17
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,640
I, Park Dong-ho,

18
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,059
attempted to assassinate

19
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,145
former President Jang.

20
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,281
Chairman Kang Yeong-ik of Daejin Group.

21
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,034
I wanted to weed him out myself.

22
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,203
I'll do it for you.

23
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,164
I barely managed to get three justices.

24
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,502
Chairman Kang of Daejin Group
bribed the constitutional justices

25
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,295
and manipulated state affairs.

26
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,716
Jo Sang-cheon,

27
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,303
the monster created
by the division of Korea,

28
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,014
I wanted to bring him down myself.

29
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,016
Leave it to me.

30
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,062
Assemblyman Jo bought off a justice
who's an ex-public security prosecutor.

31
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,732
This is evidence of an assemblyman
bribing a constitutional justice.

32
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,784
What do we do about Jeong Su-jin?

33
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,661
She was our ally for a long time.

34
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,667
She'll have to come with me.

35
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,835
Come with me

36
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,837
to hell.

37
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,631
I, Park Dong-ho,

38
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,926
will take the filth of this world

39
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,263
and step away
from the spotlight of history.

40
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,682
Bringing them to justice

41
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,476
is my final duty

42
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,231
as the president of the Republic of Korea.

43
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,694
A country with equality for all.

44
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,778
GRAVE OF SEO MUN-BAE

45
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,239
A country in which
the weak are not trampled on.

46
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,872
All of his unfulfilled dreams
have been laid to rest here.

47
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,420
What's your dream?

48
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,093
To be a whirlwind.

49
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,724
WHIRLWIND
PARK DONG-HO

50
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,434
I want to start over

51
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,646
after sweeping everything away

52
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,815
in this suffocating world.

53
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,587
THE WHIRLWIND

54
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,259
EPISODE 10

55
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,469
This is live footage of President Park

56
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,639
surrendering himself as a suspect
to the Seoul Central DPO.

57
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,516
The country is in shock

58
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,185
as prosecutors investigate
a sitting president

59
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,354
for the first time in history.

60
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,984
President Park has announced
that he will remain at the Blue House

61
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,195
until the Court's corruption case
has been resolved.

62
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,549
If you need my blood

63
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,510
to bring Kang Sang-un
and Jeong Su-jin to justice,

64
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,387
don't hesitate to slash me.

65
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,140
Jang-seok.

66
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,434
Today is the day.

67
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,406
JEONG SU-JIN

68
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,533
Call for a meeting
with the chief prosecutors.

69
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,452
Gather the lead prosecutors as well.

70
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,165
Just set the table. I'll do the cooking.

71
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,838
My goodness, Park Dong-ho
is trying to turn the world upside down!

72
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,632
Look, here's what I think.

73
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,841
Thank you for the input.

74
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,260
-What?
-Get my car ready.

75
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,096
Hey, look here!

76
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,181
I thought we were in the same boat!

77
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,643
I'm going to put
one more person in that boat.

78
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:34,977
Come again?

79
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:37,980
Hey, hold on!

80
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,945
On April 17th, I met with Chairman Kang
at the Samcheong-dong safe house.

81
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,739
I promised him half of my power.

82
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,535
Chairman Kang… agreed
to buy over the justices--

83
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,953
Your wife called.

84
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,332
Han-gyeol is considering

85
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,835
taking a break from school.

86
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,339
The kids have been giving him a hard time.

87
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,888
I'll look for a new school for Han-gyeol.

88
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,851
I'll also help your wife look for
a new place where she can lie low.

89
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,570
I want my motive
for stopping Jang Il-jun's heart

90
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,490
to be etched in history
for Han-gyeol's generation.

91
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,336
Please do that for me.

92
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,124
-First, I'll investigate Chairman Kang--
-No.

93
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,710
Go after the Constitutional Court first.

94
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,922
-We must follow the procedure--
-Get Jeong Su-jin first.

95
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,882
Jang-seok.

96
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,675
Jeong Su-jin and I have

97
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,011
somewhere to be.

98
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,765
DAEJIN MEDICAL CENTER

99
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,935
I must stop them from obtaining
a warrant for the Constitutional Court.

100
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,396
I expected you to have a better idea

101
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,482
when you woke this old man from his nap.

102
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,736
Half of the higher-ups in the DPO
worked in special investigations.

103
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,696
They're the type to seek power.

104
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,953
The prosecutors you've been grooming…
are the type to seek money.

105
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,331
Those higher-ups look up to you
like you're their own father.

106
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,583
It's time your kids did good by you.

107
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,422
Fill up half of the eight-lane road
in front of the DPO.

108
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,466
I'll take care of the other half.

109
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,636
-We got this!
-Gather everybody who can walk.

110
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,598
What? You don't have enough flags?

111
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:22,645
Do you remember the Japanese flags
left over from the Japanese boycott?

112
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,607
Tell them to splash some blue paint
and add some lines to them.

113
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,650
They can bring those.

114
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,819
My supporters will also lend a hand.

115
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,736
Come on, let's go!

116
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,783
I have mobilized powerful labor unions
of large corporations,

117
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,869
industrial unions,
and executives in the metropolitan area.

118
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,454
Today, in Seocho-dong,

119
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,333
the fate of this country
will be determined.

120
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,696
The chief prosecutors
are holding a meeting.

121
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,867
Park Dong-ho may be the president,
but he's still a murder suspect!

122
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,621
About 100 lead prosecutors have been
called in from the metropolitan area too.

123
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,497
This is a rebellion.

124
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,131
The president

125
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,217
is currently at the Prosecutors' Office.

126
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,725
Chief of Staff Choi
will submit her resignation letter.

127
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,228
She is furious with me.

128
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,523
She was a longtime ally of President Jang,

129
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,902
so she's probably having a hard time

130
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,279
accepting the fact that I killed him.

131
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,784
Are you trying to protect…

132
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,079
Choi Yeon-sook?

133
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,380
Go back to the party.

134
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,676
Many people will point
their fingers at me.

135
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,344
You should stand in front

136
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,388
and spit on me.

137
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,307
Mr. President.

138
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,104
"Before the cock crow,
thou shalt deny me thrice."

139
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,564
That is

140
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,734
what Jesus said to Peter.

141
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,195
Peter survived.

142
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,573
He survived in a world without Jesus

143
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,368
and became the first pope.

144
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,123
You still have much to accomplish.

145
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,127
I want you to deny me thrice.

146
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,921
No, ten times. A hundred times.

147
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,550
Don't follow me…

148
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,137
and become a martyr.

149
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,057
I was the only one involved
in Jang Il-jun's assassination.

150
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,226
I secured a residence for you in Sweden.

151
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,770
There is only one cross

152
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,440
and no room on it for you.

153
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,693
I had no accomplices.

154
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,161
PROSECUTOR JI YEONG-MI

155
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,458
This is Lee Jang-seok.

156
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,461
What?

157
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,795
An arrest warrant?

158
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,173
They're trying to arrest who?

159
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,942
You may not enter.

160
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,403
-Move aside.
-You cannot enter.

161
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,446
Move!

162
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,953
2,000 prosecutors
and chief prosecutors have agreed

163
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,457
to request an arrest warrant
for the murder suspect, Park Dong-ho.

164
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,085
You're going to arrest
a sitting president?

165
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,131
He assassinated President Jang
and caused an insurrection.

166
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,174
He even confessed.

167
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:24,053
It will not be easy
to arrest the sitting president.

168
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,222
I'm not going to dodge the waves

169
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,475
Park Dong-ho has created.

170
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,644
Instead, I am going to

171
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,313
turn the tide

172
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,358
against Park Dong-ho.

173
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,277
As of now, you are no longer the president

174
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,405
but a murder suspect
and the main culprit of an insurrection.

175
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,199
You will be treated as such.

176
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,784
Shut it!

177
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,622
Mr. President,
you must return to the Blue House.

178
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,251
I'll suppress the internal rebellion.

179
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,628
Arrest Park Dong-ho!

180
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,463
Arrest him!

181
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,965
Incarcerate Park Dong-ho!

182
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,925
Incarcerate him!

183
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,593
Imprison Park Dong-ho!

184
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,345
Imprison Park Dong-ho!

185
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,270
Arrest Park Dong-ho!

186
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,105
Arrest Park Dong-ho!

187
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,982
Incarcerate Park Dong-ho!

188
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,025
Incarcerate Park Dong-ho!

189
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,239
You really think you'll make it back
through the angry citizens?

190
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:30,494
The judge in charge of the warrant
is conducting a legal review.

191
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,290
You can come with us
until the Court comes to a decision,

192
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,374
Mr. President.

193
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,421
The police estimate there are
30,000 protesters in Seocho-dong.

194
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,131
We must get the police to disperse--

195
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,259
There will be bloodshed
if a single protester gets injured,

196
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,262
and the situation
will spin out of control.

197
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,561
The president is alone
in the Prosecutors' Office.

198
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,734
This is Seo Jeong-yeon.

199
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,909
Prime Minister Jeong has called for
an emergency Cabinet meeting.

200
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,578
What?

201
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,918
She'll demand the president's resignation
with a resolution of the Cabinet.

202
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,213
The DPO will use it as justification
for executing an arrest warrant.

203
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,424
What are we going to do?

204
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,391
What is it?

205
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,185
The prime minister

206
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,605
wanted to discuss something
and asked us to wait in your office.

207
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,485
As per Article 77, Section 1
of the Constitution,

208
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,987
"The president may proclaim martial law."

209
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:52,618
The armed forces chiefs of staff
are gathered at the Blue House.

210
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,120
What is she saying?

211
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:59,041
The chief of staff is currently reviewing
the proclamation of martial law

212
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,043
under the president's orders.

213
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,295
Article 11, Section 1 of the Constitution.

214
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,882
"All citizens shall be equal
before the law."

215
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,303
Whether a murderer is
an ordinary citizen or the president,

216
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,805
he must stand in court

217
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,265
wearing the same prisoner's uniform.

218
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,483
Peter survived.

219
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,069
He survived in a world without Jesus.

220
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,155
You still have much to accomplish.

221
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,116
I want you to deny me thrice.

222
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,826
No.

223
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,703
Ten times. A hundred times.

224
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,541
Don't follow me

225
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,127
and become a martyr.

226
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,135
President Park is once again
violating the constitutional order

227
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,887
by not complying with
the prosecution's arrest warrant.

228
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,476
We must prevent
the declaration of martial law.

229
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,565
It took the April 19 Revolution,
the May Democratic Uprising,

230
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,401
and the June Democratic Struggle
to establish the Constitution.

231
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,197
We must abandon the president

232
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,409
in order to protect our Constitution.

233
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,790
Article 112, Section 2
of the Constitution states,

234
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,335
"Constitutional Court justices shall not
participate in political activities."

235
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,548
Nine justices of the impeachment trial
involved themselves

236
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,260
in schemes and collusion
under the sway of political interests.

237
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,973
Regarding the video,

238
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,227
Chairman Kang testified
that he made a false statement

239
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,980
because of the president's threats!

240
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,442
Have you not heard the news yet?

241
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,239
The Constitutional Court of Korea

242
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,283
is innocent.

243
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,167
You may begin.

244
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:06,960
CONFIDENTIAL FILES

245
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,716
I trust that I'll be protected

246
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,887
once I side with the president.

247
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:24,061
Chief Justice Choi Yong-hwan trampled
on the Constitution for personal motives.

248
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:30,400
Do you think we could win over
Justice Cha Guk-hyeon?

249
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,153
He has many debts to repay

250
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,697
to Chairman Kang.

251
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,408
Constitutional Justice Cha

252
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,452
sold our sacred Constitution

253
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,080
for a heap of money
to save his family's company.

254
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,248
Stop it!

255
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,750
Don't you want to see

256
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:51,171
just how innocent
the Constitutional Court of Korea is?

257
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,008
I'd like to schedule a meal

258
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,178
with Justice Song Tae-ho.

259
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,139
I don't think you can get to him.

260
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,974
Assemblyman Jo Sang-cheon

261
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,935
has already fed him plenty.

262
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,691
Constitutional Justice Song Tae-ho

263
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,570
sold our Constitution
in exchange for a nomination

264
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,947
to enter the political arena.

265
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,747
President Park has promised us his demise.

266
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,377
Please do not stand in the way
of the journey he must take one last time

267
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,255
before he stands in the Court of Law.

268
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,926
President Park is climbing Golgotha
all by himself.

269
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,763
But I'm going to climb with him now.

270
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:47,060
I'll be crucified on the cross of history
alongside President Park.

271
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,483
PRESIDENT PARK DONG-HO

272
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,155
My apologies, sir.

273
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,409
I was not able to follow your final order.

274
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,713
I'm sure they'll buy it.

275
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,673
They even believed the rumor

276
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,302
that North Korean soldiers
infiltrated Gwangju in May 1980.

277
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,684
President Park will protect

278
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:33,315
the people and national security
until the moment he leaves the Blue House.

279
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,860
Furthermore, he will conduct
an in-depth investigation

280
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,404
into the spies who infiltrated
the Trade Union Federation.

281
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:44,368
A group of spies infiltrated the TFU
to push for the withdrawal of US troops

282
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,204
and to fight against
our joint military drills with the US.

283
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,997
This enormous group of spies,

284
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,333
operating in secret
for the past few years,

285
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,585
is committing an act of insurrection

286
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,712
by attacking the stability of our country.

287
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,048
Just look at this commie bastard!

288
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,174
They're lying to us!

289
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,511
We will combine the resources
of the NIS and the police

290
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,805
and root out all acts that are threatening

291
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,849
the existence of our country.

292
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,065
Bring in the police.

293
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,025
Don't just dismiss them. Put them down.

294
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,695
They are not innocent protesters.

295
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,864
They are rioters who are blocking roads
and inciting violence in broad daylight.

296
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,661
Okay. Well,

297
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,790
I'll put in another request
for the arrest warrant. I'll--

298
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,504
I assume
they dismissed the arrest warrant.

299
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,633
Since the Court has finished its review,
I'll get going now.

300
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,597
We'll put in another request
for a warrant--

301
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,182
Don't bother barking

302
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,102
if you can't even bite.

303
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,784
I want the National Security Department

304
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,579
to get a search and seizure warrant
for the Constitutional Court.

305
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,664
I want the Anti-Corruption Department

306
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:16,251
to obtain arrest warrants
for all the constitutional justices now!

307
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,337
Jang-seok.

308
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,089
See you
in the interrogation room next time.

309
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,386
Once you're done investigating
the justices, Chairman Kang,

310
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,057
Assemblyman Jo Sang-cheon,
and Prime Minister Jeong Su-jin,

311
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,062
and the interrogation room
becomes vacant, call me.

312
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,148
When that happens,

313
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,984
I'll be here as a citizen…

314
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,237
not the president.

315
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,567
Just one month.

316
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,152
Will you please give me

317
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,904
just one month

318
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,074
to turn the world upside down?

319
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,621
From the moment you asked for time
to turn the world upside down,

320
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,833
you have never once been on your own.

321
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,257
Please make a list
of politicians who are not corrupt.

322
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,675
They must be protected.

323
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,638
I'll take anyone
who will remain after our demise

324
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,015
and put them in the ark.

325
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,310
A heavy rain
will flood Jeong Su-jin's world.

326
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,897
A rain that will last 40 days.

327
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,528
The Seoul Central DPO conducted
a search and seizure this morning

328
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,030
on the Constitutional Court
after obtaining a warrant.

329
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,242
All legal professionals
are solemnly observing

330
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,328
the unprecedented search and seizure
of the Constitutional Court.

331
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:20,292
Meanwhile, none of the constitutional
justices showed up to work today.

332
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,003
The justices are not responding
to the summons.

333
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,590
They deny having ever met
with Chairman Kang or even knowing him.

334
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,885
I think I need some more time, Dong-ho.

335
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,389
Why do you think
those who seized power through a coup

336
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,391
were obsessed with economic growth?

337
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,102
Because the people do not wait.

338
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,314
For over half of the decades
since Korea was founded,

339
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,441
or perhaps longer,

340
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,985
villains have held power in this office.

341
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,862
The people tolerated it,

342
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,865
believing it was a necessary evil
for their time.

343
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,451
If they see no progress,

344
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,412
they will ask me,
"Why are you still in that seat?"

345
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,542
Jang-seok, we're running out of time.

346
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,675
I want the Anti-Corruption Department

347
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,595
to obtain arrest warrants
for all the constitutional justices now!

348
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,518
Those constitutional justices
are our seniors and our mentors.

349
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,771
They're trying to mess with us!
We can't just roll over and do nothing!

350
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,358
The truth does not defeat lies.

351
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,485
Bigger lies do.

352
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,155
Give the press a tip-off

353
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,285
that an anonymous justice is
secretly cooperating with the prosecution.

354
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,745
Yes, sir.

355
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,921
WHO IS 'A',
THE JUSTICE COLLUDING WITH DPO?

356
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,589
It can't be Justice Ju Byeong-seok.

357
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:53,134
I talked to Justice Oh Min-su
on the phone yesterday,

358
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,136
and he did sound hesitant, but…

359
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,851
Your father, Chairman Kang,
tried to save Daejin Group

360
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,270
by selling his own son.

361
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,899
It's time to return
all the love your father gave you.

362
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,444
Just think about this.

363
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,364
Who would pay you the highest price

364
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,283
for selling out your father?

365
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,535
I want to meet with all three of them.

366
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:22,289
I don't know which wall is leaking,
so I will repair them all.

367
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,416
Where is it?

368
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,418
Where does Chairman Kang

369
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,837
meet people in secret?

370
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,262
I've stored some grain
in your secret safes

371
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,389
at Macau Bank.

372
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:44,352
It should be enough
to feed your future generations.

373
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,441
It's been 60 years
since Daejin was founded.

374
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,193
No one under my umbrella
has been rained on.

375
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:56,698
Don't dare come out from under my umbrella
over a few raindrops on your shoulders.

376
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,577
PARK DONG-HO

377
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,373
It is so hard to punish people

378
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,335
with the law
when they're so well-versed in it.

379
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,630
You know well how difficult it is
to prove bribery allegations

380
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,299
without a confession and testimony.

381
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,969
That being said,

382
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,597
you are under arrest

383
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,433
for offering and exchanging bribes.

384
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,196
You've worked so hard to develop
the economy for the past 60 years.

385
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,240
You can now sit back and relax

386
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,992
for the rest of your life

387
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,619
in prison.

388
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,629
Chairman Kang and Kang Sang-jin

389
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,464
were indicted three days
after their arrest.

390
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,008
The blade is now aimed at us, ma'am.

391
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:04,015
Both heirs to the Daejin Group
have been locked up now.

392
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,437
Kang Sang-un and Kang Sang-jin…

393
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,981
Whoever is released first

394
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,567
will inherit Daejin Group,
don't you think?

395
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,615
I would like to hear about
the death of Jo Dal-hyeon

396
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,951
and his family in North Korea.

397
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,373
I heard that you have children.

398
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,250
That's a relief.

399
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,129
You still have some offspring
to hold your ancestral rites.

400
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:43,513
The head of the United Front Department
of North Korea is currently in Moscow.

401
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:49,060
He has a deputy director of the NIS
sitting right across from him.

402
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,191
What? What are you talking about?

403
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:59,571
He has something to say about the death
of Jo Dal-hyeon and Jo Sang-min…

404
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,660
including who requested
the execution of the Republic's hero…

405
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,748
For the South to live,

406
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,208
the North must die.

407
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,669
…what was given in return for the favor…

408
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,423
-He will demand a lot of money.
-Double the asking price. It is urgent.

409
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,218
…and what the son received
in exchange for his father's death.

410
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:26,222
The North is demanding
$10 million as payment, sir.

411
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,058
Wire it from
the NIS special activities fund.

412
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,770
Wait, hold on.

413
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,063
Giving public funds

414
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,733
to the North is--

415
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,819
It's a crime. It's all right.
I've already killed the president.

416
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,865
My sentence can't get any worse from here.

417
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,078
When is the embargo being lifted?

418
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,288
Two o'clock, sir.

419
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,542
Breaking news.

420
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,211
New intelligence has been received

421
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,964
stating that Assemblyman Jo requested
the death of Jo Dal-hyeon and his family.

422
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,133
According to a North Korean official,

423
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,886
Daejin Group, after receiving
Assemblyman Jo's proposal,

424
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,429
provided $5 million

425
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,641
and requested Jo Dal-hyeon
and his family be put to death.

426
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:13,228
The NIS is analyzing the information
they received through HUMINT…

427
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,273
Dad!

428
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,402
"We are born into this land,
charged with the historic mission…"

429
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:28,076
I have dedicated myself
to my country for the past 40 years.

430
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,663
Did the funds come from Daejin?

431
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,874
The New Conservative Party
expelled Assemblyman Jo from the party

432
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,502
for asking North Korea
to execute his family.

433
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,547
The National Assembly submitted
a resolution to expel Assemblyman Jo,

434
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,883
and the prosecution is currently reviewing
an emergency arrest warrant.

435
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,094
This is the end of an era.

436
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,891
It took far too long.

437
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,191
These documents were obtained

438
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,652
while executing the warrant
on the Constitutional Court.

439
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:07,740
Constitutional Justice Min Sang-cheol's
family's old trial records.

440
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:12,203
I'm amazed you managed to dig this up
from the prosecution's archive.

441
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,376
Send in the investigators.

442
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,381
Now you are no longer a prosecutor.

443
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,800
You are an accomplice
in illegal activities.

444
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,552
You will be treated as such.

445
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,643
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Jeong
has been arrested, ma'am.

446
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,899
The prosecution is directing
its investigation toward us.

447
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,777
Get Jeong Su-jin first.

448
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,404
Jeong Su-jin and I have

449
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,323
somewhere to be.

450
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,367
PARK DONG-HO

451
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,285
Jeong Su-jin.

452
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,953
Come with me

453
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:55,872
to hell.

454
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,996
Jang Il-jun!

455
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,166
Jang Il-jun!

456
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,490
On the day of Jang Il-jun's inauguration,
I was sitting on this side.

457
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:58,911
And you…

458
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,250
Cheers!

459
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,585
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

460
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,674
Do you remember

461
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,509
the toast

462
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,762
you made that day?

463
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,555
Like this handkerchief,

464
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,725
here's to politics
that will wipe away the people's tears!

465
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,813
A world of fairness

466
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,149
and justice.

467
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,527
Those who promised
to make this world heaven on earth

468
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,155
turned this place into hell.

469
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,911
Here is your final task.

470
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,998
Vanish with them.

471
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:50,046
You sink along with the 50 members
of the Assembly bankrolled by Han Min-ho,

472
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,549
the justices who colluded with charlatans,

473
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,386
and those who pretended to be just
while pursuing their interests.

474
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,349
If you vanish
with all the filth of this world,

475
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,391
then perhaps…

476
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,354
your downfall might be worthwhile.

477
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,696
You cannot evade justice.
I'm giving you a chance to repent.

478
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,084
SO-YEON

479
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,675
Mom.

480
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:49,397
This is the prime minister's residence.
We haven't received any advance notice--

481
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,816
You will get it
when we execute the arrest warrant.

482
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,693
-So-yeon.
-Mom.

483
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,332
Here is your final task.

484
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,340
If you vanish
with all the filth of this world,

485
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,633
then perhaps

486
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,469
your downfall might be worthwhile.

487
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,849
You cannot evade justice.

488
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,642
I'm giving you a chance to repent.

489
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,440
Why did you oppose dictatorship?

490
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,358
They also achieved industrialization.

491
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,865
Why did you resist the coup?

492
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,118
They also championed the cause
of lifting the country out of poverty.

493
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,333
You may hold a different shield,
but you wear the same armor.

494
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,809
The cross-examination of Jo Sang-cheon
and Kang Sang-jin will take place today.

495
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:13,272
They'll obtain the testimony stating that
Jeong Su-jin connected them to the North.

496
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,359
Furthermore,
they will prove the allegation

497
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,653
that Jeong Su-jin bribed
Justice Min Sang-cheol.

498
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,529
Jeong Su-jin has no other options.

499
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,699
She can either sink alone
or vanish with them.

500
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,958
Mr. President. Jeong Su-jin…

501
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,295
Prime Minister Jeong…

502
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,104
THE WHIRLWIND
