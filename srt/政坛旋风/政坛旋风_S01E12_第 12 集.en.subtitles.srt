1
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,433
Please thank Choi Yeon-sook for me…

2
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,351
The person you have called is unavailable.

3
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,271
Mr. President,
your family is at the safe house.

4
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,566
The Blue House is no longer safe.
You must leave now.

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,193
…for giving me the time to turn the world

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,362
upside down.

7
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,411
Tell Lee Jang-seok

8
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,498
that Jeong Su-jin will be arrested soon.

9
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,959
He should prepare for her interrogation.

10
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,008
It's time for me…

11
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,012
to leave now…

12
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
for the sake of the things
that should stay.

13
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:06,941
WILL

14
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,935
You did indeed kill the president!

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,562
Jeong Su-jin.

16
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,773
The president you killed…

17
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,527
is Park Dong-ho!

18
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,612
Oh God!

19
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,530
Oh no!

20
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,658
No!

21
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,728
THE WHIRLWIND

22
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,567
EPISODE 12

23
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,552
What's your dream?

24
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,226
To be a whirlwind.

25
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:52,982
Dong-ho.

26
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,526
What's your dream?

27
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,404
I wish for a world

28
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,282
in which wrongdoers feel shame.

29
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:07,205
No one can go their entire lives
drinking only clean water.

30
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,457
Dong-ho.

31
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,334
Let's have

32
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,586
a glass of spoiled wine.

33
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,672
Just one glass.

34
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,222
Let's drink…

35
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,892
from our own glasses.

36
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,719
Cheers!

37
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:07,598
Grab the shining glass in your hands

38
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,602
Let's drink for our future, my friends!

39
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:15,356
Let's drink and give it our all!

40
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,877
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

41
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,317
"And forgive us our debts,

42
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,028
as we also have forgiven our debtors."

43
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,948
"And lead us not into temptation…"

44
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,282
"But

45
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,244
deliver us from evil."

46
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,043
Did you just sit by and watch

47
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,088
as our president

48
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,049
climbed that hill all alone?

49
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,351
Before drinking
that poisoned drink in front of Kang…

50
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,397
he told me he had given up on his future…

51
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,528
and that he was merely finishing
an overdue task.

52
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,996
How scared he must have been…

53
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,916
when climbing that hill by himself.

54
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,819
He is unconscious.

55
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,237
His breathing is very weak.

56
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,948
Let's check his vitals.

57
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,909
You can't come in.

58
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,067
-Let's begin CPR.
-Yes, sir.

59
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,659
-100 joules!
-Done.

60
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,245
-It's charged.
-Move aside. Clear!

61
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,374
"What do we do with this rotting world?"

62
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,959
We're asking the same thing.

63
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,545
But we have different answers.

64
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,976
I'm going all the way to the end,
trusting my answer is the right one.

65
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,379
If the world I want to create comes…

66
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,390
I will not be in it.

67
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,242
At 18:45 on July 31,

68
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,913
President Park Dong-ho passed away.

69
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,439
The country is in shock
at the sudden passing of the president.

70
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,525
Prime Minister Jeong,
who was arrested at the scene,

71
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,695
is currently being investigated
at Seoul Central DPO.

72
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,324
Secure the CCTV footage
from inside the Blue House.

73
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,452
The parking lot in the front
has dozens of security cameras.

74
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,206
At least one should be
pointing up at the hills.

75
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,209
You have to find it.

76
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,668
Go eat before we get started.

77
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,086
Yes, sir.

78
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,124
They found your DNA on the handkerchief.

79
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,421
Your clothes and the button found
on the hill are evidence of a struggle.

80
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:41,051
Your dismissal of his bodyguards
proves your intent to murder.

81
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,847
I'm going to prove

82
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,975
that it wasn't murder.

83
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,019
Jeong Su-jin.

84
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,819
For the first time,
you are where you belong.

85
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,697
The interrogation room.

86
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,451
I'll provide you a way out though.

87
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,747
The one piece of evidence
that proves you didn't murder me.

88
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,299
It's my very own will.

89
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,886
If this will is made public,

90
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,056
you'll no longer be a murder suspect

91
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:32,228
because it'll prove
that I threw myself off that cliff.

92
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,314
Do you want it?

93
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,274
My will?

94
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,822
The question hasn't changed.

95
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,241
You can either sink alone

96
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,743
or go down
with all the filth of this world.

97
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,704
It is now time for you to choose.

98
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,926
You're trying to use me as an instrument.

99
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,970
Have you forgotten?

100
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,805
In our youth,

101
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:11,642
we all pledged to become instruments

102
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,937
to realize democracy,

103
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,105
peace,

104
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,857
and reform.

105
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,321
He instructed me to seal the will
in the casket with his body

106
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,698
unless you testify first.

107
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,660
He said that the truth about his murder

108
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,912
will be buried with him

109
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,541
unless you reveal
the truth about yourself.

110
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,508
Prime Minister Jeong.

111
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,553
The president will be placed in a casket

112
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,930
tomorrow morning.

113
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:04,320
There's a land that is fairer than day

114
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:13,370
And by faith, we can see it afar

115
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:22,630
For the Father waits over the way

116
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:30,638
To prepare us a dwelling place there

117
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:37,478
In the sweet by and by

118
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:41,607
In the sweet by and by…

119
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,901
There are no security cameras
pointed at the hill.

120
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,281
But I have camera footage
of the sole witness.

121
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,200
I'll send it over now.

122
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,033
It is now time for you to choose.

123
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,049
Not a sigh

124
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:54,847
For the blessing of rest

125
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:00,144
In the sweet by and by

126
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:04,690
In the sweet by and by

127
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:11,780
We shall meet on that beautiful shore

128
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,287
In the sweet by and by…

129
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,957
WILL

130
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,629
We shall meet on that beautiful shore…

131
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,049
CHIEF PROSECUTOR LEE JANG-SEOK

132
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,594
Assemblyman Gu Yeong-gwan,

133
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,305
Assemblyman Jo Dong-hui,

134
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,683
Assemblyman Song Min-gyu…

135
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,518
KOREAN LIBERAL PARTY MEMBERS
INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL POLITICAL FUNDING

136
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,812
…Assemblyman Choi Seung-seok,

137
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,857
Assemblyman Choi Jin-yeong,

138
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,110
Assemblyman Jang Yun-jun…

139
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,906
Assemblyman Cha Gyeong-min…

140
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,868
Assemblyman Jung Hun-gi…

141
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,119
CHIEF OF STAFF CHOI YEON-SOOK

142
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,085
Mr. President.

143
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:08,962
Now,

144
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,257
a whirlwind is coming.

145
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,692
The prosecution has obtained a list
of 50 Korean Liberal Party lawmakers

146
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,694
who received illegal political funding.

147
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,946
I will stop the tragedy

148
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,116
that could befall our country.

149
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,409
Vice Chairman Kang's slush fund
bankrolled…

150
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,703
I will crush those who sleep in injustice.

151
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,082
I will judge those
who reign above the law…

152
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,711
while I try

153
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,505
to pay off the debt to the nation

154
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,674
that Jang Il-jun left behind.

155
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,218
Enraged citizens are demanding
the resignation of all lawmakers

156
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,178
and an early general election.

157
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,514
The National Assembly
has almost ceased to function,

158
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,559
with all standing committees
and plenary sessions canceled.

159
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,944
Happy birthday.

160
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,196
I do hate your guts,

161
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,490
but I guess old habits die hard.

162
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,034
It's all your fault.

163
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,247
-If you hadn't taken my phone--
-You still blame others for everything.

164
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,001
I used to love how consistent you were.

165
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,547
You know, people rarely change.

166
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,175
I wonder if Jeong Su-jin will.

167
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,469
It was Jeong Su-jin

168
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,598
who stopped the investigation
into Jang Hyeon-su.

169
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,683
Vice Chairman Kang Sang-un took care

170
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,269
of the Jang Hyeon-su issues.

171
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,189
When Kang Sang-un
was making his investments,

172
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,066
Jeong Su-jin was there, wasn't she?

173
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,484
I had no idea

174
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,404
that my husband was accepting
that kind of money.

175
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,699
Jeong Su-jin will be released soon.

176
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,829
It's not that easy
to clear murder charges…

177
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,207
PRESIDENT PARK'S WILL DISCOVERED

178
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,834
Jeong Su-jin received an enormous gift.

179
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:16,048
She really knows how to survive
when being chased by a predator.

180
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,803
You just have to offer up weaker prey.

181
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,014
Watch yourself.

182
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,392
I'm worried this might be
your last birthday.

183
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,186
I mean it.

184
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,907
You may have escaped the murder charges,

185
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,575
but we'll continue to investigate

186
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,329
charges related to the Political Funds Act
and bribing justices.

187
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,084
We are also going to request
a detention warrant.

188
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,169
I'll see you again very soon.

189
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,714
Did you forget?

190
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,384
Article 71 of the Constitution states,

191
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,679
"If the president
is unable to perform his or her duties,

192
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,099
the prime minister acts for him or her."

193
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,644
The moment I walk out of here,

194
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,939
I'll be the acting president
of this nation.

195
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:14,856
Jeong Su-jin!

196
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,984
I will be acting president.

197
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,527
Show some respect.

198
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,757
Dong-ho, the Blue House isn't safe.

199
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,801
PROTESTORS TO STORM THE BLUE HOUSE

200
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,845
I'll come get you with my car--

201
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,762
Jang-seok.

202
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,183
This is

203
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,811
where I should be.

204
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,357
I miss him.

205
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,111
I'll be right there.

206
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,865
The main building is too dangerous,
so I'll meet you by the annex.

207
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,700
Jang-seok.

208
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,202
Do you still believe

209
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,372
that the truth is what defeats lies?

210
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,876
What defeats lies

211
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,128
is bigger lies.

212
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,049
Jang-seok.

213
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,926
Just this once,

214
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,262
be my friend…

215
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,683
and not a prosecutor.

216
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,187
I will, Dong-ho.

217
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,650
Call the reporters.

218
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,569
I have an urgent matter

219
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,946
to share with the press.

220
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,826
GOVERNMENT COMPLEX

221
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,456
We've obtained the undisclosed contents
of the diary that belonged to Han Min-ho.

222
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,584
A shocking report has revealed
that former President Jang

223
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:01,755
was assassinated while hospitalized
at the Armed Forces Capital Hospital.

224
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,799
According to CEO Han's diary,

225
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,760
the cause of President Jang's death
was asphyxiation,

226
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:11,098
and the Prime Minister's Secretary, Lee,
is said to be responsible for his death.

227
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:16,019
Secretary Lee Man-gil
is said to have committed the crime

228
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,314
to divert the attention away
from the private equity fund investigation

229
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,900
and salvage his political career.

230
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,405
Call for a Cabinet meeting.
The prosecution is going to make its move.

231
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,739
We have to take control--

232
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,409
The Prime Minister is said
to have admitted that Secretary Lee

233
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,744
assassinated President Jang

234
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,205
during the investigation
with the prosecution.

235
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:39,376
The prosecution has sent investigators
for an immediate arrest of Lee Man-gil,

236
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,169
who murdered President Jang--

237
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,519
Lee Man-gil.

238
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,189
It's all fabricated.

239
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,316
I know.

240
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,696
You also fabricated
your husband's diary, Prime Minister.

241
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,544
It was also you who told me
that Jang Il-jun should never wake up

242
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,840
if he couldn't wake up and save us.

243
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,470
And that I should wait outside…

244
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,850
if I didn't have the courage to watch.

245
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,316
You're the one who killed Jang Il-jun!

246
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,233
Lee Man-gil.

247
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,404
We must find out…

248
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,116
why they're doing this

249
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,744
and what they intend to achieve!

250
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,912
Turn yourself in.

251
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,831
Tell them it wasn't me.

252
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,251
Tell them

253
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,337
you killed Jang Il-jun.

254
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,225
Don't you…

255
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,355
Don't you remember how we got here?

256
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,237
And what we had to do to come this far?

257
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,787
Turn yourself in. I'm begging you.

258
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,165
You know it wasn't me.

259
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,586
-You're the one who--
-Fine!

260
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:54,970
I killed him.

261
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,516
JEONG SU-JIN CONFESSES
TO ASSASSINATING PRESIDENT JANG

262
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,564
I killed him…

263
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,862
with these hands…

264
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,993
and the handkerchief he gave me.

265
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,546
I promised him as I put him to death…

266
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,636
that I would keep his spirit alive
by killing him.

267
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,433
As I was delivering
the eulogy at his funeral,

268
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,184
I made myself a promise

269
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,730
to make our dream and our time on Earth

270
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,734
a part of our country's proud history.

271
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:56,531
Pull yourself together, Lee Man-gil.
I'm the acting president!

272
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:01,202
I'll be directing
Park Dong-ho's funeral proceedings.

273
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,997
I must turn his funeral

274
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,084
into an opportunity
for my political comeback.

275
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,012
Investigators on standby,
make your way in.

276
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,309
With these very hands
that killed Jang Il-jun…

277
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,189
Lee Man-gil.

278
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,192
Let's make sure it comes true, okay?

279
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,529
And let's write a new history!

280
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:57,258
SO-YEON

281
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,514
Mom, the TV…

282
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,697
JEONG SU-JIN CONFESSES
TO ASSASSINATING PRESIDENT JANG

283
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:16,463
Prime Minister Jeong, you are under arrest
for the assassination of the president.

284
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:52,540
FUNERAL OF PRESIDENT PARK DONG-HO

285
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:05,261
My mind has forgotten you for too long

286
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:11,226
And my legs far too long

287
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:16,314
Have strayed from you

288
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:23,947
But with a slender remembrance

289
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:30,745
Of my heart's burning thirst

290
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:38,920
Secretly, I write your name

291
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,132
With a burning thirst

292
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:48,847
With a burning thirst

293
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:55,937
Long live democracy!

294
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,452
LONG LIVE DEMOCRACY

295
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,883
Long live

296
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:10,720
Long live

297
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:16,351
Democracy

298
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:23,441
Long live democracy!

299
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:40,541
People say,

300
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,002
"Darkness shall never prevail over light."

301
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,088
There is no light in this country.

302
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,256
Darkness fights even darker forces,

303
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,927
pretending and claiming to be light.

304
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,556
I will clear away
the darkness on the left,

305
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,476
crush the darkness on the right,

306
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,853
and create a new light.

307
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,362
I have never once

308
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,657
done politics for the people.

309
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,034
I did it all for myself.

310
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,415
I did it because I couldn't stand
the ugliness of this world.

311
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,710
I did it
because I couldn't stand being ruled

312
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,169
by the unrighteous.

313
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,650
I, Park Dong-ho,

314
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,236
will take the filth of this world

315
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,614
and step away
from the spotlight of history.

316
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:22,101
WHIRLWIND
PARK DONG-HO

317
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,233
It's time for me

318
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,819
to leave now…

319
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,826
for the sake of the things
that should stay.
