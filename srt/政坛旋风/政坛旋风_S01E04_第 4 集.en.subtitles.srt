1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,347
In front of the NTV station, where
the KLP primary debate is being held,

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,016
supporters of each candidate

3
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,685
have been clashing
since early this morning.

4
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:22,105
Selecting three candidates
to advance to the final race…

5
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,860
All candidates are emphasizing
their ties to the late president.

6
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,487
I'm sure Park Dong-ho will do the same.

7
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,532
He served him for ten years,
so he will play the sympathy card--

8
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,159
You have to ask questions

9
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,870
he can't answer.

10
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,539
Let me ask you this, Mr. Park.

11
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:43,334
The prosecution went after
the president's family over false rumors.

12
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,212
They conducted
coercive investigations into his son,

13
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,299
not to mention their threat
against the First Lady.

14
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,303
Dismissing Prosecutor Lee Jang-seok,
who led all these atrocities,

15
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,847
is the first step
toward prosecution reform.

16
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,267
We have prepared a proposal
to remove Mr. Lee.

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,560
Would you approve it?

18
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,108
By approving it, he'd be acknowledging
the investigation was an overreach.

19
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,111
By refusing it, he'd be seen
as siding with the prosecution

20
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,280
who disparaged the president's family.

21
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:13,865
Let's show them

22
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,702
who Jang Il-Jun's political heir is.

23
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:23,291
Jeong Su-jin!

24
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,876
Mr. Park.

25
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,587
Do you disagree with prosecution reform?

26
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,924
KOREAN LIBERAL PARTY
PRIMARY DEBATE

27
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:31,841
I will

28
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,344
reform the reform.

29
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,181
Once I take office as president,

30
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:42,685
I will order a reinvestigation
into the private equity fund case.

31
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,524
I'll dig into the possible involvement
of the president's son--

32
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,651
It's an insult to the president's family.

33
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,487
-That's a baseless rumor--
-The prosecution will investigate.

34
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,656
The court will judge.

35
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,284
Do you mean to defame the late president?

36
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,786
Death doesn't grant absolution.

37
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,870
Mr. Park Dong-ho!

38
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,126
The late president is a symbol
of the Korean Liberal Party

39
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,211
and the heart of the reform.

40
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,504
Trying to defame him--

41
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:13,883
You are all glorifying the late president
to take advantage of his legacy.

42
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,722
You can share his legacy however you like.

43
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,723
Meanwhile,

44
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,476
I'll try to pay off the debt to the nation

45
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,311
that Jang Il-jun left behind.

46
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,439
THE WHIRLWIND

47
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,443
EPISODE 4

48
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,070
Wait just a little longer.

49
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,072
I am waiting.

50
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,498
Don't I deserve to know
when I will be released,

51
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,334
given I have waited so long?

52
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,338
I think I'd like to taste the coffee
served by the prosecution tomorrow.

53
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,464
I will go there

54
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,383
and tell them why Jang Il-jun collapsed

55
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,010
and what Park Dong-do did.

56
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,470
-All of it.
-Be my guest.

57
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,222
If you tell them about the fund,

58
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,432
I will end up in jail too.

59
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,352
You can show me the ropes
as the more experienced inmate.

60
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,895
Come on, Su-jin.

61
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:53,733
I… want to survive.

62
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,526
That's a good idea.

63
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,862
What did the chairman say?

64
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,365
You're not the only son

65
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,200
I can hand my company over to.

66
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,536
I have two more sons.

67
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,538
A tiny problem at the group

68
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,833
irritates your father
more than a tumor in your body.

69
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,378
Sang-jin looks very confident.

70
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,464
Would you like to see
your brother in the chairman's seat?

71
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:23,346
The only way for you to get released
and take control of Daejin Group is…

72
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,270
for me to become
the owner of the Blue House.

73
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,028
And Park Dong-ho?

74
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,446
You will see him frequently.

75
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,742
I will make sure

76
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,829
that he ends up where you are.

77
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,214
Prosecutor Jeong Pil-gyu
of Seoul Central DPO

78
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,216
held an emergency briefing this afternoon

79
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,303
to discuss the investigation
into bribery committed by Mr. Park,

80
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,014
a prospective candidate
for the Korean Liberal Party.

81
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,933
I am resuming
an investigation that was halted

82
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,853
due to the tragic event
of President Jang Il-jun's passing.

83
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,397
There's no political agenda here.

84
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,107
CANDIDATE PARK DONG-HO'S CAMPAIGN CAMP

85
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,817
Ma'am, NTV has requested an interview.

86
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,863
No one here should contact the media
until our message is ready.

87
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:29,078
TBC has set up a specific team
to focus on in-depth coverage.

88
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,123
Details of the investigation
are being leaked on an hourly basis.

89
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,209
Prosecutor Jeong Pil-gyu
is their source at the Seoul DPO.

90
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,837
Jeong Pil-gyu.

91
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,131
He is Jeong Su-jin's cousin.

92
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,676
He was a nobody, but Jeong Su-jin
put him at the Central DPO.

93
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,805
They fabricated the bribery case
related to the crypto brokerage.

94
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,474
This is the problem with truth.

95
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,309
It unveils itself too late.

96
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,520
Everyone shoots off emails these days.

97
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,147
God, it's so dull.

98
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,024
CHOI SE-WON
CRYPTO BROKERAGE CHAIRMAN

99
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,859
How about we write a letter

100
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,903
with a human touch?

101
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,074
I learned a lesson when I buried Gi-tae.

102
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,119
One word is enough
to make false accusations,

103
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,705
but a thousand words

104
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,458
aren't enough to prove innocence.

105
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,542
Here's one more.

106
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,921
The truth does not defeat lies.

107
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,715
Bigger lies do.

108
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,803
A handwritten letter by Chairman Choi,
who is under arrest,

109
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,639
sent to the Daejong Daily
has been obtained.

110
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,767
Chairman Choi admitted
that he offered Mr. Park one billion won

111
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,771
while he was prime minister
in exchange for immunity from a tax audit.

112
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,775
The dates and locations are
all listed in the handwritten letter…

113
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,111
These bastards are all the same.

114
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,863
How dare he criticize the late president!

115
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,573
SPECIFIED CRIMINAL CHARGES

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,368
The three of us

117
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,996
will remember today for a very long time.

118
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,588
I'd like to remember today
as a victorious day.

119
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,799
Today will be

120
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,301
a nightmare for Jeong Su-jin.

121
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,888
I know it's a difficult decision

122
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,434
to transfer the case to the CIO
because the prosecution cannot be trusted.

123
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,854
Lee Jung-gwon, head of the CIO,
is candidate Park Chang-sik's man.

124
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,982
They will probably cook something up.

125
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,650
You might get caught in a trap.

126
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,485
Since that's gonna happen anyway,

127
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,945
I will speed it up.

128
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,739
Jang-seok.

129
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,908
I am on my way to the CIO.

130
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,493
He is here.

131
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,956
CIO: CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION OFFICE
FOR HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS

132
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,183
Well, I don't know

133
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,561
if my inexperienced men here
can handle a former ace prosecutor

134
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,939
with ten years of experience
in the special investigation unit.

135
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,486
I shouldn't keep someone who suffers
from diabetes and hyperlipidemia

136
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,237
for too long.

137
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,240
Let's cut to the chase.

138
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,120
May I ask for another cup of tea?

139
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,880
Primary elections are decided
by members of the party.

140
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,926
Jeong Su-jin is supported
by Jang Il-jun's faction.

141
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,970
Probably this much.

142
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,437
You have support
from traditional party members.

143
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,940
Probably about that much.

144
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,697
Candidate Park Dong-ho

145
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,243
has the votes of party members
against Jang Il-jun.

146
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,917
We cannot hand over those votes,
but you will get a chance to take them.

147
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,388
Park Dong-ho must stay in the race

148
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,392
so I can have a chance, is that it?

149
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,602
I believe this was

150
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,981
a candidate's strategy
in a presidential election in the '80s.

151
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,570
"The three-candidate election strategy."

152
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,826
Chairman Choi claimed in his letter

153
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,079
that he gave me one billion won
on November 12th.

154
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,709
But I was at the president's safe house
in Samcheongdong that day.

155
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,923
The dead don't speak.

156
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,926
Thus, the late president
can't confirm your alibi.

157
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,596
The person I had dinner with…

158
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,057
was Jeong Su-jin.

159
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,020
Jeong Su-jin is

160
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,938
my alibi.

161
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,234
Jeong Su-jin!

162
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,195
We love you!

163
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,877
Thank you.

164
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,505
I checked both his official
and personal schedules.

165
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,133
I chose a date for which he had no alibi.

166
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,218
Wait.

167
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,181
Put down November 19th for the date.

168
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,808
Right, that's good.

169
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,311
What great handwriting.

170
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,230
The date in the letter was changed.

171
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,440
NOVEMBER 12, 2021

172
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,817
On that date…

173
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,330
This is Jeong Su-jin.

174
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,208
This is Seo Jeong-yeon,
Park Dong-ho's campaign director.

175
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,919
A lot of people are watching.
You should smile.

176
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,929
The truth does not defeat lies.

177
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,931
Bigger lies do.

178
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,146
Please change the date in the letter
you are sending to the media tomorrow.

179
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,067
I'll consider it as a tribute
to my dead brother,

180
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,653
who was your friend for 30 years.

181
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,579
If you don't believe my alibi,

182
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,833
check Jeong Su-jin's schedule
for November 12th.

183
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,465
I remember seeing you
at Assemblyman Seo's funeral.

184
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,802
You were his only sister.

185
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,435
I am sorry

186
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,311
for your loss.

187
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,482
Do not apologize

188
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,943
for something I cannot forgive.

189
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,411
My brother left me a dossier.

190
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,124
A dossier on your husband
and his private equity fund business,

191
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,001
as well as

192
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,503
information on what happened

193
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,839
on November 12th.

194
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,552
NOVEMBER 12, 2021

195
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,763
I'd like to meet with the president.

196
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,432
I can go to the Blue House…

197
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,396
or the dude can come to me.

198
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,985
You should put out the fire you started.
Otherwise, the CIO will come for you.

199
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,368
Will what started

200
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,746
on November 12th

201
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,624
be revealed this time?

202
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,795
The handwritten letter
that Chairman Choi wrote

203
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,130
ripped Park Dong-ho apart.

204
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,383
I doubt the CIO will release

205
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,803
someone who is knee-deep in trouble.

206
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,433
We prepared the justification for that.

207
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,695
Ma'am.

208
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,701
The current government policy
is not to have private meetings

209
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,787
with entrepreneurs.

210
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,289
That's too bad.

211
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,792
I already paid the bill.

212
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,923
What would you like to do?

213
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,760
This is why
couples should talk to each other.

214
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:20,818
There she is!

215
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,282
What are your thoughts
on Chairman Choi's letter?

216
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,533
Any comments, ma'am?

217
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,743
-Please!
-Tell us what you think.

218
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,082
At a safe house in Samcheongdong
on November 12th,

219
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,544
I had dinner with then-Prime Minister Park

220
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,506
and discussed national affairs
late into the evening.

221
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,383
That is true.

222
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,261
Are you saying
Chairman Choi's letter is fake?

223
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,264
Isn't Chairman Choi

224
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,933
a three-time convicted criminal for fraud,

225
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,561
breach of trust, and embezzlement?

226
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,731
This incident urges the media

227
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,107
to reflect on itself

228
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,527
for accepting the words of a fraudster
without fact-checking.

229
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,586
Clear that bastard Park Dong-ho

230
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,505
of all charges and set him loose.

231
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,474
You should obey the order…

232
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,729
of a superior who set the target.

233
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,820
Great job dodging
all the traps set by Jeong Su-jin.

234
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,698
It seems like just yesterday

235
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,034
that you first entered
the political arena.

236
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,163
I learned how to win…

237
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,416
by getting defeated.

238
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,587
I would like to express my gratitude
to Assemblywoman Jeong

239
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,424
for speaking the truth instead of
using this situation for her benefit,

240
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,344
even during this primary.

241
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,143
Ma'am.

242
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,771
Namsan C&C is calling.

243
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,651
NAMSAN C&C SECRETARY'S OFFICE

244
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,494
I told you to hand over your shares
to Cheol-un long ago.

245
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,457
Su-jin.

246
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,045
I founded Namsan C&C
and grew the business--

247
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:45,963
I'm not asking.

248
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,674
Walk away from the company.

249
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,217
You can sell it if you need to.

250
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,552
Jeong Su-jin!

251
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,649
Who the hell do you think I am?

252
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,529
30 YEARS AGO
NCSR LAUNCHING CEREMONY

253
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,616
The NCSR, National Council
of Student Representatives,

254
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,454
the united heart
of one million young students!

255
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,749
Let us support Chairman Han Min-ho

256
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,419
and show the world
our strong determination!

257
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,093
Even if our time is short

258
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,805
We are as proud as the mountains

259
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,559
If we have to live fighting…

260
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,770
JEONG SU-JIN
CULTURAL PROPAGANDA DIVISION (NCSR)

261
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,480
Through the silence of the streets

262
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,317
We will burn the night of despair

263
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,196
That is darker than death

264
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,949
We will march in blizzards and rainstorms

265
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,203
To the frontlines
To the frontlines, to the frontlines

266
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,245
The vice chairman,

267
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,789
directors,

268
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,001
and even kids with no titles who were
under my command are now politicians.

269
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,296
Some run the country at the Blue House,

270
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,508
and others make a living
by working as mayors,

271
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,595
provincial governors,
and even district mayors.

272
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,183
Chairman Han Min-ho of the NCSR?

273
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,230
I'm nobody in the political arena,
but I want to show them…

274
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,402
I am still somebody, Su-jin.

275
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,291
Is that why you met with Kang Sang-un?

276
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,010
Is that why…

277
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,349
you dragged me into this trap?

278
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:09,982
Listen.

279
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,110
-It's because of Park Dong-ho--
-You…

280
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,074
You and I…

281
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,498
should've been like Park Dong-ho.

282
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,677
I am so ashamed…

283
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,556
of my youth…

284
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,575
for looking up to someone like you.

285
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,787
Su-jin.

286
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,836
Why can't I abandon…

287
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,133
someone like you?

288
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,498
KOREAN LIBERAL PARTY PRELIMINARY RESULTS
A THREE-WAY RACE

289
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,462
The candidate will be decided
by electoral college votes.

290
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,632
Jeong Su-jin will use public sympathy
from her memorial sentiments.

291
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,176
Park Chang-sik will use
his group of people.

292
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,805
Then we will have to use
our group as well.

293
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:10,102
No one else is capable of registering
tens of thousands of people

294
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,561
but Park Chang-sik.

295
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:20,904
Zhuge Liang won the Battle of Red Cliffs
by obtaining the enemy's arrows.

296
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,160
The leader of anti-communism.

297
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,830
The spiritual leader
of right-wing extremists.

298
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,748
Jo Sang-cheon.

299
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,422
I am going to borrow arrows
from Jo Sang-cheon

300
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,216
of the New Conservative Party.

301
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,734
Sir.

302
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,155
It has been confirmed
that Mr. Jo Sang-cheon's father,

303
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,116
Jo Dal-hyeon,
is currently alive in North Korea.

304
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,702
Seven years ago, North Korean Leader Kim

305
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:12,748
visited the Bochon carp farm
located in Chosan-gun, Jagang Province.

306
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,208
The head of the fish farm
seen in the footage

307
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,837
has been confirmed to be Jo Dal-hyeon,
the father of Mr. Jo Sang-cheon.

308
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,465
Mr. Jo Dal-hyeon
was kidnapped by North Korea

309
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,343
while fishing near Baengnyeongdo
in the West Sea in 1978.

310
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,054
Although he was assumed to have died,

311
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,849
he was working as a fish processor
in the fishery business.

312
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,481
This is Park Dong-ho.

313
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,692
Oh my.

314
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,570
What an incredible gift you sent me.

315
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,033
I don't know
how I can possibly thank you enough.

316
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,623
He wanted to catch more fish
to help pay for your school,

317
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,125
so he took the boat out in the storm.

318
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,835
I'm worried, Sang-cheon.

319
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,589
Dad!

320
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,591
Dad, can you hear me?

321
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,134
Dad!

322
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,187
The engine broke down.

323
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,940
The tide seems to be moving north.

324
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,691
What do we do?

325
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,363
Dad!

326
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,407
You must be able to hear me!

327
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,326
Dad!

328
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,174
Dad!

329
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,841
Has it already been ten years?

330
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,093
I thought to myself

331
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,347
that a delicate scholar
had joined us in the political arena,

332
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,475
but you became a shithead.

333
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,732
Your father, Jo Dal-hyeon,

334
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:47,736
was awarded the Red Flag Medal
of the Third Revolution in 1987

335
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,281
for his loyalty to the North Korean regime
after his kidnapping.

336
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,284
This will be in the morning newspapers.

337
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,912
If this is not a big enough gift--

338
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,954
Do you think

339
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,832
this will shake me up?

340
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,336
It will at least
shake up the hearts of those

341
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,880
who stood by your cause.

342
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,103
What if I want to

343
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,314
refuse your gifts?

344
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,609
I need voters to support me

345
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,070
in the final primary
for the Korean Liberal Party.

346
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:34,157
You have the power to quietly enlist
numerous people in the electoral college.

347
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:42,123
If you want food, wag your tail.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

348
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,002
You wouldn't grab my hand
unless I pushed you from a cliff.

349
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,098
Meddling in another party's primary…

350
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,435
is a criminal act, isn't it?

351
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,148
You manipulated investigations
and espionage cases,

352
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,318
earning promotions and a spot
at the Supreme Prosecutor's Office.

353
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,236
So live your life

354
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,114
as you have lived.

355
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:32,966
You seem to

356
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,219
know me quite well.

357
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,139
But I don't know what to make of you.

358
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,726
What a shame.

359
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,228
When a lion is hunting,

360
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,732
it tends to target the weakest prey.

361
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,613
Sir!

362
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,489
Please put me

363
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,200
in the ring.

364
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:15,300
This is the result of the two-way race
announced this morning.

365
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:19,929
Jeong Su-jin 52 vs. Jo Sang-cheon 38.

366
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:24,517
Park Chang-sik 40 vs. Jo Sang-cheon 41.

367
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:30,023
Park Dong-ho 31 vs. Jo Sang-cheon 45.

368
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,192
The only candidate

369
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:36,821
who can achieve a profound victory
in the upcoming presidential election

370
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,906
is me.

371
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,533
Jeong Su-jin.

372
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,912
I ask you this, Mr. Park Dong-ho.

373
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,083
You said you'd create a country
in which justice prevails.

374
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,253
How do you plan to achieve that

375
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,130
after you lose the election?

376
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,182
I have already

377
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,810
made myself perfectly clear.

378
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,651
Sir.

379
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,236
Please put me

380
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,154
in the ring.

381
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,198
Now, I am

382
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,326
waiting for the answer.

383
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,496
When a lion is hunting,

384
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,958
it tends to target the weakest prey.

385
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,011
TWO-WAY RACE FOR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
14% DIFFERENCE

386
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,894
Call the director in. Quickly!

387
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,108
KOREAN LIBERAL PARTY
MEMBER RECRUITMENT CENTER

388
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,991
Member recruitment
takes place over three days.

389
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,702
I mobilized
President Jang Il-jun's fan club

390
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,328
and sites that support us.

391
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,334
Half a million people signed up
on the first day.

392
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,670
It is estimated
that 50,000 are for Park Dong-ho,

393
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,088
150,000 are for you,

394
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,257
and the remaining 300,000
are for Jeong Su-jin.

395
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,345
Look, it's Park Chang-sik.

396
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,566
Name your price.

397
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,988
Anything you want
except for the Blue House.

398
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,119
Do you want a unified campaign?

399
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,667
We've got to take care of
our hard-working supporters.

400
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,545
Any secretary position

401
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,297
or a nomination for a seat.

402
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:02,926
Dong-ho.

403
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,223
If you add one drop of your water
to my bucket…

404
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,228
Jeong Su-jin is riding the wave
of sentiment for President Jang Il-jun.

405
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,857
No wave lasts all day.

406
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,069
All you have is a drop of water.

407
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,698
Sell it for a high price
when someone thirsty wants it badly.

408
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,353
Name your price.

409
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,399
Anything you want
except for the Blue House, sir.

410
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,459
I have been told

411
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,838
that you could add your tea to my cup.

412
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,132
I think…

413
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,511
I'd like to drink it myself.

414
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,896
What are your intentions?

415
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,401
You said you wanted to create
a world free of foul play.

416
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,945
You're hiding your intentions…

417
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,908
while trying to figure out mine.

418
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,284
Isn't that foul play?

419
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,671
It's the last day of voter recruitment.

420
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,423
After visiting the First Lady at 11:00,

421
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,967
I've only scheduled events
related to President Jang.

422
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,093
Did you tell her…

423
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,178
I told her

424
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,180
that if she cries today,

425
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,683
she will smile for the rest of her life.

426
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:23,733
PRIVATE RESIDENCE OF THE FIRST LADY

427
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,920
ESTIMATED ELECTORAL VOTES PER CANDIDATE

428
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,839
PARK DONG-HO 50,000/PARK CHANG-SIK 300,000
JEONG SU-JIN 600,000

429
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,717
Call the local committee chairmen!

430
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:54,347
Tell the bastards to grab 1,000 people
by the collar and make them sign up. Now!

431
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,893
GRAVE OF PRESIDENT JANG IL-JUN

432
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,646
ESTIMATED ELECTORAL VOTES PER CANDIDATE

433
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,071
HOW TO JOIN KLP'S ELECTORAL COLLEGE

434
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,198
ESTIMATED ELECTORAL VOTES PER CANDIDATE

435
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:04,208
PARK DONG-HO 70,000/PARK CHANG-SIK 420,000
JEONG SU-JIN 1,030,000

436
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,216
In 2008, he withdrew
once it was clear he'd lose the primary

437
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,801
due to "family objections."

438
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18,765
He's dropped out of the race three times,
including the 2013 and 2018 primaries.

439
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,100
He is afraid of being defeated.

440
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,186
Will he make the move as we planned?

441
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,479
He's only human.

442
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,982
He will live his life as he has lived.

443
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:29,692
Thump!

444
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:31,903
Thump!

445
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,451
I, the living
and breathing Park Chang-sik,

446
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,746
was defeated by a dead man,

447
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,372
Jang Il-jun.

448
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,139
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

449
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,391
Here.

450
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:07,980
Do you remember that we drank here
when you failed the bar exam?

451
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,565
How could I ever forget?

452
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,402
The guy buying me consolation drinks
forgot his wallet.

453
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,948
The guy who passed with the highest score

454
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,243
didn't say a word
because he felt bad for me.

455
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,746
We drank the entire case of makgeolli

456
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,706
with just one green onion pancake.

457
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,466
He really did

458
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,344
love makgeolli so much.

459
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,428
Jang-seok.

460
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,180
I don't want to…

461
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,684
think back on times

462
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,561
that won't come back.

463
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,361
I heard

464
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,407
Jeong Su-jin has
a staggering number of estimated votes.

465
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,827
You did your best.

466
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,995
Take a break and--

467
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,413
I've told you

468
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,123
I will create the world

469
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,167
Gi-tae wished to see.

470
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,837
Listen, Dong-ho.

471
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,005
If I meet my end

472
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,467
and you are the only one
left sitting here, Jang-seok,

473
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,387
I want you to create the world

474
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,264
I wished to see.

475
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,610
Sir, Mr. Park Chang-sik announced
his withdrawal from the race.

476
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,117
Dear fellow citizens

477
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,580
and comrades of the Korean Liberal Party,

478
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,166
I am

479
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,126
withdrawing

480
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,587
my candidacy

481
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:59,091
from the primary election
of the Korean Liberal Party.

482
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,393
I wanted to create a world
free of foul play for my fellow citizens.

483
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:14,649
But in an election process
rife with cheating and foul play,

484
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,527
my vision was powerless.

485
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,865
To those who have supported me throughout…

486
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,824
PARK DONG-HO

487
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,993
…I sincerely express my gratitude.

488
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,221
He is waiting for you.

489
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,098
I will take you to him.

490
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,067
I'm here.

491
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,195
You asked me to meet.

492
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,448
Now that we have, I'm leaving.

493
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,367
You have 420,000 electoral votes.

494
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,411
Give them to me.

495
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,123
Oh my.

496
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,252
Some people like to kick others
when they are down.

497
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,713
But that takes balls.

498
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,923
How can you be so audacious?

499
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,470
You climbed your way up from the bottom
as a member of the Korean Liberal Party.

500
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,556
Your impressive experience
as an assemblyman,

501
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,143
party leader, and Supreme Council member
has secured you 420,000 votes.

502
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,520
Are you throwing those votes away?

503
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:24,403
Forget about subtraction.
It's time for us to do some addition.

504
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:28,949
Even if we combine ours, it's 500,000.
Jeong Su-jin has over a million.

505
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,409
Of her million votes,

506
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,163
300,000 are my arrows.

507
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,376
300,000 is the limit.

508
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,503
If I try to get more,

509
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,338
they will know.

510
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,634
I will make good use
of the arrows you provided.

511
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,887
Your survival

512
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,347
will guarantee mine.

513
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,475
Jo Sang-cheon,
the spiritual leader of the extremist?

514
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,894
I really wanted to win.

515
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,480
He fabricated
the Chungju espionage incident

516
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:03,359
and committed judicial murder
by executing two prisoners of conscience!

517
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,277
I had no other choice.

518
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,445
Park Dong-ho!

519
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:10,116
It's mud-slinging politics,
but there are some paths you don't take.

520
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,959
You stayed silent

521
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,212
when Seo Gi-tae was falsely accused.

522
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,799
Was that the right path to take?

523
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,596
How about refusing
an investigation after his death?

524
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,099
Was that also the right path?

525
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,269
If you know

526
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,063
the right path, then show me.

527
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,783
You had an enormous campaign camp.

528
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,785
Shouldn't you make sure they have a job?

529
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,454
You sided with Jo Sang-cheon--

530
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,331
You don't have to act righteous
in front of me.

531
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,627
Yeouido is like a dog fighting ring.

532
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,421
Isn't it good to have…

533
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,758
at least one person you can open up to?

534
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,904
JEONG SU-JIN EXPECTED TO WIN

535
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,655
A landslide victory is certain.

536
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,826
-As an official presidential candidate--
-I will visit President Jang's grave.

537
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,121
You went there during the primary…

538
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,167
-I will let the media know.
-No.

539
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,460
I will go by myself,

540
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,754
not as a candidate.

541
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,383
If I don't win,

542
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,553
I will never be forgiven.

543
00:41:55,429 --> 00:42:00,726
Jeong Su-jin!

544
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:05,189
Jeong Su-jin!

545
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,399
-Thank you.
-Jeong Su-jin!

546
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,737
Jeong Su-jin!

547
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,738
The party of hope,

548
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,200
KLP, is shaping a new Korea
for the 21st century.

549
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,036
I will now announce
the result of the primary election

550
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,288
for our party's presidential candidate.

551
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:26,252
Out of a total
of 1,524,321 in the electoral college,

552
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:31,006
1,215,645 people participated.

553
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,842
Voter turnout was 79.74%.

554
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,720
Ms. Jeong Su-jin has

555
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,349
598,792 votes.

556
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,687
Mr. Park Dong-ho has…

557
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,066
603,475 votes.

558
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,069
13,378 votes were invalid.

559
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,071
I declare Mr. Park Dong-ho

560
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,074
as the presidential candidate
for the Korean Liberal Party.

561
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,743
Park Dong-ho!

562
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,745
ACCEPTANCE SPEECH

563
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:08,502
Park Dong-ho!

564
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,042
Do you think you can defeat me?

565
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,460
I must!

566
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,254
Because the future you create

567
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,049
shouldn't be a part of history.

568
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:37,091
THE WHIRLWIND
