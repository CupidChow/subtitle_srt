EPISODE 3

2
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,624
{\an8}<i>The operation will begin.</i>
<i>Is everyone ready?</i>

3
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,270
{\an8}Ma'am, this way, please.
Watch your step there.

4
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:03,439
{\an8}Congratulations.

5
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,940
{\an8}I prepared what you wanted.

6
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:06,901
{\an8}-Thank you.
-Thank you.

7
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,152
{\an8}Oh, how about a toast?

8
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,487
{\an8}Yes, cheers.

9
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,404
{\an8}I love you all.

10
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:11,530
{\an8}-Thank you.
-Thank you.

11
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:12,490
{\an8}I love you.

12
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,285
{\an8}Thank you so much again.

13
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,621
{\an8}I was able to manage through the year,
thanks to you, ma'am.

14
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,247
-Thanks for your hard work.
-Goodness.

15
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:21,165
Oh, don't mention it.

16
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,502
By the way, is our next step
going to work, Yi-rang? Boss?

17
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:28,422
Don't worry. We have James.

18
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,989
I'm counting on you, Yi-rang.

19
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,104
Do you want to go somewhere quiet?

20
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,022
Where we can be alone?

21
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,532
Oh, what's he saying?

22
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,325
Gosh, that's so lame.

23
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,336
Okay, I got his fingerprint.

24
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,339
Just as I expected.

25
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,551
What exactly were you expecting?

26
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,471
Well, what should I say?

27
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,474
Fabulous, sophisticated,

28
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,101
and luxurious.

29
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,021
And?

30
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,690
And excellent.

31
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,364
I like that.

32
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,376
We, Wonderby, will be purchasing

33
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,048
numerous works through you from now on.

34
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,926
As you know,

35
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,722
Wonderby Auction
is leading the global art scene.

36
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,314
What can you offer me?

37
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,361
Tell me what you want, Olivia.

38
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,571
I will find you anything you want.

39
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,658
I'd do anything for you. Anything.

40
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,285
Really?

41
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,497
What?

42
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,666
Yi-rang, stop with that voice.

43
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,583
<i>Hear me?</i>

44
00:06:59,044 --> 00:06:59,878
Really?

45
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,716
Olivia.

46
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:11,807
I've handled masterpieces
far beyond anything you've ever seen.

47
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,183
And...

48
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,395
would you believe me if I said

49
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,898
even bigger works have been created

50
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,693
by my own hands?

51
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,166
Mr…

52
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,336
My apologies.
I didn't know you were with a guest.

53
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,380
Well, the commission has been settled.

54
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,632
Excuse me.

55
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,766
Well, Chairman Kim offered 50 million won.

56
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,395
You may leave.

57
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,196
-Olivia.
-Yes?

58
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,948
Will you look at that painting
for a second?

59
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:11,658
Oh my!

60
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:12,784
One second.

61
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:34,806
I got the password!

62
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,183
<i>Password secured.</i>

63
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,270
I'm going to be a waiter now.

64
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,147
Let's do this.

65
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,573
-It's beautiful.
-It is.

66
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,826
What's wrong?

67
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,328
-What's wrong?
-I can't breathe.

68
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,996
-Are you okay?
-I can't breathe.

69
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,082
It's suffocating.

70
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,669
You do look pale.
I think you're having cold sweats.

71
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,131
It's because I wore a tight dress
to impress someone today.

72
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,637
Whose favor?

73
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,517
Gosh, you're too much!

74
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,602
Naughty! Oh, seriously.

75
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,731
Yes. I am, aren't I?

76
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,109
Here.

77
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,318
Oh, Olivia.

78
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,741
Do you want to go outside
for some fresh air?

79
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,411
Shall we?

80
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,164
Let's do that then. Be careful now.

81
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,666
Follow me.

82
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,631
I feel lightheaded.

83
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,551
Oh, boy. You should've told me.

84
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,304
I'm sorry. Be careful.

85
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,254
The desk.

86
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,006
Next to the desk?

87
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,592
Right. Behind the frame next to the desk.

88
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,885
Slide it, right?

89
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:37,429
What…

90
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:51,943
Do you still feel suffocated?

91
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,945
I feel much better.

92
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:55,989
I'm glad to hear that.

93
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,286
By the way,
you've achieved enough in Korea.

94
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,205
Don't you want to advance abroad?

95
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,166
I think I can help you with that.

96
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:10,003
I still have things to do here.

97
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,214
Perhaps,

98
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,716
it's the most important job

99
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,344
in an art critic's career.

100
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:19,554
What could that be?

101
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,432
What is it?

102
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,394
Olivia is so curious!

103
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,401
Olivia,

104
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,487
if you ask me, I can't help but tell you.

105
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,825
Seriously, what is it?

106
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,368
I'm really curious.

107
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,223
Discovering the van Gogh of Korea.

108
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,018
That's my life's dream.

109
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,147
You want to discover
Korea's Vincent van Gogh?

110
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,398
Discovering an unknown painter,

111
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,359
who was so obsessed with art
that they devoted their entire life to it

112
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,944
and died without a name.

113
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,822
It's a noble calling
that gives their work a second life.

114
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,161
I believe that it's worth
dedicating my life to.

115
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,996
Seriously, cut the crap.

116
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,290
I'm touched.

117
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,918
Not only is your insight remarkable.

118
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,171
So are you.

119
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,719
Gosh, you flatter me.

120
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,767
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop myself.

121
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,978
I should've held back.

122
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,565
Oh, wait. You got some…

123
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:58,570
Olivia.

124
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,117
Holding back will make you sick.

125
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,286
Don't hold back.

126
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:26,890
What's that?

127
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,352
Security! Run to my office! Hurry!

128
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,770
Yes, sir.

129
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,189
Make some noise!

130
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,863
Make some noise!

131
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,865
Jump!

132
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,785
<i>-James, buy me more time.</i>
-What?

133
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,078
I can't hear you.

134
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,371
What? Stop them?

135
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,373
Where are they?

136
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,667
Got it.

137
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,045
To the right!

138
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,926
Jump!

139
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,179
Jump higher!

140
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,188
Damn it.

141
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:38,878
What the…

142
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,310
Something wrong?

143
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,280
CHEONMYEONG SHOP

144
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,698
3 MONTHS AGO

145
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:07,907
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

146
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,035
One second. It's Gu-ho.

147
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,536
Gu-ho, when will you be back?

148
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,330
You said you'd toast marshmallows for us.

149
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,457
<i>I'm getting tired of waiting for you.</i>

150
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,666
<i>Gu-ho, hurry up.</i>

151
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,044
I promise I'll visit you soon.

152
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,130
I shouldn't have called you
when you were busy.

153
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,050
Are you ill, by the way?
You don't sound good.

154
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,260
<i>No, I'm not ill.</i>

155
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:32,057
She used to call me every day,
but I haven't been able to reach her.

156
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,725
<i>She's never done that before.</i>

157
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,228
It's probably nothing.
I will visit her later.

158
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,231
If you could do that for me,
I'd really appreciate it.

159
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,358
All right.

160
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,533
So, did you all get what you want?
What are you having?

161
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,869
GYEONGJEON OFFICETEL, UNIT 602

162
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,788
Gyeongjeon Officetel.

163
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:55,789
GYEONGJEON OFFICETEL

164
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:56,706
Okay.

165
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,265
Bo-ra.

166
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:16,810
Bo-ra.

167
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,285
<i>Bo-ra?</i>

168
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,080
<i>Bo-ra?</i>

169
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,623
<i>Bo-ra?</i>

170
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,085
No!

171
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,225
Hey, are you okay?

172
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:51,112
He's here to see you.
Don't you want to see his face?

173
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,578
Say something, Bo-ra, will you?

174
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,337
Ma'am, I will go and get what Bo-ra needs.

175
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,297
Will you do that for me?

176
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,591
I think I should stay by her side.

177
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,509
Sure.

178
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,409
MY SECRET WEAPON IS STILL IN MY HANDS
THAT IS HOPE

179
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,286
{\an8}IN EVERYONE'S HEART
THERE IS A JEWEL OF THOUGHT

180
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,872
{\an8}AFTER THE INTERNSHIP
IT'S THE EXHIBITION!

181
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,165
ONE DAY, I'M GOING TO SHINE

182
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:19,409
{\an8}<i>He called me to his office again.</i>

183
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,662
<i>He fondled and touched me again.</i>

184
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:31,129
{\an8}<i>When I try to avoid him,</i>
<i>he talks about my debut.</i>

185
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,553
{\an8}TREASURE HUNT

186
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:42,307
{\an8}Then, today, will we get to see
an authentic masterpiece?

187
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,935
Let's bring in today's client.
Please come out.

188
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,531
It's Legall's work.

189
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:02,660
My mother purchased it
from an art gallery in Paris 25 years ago.

190
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,829
I have a certificate of authenticity too.

191
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,457
May I take a look?

192
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,374
Yes.

193
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,256
Thank you.

194
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:16,549
Sure.

195
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,929
Let me take a look at the painting
for a moment.

196
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,729
May I ask the purchase price?

197
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:33,775
My mother said
she paid 12 million won at the time…

198
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:37,528
After the IMF crisis,

199
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,906
when the country's economy
was back on the right track,

200
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:44,869
many malicious painting sellers abroad
took advantage of many Korean tourists.

201
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,621
I see.

202
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,375
Your mother was one of them.

203
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:52,710
What?

204
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,464
Wait, then are you saying
this is counterfeit?

205
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,383
No.

206
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:01,928
It's worse than that.

207
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:03,471
What?

208
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,391
The painting material, the brushstrokes,
and even the composition…

209
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,558
Everything's terrible.

210
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:11,270
This doesn't do Legall any justice.
It's pure disrespect.

211
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,272
Wait, that can't be true.

212
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:14,607
Can you take a look again?

213
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:15,733
Look.

214
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:18,569
None of Legall's paintings
ever used a canvas

215
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,489
that contained fluorescent materials.

216
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,952
It is clearly a cheap forgery.

217
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,872
-But…
-This is not Legall's painting.

218
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,749
But how can you…

219
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,503
Wait, are you saying
it's not even worth a little?

220
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,463
I will not comfort you with lame excuses.

221
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,678
But my mom is watching.

222
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,139
Remember.

223
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:52,478
True class is defined by the eyes
that can see what's real.

224
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,608
He's now on public TV? He's thriving.

225
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,445
Mr. Famous is famous these days.

226
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:03,156
An art critic well-versed
in all forms of artistic expression

227
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,116
and a major player
in the art business world.

228
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,785
His jawline is just sharp enough
to look masculine.

229
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,038
A nose that brings balance to his face.

230
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,540
And slightly slanted eyes.

231
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,626
He has the fennec fox face.
That's the trend these days.

232
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,836
He's my type.

233
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,505
Why did you turn it off? Are you jealous?

234
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,049
Jealous? Me? No!

235
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:22,508
He's darn ugly.

236
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,177
Why is he sulking again?

237
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,595
I mean…

238
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,889
Seriously, because of him, Bo-ra is…

239
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,182
Bo-ra? Like the color purple?

240
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,642
Remember the shop by the beach?

241
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:33,770
Oh, the one that also runs an inn?

242
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,022
Bo-ra is the daughter of the inn's owner.

243
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,231
So?

244
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,817
What happened
between Purple and Mr. Famous?

245
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,989
<i>Bo-ra met Mr. Famous six months ago.</i>

246
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:48,284
<i>Mr. Famous visited her university</i>
<i>as a guest instructor.</i>

247
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:52,914
A familiar motif and an imitated touch.

248
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:54,707
That is just…

249
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,256
You've got the artistic sense though.

250
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,634
Not bad.

251
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:10,098
If you have anything else,
bring it to my gallery.

252
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:12,600
What?

253
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:22,026
<i>Bo-ra was naive enough</i>
<i>to trust his word and visit that jerk.</i>

254
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:26,781
A RUTHLESS MAN KNOWS WHAT'S REAL

255
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,624
You're here, Bo-ra.

256
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,750
It's me.

257
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:42,713
Let me see how much you've improved
since the last time.

258
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,760
Not bad.

259
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:51,139
You've gotten better from last time.

260
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:52,932
Really?

261
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:57,979
You're improving every day.

262
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,151
<i>I think it makes sense.</i>

263
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:06,863
He's a good-looking professor
giving her warm support during his visit.

264
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,198
And they're both artists.

265
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,450
He had the power to help her debut too.
Don't you think?

266
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:12,743
No.

267
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:15,413
To students like Bo-ra,
Mr. Famous is like god.

268
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,540
He's just a piece of trash

269
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:21,794
who takes advantage of his status
to go after women.

270
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,963
Mr. Famous was actually known for that.

271
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,298
There were scandals and lawsuits.

272
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,258
And his girlfriends kept changing.

273
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:28,885
Because he's attractive.

274
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,344
What a piece of trash.

275
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,262
All right.

276
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,058
Now, shall we get started?

277
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,727
-Start what?
-What?

278
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:41,647
What do you mean "what"?
Mr. Famous is good laundry material.

279
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:44,483
We can't just ignore the jerk
who did that to Bo-ra.

280
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,651
I'll sit this one out.

281
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:46,903
Why?

282
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,491
It's too little.
I'm not interested in pocket money.

283
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,495
James.

284
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,873
You can't do this to me.

285
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,085
When you passed out,
though you were faking it,

286
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,670
I swore to take revenge for you.

287
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,380
-Remember?
-I remember.

288
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,549
Money's not everything, James.

289
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,134
Money is the essence of life.

290
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:12,386
Stay out of it.

291
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,930
James, help me.

292
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,101
You're right.

293
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:22,021
Money is the essence of life,
but it's not everything.

294
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,232
It's not, but it's about 90%.

295
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:25,233
James.

296
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:28,069
From now on,
you're the boss of this operation.

297
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,782
I will do anything you say, James.

298
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,118
-That's not bad.
-Right?

299
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,955
I mean, what can't we do
without Yi-rang? Right?

300
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:39,872
This prick…

301
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:42,083
Right, for something this size,
the two of us will do.

302
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,669
And it's something I always do.

303
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,421
That's right.
You're an expert in this field.

304
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,007
Let me see.

305
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,886
Given his complex relationships
with women,

306
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,514
in just a day or two,
we'll be able to spot his weakness.

307
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,349
We'll pay Purple compensation with that,

308
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,394
and the two of us
can take some commission.

309
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,853
You can have my share.

310
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,773
I can sacrifice that much
to serve such a great boss like you.

311
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,066
We have a chance.

312
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,401
I'm in!

313
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,278
So now…

314
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:11,570
Scalpel.

315
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,865
-We'll dig up Mr. Famous's dirt.
-Suction!

316
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,659
To bits and pieces, every single detail,

317
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,411
completely, all of it, and everything!

318
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,912
-Yes, Boss!
-Louder!

319
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,122
Yes, Boss!

320
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,624
-Let's get it!
-Okay, let's get it!

321
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,294
Another unit of blood, please.

322
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,310
WASH & HAPPY
LAUNDRY SERVICE

323
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:44,395
Excuse me.

324
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,647
We're here for the fire inspection.

325
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,524
What? Inspect what?

326
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,567
Fire inspection.

327
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,901
I don't want any noise. Get out.

328
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:53,362
I'm sorry, but noise can't be avoided.

329
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,075
For Christ's sake.

330
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,162
-What about the VIP invitation list?
-Oh, the final…

331
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:02,913
MS. NA

332
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:05,416
Yes? Jeez.

333
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,754
One moment, please.
Sorry, it's too loud in here.

334
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:16,886
Hold there.

335
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,263
Yes. The complimentary item?

336
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:20,931
Yes, I made sure you got one.

337
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:35,529
<i>Gu-ho, can you see clearly?</i>

338
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,448
<i>Mr. Famous's house is above his office.</i>

339
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:39,909
{\an8}<i>It's your turn now.</i>

340
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,085
-I'm here for disinfection.
-Okay.

341
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,127
-Where?
-That way, please.

342
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,754
Over there? Thank you.

343
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,606
{\an8}-My goodness.
<i>-Can you see me?</i>

344
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,567
{\an8}Yes, I can see you very well.
Very good-looking.

345
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:23,744
{\an8}Now, shall we uncover
the truth about Mr. Famous?

346
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:34,004
It's only a matter of time
until we catch this guy's weakness.

347
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,442
James, wait.

348
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,945
I think he's looking straight into it.

349
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,448
Did we get caught?

350
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,544
No, wait.

351
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,588
His eyes aren't looking here.

352
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,340
It's about 0.8 degrees off.

353
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:21,802
What?

354
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,308
Jeez, it's tilted.

355
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,809
{\an8}-Jeez.
-That's right.

356
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:32,188
That scared me.
Wait, how did you even catch that?

357
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,481
I'm an expert.

358
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:37,026
Gosh, I thought
he was looking straight at me.

359
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,486
He's a little cross-eyed.

360
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:39,528
-His eyes?
-Yes.

361
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,827
Mr. Famous, good job!

362
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,829
{\an8}You're awesome.

363
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:52,458
<i>Make sure to be born as yourself again</i>
<i>in your next life.</i>

364
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,376
Hey.

365
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,170
You're doing great.

366
00:29:58,714 --> 00:29:59,924
Oh, so nice.

367
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,052
-What a loser.
-What a loser.

368
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,657
{\an8}That's laughable.

369
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,283
{\an8}It's the size of a candle.

370
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:27,368
{\an8}I'm rooting for you.

371
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,669
Ew, that disgusting punk. So gross.

372
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:37,795
So freaking gross.

373
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,630
<i>Even my poo looks cute.</i>

374
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,466
I mean, how does one even say that?

375
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,093
He just made me imagine it.

376
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,345
Stop saying nonsense, you poophead.

377
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,104
I'm bored.

378
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,023
Going over.

379
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,778
Yes!

380
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,780
Step on it! Come on!

381
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,075
This is boring.

382
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,038
It's boring.

383
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:21,171
ART CRITIC 'S ENDLESS PASSION
WRITTEN BY MR. FAMOUS

384
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,385
Okay.

385
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,764
All right. Let's find out who he is.

386
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,062
<i>He studied aesthetics</i>
<i>at Hongmin University</i>

387
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:39,315
<i>and earned his master's</i>
<i>and doctoral degrees there too.</i>

388
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,401
{\an8}<i>He received the Curator of the Year Award</i>
<i>for his sharp criticism abilities.</i>

389
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,279
<i>Thanks to a corporation's sponsorship,</i>

390
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,823
<i>he started running his own gallery</i>
<i>at a young age.</i>

391
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,036
<i>After discovering a few</i>
<i>missing masterpieces by famous painters,</i>

392
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,705
<i>he instantly became a star critic.</i>

YOUNG CRITIC DISCOVERS YU KANG-IL'S PIECE

396
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,895
Yes, it was this painting.

397
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,449
So is it real or not?

398
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:35,996
Ma'am, I am sorry.

399
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,667
It's one of the mass-produced pieces
from the early '90s.

400
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:41,710
This is a forgery.

401
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,630
Darn it.

402
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,799
And they talked like I owed them a lot.

403
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:50,386
<i>Still, the finish is pretty good.</i>

404
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,179
<i>I'll buy it for 250,000…</i>

405
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:56,517
I'll buy it for 300,000 won. Yes, 300,000.

406
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,394
I will buy it.

407
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,274
He lies that a genuine painting is
a forgery and buys it dirt cheap?

408
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,360
How much is he going to sell it for?

409
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,988
<i>I'm thinking 30 million won.</i>

410
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,326
What the…

411
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,121
Turning 300,000 into 30 million?
Ridiculous!

412
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:20,124
That's insane. He's a total fraud.

413
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,291
A darn fraud.

414
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,758
I was having a meal.

415
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,845
{\an8}<i>Hello, ma'am.</i>

416
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:35,639
{\an8}<i>Yes. It's me, Mr. Famous.</i>

417
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:38,058
{\an8}<i>Yes, of course. I got a big one for you.</i>

418
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,562
{\an8}James, wake up.

419
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:42,813
{\an8}What's going on?

420
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,022
{\an8}Listen to this.

421
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,942
{\an8}<i>-When I saw the altar painting…</i>
-It's cold.

422
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,696
{\an8}<i>…I immediately thought of you</i>
<i>and your deep faith in Buddhism.</i>

423
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,406
Yes, of course.

424
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,242
Ma'am, do you know King Jinheung?

425
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,995
During the rebuilding period
in the time of King Jinheung of Silla,

426
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,496
it was stored at a temple.

427
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,207
I don't even need to mention its value.

428
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,044
Of course. I won't say a word about it.

429
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:09,214
As always. Without any trouble.

430
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,384
Illegal purchase and trade
of cultural heritage?

431
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:15,053
Gosh, this is getting serious, right?

432
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,430
-I know, right?
-Yes.

433
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,849
For something this big,
shouldn't we call Yi-rang?

434
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:19,892
No!

435
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,561
You're the boss, James.

436
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,938
I know you can do it!

437
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,649
Your boss had a plan,

438
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,485
but this is getting out of control.

439
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,321
No. You can still do it, James.

440
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,156
-I can do it.
-Yes, you have a plan.

441
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,866
-I can do it.
-You can do it, Boss!

442
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,161
I can do it!

443
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,288
-You're the boss!
-I can do it!

444
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,624
WASH & HAPPY
LAUNDRY SERVICE

445
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,094
I told you to eat well.

446
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,012
-What is…
-What's this?

447
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,096
Sushi?

448
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,683
What are you doing here at this hour?

449
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,435
Never mind. It's the morning.

450
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:06,104
Are you here
because you were bored without us?

451
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,774
Bored? Me? Why would I be?

452
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,568
No way.
Yi-rang can have fun all by herself.

453
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:14,071
I guess you're not happy to see me.

454
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,533
Come on. You know he's happy to see you.

455
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,534
Tell her.

456
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:22,371
Well, then are we doing this together now?

457
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:24,748
Why would I?

458
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:28,001
What do you mean "why"?
Because we're a team.

459
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,505
Yi-rang's the only one
who cares about us, right?

460
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:40,722
{\an8}What's all this?

461
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,558
Producing forgeries…

462
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,853
Illegal trade of cultural heritage?

463
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,147
He wasn't some small laundry.

464
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,816
He turned out to be huge.

465
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,402
-Is that so?
-Yes.

466
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,319
Yes.

467
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,407
CHAIRMAN KIM OF HUNDRED VICTORIES GROUP

468
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,625
Yes, sir.

469
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:11,420
<i>Mr. Famous helps</i>
<i>politicians and high-ranking officials</i>

470
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,422
<i>build illegal slush funds through art.</i>

471
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,594
<i>His phone is set to ring</i>
<i>anytime his VVIP clients call.</i>

472
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,346
<i>So, when the phone rings,</i>

473
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,601
<i>he answers it anytime, day or night,</i>
<i>mid-meeting or fast asleep.</i>

474
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,523
The genuine piece will be stored safely
in the basement storage.

475
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:35,360
<i>If one buys a painting</i>
<i>with the company's funds,</i>

476
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:38,488
<i>Mr. Famous produces</i>
<i>an identical fake piece.</i>

477
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,199
<i>Then the forgery is hung</i>
<i>on the company lobby,</i>

478
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,409
<i>-and the genuine work…</i>
-Thanks.

479
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,578
<i>…is used to build</i>
<i>the chairman's illegal slush funds.</i>

480
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:45,871
He's even making a deal

481
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,165
with the chairman
of Hundred Victories Group?

482
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:49,958
That's not the end of it.

483
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:53,128
I bet there are tons of rich people
involved with Mr. Famous.

484
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,048
This might be more complex
than we thought.

485
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,675
This might be worth money.

486
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,802
What? Are you saying…

487
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,765
Can I expand the scale?

488
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,559
Yes, of course. It can't hurt.

489
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,561
So are you in too?

490
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,063
No takebacks. Okay?

491
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,482
But there's something I need to do first.

492
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,524
What is it?

493
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,072
-Reordering the hierarchy.
-Reordering the hierarchy?

494
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,033
Call me "Boss."

495
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:24,993
Boss.

496
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,495
Why aren't you saying it?

497
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:28,705
I'm leaving then.

498
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:30,666
-Fine, Boss.
-Boss.

499
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,292
Happy now, Boss?

500
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:34,962
Yes.

501
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:39,007
Now, why don't you come up
with a strategy, Boss?

502
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:43,679
Your face says
you already have something in mind.

503
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:45,931
What we need right now is…

504
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,057
Is?

505
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:50,894
…the perfect pushover.

00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,783

Forty-three million.

511
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,887
The next work
is Painter Kim Gi-baek's "Frozen Time."

512
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,639
The single unforgettable moment…

513
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:32,978
moment in life.

514
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:41,862
It's a work that expresses such memory
in a dreamy way.

515
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,079
Kim Gi-baek's "Frozen Time."

516
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:54,041
The bid starts from 50 million.

517
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:58,211
Fifty million. Fifty-five million.

00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,379
Sixty million.

Be careful. Treat them like babies.

535
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:48,512
I appreciate it.

536
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:52,516
As I heard, there were many great works,
Mr. Famous.

537
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,517
Thank you.

538
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,727
Oh, right.

539
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:00,148
I'm the Head of Purchasing
for Wonderby Asia,

540
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,775
Olivia Kim.

541
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,780
By Wonderby, you mean
the world's biggest auction company?

542
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:07,697
It is that Wonderby.

543
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,043
Wait.

544
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,922
You purchased so many pieces today.

545
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,674
If you don't mind,

546
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,301
I'd like to return the favor.

547
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,720
Can we have dinner together?

548
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,682
I understand
if you already have plans, though.

549
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,227
You read my mind.

550
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,029
Have you heard the news that

551
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:51,825
Wonderby's headquarters
sold all shares of Soul Auction?

552
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:52,826
Yes.

553
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,704
That's the biggest issue
in the field lately.

554
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:56,997
Of course I've heard about it.

555
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:03,628
We're expecting Korea to reshape
the Asian art world in the next ten years.

556
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:05,505
That is our anticipation,

557
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:09,384
that the Korean wave in diverse fields
will not wither easily.

558
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:11,928
I wasn't aware

559
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:15,974
of Wonderby's thoughts
on the art world in Korea.

560
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,729
To tell you the truth,

561
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,773
it is not an anticipation but a plan.

562
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,780
Our decision sets trends
in the global art scene.

563
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,491
Obviously,

564
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:37,162
as Wonderby is leading the world trend.

565
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,836
SOUL AUCTION
LEGAL TEAM MANAGER CHOI DAE-CHEOL

566
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,338
Right.

567
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,467
You must have met
Soul Auction's legal team manager.

568
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:52,636
His name is…

569
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,347
Choi…

570
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:57,432
Right.

571
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,392
I've got his business card here.

572
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,271
<i>Buy some time.</i>

573
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,148
Hurry.

574
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,501
LEGAL TEAM MANAGER CHOI DAE-CHEOL

575
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:25,961
-Choi Dae-cheol!
-Choi Dae-cheol!

576
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,214
-Jeez!
-What's up?

577
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:32,175
-Ouch.
-What…

578
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,387
I've been suffering from rhinitis.

579
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,973
Choi Dae-cheol, right? Mr. Choi.

580
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:42,269
Oh, I finally remembered.

581
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:44,521
I've been getting forgetful these days.

582
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,381
Jeez!

583
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,465
I'm sorry.

584
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,259
What's wrong? What happened?

585
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,222
Excuse me. I need to make a call.

586
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,774
Yi-rang,

587
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:31,943
did you do something weird?

588
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:33,737
I didn't do anything.

589
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,739
Yi-rang. Please, I'm begging you.

590
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:39,659
Don't act on everything
that pops into your head, please.

591
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,995
I respect all your ideas,
but not this time.

592
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:43,496
No improvising. Stick to the script.

593
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,414
Stick to the script.

594
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,667
Why do you all think I can't do it?

595
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:49,461
I can pull it off too.

596
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,670
That was really close.

597
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:51,671
-It was.
-Yes.

598
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:53,423
Whatever. And don't yell.

599
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,801
Is he puking or what?
What's taking him so long?

600
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:14,444
May I ask when you arrived in Korea?

601
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:21,785
<i>Two days ago.</i>

602
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,704
Why do you ask?

603
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:35,006
I'm just worried that you might be tired.

604
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:37,217
I see.

605
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,511
I stopped by Hong Kong.

606
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:43,056
And yesterday's meeting with Soul Auction
was the last on my official schedule.

607
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,266
You could say

608
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,144
I'm on a short break now.

609
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,441
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

610
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:56,152
<i>The name of the person</i>
<i>in charge of Asia is indeed Olivia Kim.</i>

611
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:58,029
<i>She arrived in Korea two days ago,</i>

612
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,365
<i>and she's currently</i>
<i>on a business trip around Asia.</i>

613
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,124
You are truly amazing.

614
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,626
Pardon?

615
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:17,340
At Wonderby, which holds sway
over the global art world,

616
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:18,925
you're in charge of Asia,

617
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:21,511
the region destined to become
the most influential.

618
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:27,892
I was just lucky.

619
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:32,147
Meeting people in various fields
around the world,

620
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,024
I'm humbled by their passion and insight.

621
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:37,402
Especially when I meet someone

622
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:40,697
with such a unique insight like yours.

623
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:46,077
Oh, my heart is pounding.

624
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,706
Do you see I'm getting a little shy?

625
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,670
If that is you being shy,

626
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,090
I can't wait to see
what you're like when you're bold.

627
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:01,176
You will soon see it

628
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:03,887
because I will show you.

629
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:22,155
I didn't expect to have such a good time
before going back to England.

630
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,991
When are you going back?

631
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:30,121
Well, if there's nothing special,
I might go back tomorrow.

632
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:33,708
Well…

633
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:39,297
Can you stay in Korea for a little longer?

634
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:46,429
What's this?

635
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:53,478
"VIP charity auction"?

636
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:56,314
Am I allowed to go to such a place?

637
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:57,524
You are already

638
00:46:58,816 --> 00:46:59,943
my VIP.

639
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,239
That's so sweet of you.

640
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,122
We spent too much on the initial cost.

641
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,876
I'm worried we might go broke.

642
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:20,421
I will retrieve it big-time for you.
Don't worry.

643
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,677
Wait, Yi-rang.

644
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,180
What's up with that weird look?

645
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:30,723
Your eyebrows are connected.

646
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,602
That is such a bold comment.

647
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,854
So, are you going Frida Kahlo this time?

648
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:42,944
The greatest female artist of the era

649
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:47,907
who expressed all the pain of her life
on the canvas in vivid colors.

650
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:52,453
So what are you going to do
dressed like Hurida?

651
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,038
It's not Hurida. It's Frida.

652
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:55,999
As in "free." Frida Kahlo.

653
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,208
-Okay?
-Oh, "free."

654
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:58,668
"Free-da."

655
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:02,714
I'm preparing a bait to catch Mr. Famous.

656
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,465
-A bait?
-I don't bite it.

657
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:09,887
We'll dangle the bait
using Mr. Famous's most powerful memories.

658
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,264
Powerful memories?

659
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:13,516
Frida… Bait…

660
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:17,270
-I don't know. Whatever.
-What?

661
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:21,608
The incident
that got Mr. Famous his biggest fame.

662
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:26,195
I'll make him feel the joy of discovering
a famous painter's hidden painting again.

663
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:30,408
So you'll make him
discover an artist through a forgery.

664
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:32,869
First,

665
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,205
the painter
with the greatest artistic skills,

666
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:37,749
Yun Yi-rang's…

667
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,210
Vermeer.

668
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,342
What's up with that earring?

669
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:50,637
Why are you laughing?

670
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:54,974
DOKSIMNI
ANTIQUE ART

671
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,694
Excuse me.

672
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:10,490
Look who it is!

673
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:12,659
Look who's here!

674
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:16,871
My tangy, dangly, spangly, zangy,
lovely little Yun Yi-rang!

675
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:19,374
How have you been, sir?

676
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:22,043
Not good, of course.

677
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,337
How could I have been well
when I missed you this much?

678
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,755
This much!

679
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:27,423
That's such an old joke.

680
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:29,717
And how do you know that joke?

681
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,135
Anyway, who is he?

682
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:32,970
-He's…
-I'm Kim Yong-bok!

683
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:35,473
Born in 1958, the Year of the Dog.
Woof woof!

684
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:36,933
I don't like this guy.

685
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,771
He's a painting restorer on the outside,

686
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,690
but he's actually the Meegeren of Korea.

687
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:44,857
Meegeren?

688
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:47,110
The notorious art forger.

689
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,737
-The one who fooled the German Nazis--
-Look it up.

690
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:50,780
Are you a finger prince?

691
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:51,989
"A finger prince?"

692
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,741
It means use your fingers to look it up.

693
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:58,996
So is this your forgery factory?

694
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,708
Come on. Not here.

695
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:08,297
You'll see it if you keep going this way.

696
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:13,052
The perfect forgery factory
where my art world spreads!

697
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:17,515
Since the man with the perfect skills
paints with the same art supplies,

698
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:21,394
no wonder a perfect forgery is created
without the risk of getting caught.

699
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,607
Sir, then do you think
you can also fool Mr. Famous?

700
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:27,942
Who?

701
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:33,489
The greenhorn who's on a show
counting on his handsome face?

702
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:35,450
He's nothing compared to me!

703
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,243
Hey, I really don't like you.

704
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:40,955
Paintings are all about confidence.
I'm counting on you, Mr. Kim.

705
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,749
Don't worry. You can count on me.

706
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,964
What we need now is Elcasso.

707
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,468
He spent his entire life
doing nothing but painting.

708
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:56,262
So, he left behind a mountain of work.

709
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:59,724
And countless pieces of his
vanished during the war.

710
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:04,479
These canvases here are all
by obscure painters from Elcasso's time.

711
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,023
We'll paint over them,

712
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:11,319
bake them evenly in that oven,
and age them.

713
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:14,614
Then they will become
paintings of Elcasso,

714
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,575
lost to history,
reborn with the marks of time.

715
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:23,456
I pray that it doesn't come out
better than Elcasso's!

716
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,792
Please.

717
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,045
A FEW DAYS LATER

718
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:34,634
He's here.

719
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:36,135
Yes.

720
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:37,428
Please take a seat here.

721
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:38,971
Okay.

722
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:42,725
Nice to meet you. Prepare the drinks.

723
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,728
Nice house you have here.

724
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,648
I asked you to come

725
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,692
because I want you to evaluate
a painting that I want to sell.

726
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:55,238
Then can I take a look?

727
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:57,406
I'll show you
as long as you promise me not to rip it.

728
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:00,618
I guess

729
00:52:02,078 --> 00:52:03,496
that must have bothered you.

730
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,251
I actually became a fan of yours
after seeing that.

731
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,503
You know how the showbiz runs.

732
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:13,214
I couldn't help it
because of the viewer ratings.

733
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:16,342
Right. You have to say things
you don't want to say.

734
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:29,772
It's Elcasso's work.

735
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:32,108
I need to observe it carefully.

736
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:34,735
Sorry?

737
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:39,323
There are many forgeries
of Elcasso's works.

738
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,660
Is that so?

739
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,580
It's from Elcasso's Rose Period.

740
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,415
The Nazis confiscated it,

741
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,835
then one collector bought it from
the black market and brought it to Korea.

742
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,670
And my grandfather purchased it.

743
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,255
Let me take a look.

744
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:08,603
Here is the last room.

745
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:11,314
Because it's facing south,

746
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,816
even though the sun has already set,
it's still bright.

747
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,527
Isn't the view nice?

748
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:19,989
INQUIRIES

749
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,699
Isn't it gorgeous?

750
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:28,039
INQUIRIES FOR SALES

751
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:41,344
Are you done yet?

752
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:42,511
Oh, stop.

753
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:43,429
What?

754
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:44,347
-What?
-What?

755
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,264
-What?
-What?

756
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:48,184
I mean, if you could observe it
more carefully…

757
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:51,062
-More carefully. Thanks.
-Okay.

758
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,815
If you're done, shall we go down?

759
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,662
-Was that from upstairs?
-Oh, right.

760
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,915
Tell the kids to stop running upstairs.

761
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:11,958
Yes, sir.

762
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,421
How many children do you have?

763
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:21,175
I have a son and a daughter.

764
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:23,511
How old is your son?

765
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,304
-Seventy…
-Seventy?

766
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:29,308
I mean seven.

767
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:35,022
The chairman is thorough
with everything he does.

768
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:36,607
I see.

769
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:40,111
Now, if you're done, shall we go down?

770
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,572
He's water divining.

771
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,116
Please be quiet.

772
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:50,538
What are you doing? Hurry up.

773
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,790
<i>We're in a rush. We look weird.</i>

774
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,675
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

775
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:07,680
Well, by any chance…

776
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:08,597
Yes?

777
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:11,934
Can you show me

778
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:16,063
the certificate of authenticity
for that work?

779
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:17,481
-No.
-No?

780
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:18,566
I mean… Sure.

781
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:21,318
Let me see here.

782
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:23,863
Here it is.

783
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:34,665
Where was this purchased?

784
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:39,587
The Nazis had confiscated it.

785
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,673
Then a collector bought it from
the black market and brought it to Korea.

786
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,592
And my grandfather purchased it.

787
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:46,761
When?

788
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:47,678
The Nazis…

789
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:49,847
confiscated…

790
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:53,517
My grandfather bought it. I'm not sure…

791
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:56,645
I don't think so.

792
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:04,445
Darn it.

793
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:09,784
I don't think it's fake.

794
00:56:12,787 --> 00:56:13,788
This Elcasso painting…

795
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,959
May I take it over?

796
00:56:23,923 --> 00:56:24,840
Sure.

797
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:29,553
I will do my best to raise the price.

798
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:37,019
What?

799
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:41,190
We were checking how stable the house is.

800
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,036
See?

801
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,123
I told you
even Mr. Famous would fall for it.

802
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:59,583
Now, let's start working on other painters
one by one.

803
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:02,962
All right.
Let's wet our whistles to celebrate.

804
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:05,047
-You're talking like an old man.
-What the heck?

805
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,676
Why do good beginnings always end badly?

806
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:09,593
What the heck?

807
00:57:19,562 --> 00:57:20,813
-What?
-Wait.

808
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:21,897
What's going on?

809
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:24,400
Mr. Kim…

810
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:07,818
{\an8}<i>Mr. Famous's list?</i>

811
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:10,279
{\an8}The artwork ledger
that Mr. Famous used for deals.

812
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,740
{\an8}<i>It must be here somewhere.</i>

813
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,451
{\an8}<i>I can see through all of them.</i>

814
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:16,493
{\an8}No one can fool me.

815
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,163
{\an8}<i>James, buy me more time.</i>

816
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,998
{\an8}Where are you? Get out of there now.

817
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:22,166
{\an8}I found it.

818
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:23,292
{\an8}<i>Should I call the police?</i>

819
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,212
{\an8}<i>Gosh, this jerk.</i>
<i>He's an even bigger piece of trash.</i>

820
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:30,591
{\an8}<i>Now that I threw the bait,</i>
<i>there should be a bite.</i>

821
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:36,222
{\an8}<i>We underestimated him.</i>
<i>We were completely wrong.</i>
