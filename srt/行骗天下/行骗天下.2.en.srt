Hello, guys!

8
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:03,813
Hello.

9
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,651
Here's the heir to the throne.
Entitled, spoiled brat.

10
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,780
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

11
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:20,998
Hey. Film this.

12
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:25,294
Oh, it's the young
master himself.

13
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,255
You seem really happy now.

14
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,466
-You're an idiot.
-Yeah?

15
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,218
-Do you want to die?
-Die?

16
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,262
Wake up, young master.

17
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:36,346
Time to get up.

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,723
Hey.

19
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,058
Let go of me!

20
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:45,146
I was a boxer. Let's go. Huh.

21
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:46,649
-You want to fight?
-Huh? Whoo!

22
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,823
You like that?

23
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:10,339
You can spend all this money on
gambling or you can spend it on drugs.

24
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,632
It doesn't matter to me.

25
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:13,383
What I wanna know...

26
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,888
is how you two could smuggle
the money in with no issues.

27
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,015
It was my first time doing it.

28
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,350
You gotta believe me.

29
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:23,478
Are you just trying to
get yourself outta this?

30
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,645
This is something I decided to
try this one time, you know?

31
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,315
-It's not like I'm an expert...
-Sir.

32
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:28,816
You need to take a look at this.

33
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,360
It's a video of Rising
Airlines Chairman's love child.

34
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:33,779
Me? What about me? What?

35
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,491
RISING AIRLINES' LOVE CHILD

36
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,162
Check his left arm out.

37
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,667
Huh?

38
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,091
A gun? What for?

39
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,488
Stand up.

40
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,056
Ah.

41
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,351
Ah...

42
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,316
Who the hell are you?

43
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,446
Hey, show me the video.

44
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,578
If you're going to scam
me, at least do it right.

45
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:31,503
Huh?

46
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:32,880
It's on the other side!

47
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:36,966
I swear! That's a mirror
reflection. For Christ's sake.

48
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:38,635
Huh?

49
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,641
I told the truth!
I told the truth!

50
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:51,106
It's on the right shoulder.

51
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,492
EPISODE 2

52
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,286
Just sit tight and
answer my calls.

53
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,247
I could have you locked
up for smuggling cash,

54
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,333
overseas gambling
and even drugs.

55
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,754
Would you rather be locked up
in Korea or the Philippines?

56
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:19,468
See you in Seoul.

57
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,344
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,601
Okay! He took the bait.

59
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,062
Jeon Tae-su's not that
easy of a target, huh?

60
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,272
I almost peed my pants, I swear.

61
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,608
If you'd listened to me
and had played the pilot,

62
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,360
all this could
have been avoided.

63
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,443
What?

64
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,570
What's this?

65
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,534
Yi-rang... Why
did you take that?

66
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,327
That's a stimulant. Spit it out!

67
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,746
Hurry! Spit it out already.

68
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,747
Spit it out.

69
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,457
Yi-rang!

70
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,126
Yi-rang?

71
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,794
Yi-rang! Yi-rang!

72
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,006
Yi-rang!

73
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,384
Come on. I'm not stupid
enough to take it.

74
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,720
Seriously, you drive me crazy.

75
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,638
-Seriously!
-Let's go.

76
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,098
Get in the car.

77
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,600
-You did a good job. Lean on me.
-It's making the pain worse.

78
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,352
Verify his alibi.

79
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:12,479
Check his last visit
to the Philippines.

80
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:13,647
Yes, sir.

81
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,194
Hey...

82
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,239
there's something I need.

83
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,241
Investigate him closely

84
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,243
to see if he's the love
child of Rising Airlines.

85
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,121
If there's anything suspicious,
report it immediately.

86
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,123
Yes. Roger that, sir.

87
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,391
Hey, we're home.

88
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:50,893
Okay, Nangrang, be careful.

89
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:51,852
Hey, Jeje.

90
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,062
One, two.

91
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,521
Be careful.

92
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,190
-Slow down.
-Oh, my sweet babies.

93
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,233
You're home!

94
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:01,111
Oh, goodness.

95
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,738
It's Dad and Mom.

96
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,658
Go on, say hi to Mom.

97
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:12,247
Oh, I try to take them out, but...
they don't like me walking them.

98
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,416
They only go outside
with you, Mr. Myung.

99
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,211
Ah. No need to call me that.

100
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,546
If you ever need me to
walk them, just call.

101
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,549
Thank you for your hard work.

102
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:22,633
Thank you.

103
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,716
Oh, hold on.

104
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,345
-What's that?
-Thank you so much.

105
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,263
Oh, wow! Gosh. Thank you.

106
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:32,101
-Yes. Thank you for your help.
-You're welcome. Goodbye.

107
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,704
It's a pleasure to
see you here in Seoul.

108
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,207
Let's cut to the chase.

109
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,290
Bring the package.

110
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,966
Take it to the Philippines and hand
it off to our guy in the agreed spot.

111
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,803
May I ask what's inside
of those suitcases?

112
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,306
-Shh!
-Apologies.

113
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:15,102
What do you think
matters the most in life?

114
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,479
Well, obviously money...

115
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:18,981
-It's trust.
-Trust.

116
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,442
Since I'm trusting you with a job,
there are rules you need to follow.

117
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,238
Do not open the package
under any circumstance.

118
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,199
And no matter what, do
not mention my name.

119
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,579
-And if you break either rule...
-What would happen?

120
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,250
Use your imagination.

121
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,585
What do you think?

122
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,969
Are you sure we'll
be okay? Huh?

123
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,929
We do have a plan
in place, don't we?

124
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,098
Please tell me that we do.

125
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,558
-Not telling you.
-What?

126
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,394
How can you be joking?

127
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,148
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

128
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,943
If I ask you a question,
I expect an answer.

129
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,114
Oh, I'm so sorry.

130
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,074
I'm sorry. I'm
sure you won't die.

131
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,953
So typical of you! Everything
always has to go your way!

132
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,664
Maybe you should try
using your brain like me.

133
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,167
Don't you stare at me with those
round eyes. I could just...

134
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,085
-Gosh.
-Do you want me to make them square?

135
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,463
-Or perhaps a triangle shape?
-See! There it is!

136
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,797
You keep talking back!

137
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,508
Do you really want to see
me lose my temper? Huh?

138
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,013
Is this entertaining?

139
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,557
Please enjoy it while
you still can, sir.

140
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,183
It's just an act.

141
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,309
Let's go.

142
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,244
Hello. Welcome to
the Philippines.

143
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,517
-Come on, miss.
-800 per night?

144
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,769
-You should take the deal now.
-800? That's so expensive!

145
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,479
Come, on, we're on budget.
We're just students...

146
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,772
What are you staring at?

147
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,358
Just reminiscing a little.

148
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,652
Back where we met
at Sunyuldo Island.

149
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,570
-Just make it 700.
-800, miss.

150
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:31,655
The place is near.

151
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,824
-We don't have 700.
-That's as low as I'll go.

152
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:38,996
WELCOME GU-HO'S INN

153
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,748
Are you the one who
made the reservations?

154
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,790
-I made them, yeah.
-Great. Hello.

155
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,019
There are great
deals in this area.

156
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,354
-Is that all?
-Was if far?

157
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,064
It's just around the
corner. Go straight...

158
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,441
-It feels familiar here.
-700.

159
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,527
It's peaceful,
simple, and so quiet.

160
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,280
You were just like that guy.

161
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,824
I was like him, wasn't I?

162
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,746
Things aren't the same
as they used to be, huh?

163
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,915
We should go back there one day.

164
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,419
Are you sleeping?

165
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,882
You started this conversation.

166
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:08,876
Huh?

167
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,519
He's still knocked out.

168
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,816
I told you to go easy on
him. We're short on time.

169
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,820
-Sorry, boss.
-Where's the girl? Let's get her.

170
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,414
What the...

171
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,339
Oh, shit.

172
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,647
Oh, God! You scared me.

173
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:53,565
Who are you?

174
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,151
Who do you think? I'm the
one who kidnapped you.

175
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,610
Kidnapped?

176
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,529
-You know Jeon Tae-su?
-Yeah.

177
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:00,489
Uh... no.

178
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:04,659
I used to work with him back in the day,
but there was a small misunderstanding.

179
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,286
So unfortunately, he...

180
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,289
had all of my internal
organs rearranged.

181
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,541
See, I'm not the kind of guy who

182
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:15,003
can sleep at night when I owe
others, so I plan to pay him back.

183
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,300
Is this your bag right here?

184
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,430
He's still using
the same old tricks.

185
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,017
If you'd shown up at the
drop point with this package,

186
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,394
the cops would've nabbed
you and tossed you

187
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,230
in some filthy cell for days.

188
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,190
That's his way of
testing loyalty, see?

189
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,192
Making sure you
won't rat him out.

190
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,820
I... I don't know
why that's in my bag.

191
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:44,783
I have nothing to do with any of
this. You have to believe me, sir.

192
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,034
Look, lady...

193
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,036
Drop the lousy act.

194
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,790
I'm taking this to the
Narcotics Division in Korea,

195
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:55,168
and I'm gonna need you to
be a witness and testify.

196
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,139
Shit.

197
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,016
I have to get out of here.

198
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,894
Yi-rang, hang in there.

199
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,438
I'll go and get the cops.

200
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,817
Bastards.

201
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:33,832
Oh.

202
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,740
Look at that.

203
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,264
Hey, where are you going?

204
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,936
Uh, how's it going, guys?

205
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,688
Don't come this way.

206
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,815
-Stop! Hold on. Stop right there!
-What is this idiot doing?

207
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,818
Uh, excuse me.

208
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,112
-You're not getting out of here.
-Hey, wait. Don't!

209
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,742
Gu... Gu-ho.

210
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,078
Oh, I know. I get it. Chairman Jeon
told you to keep your mouth shut, right?

211
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,747
But guess what?

212
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,791
You know what happens when you
fail to carry out his orders?

213
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,297
He tried to escape.
He's secured now.

214
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,381
Ah, really?

215
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:28,136
Wait! Please, just
wait! Hold up, please!

216
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,971
Just hold on!

217
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,315
Oh, shit! I... Uh...

218
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,192
Horrible, right?

219
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,236
The young man you came with,
he tried something cute.

220
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,446
Awful, right?

221
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:52,035
But even if you two make it out of here,
the Chairman's still going to kill you.

222
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,537
So? Feeling a bit
more cooperative now?

223
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,249
Or do you want your friend to wear mittens
for the rest of his miserable life?

224
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,720
Please have mercy.

225
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,348
-What?
-Not on me...

226
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,644
on my friend.

227
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,313
Take his ring finger

228
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,940
instead of the middle one.

229
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,859
At the very least,
let him earn a living.

230
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,361
Please.

231
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,029
I'm begging you, please.

232
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,838
The lady next door asked me
to chop your ring finger off

233
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,001
instead of your middle one.

234
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:48,842
Why? Why?

235
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,011
But I'm only going
to cut your pinky.

236
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,179
Stay still. Don't move
or you'll lose your hand.

237
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,306
Clench your teeth.

238
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,725
It's going to hurt a bit.

239
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,904
The fuck was that shit?

240
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,531
Don't move your
hand. Stay still.

241
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,286
-I'll cut her finger instead.
-No, wait!

242
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,540
I'll do it. I'll do it.

243
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,500
Keep your finger straight.

244
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,545
Put it here. I'll
just cut a piece.

245
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,298
That's all I'll cut. Just here.

246
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,577
What the fuck is going on?

247
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,914
Good job.

248
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,554
Ah!

249
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,477
My finger.

250
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,815
I still have it. It's here.

251
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,652
Are you okay?

252
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,779
Chairman Jeon?

253
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,665
Come here, boy, come here.

254
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,128
Chairman Jeon.

255
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,556
Cheers!

256
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,936
You're really in the
mood for this right now?

257
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,105
Do you have any idea
what I went through?

258
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,524
And you told him to
take my ring finger?

259
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,859
Seriously Yi-rang?

260
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:16,865
Gu-ho, why do you always only
see one side of the story?

261
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,658
That's not true. I look
at things from all angles.

262
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,618
The man who kidnapped us.

263
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,664
He said so himself, he went through
exactly the same thing as us.

264
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,250
But he had all five
fingers on his hand.

265
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,295
He was just bluffing about the
whole chopping fingers off.

266
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,171
It was all a set-up.

267
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:35,717
I bet you. Jeon Tae-su
heard every word we said.

268
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,345
He's still using
the same old tricks.

269
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,394
Anyway, thanks to your
heartfelt performance today,

270
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,272
I'm pretty sure Jeon
Tae-su's fully convinced now.

271
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,524
Lucky day for us.

272
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,737
I'm being completely
serious right now.

273
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,574
I think Jeon Tae-su cares
more than you, Yi-rang. Hmm?

274
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,827
Well, he hugged me, okay?

275
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,413
He comforted me. Huh? What else?

276
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,165
-Gu-ho.
-What?

277
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,042
Have you forgotten about James?

278
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,504
Are you some kind of traitor?

279
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,343
Jeon Tae-su, that psycho.

280
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,262
That's right.

281
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,313
When is Jeon Tae-su
going to reach out?

282
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,607
That son of a bitch.

283
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,818
Just wait until he calls me.

284
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,909
Understood. Thank you, sir.

285
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,504
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTOR'S
OFFICE FINANCIAL INVESTIGATION

286
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,259
SAND FOUNDATION FINANCIAL STATEMENT
NOTICE OF TAX AUDIT COMMENCEMENT

287
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,971
THIS IS TO NOTIFY YOU THAT A
TAX AUDIT WILL BE CONDUCTED

288
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,892
With this much evidence,

289
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,978
we could be looking at a
search warrant within a month.

290
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,771
I need to move the timeline up.

291
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,523
I'll keep that in mind.

292
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,067
What do you want me
to do about the two?

293
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,443
Should I keep digging?

294
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,369
No, don't.

295
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,496
There's no need for that.

296
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,253
Oh, my God. How
much is all this?

297
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,047
Fifty billion won.

298
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,427
Fifty billion won?

299
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:49,392
It needs to be transferred to my
summer house in Manila by next Friday.

300
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,356
The amount's way bigger than we expected,
so our current methods just won't cut it.

301
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,983
Is that a no?

302
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,445
Sir, with such a
large sum of money,

303
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:04,157
wouldn't it be smarter to set up
a shell company in the Bahamas

304
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,600
and route it there?

305
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,578
You think I didn't
look into that?

306
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,954
I'm sure you did, sir.

307
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,958
Quit running that useless brain of yours
in circles and figure something out.

308
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,044
This is why you're still alive.

309
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,966
Well, there is one way, sir.

310
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,594
Hmm. Okay. Okay. And that is?

311
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:29,140
To speed up boarding during peak
season, they opened a new lane

312
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:32,643
that lets passengers skip removing
their laptops from their luggage.

313
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,313
We can bypass the X-ray machine

314
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,774
by covering our luggage
with a shielding device.

315
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,283
This device will absorb the
radiation and block the rays,

316
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,786
allowing it to get
past all of security.

317
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,581
Hmm.

318
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,098
All right.

319
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,059
Shall we get started?

320
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,228
Yeah!

321
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,092
Gosh. What's wrong with him?

322
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,175
Huh?

323
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:49,804
Go away.

324
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,932
Hey, get away from me. Come on.

325
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,809
-Go away. Huh? What?
-Sir, you need to come with us.

326
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,172
Where are you taking me?

327
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,521
Hey! Let me go!

328
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,022
-Shit!
-Stop resisting.

329
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,358
What? Do you know
who I... Let me go!

330
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,901
I'm so sorry, sir.

331
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,778
What happened?

332
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,947
Why was the damn dog
all over that bag?

333
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,534
Because of a recent uptick
in cash smuggling incidents,

334
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,203
a cash-sniffing dog was
deployed starting yesterday.

335
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,914
I should've informed you about
this in advance. I'm sorry.

336
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,751
And what about the money?

337
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,295
Do you know how
much was in there?

338
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,047
That was one billion
won. One billion!

339
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,717
-The love child returned.
-Get him.

340
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,596
Hey... Ah! Ah!

341
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,889
Ouch. Hold on.

342
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:34,765
Where's my bag?

343
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:35,849
Huh?

344
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:40,688
Well, my father got me out...
I mean, he pulled some strings.

345
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,481
Regarding the money though...

346
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,609
that needs to be investigated.

347
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,659
If anything happens to my money,

348
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,329
I'll gut you and sell off
whatever's worth a damn...

349
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,873
-down to the bones.
-What?

350
00:24:58,956 --> 00:24:59,956
Take them both.

351
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:07,924
Would you like a flyer?

352
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,679
Ouch.

353
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,777
Sir, this is it!

354
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,034
All you need to do is focus
on your responsibilities.

355
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,579
Have you lost your mind?

356
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:42,041
Oh, sir, just think about it.
What does the Sand Foundation do?

357
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,379
Protect children, respond to
disasters, and fight poverty.

358
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,173
What are you trying
to pull here now? Huh?

359
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,716
Basically, um...

360
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:55,054
We promote the Sand Foundation's
spirit of giving on a global scale

361
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,597
through a massive
donation campaign!

362
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:59,433
Which means that we
charter a private flight

363
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,394
to send relief
supplies overseas.

364
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,526
FILL A RELIEF BOX SPREAD
WARMTH ACROSS THE WORLD

365
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:11,028
So, what's your point?

366
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:14,490
We'll pack it with clothes,
medicine, and other relief supplies.

367
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,784
If we split the cash
between those boxes,

368
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,869
no one's gonna suspect a thing?

369
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,454
-Oh, yeah!
-That's it!

370
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,833
Okay. Leave the chartered
plane to me, sir.

371
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,418
You know, I have my ways.

372
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,501
Yeah?

373
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,514
Ms. Kim.

374
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,059
That's outstanding.

375
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,854
Good job.

376
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:52,111
Get it together!

377
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:56,991
What the hell?

378
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:58,992
Mmm.

379
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,703
My blood sugar's dropping.

380
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,998
Jeon Tae-su sure
is intense, right?

381
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:07,126
He said he'd sell whatever's
worth anything down to the bones.

382
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,628
-My gosh.
-You did well out there, Gu-ho.

383
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,213
Eat as much as you want.

384
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,186
Hey!

385
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,938
This exquisitely, pungent
and funky cheese scent.

386
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:31,525
There's no way a dog
could resist that.

387
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:32,902
Your timing was impeccable.

388
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,779
-Go away. Huh? What?
-You need to come with us.

389
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,238
Are you serious? Really?

390
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,326
Why'd you go the hard way and
make things so complicated?

391
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,953
We could've just chartered a
plane right from the beginning.

392
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:44,246
Here's the thing.

393
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,874
I had to make it clear to Jeon
Tae-su that moving the money

394
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,543
the way we've been doing it
just wasn't an option anymore.

395
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:50,920
For that to happen,

396
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,713
he had to witness
you getting caught.

397
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:53,798
That's how it works.

398
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:58,886
Once suspicion dies down, trust
takes its place, of course.

399
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,806
If we'd mentioned the
chartered plane right away,

400
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,225
he would have never gone for it.

401
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,854
What? Did you fall for me again?

402
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,523
Oh my gosh.

403
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,149
Am I really that pretty?

404
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,484
Geez.

405
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,112
The shielding device you used
to get past the security...

406
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,656
-great stuff.
-Thank you.

407
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,741
Clever girl.

408
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:28,582
Seriously, who would've thought that this
whole thing was planned from the start?

409
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,834
That's how people are.

410
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,670
They only believe what they
can see with their own eyes.

411
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,756
They have no clue how
tight aviation security is.

412
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,175
Gosh. Oh, Yi-rang...

413
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:42,930
Honestly, how do you keep coming
up with stuff like this? Huh?

414
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,432
You were born to do this.

415
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,976
It'd be a shame to let
this talent go to waste.

416
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:48,686
-Geez.
-Gu-ho.

417
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,439
So what happens next?

418
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:00,406
I just received word that
he'll be arriving soon.

419
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,660
Hey! Excuse me. Hey. Here.

420
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,537
Long time no see.

421
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,372
We're a little late...

422
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,376
-It's been a while, huh?
-Excuse me?

423
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,880
I was meant to meet you with the chairman,
but things have been hectic lately.

424
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,339
Sorry I didn't get in touch.

425
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,091
Yeah.

426
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:21,218
Um, so, how do we
know each other?

427
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,430
Don't be a stranger.
Come on. Card.

428
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,020
Let's talk upstairs. Please.

429
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,732
-Thank you.
-Sure.

430
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,120
If things go according to plan,

431
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,166
the Sand Foundation will
fully back the funding.

432
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,044
Oh, of course. It's
for a good cause.

433
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,255
Naturally, we'll do
anything to support you.

434
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,547
If you need something else,

435
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,800
-besides the chartered flight, let us...
-Oh, and one more thing. Shh. Mmm.

436
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:06,597
No one outside of these four walls
must know about our meeting today.

437
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,100
Don't even tell the
chairman about this, okay?

438
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,773
You see, since we're a
charitable organization,

439
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:19,151
there's been quite a lot
of talk about our funding.

440
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:21,779
Ah...

441
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,031
I'll make sure to
keep that in mind.

442
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,992
-All right. I'll see you soon.
-Yes, sir.

443
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,454
Yeah.

444
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,375
Working out, huh?

445
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,960
-Goodbye.
-Okay. See you guys.

446
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,378
-Yes!
-Bye.

447
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,808
I just booked a chartered
flight with Jeon Tae-su's money!

448
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:08,450
Let's go.

449
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,869
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

450
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,061
Hmm.

451
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,943
The trucks are entering
the premises. Yeah.

452
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,115
They've entered the premises.

453
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:58,959
All right. Let's
get on the flight.

454
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,796
And now, our great
journey finally begins.

455
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,382
-Sand Foundation, let's do this!
-Let's do this!

456
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,098
-This is almost over.
-I'd like to take a moment

457
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,641
to thank the volunteers
and supporters...

458
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,643
Anyway, why are the
supplies not here yet?

459
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,562
Just be patient. Luck's
always on my side.

460
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,006
Can you make a finger heart?

461
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:22,608
-Sand Foundation, let's do this!
-Let's do this!

462
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,404
Thank you. Okay.

463
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,114
-Sir.
-Yes.

464
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,825
We need to move. It's time.

465
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,451
They're here.

466
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,163
EMERGENCY RELIEF SUPPLIES

467
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:44,755
-Close it out.
-Yes, sir.

468
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,424
We'll end the presentation here.

469
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:49,802
Our schedule requires
us to depart shortly.

470
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:50,886
Thank you very much.

471
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,430
Sir.

472
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,688
-Let's get on that plane.
-Yes.

473
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,608
We should all stick around

474
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,235
and enjoy the finale.

475
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,845
Something feels different,
don't you think?

476
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,335
Don't get distracted

477
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,587
-and keep your head in the game.
-But...

478
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,399
We took the money bags,

479
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,735
out of the cargo hold
and had them brought up.

480
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,319
Thank you.

481
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,657
-I couldn't have done it without you.
-Thank you very much.

482
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:56,118
We don't deserve
the credit, sir.

483
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:58,162
I'm grateful you trusted us.

484
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,875
-I'm going to use the restroom.
-Oh, this way.

485
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:04,460
Yes.

486
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:11,341
EMERGENCY RELIEF SUPPLIES

487
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,465
Yi-rang, Yi-rang, Yi-rang.

488
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,889
I knew the plan up to this
point, but what's the next step?

489
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,474
We'll figure it out as we go.

490
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:22,895
Huh? Are you for real?
You don't even know? Huh?

491
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,688
Oh, the restroom is occupied.

492
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,253
Wh... what are you...

493
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,032
A shame, really.

494
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:36,742
It was almost perfect.

495
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,369
Sir. What happened?

496
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,500
KOREAN TOURIST MURDERED
IN THE PHILIPPINES

497
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,743
CONFIRMED AS THE LOVE CHILD
OF RISING AIRLINES CHAIRMAN

498
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,172
How dare you try
to steal my money?

499
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:56,136
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
You poor things.

500
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,180
How can you be
this unlucky, huh?

501
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,185
Or maybe, I'm just
really lucky, right?

502
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,521
I... I... I can...
explain everything.

503
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,897
-Sure.
-Uh...

504
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,607
-Wait. Sir. Sir, please.
-Hey, don't move.

505
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,525
What are you doing?

506
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,402
That reminds me. No wonder
you looked so damn familiar.

507
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:13,987
You know?

508
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,907
But who cares about
all of that now? Huh?

509
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,450
It'll all end soon enough.

510
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:20,744
-Please, sir. Wait. Wait!
-Hey. Don't move.

511
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,955
Once you wake up, this
will all be behind you.

512
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:23,914
-Okay?
-Stop!

513
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,040
Every single thing...

514
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,209
-No, wait!
-Your job and your life too.

515
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,716
What was that? What's going on?

516
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,554
What just happened?

517
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:40,514
Sir, are you okay?

518
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:48,981
We're experiencing turbulence.

519
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,358
Please be seated and
fasten your seat belts.

520
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,986
-Ugh! Shit.
-Shit.

521
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:02,578
Oh, shit.

522
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,580
What's happening?

523
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:07,708
Hey, go to your seats.

524
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,459
-Hurry!
-Come on sit now!

525
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:12,963
What's happening?

526
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:20,429
We're all gonna die!

527
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,907
Shit!

528
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:53,879
Hey, wake up. Wake up, for
goodness' sake. Wake up!

529
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,301
This is the Captain of
Rising Air Flight 275.

530
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,303
Due to engine damage
and the risk of fire,

531
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,056
we are unable to continue to
our destination as planned.

532
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,309
We will be attempting an emergency
landing at the nearest airport available.

533
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,645
Due to engine damage and
the high risk of a fire,

534
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,147
we're no longer able to
continue to our destination.

535
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,191
We'll attempt an emergency
landing at the nearest airport.

536
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:16,026
-Sorry for the inconvenience...
-Everybody shut up!

537
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,450
Oh, my God! Oh, shit!

538
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:24,993
No!

539
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,128
Watch out. Be careful.

540
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,638
What is that?

541
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,683
Oh, look.

542
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,311
Wow...

543
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,614
Ladies and gentlemen, in order
to ensure a safe landing,

544
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,449
we need to lighten the aircraft.

545
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:07,119
We kindly ask for
your cooperation.

546
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,746
Please remain seated with
your seat belts fastened.

547
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:13,542
In order to ensure a safe landing, we
need to lighten the aircraft's load.

548
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,585
We kindly ask for
your cooperation.

549
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:17,587
Lighten the aircraft?

550
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,383
Hey. Excuse me.

551
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,969
Hey! What is she doing?

552
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,722
Hey, sir! This is dangerous,
let her do her job!

553
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,099
Hey, that's my suitcase!
Get your hands off it!

554
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,226
Hey! Nobody touches it!

555
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,310
Shit. Hey!

556
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,024
Hey, man. Be quiet! She's just
trying to save our lives, okay?

557
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,528
First Officer!

558
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:46,908
Altitude loss! Depressurization!

559
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:48,618
-Yes!
-Shit!

560
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,622
-No, no, sir...
-Let go of me.

561
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,833
-Just stop it! Stop it, sir!
-Hey, don't touch my stuff!

562
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,585
Emergency exit! One, two, three.

563
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,212
-It's too dangerous. You can't do that.
-Out of my way!

564
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,298
Seriously! Stop
that! Stop it, sir!

565
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,596
Let go of me! Oh, fuck. Wait!

566
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:15,771
Release all of the heavy cargo!

567
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:17,938
Release!

568
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,658
Hey! What the fuck?

569
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,243
What are you doing? Fuck!

570
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:43,757
Release finalized!

571
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,261
-Wait...
-Sir. Please, wait...

572
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:00,523
It's all gone?

573
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:04,736
Thanks to everyone's cooperation,
we were able to react fast.

574
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,820
Thank you.

575
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,073
Huh? It's...

576
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,408
Hi. Get back to your seat.

577
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,870
Captain Kim. You bastards.

578
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:15,122
Are you insane?!

579
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:17,749
-Gu-ho.
-Yeah.

580
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:18,792
-Gu-ho.
-Wha...?

581
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:19,960
Yi-rang needs you.

582
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,044
Huh?

583
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:23,296
Wake up, boy. Get to work.

584
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,133
Huh?

585
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,134
Huh?

586
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,304
-What's going on?
-Are you fucking crazy?

587
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:31,555
Let go of me. Let go!

588
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,140
Did you just

589
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,934
dump all of my 50
fucking billion won?

590
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,437
That's true! That
was your money!

591
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,399
So what now? What the
hell are we gonna do?

592
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,192
How are we getting it?

593
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,990
Shit!

594
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,209
-Open it!
-What?

595
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,628
-Grab that!
-Grab it?

596
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:05,755
-Okay.
-It's yours!

597
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,342
Try it on!

598
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:10,594
Are you

599
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,888
-saying I have to jump off?
-That's what I'm saying!

600
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,222
Oh!

601
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:15,891
Don't you dare move!

602
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,518
Or I'm going to kill you both!

603
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:19,894
Hey, put it on!

604
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,105
What? Sir, why me?

605
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:23,481
Here, for you.

606
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,400
Put it on! What are
you waiting for?

607
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,360
Hurry, find my money now!

608
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,119
I pulled you out of the
gutter when you had nothing.

609
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,665
Gave you a shot at a life, and
you repay me like this? Ha!

610
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,720
Sir, what are you doing?

611
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,765
Are you actually
going to jump off?

612
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,600
You'll go, just for that?

613
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:01,895
"Just for that?"

614
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,609
This is the kind of cash
you dream of having...

615
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:11,154
and will never get!

616
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,361
Whoa! Did he jump?

617
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,444
-Wow!
-Oh!

618
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,045
-Shut it! The door! The door!
-How do I close it?

619
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:11,631
Just pull the handle
hard! Come on.

620
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:13,133
Just grab that!

621
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:14,342
Pull it!

622
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,889
One, two, three.

623
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,084
There are my babies.

624
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,170
Yeah, there they are.

625
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,714
My precious babies!

626
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:04,684
My babies.

627
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:06,477
Thank you.

628
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:23,953
What the hell?

629
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,292
Shit!

630
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,133
The aircraft is now
safe and on course.

631
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:40,387
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll get
you to your destination safely.

632
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,138
Ladies and gentlemen...

633
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:43,848
Mmm.

634
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:44,932
Thank you.

635
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:54,401
James, while we're
buying time outside,

636
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:57,153
swap the money bags that
are in the cargo hold.

637
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,822
Do you have any idea how hard

638
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,949
it was to swap out all
those money bags on my own?

639
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:05,244
Okay!

640
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,872
Wow, great job.

641
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:09,874
Really convincing.
Nice performance.

642
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,376
Okay! Good job.

643
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,879
Yi-rang, great work.

644
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:15,963
Well done, my dear!

645
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,216
Gu-ho, well done.

646
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:21,845
-James...
-Oh, oh, oh.

647
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,248
What is wrong with him?

648
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:25,223
He's sleeping all day.

649
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,434
Oh, this kid. He's so fragile.

650
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:49,456
Whoo!

651
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,166
Ta-da!

652
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,127
Remember how I bought a winery

653
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,005
-in Burgundy, France, last month?
-Yeah.

654
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,007
This champagne comes
from that winery.

655
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,676
And since I own it, I think
I deserve a little taste.

656
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,886
Of course you do.

657
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:05,597
-Thank you.
-Mmm.

658
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:09,058
How could you do that to me?

659
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,727
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

660
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,687
Sorry, sorry.

661
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,189
Huh? Just come and join us.

662
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,607
-No way...
-Just come here.

663
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,025
-Absolutely not!
-Come on!

664
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,944
I just don't understand.

665
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,445
You're gonna have
to explain it to me.

666
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,697
How much of it was real
and how much was fake?

667
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:28,870
It's true that James approached
him disguised as a captain.

668
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,331
If you don't mind, can I get
your business card as well?

669
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:34,334
Jeon Tae-su was way more
suspicious than we thought.

670
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,669
Earning his trust
was no easy task.

671
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:39,422
So we figured it wasn't going
to work out, and we pulled out.

672
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:40,506
TRUTH

673
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:44,219
From that moment on,
everything was a lie.

674
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:47,472
Jeon Tae-su never actually turned
up at the cargo ship that day.

675
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:51,267
So the whole story about James
getting assaulted and beaten

676
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:52,268
was something we made up.

677
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:53,352
FALSE

678
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,565
After that, we kept waiting for
Jeon Tae-su to give us a call.

679
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:01,903
But since he was so suspicious,
he didn't even bother to text us.

680
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:04,656
Time to improvise.

681
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:09,786
However as soon as we came
up with the whole operation,

682
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,579
you immediately came to mind.

683
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,081
Because what Jeon Tae-su wants

684
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,960
isn't simply trust, but
absolute loyalty and obedience.

685
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,503
So, that was the plan.

686
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,505
You both had this
all figured out -

687
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:21,881
from the start!

688
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:23,675
Gu-ho, get the truffle
oil, would you?

689
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,843
Could you grind me some
Himalayan pink salt?

690
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:28,888
Seriously, my life is just...

691
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:31,391
-Oh, tastes great, huh?
-It's so refreshing.

692
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:34,102
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

693
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:37,480
Gu-ho, see? Absolute
loyalty and obedience.

694
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:38,815
That's what you embody.

695
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,525
You were perfect for this job.

696
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:45,572
You know what?
You can't have it.

697
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:47,365
We were saying that
you're considerate.

698
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,285
-Is that it?
-That's all.

699
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,206
-Okay.
-Okay.

700
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:59,335
Wait, you were going to jump out of
the actual plane? What was that about?

701
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:01,963
Huh? Yi-rang, I knew you
were a little unhinged,

702
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:05,425
-but I never thought you'd actually...
-At altitudes below 3,000 meters,

703
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:08,636
the pressure difference between the
cabin and the outside isn't drastic,

704
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,722
so sudden decompression
isn't really a risk.

705
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,600
FLIGHT ALTITUDE = 1,000 METERS

706
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:16,686
So as long as we didn't
climb any higher, no problem.

707
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:19,147
I did all the
necessary calculations.

708
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,610
Okay, but that was
wrong. All right?

709
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:25,028
I mean it.

710
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,905
-It must've been so easy for you, huh?
-What?

711
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,992
While I was fighting for my
life, you were in a hospital bed,

712
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:34,329
kicking back all relaxed,
just wasting time, huh?

713
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,914
What are you talking
about? I was very busy.

714
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,833
I was always right
by your side, dude.

715
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:41,044
What are you talking about?

716
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:42,795
Hmm.

717
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,841
This isn't some kind of art
piece, so just take the photos.

718
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,009
This isn't a movie set!

719
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:50,677
He left.

720
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,139
-Did he leave?
-Yes.

721
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:00,063
Understood. Thank you, sir.

722
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,856
Okay, bye.

723
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,165
Why'd they have to make it so
tight? I don't have time for this.

724
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:22,585
Damn it!

725
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,422
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT
PROSECUTOR GENERAL

726
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:29,092
I can't feel my arm.

727
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:30,927
But I'm so busy.

728
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:35,556
Oh, be quiet.

729
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:45,358
Oh! Ah!

730
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,977
-I'm so sick of you!
-Where are you going?

731
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,780
I... I've had enough.

732
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,073
This shit sucks.

733
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,575
Don't you dare follow me!

734
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:57,620
I think he's actually fed up
with us this time. He sounds mad.

735
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:02,667
That hurts! Yi-rang.

736
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,168
-What's up, Ray-Bang?
-James!

737
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:05,169
Help me!

738
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:07,004
What's he doing?
Who is this guy?

739
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:09,590
Oh, you didn't have
to bring anything.

740
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:11,092
For the cause!

741
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:12,260
For the cause!

742
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,679
-Hello. Good work, everyone.
-Huh?

743
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:15,762
Yes. Good work.

744
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:20,810
You... You're...

745
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:29,902
When did this happen?

746
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:31,112
Huh?

747
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:34,824
He's a junior from my Marine Corps days
who happens to work for Jeon Tae-Su.

748
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:36,325
I snatched him up immediately.

749
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:40,413
Mr. Ray-Bang here brought Mr. Mustache,
who used to work in the film industry,

750
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,498
and that's how we got
our secret agents.

751
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,793
-Mmm.
-Uh, here. Well done.

752
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:46,961
This is your cut,

753
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,046
and for Mr. Mustache.

754
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:52,258
Thank you, sir. I will
continue to do my best.

755
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:53,968
Thank you. Have a seat.

756
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:56,471
This is yours, Gu-ho.

757
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:03,102
Where's the rest of the money?

758
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:04,979
Do you know what
chartering a plane costs?

759
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,731
We had to get those
relief supplies as well.

760
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,316
Wait a minute. Quiet.

761
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:16,491
We reported that Nazareth, a home that
helps the young transition to independence

762
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:19,911
was at risk of shutting down due
to misunderstandings and rumors.

763
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:23,372
However, two days ago, an anonymous
donor made a significant contribution,

764
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:25,958
and a new state-of-the-art
center is soon to be underway.

765
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:28,085
A FEW DAYS AGO

766
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,715
LET THIS BE USED TO
NURTURE THE FUTURE

767
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:40,139
Sister.

768
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:41,848
Sister.

769
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:43,059
Sister!

770
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,771
By the Lord's grace,
a like-minded brother,

771
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:51,067
anonymous but generous, has
blessed us in a profound way.

772
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,652
So that's where it went?

773
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:54,320
We offer our thanks
to the Lord...

774
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,656
Hey, um... Give them this
too. Go on, give it to them.

775
00:51:56,739 --> 00:52:00,201
Ah, whatever. You deserve to keep
it. We're not running a charity here.

776
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,744
He's right, Gu-ho.

777
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:04,747
You should get some snacks with
that little share of yours.

778
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:06,207
Coming up next,

779
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,793
Jeon Tae-su, chairman
of the Sand Foundation,

780
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,963
has been arrested for child abuse
and aggravated unlawful confinement.

781
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:12,880
Jeon Tae-su.

782
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:15,383
Police have discovered
that former Chairman Jeon

783
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,427
subjected children to prolonged
abuse and unlawful confinement

784
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:20,888
within the welfare
center he ran.

785
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:23,724
Go to hell, asshole!

786
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:24,808
You monster!

787
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,395
Die! You're so damn cruel!

788
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,397
They'll be launching
an investigation to...

789
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,480
Yi-rang...

790
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,943
Why Jeon Tae-su of all people?

791
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,988
He seemed different than the
usual mess we clean. Huh?

792
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:41,868
She dozed off.

793
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:47,415
Well, that was fast.

794
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:48,374
Let's go.

795
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,001
-Okay. Okay.
-Follow me.

796
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:54,671
Mmm.

797
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,710
25 YEARS AGO

798
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:19,734
Checkmate!

799
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,654
I won again.

800
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:25,656
That's unfortunate.

801
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,827
Since you lost, you
need to get punished.

802
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,166
That's so unfair.

803
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,250
What's unfair?

804
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:42,339
Ah...

805
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:46,010
Are you saying you keep
losing because they scare you?

806
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,637
No way. I'm way
younger than you.

807
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,514
But you're smarter than I am.

808
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:53,476
But you have much
more experience.

809
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:54,893
What if...

810
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,812
and I'm just saying this...

811
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,983
Maybe you're actually
smarter than I am...

812
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,446
That makes sense.

813
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:08,657
Fine. Then we'll play
the game you want.

814
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,161
-What do you want to play?
-What about hide-and-seek?

815
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,038
Sure.

816
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:26,884
Go ahead.

817
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:34,141

818
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:37,686

♪ Hide yourself well

822
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:54,912
Okay.

825

Checkmate.

827
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:11,447
ANY WORLD THEME PARK KIDNAP
CASE, MYUNG GU-HO, AGE 28

828
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:00,454
An art critic fluent in every
form of artistic expression

829
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,039
and a major force
in the art world.

830
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:05,292
Are we about to reveal a hidden
masterpiece on our show today?

831
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:08,379
All right. Let's
find out who he is.

832
00:59:09,922 --> 00:59:11,465
You can show me in my gallery.

833
00:59:12,383 --> 00:59:13,342
That's crazy...

834
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:17,221
He's a piece of trash who
harasses women using his status.

835
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:20,849
Wait, wait, wait. James,
did we get caught?

836
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:25,104
I'm Olivia Kim, Head of
Purchasing at Wonderby Asia.

837
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:29,149
We'll lure him in using Mr. Famous's
most powerful memories as bait.

838
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:30,233
Ah!

839
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:32,293
What's wrong?
What's the matter?

840
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,541
When did you arrive in Korea?

841
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:39,493
I'm sure you must know Soul
Auction's legal team manager.

842
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,120
Don't you worry.

843
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:43,289
I know what we need now...

844
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:46,041
the perfect target.
