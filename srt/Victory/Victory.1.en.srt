1
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,541
Bam!

2
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:21,165
Did our fly moves
blew up your feeble brains?

3
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,250
This is nothing in Busan.

4
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,291
What the…

5
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,500
Is this busted?

6
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,875
It's not busted.

7
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,291
Then what are these?

8
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,999
Whose backup dancer do you
want to be later?

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,124
Uhm Jung-hwa.

10
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,290
Her dance team 'Friends'?

11
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,374
I heard becoming a celeb
is easier than joining that team.

12
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,166
Nothing in this world is easy.

13
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,500
Kim Jong-min is in that team.

14
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,750
I heard he's hotter than
Jung Woo-sung in person.

15
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,000
I like Baek Ji-young better.

16
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,125
Baek Ji-young?

17
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,585
The newbie? She won't last.

18
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,819
Her singing is whack.

19
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:37,010
I thought she was good.

20
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,000
That's all lip syncing.

21
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,916
She's a one-hit wonder,
you know my intuition.

22
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:44,568
You're trippin'.

23
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:46,443
Shall we warm up?

24
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:49,693
Let's do it.

25
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:55,817
Let's say you go to Seoul
and become a backup dancer.

26
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,193
What will you do next?

27
00:03:58,568 --> 00:03:59,568
Dance.

28
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:00,859
And then?

29
00:04:01,193 --> 00:04:02,193
There is nothing else.

30
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:03,943
- That's my end goal.
- Yeah?

31
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:21,984
Rad Mina!

32
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:24,943
Geoje is too small for me.

33
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,359
- Who is the best?!
- Haegwang High!

34
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,818
- Who is the best?!
- Haegwang High!

35
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:57,443
Rad Mina, is soccer fun?

36
00:04:57,609 --> 00:05:01,484
No one watches soccer
because it's fun, we just do.

37
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:04,109
It's sad, actually.

38
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:06,818
It's almost like watching
Animal Kingdom.

39
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:09,818
Maybe that's the real hip hop.

40
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:15,443
It's a skill to be that bad.

41
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,442
He should not be playing soccer.

42
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:25,318
Not just soccer,
he shouldn't do anything.

43
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:28,234
So pointless…

44
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:31,109
Don't use your fingers.

45
00:05:33,443 --> 00:05:34,443
Dad.

46
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:36,067
I've been thinking.

47
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:37,443
Don't think while eating.

48
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:39,484
Geoje is hopeless.

49
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,442
Can't I transfer to Seoul?

50
00:05:41,443 --> 00:05:42,859
Don't think about transferring.

51
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:45,109
Why? Why can't I?

52
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:48,983
I can stay with auntie...

53
00:05:48,984 --> 00:05:50,484
Don't mention auntie.

54
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,943
She's no Paris Hilton.

55
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:54,818
She's got it tough.

56
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:58,192
What's good about having
an aunt in Seoul!

57
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:00,442
Why are you so desperate
to go to Seoul?

58
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,943
Will Seoul feed you?

59
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:04,067
Then Geoje feeds me?

60
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:05,233
It sure does!

61
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:07,568
Geoje feeds you and me too.

62
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:10,609
I can't live just
by eating alone!

63
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:14,567
What will you do in Seoul?

64
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:15,443
A dancer!

65
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:16,609
Don't be a dancer!

66
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:18,693
Eat your food.

67
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:20,943
I lost my appetite!

68
00:06:21,818 --> 00:06:23,234
Hey, Pil-sun!

69
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,193
Pil-sun, your food...

70
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:29,109
She finished it…

71
00:06:29,484 --> 00:06:30,443
Pil-sun!

72
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:33,108
Why are you calling,
why are you calling?

73
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:34,233
When my heart aches

74
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:36,733
Why are you calling,
why are you calling?

75
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:38,108
When my heart aches

76
00:06:38,109 --> 00:06:42,484
Open your arms wide
and hug me tightly

77
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:51,318
Loneliness floating in the blue waves
under the blue sea

78
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:55,609
Who called me and brought me here?

79
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:57,109
Who is it?

80
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:01,693
Can I… use the washroom?

81
00:07:05,234 --> 00:07:06,483
Did you not see the sign
on the door?

82
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:07,484
Did you?!

83
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:12,067
- I'll use another washroom…
- Hey, Brainy Smurf.

84
00:07:12,068 --> 00:07:12,734
Yes?

85
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:14,484
Do you like SES or Fin.K.L?

86
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:15,818
I…

87
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:19,859
…like DIVA.

88
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:21,484
Pass.

89
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:27,484
Have you tried the Rice Burger?

90
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:30,109
Should we go to Lotteria
and karaoke after?

91
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:33,108
I have to make dinner
for my sisters.

92
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:36,568
Are you their maid?
Do they not have hands or feet?

93
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:39,859
They got hands and feet,
but no minds.

94
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:42,484
Did you know my mom
is pregnant again?

95
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:45,442
I thought she just gained weight.

96
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:47,568
How many so far?
7 daughters?

97
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:50,359
It's about time for a son.

98
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:52,484
Always son this, son that…

99
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:55,318
Dammit.

100
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:57,484
Did you not see
the cleaning sign...

101
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:02,443
Can you at least clean then?

102
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:09,734
You rascals, did you smoke too?

103
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:12,692
No! It was for curling
her eyelashes!

104
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,692
Like hell you did!

105
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:16,358
That hurts!

106
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,984
Chu Pil-sun, Jang Mina, and you!

107
00:08:20,193 --> 00:08:21,568
To the teacher's office.

108
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:24,359
Dean?

109
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:26,609
Why are you in
the girls' washroom?

110
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:28,443
What?

111
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:29,443
Right!

112
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:31,067
Why are you in here?
No men allowed!

113
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:32,817
Yeah! You can't be in here!

114
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:34,692
This is unthinkable in
the 21st Century!

115
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:35,693
Pervert!

116
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,943
To the teacher's office!

117
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:44,943
Was it really that good?

118
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:48,943
My ace was under the weather
so he took it easy.

119
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:53,443
I'm glad you're happy.

120
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:59,943
They're not aiming for the World Cup,
their studies should be the priority.

121
00:09:01,318 --> 00:09:02,693
I'm…

122
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:07,443
…not interested in soccer at all.

123
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:11,068
I gotta go now.

124
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:18,359
See that? Principal Kim is
mocking me.

125
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:20,693
I didn't see, but I heard.

126
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:23,484
Are you mocking me too?

127
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:27,693
Tell me, why do you keep losing?

128
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,484
Just tell me that.

129
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:32,567
Haegwang is good,
they played in the round of 16...

130
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:33,693
Stop!

131
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:37,818
Can't we play well too? Please?!

132
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:47,109
You know Geoje is hosting
the nationals for the first time, right?

133
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:48,484
Of course, sir.

134
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:53,192
Wasn't Kim Dong-hyun from
Hyundae High supposed to arrive?

135
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,692
Did he change his mind?

136
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:56,734
No, sir, he'll be here today.

137
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:07,193
Can we reach
the quarterfinals with him?

138
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:28,109
Hands up properly.

139
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:30,859
You too.

140
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:35,317
You think we like dancing
in the washroom?

141
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:38,108
Let us use the club room again!

142
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:40,692
Oh dear…

143
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:41,983
You stupid!

144
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:43,068
Stupid!

145
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:44,484
Stupid!

146
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:47,234
Why are you here?

147
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,359
I was just using the washroom…

148
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:51,233
You're stupid too.

149
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,693
Don't hang out with these girls!

150
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:56,233
Why? What's wrong with us?!

151
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:58,692
Are you discriminating?
It's unthinkable in the 21st Ce...

152
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:00,943
You be quiet.

153
00:11:06,443 --> 00:11:08,234
Why are you hitting us?

154
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:10,609
Are you in college?

155
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:13,568
How can you still be
in high school?

156
00:11:14,443 --> 00:11:16,443
Have you seen the movie
Whispering Corridors?

157
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:20,193
A high school girl continues
going to school in it.

158
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:24,693
The way I see it, I think
you two are ghosts, not her!

159
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:30,068
When I graduate,
I'll sue you for assault!

160
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:34,983
Isn't 'assault'
you and Mina's middle name?

161
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:38,192
Stop causing trouble
and graduate in a few years, got it?

162
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:40,234
When did we cause trouble?

163
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:45,693
When?

164
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:49,359
What grade are you in?

165
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:50,484
You're juniors, yeah?

166
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:52,692
- So what?
- We're seniors!

167
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:55,109
No one gives a crap
about grades in clubs!

168
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:58,693
And we've been coming here
way before you all.

169
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:02,483
- Are you nuts?
- You bitch!

170
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:03,484
It wasn't me!

171
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:34,442
Had we not fought back then…

172
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:36,817
We wouldn't have been suspended,

173
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:39,484
and not have to repeat a year.

174
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:43,193
And our dance club
would still be around.

175
00:12:44,443 --> 00:12:46,609
You should've said
it was because of Yeon-woo.

176
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:49,443
And she took off to Seoul.

177
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:54,817
If you ask me why I couldn't say

178
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:57,817
what was in my mind!

179
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,859
My heart...

180
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:01,234
Dang it!

181
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:02,483
Which bastard was it?!

182
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:06,193
Sorry! That was my bad!

183
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:09,818
That bell saved your ass.

184
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:16,484
My ball!

185
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:18,693
Hey.

186
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:20,942
Chi-hyung likes you, right?

187
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:21,943
You nuts?

188
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,442
How do you know
what he's feeling?

189
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:26,108
It's not about who he likes,
I just don't like him.

190
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,109
He's not allowed to like you?

191
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,567
I'm sick of it, I've seen him
since we were 4.

192
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:31,443
I would feel nothing
to see him naked.

193
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:34,484
He is a bit of an idiot.

194
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,693
My shoulders are so sore.

195
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:42,943
How much did you drink
last night?

196
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:45,234
Dunno, I don't remember.

197
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:47,942
Why did you drink so much
on a weekday?

198
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:50,692
Today was supposed to be
an off day!

199
00:13:50,693 --> 00:13:53,108
- The company's doing whatever...
- Shh, shut up.

200
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:54,318
What is it?!

201
00:13:58,234 --> 00:14:00,233
Today is an off day!

202
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:03,068
Are you expecting subcontractors
to work ourselves to death?!

203
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:09,818
We pay, feed, clothe them,
and now they want holidays too?

204
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,484
They're contractors.

205
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:15,983
If we just press them,
the efficiency will...

206
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:20,443
It's your job to make sure
the efficiency doesn't drop, no?

207
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,442
I don't need managers
who side with workers.

208
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:24,734
Do you understand?

209
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:38,443
Cheerleading?

210
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:48,443
Hey, look at her, it's so funny.

211
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,359
Yo!

212
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:53,109
Holy cow…

213
00:14:54,484 --> 00:14:55,568
Turn it off.

214
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:58,233
Oh gosh!

215
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:00,234
Who gave you permission
to dance here?!

216
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,692
Do I need permission
to dance here?

217
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:07,234
“Do I need permission
to dance here?”

218
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:09,859
This Seoul chick is fearless.

219
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:13,193
You need my permission
to dance around here.

220
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:15,109
And you are?

221
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:16,234
Me?

222
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,483
This school's alpha.

223
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,734
Our top ringleader!

224
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:21,942
Stop playing dumb.

225
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:24,484
Did you not sense it?

226
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:27,109
You know what
I'm about to say next, yeah?

227
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:30,859
Come to the rooftop after class!

228
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:33,568
Come!

229
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,483
Where in Seoul are you from?

230
00:15:45,484 --> 00:15:47,693
Would you know if I tell you?

231
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:53,609
Yeah? You sure talk like a shrew.

232
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:56,318
What if we do?

233
00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:57,484
You've never lived there.

234
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:00,942
But I know! Dongdaemun,
Apgujeong, yeah?

235
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:04,233
And… what else?

236
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:05,692
Lotte World! Farmland!

237
00:16:05,693 --> 00:16:09,567
Farmland became Everland,
like a year or two ago.

238
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,443
Everland is not in Seoul.

239
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:14,234
I know even if I never lived there.

240
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:17,567
Do you need to live in
New York to know about it?

241
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:19,984
I lived there for about 2 years.

242
00:16:20,943 --> 00:16:22,984
Then you must know it well.

243
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,943
So, why did a high class
Seoulite who lived in New York

244
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:28,818
transfer to the countryside?

245
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:30,983
Did you get suspended
for dancing too?

246
00:16:30,984 --> 00:16:33,108
My brother transferred
to play soccer, so I came along.

247
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:34,943
What was that dance earlier?

248
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:36,568
Did you learn cheerleading?

249
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:40,609
Do you need a practice room
to do that?

250
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:45,234
I… guess?

251
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:48,693
Speak respectfully.

252
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,108
We're a year older.

253
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:52,693
Yeah, they're older than us!

254
00:16:58,443 --> 00:16:59,943
Why do you think
we called you here?

255
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:03,733
The girls asked me to show...

256
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:05,068
Enough!

257
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,359
If you're gonna dance
when someone asks you…

258
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:13,859
Then teach us too.

259
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,193
Cheerleading.

260
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:32,692
You gals are killing me!

261
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:34,483
Do you even know what that is?

262
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:36,443
Of course, it's cheerleading.

263
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:38,983
Isn't it about time
our soccer team won?

264
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:39,693
It is!

265
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:41,942
Didn't you see Haegwang
cheering them on?

266
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:43,568
Worry about yourselves!

267
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:46,567
We'll make sure
our soccer team wins!

268
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:47,943
We'll make it happen!

269
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,818
What did you say?

270
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:52,233
It's nothing, sir,
these troublemakers...

271
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:53,609
We need a cheerleading squad!

272
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:55,359
For our soccer team!

273
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:58,818
Shouldn't we win at least once?

274
00:17:59,484 --> 00:18:01,068
Shut up, you little rascals.

275
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:05,942
All right, this is Kim Dong-hyun,
he'll be joining us.

276
00:18:05,943 --> 00:18:07,068
Say hello.

277
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:08,484
I'm Kim Dong-hyun.

278
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:11,734
Eh? That's all?

279
00:18:13,818 --> 00:18:17,483
I scored two goals in Gwangju
against you all last spring,

280
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:20,318
target-man style striker
Kim Dong-hyun.

281
00:18:20,943 --> 00:18:21,943
Is that enough?

282
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:24,692
What's with that punk?

283
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:28,234
Consider it a rite of passage
and kick this ball.

284
00:18:57,943 --> 00:19:00,317
Coach, the principal is
asking for you!

285
00:19:00,318 --> 00:19:01,318
Me?

286
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:03,234
Why?

287
00:19:04,693 --> 00:19:06,693
Like this, like this!

288
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:11,108
We'll have matching uniforms,
several of us dancing together!

289
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,984
With really cool music!

290
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:15,484
Our players would be so pumped!

291
00:19:16,234 --> 00:19:17,693
Yeah, I'm getting pumped.

292
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,359
- Come in.
- Good afternoon.

293
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:27,818
Do you know about the effects
of cheering to players?

294
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,068
What?

295
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,483
You know, that thing,

296
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:35,067
players' athleticism goes up
by 50% when they're cheered.

297
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:37,692
Hey, don't underestimate our coach!

298
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:41,318
He's not an ignoramus
who wouldn't know that! Yeah?

299
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:44,484
Yes, of course I do.

300
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:46,358
Athleticism increases by…

301
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,442
50, 50…

302
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:50,234
Increases by 5… 5… 50%,
I know about that.

303
00:19:50,943 --> 00:19:51,568
Is that true?

304
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:54,692
Yes! There's research done by
Harvard University in England.

305
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,067
Harvard in England!

306
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:57,693
Harvard is in the USA…

307
00:19:59,234 --> 00:19:59,609
What is it?

308
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,733
Wowsers!
That's how we'd cheer.

309
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,234
It's a Seoul-style cheer, wowsers!

310
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:10,317
So, you just need a practice room?

311
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:11,442
Ding, ding!

312
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:15,109
When can we see it?
That 50% increase in athleticism?

313
00:20:15,568 --> 00:20:16,443
Pardon?

314
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:17,858
Well, it's…

315
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:19,693
The next match should do.

316
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:22,108
Most definitely.
Am I right?

317
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:23,943
Not problem! Yup.

318
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:27,984
This is all?

319
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:30,568
Straight as an arrow.

320
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:34,484
Just one mirror?

321
00:20:42,443 --> 00:20:44,443
Turbo's second album?

322
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:50,108
What are you doing?

323
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:51,609
Is that your mom's aerobic uniform?

324
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:55,609
If you want to do cheerleading,
you must wear the uniform.

325
00:20:57,109 --> 00:20:58,943
Dancing is about vibe!

326
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:01,109
You look vibe-free right now.

327
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:04,109
Very well.

328
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,693
Let's warm up,
so, follow my moves.

329
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:08,984
I'll teach you the basics first.

330
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,567
Do you get the flow?

331
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:27,568
- Nope.
- Nope.

332
00:21:28,984 --> 00:21:30,734
It's because there's no music.

333
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:33,067
Do you have 'Show'?

334
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:34,318
'Show'?

335
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:38,192
Kim Won-jun's 'Show'?
That 'Show'?

336
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:40,608
We love him so much,

337
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:42,567
but that's not a dance song.

338
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,318
- Why?
- You serious?

339
00:21:45,068 --> 00:21:48,317
There is no end to the show

340
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:50,943
Only this moment exists

341
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:52,443
That's not cheerleading dance...

342
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,109
I know, I know,
this isn't how it goes!

343
00:21:56,568 --> 00:22:02,193
So, stick to your dance,
and we'll stick to ours.

344
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:09,109
How's the cheerleading going?

345
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:14,817
- I'd like to stop.
- The practice.

346
00:22:14,818 --> 00:22:16,233
Stop the practice?

347
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:19,484
You must be so tired,
but Se-hyun, we want to…

348
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:21,692
learn a bit more.

349
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:24,108
Pulling out the hip
exaggerates the move?

350
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,108
- Like this?
- This?

351
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:28,068
Dong-hyun's sister, you tell me.

352
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:30,109
Is everything okay here?

353
00:22:37,984 --> 00:22:38,984
Yes.

354
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,943
Oh yeah, the condition for
creating this club is…

355
00:22:44,568 --> 00:22:46,942
To have 9 members at least,
you know?

356
00:22:46,943 --> 00:22:47,484
What?

357
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:48,692
I'll give you a week.

358
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:51,234
If you can't assemble
5 more members,

359
00:22:51,568 --> 00:22:54,109
this club will cease to exist.

360
00:22:56,568 --> 00:22:57,984
Good luck!

361
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:01,984
Dang it…

362
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:09,443
I'll learn cheerleading.

363
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:12,858
Let's get new members first.

364
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,692
How can we get 5 members?

365
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:18,109
Don't worry, it's not 50,
5 shouldn't be a problem.

366
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:21,818
We won't get any, fat chance.

367
00:23:24,318 --> 00:23:26,693
Who made this?
Was it you?

368
00:23:27,443 --> 00:23:29,692
Fried dumplings were my idea.

369
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:32,234
Everything's crap,
but that's the worst part.

370
00:23:32,693 --> 00:23:34,067
But it's so good…

371
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:36,568
Why don't we class hop
to gather some girls?

372
00:23:37,193 --> 00:23:38,109
That's a good idea.

373
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,193
You think they'll come
by doing that?

374
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:45,318
How do we bait girls
who want to dance?

375
00:26:20,693 --> 00:26:22,943
The class isn't over,
sit back down.

376
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:28,817
I'm going to check everything
that I went over today, so do it right.

377
00:26:28,818 --> 00:26:30,192
Okay!

378
00:26:30,193 --> 00:26:31,693
You sure can answer.

379
00:26:32,443 --> 00:26:33,484
By the way…

380
00:26:35,943 --> 00:26:37,818
All right, done!

381
00:26:52,484 --> 00:26:54,109
- Send in the next one.
- Okay.

382
00:26:55,443 --> 00:26:58,068
Yo, AV! Come over here!

383
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,068
Next.

384
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:45,693
She's got it.

385
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:46,734
Fail.

386
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:48,443
Why?

387
00:27:48,943 --> 00:27:50,318
She's got no power.

388
00:27:55,568 --> 00:27:57,568
I like her exaggerated moves.

389
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:01,068
Pass!

390
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:02,443
- Fail.
- Fail.

391
00:28:02,818 --> 00:28:04,859
She's got power, but no vibe.

392
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:06,693
But I like her.

393
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:14,693
Fail.

394
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,484
Why?

395
00:28:15,484 --> 00:28:16,484
She feels like a freak.

396
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:17,858
What do you know?

397
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:21,109
Freaks dance so well,
let's watch her.

398
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,818
Wow, amazing!

399
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:36,693
Popping! Pass!

400
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:38,109
Fail.

401
00:28:38,568 --> 00:28:39,984
She is a freak.

402
00:28:40,818 --> 00:28:42,693
I'll now begin.

403
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:48,443
One, and one.

404
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:51,484
Ten!

405
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:56,443
Round I go.

406
00:28:58,693 --> 00:29:00,818
Round and round.

407
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:03,108
Ten!

408
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:05,233
This is too old school.

409
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:06,984
Her form is pretty.

410
00:29:08,693 --> 00:29:10,818
Fail! Next!

411
00:29:30,484 --> 00:29:31,818
Out you go.

412
00:29:35,193 --> 00:29:37,443
We'll never find anyone
at this rate.

413
00:29:39,484 --> 00:29:40,693
Exactly.

414
00:29:41,818 --> 00:29:42,943
Come here.

415
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:50,358
What's with the puppy?

416
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,442
Bonggu is my brother.

417
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:55,108
And why is the little one here?

418
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:56,109
Do you dance too?

419
00:29:56,484 --> 00:29:57,818
Can you dance?

420
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:00,693
My nickname in middle school
was Beyongce.

421
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,068
Give it a go, Beyongce.

422
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,608
How is she so good?

423
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:22,609
I know…

424
00:30:36,943 --> 00:30:39,233
Where did you learn to dance?

425
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:43,859
You know, I learned it by
watching AFKN, the American TV.

426
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,692
- Pass!
- Pass!

427
00:30:46,693 --> 00:30:47,734
Pass.

428
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:49,568
How many more left?

429
00:30:49,818 --> 00:30:50,943
That's all.

430
00:30:51,484 --> 00:30:52,859
What do we do?

431
00:30:54,943 --> 00:30:56,693
Why are there so few talents?

432
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:02,568
May I audition too?

433
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:12,484
AV, you're serious about this.

434
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:41,983
What about the unicycle?

435
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:43,359
Where can we use her?

436
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,943
She was original for sure.

437
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:46,984
The popper, let's go with her.

438
00:31:47,234 --> 00:31:49,692
So popping, she was so good.

439
00:31:49,693 --> 00:31:51,359
I like the one in traditional dress.

440
00:31:52,068 --> 00:31:53,443
How was it?

441
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:56,442
You haven't gone home yet?

442
00:31:56,443 --> 00:31:58,693
How did you remix that music?

443
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:00,567
I did it myself on the computer.

444
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:02,067
Then go to the Computer Club!

445
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:03,484
She may be useful.

446
00:32:03,693 --> 00:32:04,942
That's right.

447
00:32:04,943 --> 00:32:08,568
We need to remix music,
so we could use a brainiac.

448
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:09,942
Let's put her to use.

449
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:11,442
Yo, AV, you pass!

450
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:15,733
Pass! Thank you! Thank you!

451
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,693
Hey, who are you?

452
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:24,943
You thought this was
a cheering club for the soccer team?

453
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,983
- Am I right?
- Yes.

454
00:32:26,984 --> 00:32:31,943
This is a cheering club,
but we do it with dance.

455
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:34,067
I've never danced before…

456
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:36,817
Don't pretend to be naïve.

457
00:32:36,818 --> 00:32:39,943
Aren't you the daughter of
the Taekwondo Gym above Paris Bakery?

458
00:32:40,818 --> 00:32:43,234
It's not Paris, but French Bakery.

459
00:32:43,693 --> 00:32:47,234
I know, French is Paris in English.

460
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:50,693
Dancing is like taekwondo.

461
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:54,068
Since you're here,
show us a form or something.

462
00:32:54,318 --> 00:32:56,608
I haven't learned any forms…

463
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:59,943
How could you not
when your dad is a master?

464
00:33:00,193 --> 00:33:03,818
I was told girls shouldn't
learn taekwondo.

465
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:06,483
Which bastard said that bullshit!

466
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,568
My father…

467
00:33:08,818 --> 00:33:10,818
He's totally allowed.

468
00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:14,818
He must really want to
raise you like a princess!

469
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:17,567
So, show us something.

470
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,109
I'm sure you learned
something from watching.

471
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:29,984
Pass.

472
00:33:32,818 --> 00:33:34,983
How many members are we short?

473
00:33:34,984 --> 00:33:35,984
Two.

474
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,233
So-hee, you sure you don't
want to dance?

475
00:33:38,234 --> 00:33:40,068
I really can't dance.

476
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:42,233
We'll teach you, give it a go.

477
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:44,359
- But how could I…
- What was that thing,

478
00:33:44,568 --> 00:33:46,317
a manager, be our manager.

479
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:49,817
Yeah? I'd love that!

480
00:33:49,818 --> 00:33:51,442
What's so good about being
a manager?

481
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:54,234
Let's select one of the rejects,
best of the rest.

482
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,234
You're back?

483
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:58,568
Where are you going?

484
00:33:58,984 --> 00:34:01,443
That little brat!
Give her a beating.

485
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:02,693
This is my life.

486
00:34:02,818 --> 00:34:04,109
How's this one?

487
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:06,109
I like her.

488
00:34:06,568 --> 00:34:07,359
The old school?

489
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,608
She has long arms and legs.

490
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:10,818
She's got no rhythm.

491
00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:14,483
Hey.

492
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:15,943
And where are you going?

493
00:34:16,943 --> 00:34:18,484
Seriously?

494
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:20,442
Come home soon!

495
00:34:20,443 --> 00:34:22,108
Don't go to the arcade.

496
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:24,109
Eh? It's Yuri.

497
00:34:24,443 --> 00:34:25,234
You know her?

498
00:34:25,235 --> 00:34:26,359
She was on TV.

499
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:28,693
She appeared in
'How is That Possible.'

500
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,942
'Geoje High Schooler Seamstress' episode.

501
00:34:31,943 --> 00:34:33,692
Her family runs a laundromat.

502
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:35,818
- And they do alteration too.
- Alteration?

503
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:37,734
We need uniform, right?

504
00:34:37,984 --> 00:34:39,233
Let's pick her.

505
00:34:39,234 --> 00:34:41,693
Pick her, and the other girl,

506
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:42,984
the popper.

507
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:44,443
The sunglasses? Sure.

508
00:34:54,068 --> 00:34:55,733
Are you going to
keep wearing those?

509
00:34:55,734 --> 00:34:58,567
I got weak eyes,
and need to block the sun.

510
00:34:58,568 --> 00:35:00,318
Do you wear them in class?

511
00:35:00,568 --> 00:35:02,234
I take them off when I nap.

512
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:05,818
Dammit!

513
00:35:07,818 --> 00:35:10,859
By the way, do we have
a club name or something?

514
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,067
What about 'Seven Princesses'?

515
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:16,192
That's tacky, we're living
in the millennium age.

516
00:35:16,193 --> 00:35:18,859
Tacky names work,
you're so clueless.

517
00:35:19,443 --> 00:35:20,858
How's 'Girls' Generation'?

518
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:22,858
That sounds so dumb.

519
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:25,109
Why not 'Oldie Generation'?

520
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,109
A stylish and one that sticks.

521
00:35:28,984 --> 00:35:31,108
How about 'The Last Cheerleaders'?

522
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:34,108
The Earth will be destroyed
on December 31, 1999 anyway.

523
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:35,733
What's she talking about?

524
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,483
You didn't know?
She's a Doomsdayer.

525
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:41,483
What about 'Millennium Girls'?

526
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:42,693
Chills…

527
00:35:43,193 --> 00:35:44,068
That's good.

528
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:46,108
That's a killer name,
Millennium Girls!

529
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:47,818
AV, you did something right!

530
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:51,318
Good, our club will be called
Millennium Girls.

531
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,942
So, who's doing to do that,

532
00:35:54,943 --> 00:35:58,109
you know, leader of the club.

533
00:35:58,443 --> 00:36:00,109
Me, of course.

534
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:02,483
No one else knows
about cheerleading.

535
00:36:02,484 --> 00:36:04,193
The match is less than
a month away.

536
00:36:05,234 --> 00:36:07,442
Then, follow my lead
without any complaints.

537
00:36:07,443 --> 00:36:09,108
We're running out of time.

538
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:11,693
First, I'll speak freely.

539
00:36:11,984 --> 00:36:13,483
Pil-sun, Mina, you included.

540
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:14,984
You can speak freely too.

541
00:36:15,443 --> 00:36:19,733
Let me just say one thing,
let's say you're the leader...

542
00:36:19,734 --> 00:36:21,568
- You said one thing.
- Yeah…

543
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:24,858
We'll do physical training
every day before school.

544
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:28,693
I'll choose the music
and the routine.

545
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:30,192
Let me ask you a question.

546
00:36:30,193 --> 00:36:31,109
- No.
- I see.

547
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,942
We'll assemble every morning
at 6 a.m. in PE uniforms.

548
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:36,484
And return here after school.

549
00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:43,359
We'll practice to this music.

550
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:47,483
She's a stubborn one.

551
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:50,192
That's not a danceable song.

552
00:36:50,193 --> 00:36:52,817
Don't worry, it's used a lot
for cheerleading.

553
00:36:52,818 --> 00:36:56,109
First place takes the center,
let's all meet up there.

554
00:36:56,484 --> 00:36:57,984
First come, first served!

555
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,484
Hey, Bonggu!

556
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,234
Wait for me!

557
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:31,484
First place!

558
00:37:32,443 --> 00:37:33,734
Yes, yes!

559
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:43,942
The center is a bit too much…

560
00:37:43,943 --> 00:37:45,443
You finally came?

561
00:37:46,234 --> 00:37:47,818
Want some water?

562
00:37:52,484 --> 00:37:54,442
This is getting out of hand,
what do we do?

563
00:37:54,443 --> 00:37:57,108
We'll pretend to go along,
and do our thing.

564
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,109
You two!

565
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,734
Stop chatting and do
what Sang-mi's doing.

566
00:38:02,443 --> 00:38:03,734
What's with her?

567
00:38:03,984 --> 00:38:05,483
Is she Jean-Claude Van Damme?

568
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:06,484
Want my help?

569
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:13,817
A university in Minnesota is
the birthplace of cheerleading.

570
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:15,567
Wow, Minnesota!

571
00:38:15,568 --> 00:38:17,483
That sounds so cool,
you all memorize that.

572
00:38:17,484 --> 00:38:21,442
Depending on moves,
it's divided into dance, cheer stunts

573
00:38:21,443 --> 00:38:24,692
and motion cheers.
Of these, we'll be doing

574
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:25,693
dance cheerleading.

575
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:27,318
Can't we mix all three?

576
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:28,943
Can we not do any of them?

577
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:33,568
Lift your chin, open shoulders.

578
00:38:33,693 --> 00:38:35,608
Five, six, seven, eight!

579
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:37,483
One, two, three, four,

580
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:39,358
five, six, seven, eight!

581
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,108
Two, two, three, four,

582
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:42,693
five, six, seven, eight!

583
00:38:42,984 --> 00:38:44,858
One, two, three, four,

584
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:46,443
five, six, seven, eight!

585
00:39:31,943 --> 00:39:33,109
Chu Pil-sun.

586
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:35,443
Chu Pil-sun!

587
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,233
Are you nuts?!

588
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:42,443
No weekends off, cheer up!

589
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:02,942
Look in the mirror! Mirror!

590
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:05,734
Mina, you're almost a cheerleader.

591
00:40:06,984 --> 00:40:09,318
What's with that look,
something wrong?

592
00:40:09,943 --> 00:40:11,234
Aren't we gonna dance?

593
00:40:11,568 --> 00:40:12,942
We gotta dance hip hop.

594
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:16,443
We will, but this is fun too.

595
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:20,234
Everyone, gather around!

596
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,193
What is it?

597
00:40:21,194 --> 00:40:22,817
Take a look! Come!

598
00:40:22,818 --> 00:40:24,567
What have you got there?

599
00:40:24,568 --> 00:40:25,943
Look, look!

600
00:40:26,568 --> 00:40:27,734
This is crazy!

601
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:29,233
Is there one in my size?

602
00:40:29,234 --> 00:40:30,483
I wear it baggy style.

603
00:40:30,484 --> 00:40:31,733
You don't wear this like that!

604
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:34,818
Let's run the routine
a few more times, there's no time.

605
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:37,484
We practiced enough, let's stop.

606
00:40:39,984 --> 00:40:42,233
We'll practice at least 10 times
to the music.

607
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:44,568
We won't make a mistake,
don't worry.

608
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:46,859
But I am worried.

609
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,068
If worrying makes worry
go away, no one would worry.

610
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:52,358
I can half-ass it
and still nail it.

611
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:54,192
Go with your mistakes.
That's dancing.

612
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:56,193
But you can't stand out
when cheerleading.

613
00:40:56,484 --> 00:40:59,484
If you mess up the choreography,
it'll cause harm to the team.

614
00:40:59,818 --> 00:41:02,693
I won't make a mistake,
wanna see it?

615
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,817
You're one thing,
but if others...

616
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:06,234
Everyone practiced a ton.

617
00:41:08,484 --> 00:41:10,817
Anyone making a mistake tomorrow?

618
00:41:10,818 --> 00:41:12,109
Raise your hands.

619
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,943
Pil-sun!

620
00:41:22,443 --> 00:41:24,484
Pil-sun!

621
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,567
That's Pil-sun?

622
00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:32,443
Why the hell do you care?

623
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:35,817
Are you two dating?

624
00:41:35,818 --> 00:41:36,942
Almost.

625
00:41:36,943 --> 00:41:38,817
I see, it's a crush.

626
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:41,817
You can't really put it that way,

627
00:41:41,818 --> 00:41:44,109
how can I describe us?

628
00:41:44,818 --> 00:41:47,818
We're BFF since kindergarten!

629
00:41:51,568 --> 00:41:53,693
Son of a bitch, I'll kill you…

630
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:54,859
Sorry.

631
00:41:57,609 --> 00:42:00,443
What's with him?
Did he block or get hit?

632
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:14,693
Dang it!

633
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:19,109
Win! Win!
Haegwang, win!

634
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:23,109
Win! Win!
Haegwang, win!

635
00:42:23,568 --> 00:42:27,609
Fight! Fight!
Haegwang, fight!

636
00:42:27,818 --> 00:42:30,109
Fight! Fight!
Haegwang, fight!

637
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:33,608
Our opponent is mighty Haegwang.
You know what that means.

638
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:34,609
I don't.

639
00:42:35,568 --> 00:42:36,818
It's okay to lose.

640
00:42:38,943 --> 00:42:40,858
All right, let's get down there.

641
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,693
No need to be nervous,
just do what you practiced.

642
00:42:44,193 --> 00:42:46,234
Chin up, open shoulders.

643
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:52,068
We scored!

644
00:44:07,484 --> 00:44:08,818
Are you hurt?

645
00:44:15,568 --> 00:44:18,234
What is it? Are you okay?

646
00:44:18,818 --> 00:44:20,108
Let's get you up.

647
00:44:20,109 --> 00:44:21,193
First…

648
00:44:21,818 --> 00:44:23,943
Girls, back to your position!

649
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:26,692
- This move!
- Don't stop, keep going!

650
00:44:26,693 --> 00:44:27,818
Girls!

651
00:45:03,693 --> 00:45:05,567
Check the work properly.

652
00:45:05,568 --> 00:45:07,484
Check it and strip the coating...

653
00:45:13,818 --> 00:45:15,484
Are you okay?

654
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:18,443
Yes… I'm okay…

655
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:23,692
It's raining, shouldn't you
get some rest?

656
00:45:23,693 --> 00:45:25,609
Today's the deadline,
what can I do?

657
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,734
You told us to keep the deadline.

658
00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:44,068
Welcome home.

659
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:45,984
Have some dinner.

660
00:45:48,568 --> 00:45:50,318
Don't use your finger-

661
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:54,609
Did something happen?

662
00:46:00,818 --> 00:46:03,693
Thanks for the cheerleading show.

663
00:46:04,443 --> 00:46:07,567
I didn't realize cheerleading
was so funny,

664
00:46:07,568 --> 00:46:09,693
until I saw your performance.

665
00:46:09,984 --> 00:46:12,942
Cheerleading will increase
players' athleticism, huh?

666
00:46:12,943 --> 00:46:17,108
If the next match is the same,
you won't get to use this room.

667
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:20,317
Pack up in advance,
I'm sure you'll bomb again.

668
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:22,359
I've had it!

669
00:46:22,818 --> 00:46:24,568
I'll smack you!

670
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:28,692
Why do you always barge in here
and poop all over us?!

671
00:46:28,693 --> 00:46:30,568
Does that make you feel better?

672
00:46:31,943 --> 00:46:34,943
Bonggu keeps pooping everywhere,

673
00:46:35,443 --> 00:46:36,818
and barks nonstop…

674
00:46:42,818 --> 00:46:45,568
What am I gonna do
with that dumb-ass?

675
00:46:48,943 --> 00:46:50,693
Bonggu!

676
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,984
You know I didn't say
all that to you, sorry.

677
00:46:55,609 --> 00:46:58,984
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

678
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:04,608
No way, it was our first show,
and the weather was crap.

679
00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:07,484
It's okay, we can do
really well next time.

680
00:47:08,443 --> 00:47:09,483
Let's all stop.

681
00:47:09,484 --> 00:47:10,942
Yeah, stop blaming ourselves...

682
00:47:10,943 --> 00:47:11,943
No, cheerleading.

683
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:14,109
Let's stop.

684
00:47:16,568 --> 00:47:19,358
What's with you,
we can do better next...

685
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:20,818
There is no next time.

686
00:47:21,943 --> 00:47:23,234
I'm done.

687
00:47:24,443 --> 00:47:25,359
Hey!

688
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,859
Why is there no next time?

689
00:47:28,818 --> 00:47:31,693
There is a next time
even without you.

690
00:47:34,234 --> 00:47:36,109
Do you honestly want to
do cheerleading?

691
00:47:36,693 --> 00:47:40,818
You used me to get
this practice room, no?

692
00:47:48,443 --> 00:47:49,609
Let her go.

693
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,943
She thinks we can't do
anything without her.

694
00:47:54,693 --> 00:47:55,734
We can't.

695
00:47:56,109 --> 00:47:57,858
We can't do it ourselves.

696
00:47:57,859 --> 00:47:59,192
There is no next time.

697
00:47:59,193 --> 00:48:00,193
Nope.

698
00:48:01,943 --> 00:48:03,567
Shouldn't we bring her back?

699
00:48:03,568 --> 00:48:04,608
Who?

700
00:48:04,609 --> 00:48:06,109
Se-hyun!

701
00:48:07,193 --> 00:48:09,192
The next match isn't far off.

702
00:48:09,193 --> 00:48:12,359
- Can't we just cheer with hip hop?
- Hip hop is harder for me.

703
00:48:14,984 --> 00:48:18,234
Do you girls want to
continue cheerleading?

704
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:22,318
Everyone has to be happy.

705
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:47,484
What's the next step?

706
00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:55,818
What's the next move?!

707
00:48:56,484 --> 00:48:57,443
My arm!

708
00:48:57,444 --> 00:48:59,568
Do I start wide open like this?!

709
00:48:59,818 --> 00:49:00,943
Huh?

710
00:49:01,568 --> 00:49:02,693
Like this?!

711
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:06,318
Kim Se-hyun!

712
00:49:09,693 --> 00:49:11,733
Is Kim Dong-hyun's sister
in this classroom?

713
00:49:11,734 --> 00:49:13,108
Raise your hand.

714
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:13,818
Me.

715
00:49:13,819 --> 00:49:15,859
You do look a bit like him.

716
00:49:16,443 --> 00:49:18,192
Make sure to take
good care of him.

717
00:49:18,193 --> 00:49:19,359
Okay.

718
00:49:19,484 --> 00:49:22,109
He's too much.

719
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:28,608
You're not in my class.

720
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:30,109
Who really cares about that.

721
00:49:30,818 --> 00:49:33,234
How long will you live
under your brother's shadow?

722
00:49:34,734 --> 00:49:37,443
Be known as cheerleader
Kim Se-hyun.

723
00:49:38,234 --> 00:49:40,109
Let's do it together.

724
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:42,943
Let's do it.

725
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:49,693
Giving up is for losers.

726
00:49:50,109 --> 00:49:53,109
If a move gets tangled,
that's dance too.

727
00:49:53,484 --> 00:49:55,484
So, what do we need?

728
00:49:56,484 --> 00:49:58,193
Performance experience.

729
00:49:59,443 --> 00:50:01,484
What's another thing we need?

730
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:05,984
Let me introduce you
to our new center.

731
00:50:06,484 --> 00:50:08,443
We got a new center?

732
00:50:11,943 --> 00:50:14,608
She begged me to take her back.

733
00:50:14,609 --> 00:50:16,693
On her knees.

734
00:50:23,484 --> 00:50:25,693
Welcome back, Se-hyun!

735
00:50:30,943 --> 00:50:33,317
Gramps, do you need
some cheering up?

736
00:50:33,318 --> 00:50:34,734
Investment club?

737
00:50:35,609 --> 00:50:37,942
I don't think that's appropriate…

738
00:50:37,943 --> 00:50:41,943
Market? Why do you need
cheering there?

739
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:44,317
We'll go, we'll go.

740
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:46,943
Yeah? It doesn't matter
if it's small.

741
00:50:53,568 --> 00:50:56,443
We'll be too distracted
to kick the ball.

742
00:50:57,443 --> 00:50:59,818
Don't mind them,
one of them is my sister.

743
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:01,317
Which one is it?

744
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:03,067
The one with sunglasses,

745
00:51:03,068 --> 00:51:06,193
dancing like she's having a seizure.

746
00:51:30,068 --> 00:51:32,068
What are these for?

747
00:51:32,484 --> 00:51:34,234
I have a plan.

748
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:42,443
What are they doing
in a hospital?

749
00:52:05,484 --> 00:52:07,443
Since it's a twist king…

750
00:52:09,818 --> 00:52:10,818
How's this?

751
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:12,693
- Like this!
- Okay.

752
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:22,693
Be careful!

753
00:52:22,943 --> 00:52:24,109
You're gonna fall off!

754
00:52:26,568 --> 00:52:27,568
Hey!

755
00:52:29,568 --> 00:52:31,234
Did she bump her head first?

756
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:32,818
So-hee?

757
00:52:51,818 --> 00:52:53,818
- Thank you for the meal.
- Please come again.

758
00:52:54,943 --> 00:52:57,818
I'm so tired, how many left?

759
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,442
One last venue,
it's Sangwoo Shipbuilding.

760
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:02,942
Sangwoo Shipbuilding?

761
00:53:02,943 --> 00:53:04,943
Daughters of Sangwoo,
will it be okay?

762
00:53:05,484 --> 00:53:07,984
I hear the mood is bad over there.

763
00:53:08,943 --> 00:53:11,442
Then we can lighten things up.

764
00:53:11,443 --> 00:53:12,609
Very good!

765
00:53:13,693 --> 00:53:14,817
Did you make this?

766
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:15,859
Of course.

767
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:20,234
Abolish extra hours
and weekend work!

768
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:23,234
Abolish! Abolish!

769
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:25,359
Let's warm up.

770
00:53:26,234 --> 00:53:28,942
I thought we were cheering
our fathers' work.

771
00:53:28,943 --> 00:53:30,943
Why? We can't cheer protests?

772
00:53:31,443 --> 00:53:32,443
So-hee!

773
00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:34,984
Dad!

774
00:53:34,985 --> 00:53:36,733
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

775
00:53:36,734 --> 00:53:38,567
- Who is he?
- So-hee's dad.

776
00:53:38,568 --> 00:53:40,109
What are you doing?

777
00:53:41,234 --> 00:53:43,443
Kids aren't allowed at the protest!

778
00:53:44,068 --> 00:53:45,483
Run back home, kiddo.

779
00:53:45,484 --> 00:53:46,484
But Dad…

780
00:53:46,943 --> 00:53:49,692
What's with you,
girls just want to dance.

781
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,568
- Sir, please step aside.
- You should step aside.

782
00:53:52,984 --> 00:53:55,359
She came to cheer you on.

783
00:54:29,693 --> 00:54:31,568
Very good!

784
00:54:32,818 --> 00:54:35,109
Whose daughters are they?

785
00:55:11,234 --> 00:55:12,943
I'm so jealous.

786
00:55:13,193 --> 00:55:14,943
Your daughter came to
cheer you on.

787
00:55:15,318 --> 00:55:16,818
She's so pretty!

788
00:55:17,193 --> 00:55:21,193
What's the point
if she's not book smart?

789
00:55:40,818 --> 00:55:44,318
For Millennium Girls!

790
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:49,609
Delicious!

791
00:55:53,693 --> 00:55:57,484
Why do you always
bring this puppy to school?

792
00:55:57,943 --> 00:56:00,442
I can't leave him alone
with grandpa at home.

793
00:56:00,443 --> 00:56:02,734
Why? Will he eat him?

794
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,109
Hey…

795
00:56:04,109 --> 00:56:05,109
What?

796
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:07,109
Yeah…

797
00:56:09,609 --> 00:56:12,858
By the way,
is the Harvard research real?

798
00:56:12,859 --> 00:56:14,234
It's a lie.

799
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:15,609
Seriously?

800
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:19,484
Crap, you fooled me good.

801
00:56:20,484 --> 00:56:23,442
How did you come up with that?

802
00:56:23,443 --> 00:56:25,068
- Chills…
- I…

803
00:56:25,693 --> 00:56:29,818
Made it up, but I think
it could really be true.

804
00:56:30,234 --> 00:56:31,858
You're so full of crap.

805
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:35,818
When we cheer,
everyone's eyes light up.

806
00:56:37,693 --> 00:56:42,193
And when I saw that,
my heart skipped a beat.

807
00:56:46,818 --> 00:56:48,734
I'm sure everyone felt that.

808
00:57:04,943 --> 00:57:05,943
Warning!

809
00:57:06,109 --> 00:57:06,943
What the heck?

810
00:57:06,944 --> 00:57:09,318
Don't even think about her.

811
00:57:09,984 --> 00:57:13,817
I've waited for over 10 years.

812
00:57:13,818 --> 00:57:16,567
If you didn't get her in 10 years,
you'll never get her.

813
00:57:16,568 --> 00:57:17,608
Could you move aside?

814
00:57:17,609 --> 00:57:18,734
I won't!

815
00:57:19,109 --> 00:57:21,443
I'm good at protecting
what is mine.

816
00:57:22,443 --> 00:57:24,068
Then try to stop me.

817
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:25,984
Go on, asshole.

818
00:57:41,984 --> 00:57:44,067
Behind by 1 in the first half is okay.

819
00:57:44,068 --> 00:57:46,358
We're up against the top 4 national...

820
00:57:46,359 --> 00:57:48,234
Why do you keep saying
it's okay to lose?

821
00:57:48,734 --> 00:57:50,443
Myungsung is not a big deal.

822
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,359
Right, not a big deal.

823
00:57:53,943 --> 00:57:57,483
But we're even less
of a deal, so it's okay to lose.

824
00:57:57,484 --> 00:57:59,943
I don't want to.
I'm going to win no matter what.

825
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,858
- I'm not saying you should,
- What an asshole…

826
00:58:01,859 --> 00:58:03,443
I'm saying it's okay to lose.

827
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:10,734
Beyongce, aren't you nervous?

828
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,068
I was, but I'm better now.

829
00:58:15,109 --> 00:58:16,109
You?

830
00:58:16,484 --> 00:58:19,484
To think that we'll do this for real,
I'm getting nervous.

831
00:58:19,693 --> 00:58:22,484
Listen up, kiddos.

832
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:25,067
Wanna know how to
calm your nerves?

833
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:26,483
Are you curious?

834
00:58:26,484 --> 00:58:27,818
Listen carefully.

835
00:58:28,943 --> 00:58:32,817
Right before the performance,
mouth these words 3 times:

836
00:58:32,818 --> 00:58:34,609
“Shit, shit, shit.”

837
00:58:37,443 --> 00:58:38,567
Kick out anxiety!

838
00:58:38,568 --> 00:58:41,567
Swear at the world
that is suppressing me.

839
00:58:41,568 --> 00:58:43,234
Really? You really do that?

840
00:58:43,943 --> 00:58:45,568
I don't do it anymore.

841
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,318
Shit, shit, shit…

842
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:13,943
Nice!

843
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,068
Nice!

844
01:00:16,568 --> 01:00:18,818
That's it! Geoje, let's go!

845
01:00:22,234 --> 01:00:24,943
Win the tournament?
That's nonsense.

846
01:00:25,984 --> 01:00:29,693
It's not entirely impossible,
the ball is round.

847
01:00:32,193 --> 01:00:33,818
Can't you level it properly?!

848
01:00:35,068 --> 01:00:37,443
People will think that
we won the tournament.

849
01:00:39,818 --> 01:00:41,568
- You do it.
- Pardon?

850
01:00:41,859 --> 01:00:44,483
You're a math teacher,
go level the banner.

851
01:00:44,484 --> 01:00:44,984
Okay.

852
01:00:44,985 --> 01:00:47,359
English, get down,
math is going up.

853
01:00:48,193 --> 01:00:49,943
Math will do it right.

854
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:52,608
- Later!
- Bye!

855
01:00:52,609 --> 01:00:53,859
Bye, Pil-sun!

856
01:00:58,443 --> 01:00:59,193
Pil-sun!

857
01:00:59,194 --> 01:01:00,568
Shit, you startled me.

858
01:01:01,234 --> 01:01:02,234
Hey.

859
01:01:02,943 --> 01:01:06,943
Today's MVP, Kim Dong-hyun.

860
01:01:07,818 --> 01:01:11,609
I repeated a year,
so we're the same age.

861
01:01:13,484 --> 01:01:14,693
Se-hyun left earlier.

862
01:01:15,443 --> 01:01:18,443
I wasn't waiting for her,
I waited for you.

863
01:01:21,859 --> 01:01:23,359
Why did you wait for me?

864
01:01:23,818 --> 01:01:25,234
In this dark alley, no less.

865
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:28,359
Did you…

866
01:01:30,443 --> 01:01:31,568
Want to fight me?

867
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:34,233
No, it's not like that.

868
01:01:34,234 --> 01:01:35,484
What is it then?

869
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:38,693
Got some free time
now that you won a game?

870
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,817
Pil-sun, I know you're busy...

871
01:01:40,818 --> 01:01:43,359
If you called me out
despite knowing that…

872
01:01:46,234 --> 01:01:47,234
…you must like me.

873
01:01:50,109 --> 01:01:51,818
Let me see you, come here.

874
01:01:55,568 --> 01:01:56,818
See what?

875
01:01:57,734 --> 01:01:59,109
Your face.

876
01:02:00,068 --> 01:02:01,443
I like handsome guys.

877
01:02:04,234 --> 01:02:05,818
I would say…

878
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:08,109
You pass.

879
01:02:22,568 --> 01:02:23,568
Nice!

880
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:29,943
- Good!
- Get in there!

881
01:03:44,693 --> 01:03:46,108
Have some more.

882
01:03:46,109 --> 01:03:48,318
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

883
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:23,817
Look straight.

884
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:26,692
Good, good, so pretty,
you all look great.

885
01:04:26,693 --> 01:04:27,609
Chin down.

886
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:29,818
One, two, three!

887
01:04:36,234 --> 01:04:39,818
He's uncomfortably shaky.

888
01:04:40,568 --> 01:04:42,317
Shouldn't he be relieved?

889
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:44,943
Relieved by whom?
I'm already tired as is.

890
01:04:47,109 --> 01:04:49,692
We've been at it
for 3 straight weekends.

891
01:04:49,693 --> 01:04:51,859
It'd be weird if he wasn't shaky.

892
01:04:52,943 --> 01:04:55,568
He said he gets re-energized
when he thinks about So-hee.

893
01:04:55,943 --> 01:04:58,234
What a load of crap.

894
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:03,567
What's going on?!

895
01:05:03,568 --> 01:05:04,733
Someone fell!

896
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,109
Jin-su!

897
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:08,818
Jin-su! Jin-su!

898
01:05:18,068 --> 01:05:19,068
What are you doing?

899
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,943
I want to show the girls.

900
01:05:21,443 --> 01:05:23,443
It's Se-hyun's old school.

901
01:05:25,234 --> 01:05:27,234
They're nothing special,
let's go.

902
01:05:27,818 --> 01:05:29,234
- What?
- Wait.

903
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:31,609
This is the start.

904
01:05:32,068 --> 01:05:33,109
Start?

905
01:05:53,234 --> 01:05:55,068
Can't we do jumps too?

906
01:05:57,443 --> 01:05:58,193
It's dangerous.

907
01:05:58,194 --> 01:06:00,692
Let's do it,
Yong-soon is strong.

908
01:06:00,693 --> 01:06:01,484
Yeah!

909
01:06:01,485 --> 01:06:03,233
No, we don't even have a flyer.

910
01:06:03,234 --> 01:06:06,108
We should just do it,
why is she being difficult?

911
01:06:06,109 --> 01:06:07,609
Yong-soon is really strong.

912
01:06:49,109 --> 01:06:50,484
Pil-sun.

913
01:07:01,568 --> 01:07:05,109
Shouldn't we stay for a while?

914
01:07:18,109 --> 01:07:19,234
What is it?

915
01:07:20,693 --> 01:07:22,068
So-hee…

916
01:07:29,193 --> 01:07:32,234
Hey, what's the matter?

917
01:07:32,818 --> 01:07:35,608
What's with you,
could you get down?!

918
01:07:35,609 --> 01:07:38,068
Are you nuts?
Get down from there!

919
01:07:39,693 --> 01:07:40,693
Get down?

920
01:07:40,694 --> 01:07:42,818
No, no! Stay right there!

921
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:54,193
I've always been an extra.

922
01:07:55,693 --> 01:08:01,443
But to dad,
I was always the star.

923
01:08:03,859 --> 01:08:08,443
Now, I'm a nobody.

924
01:08:09,193 --> 01:08:13,443
The end of the world
will be here soon,

925
01:08:13,693 --> 01:08:15,943
why are you in such a hurry?

926
01:08:19,568 --> 01:08:22,484
Have you been to
a G.O.D. concert?

927
01:08:26,943 --> 01:08:30,693
You love them, you gotta
see them before you die.

928
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:34,859
Don't you like Baskin Robbins?

929
01:08:35,234 --> 01:08:38,859
Have you tried the new flavor?
I heard it's a killer!

930
01:08:39,318 --> 01:08:41,568
You gotta try it
before you die, So-hee!

931
01:08:42,484 --> 01:08:44,483
Is it really that good?

932
01:08:44,484 --> 01:08:47,193
Being an extra
isn't for everyone.

933
01:08:47,443 --> 01:08:52,567
People love you so much that
they'll make excuses to be with you.

934
01:08:52,568 --> 01:08:54,443
- Right?
- She's right.

935
01:08:54,568 --> 01:08:58,068
So-hee, take my hand.

936
01:08:58,484 --> 01:09:01,943
You held my hands
when I was down.

937
01:09:03,234 --> 01:09:05,318
Here, take it.

938
01:09:08,109 --> 01:09:09,234
Take my hand.

939
01:09:17,234 --> 01:09:18,693
Dad…

940
01:09:19,318 --> 01:09:24,484
Always fed me the good stuff
because I'm so small and thin…

941
01:09:25,693 --> 01:09:29,818
He always told me
to be careful…

942
01:09:38,568 --> 01:09:40,693
Will she be okay?

943
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:42,484
She should be okay.

944
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:44,484
Let's all cheer up.

945
01:09:44,984 --> 01:09:45,984
Yeah.

946
01:09:48,109 --> 01:09:50,859
Se-hyun? Kim Se-hyun?

947
01:09:53,693 --> 01:09:55,359
Damn girl.

948
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:58,568
It's been a while.

949
01:10:00,234 --> 01:10:04,109
I heard you went to Geoje
and started a cheerleading club.

950
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:06,068
Yeah.

951
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:09,109
Say hello, they're my friends here.

952
01:10:09,484 --> 01:10:12,693
No need, I won't ever
see them again.

953
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:16,442
They're the girls
who spied on us earlier.

954
01:10:16,443 --> 01:10:21,109
But seeing you all like this,
I'm not worried at all.

955
01:10:22,193 --> 01:10:24,233
Let's go, they look pretty drunk.

956
01:10:24,234 --> 01:10:25,234
Yo.

957
01:10:26,109 --> 01:10:27,109
Who are you?

958
01:10:27,943 --> 01:10:29,234
Who am I?

959
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:33,068
Is there a need for an intro?
We won't ever see each other.

960
01:10:33,693 --> 01:10:35,693
What's up?
What's going on?

961
01:10:37,443 --> 01:10:39,734
You know her,
Kim Dong-hyun's sister.

962
01:10:39,984 --> 01:10:42,192
You're Dong-hyun's sister?

963
01:10:42,193 --> 01:10:46,359
She's got a name,
she's Kim Se-hyun.

964
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,608
You can't even remember
your old friend's name?

965
01:10:49,609 --> 01:10:51,443
If you weren't a chick.

966
01:10:51,484 --> 01:10:53,443
If you weren't a dude!

967
01:10:54,818 --> 01:10:55,693
She's cute.

968
01:10:55,693 --> 01:10:56,693
Hey!

969
01:10:59,443 --> 01:11:00,443
What's going on?

970
01:11:00,444 --> 01:11:02,983
Shit, look who it is.

971
01:11:02,984 --> 01:11:06,067
The ball licker who got
pushed down to Geoje.

972
01:11:06,068 --> 01:11:09,568
Shouldn't you be fishing here
instead of kicking balls?

973
01:11:09,859 --> 01:11:10,943
Shit…

974
01:11:13,818 --> 01:11:15,734
Jesus…

975
01:11:16,443 --> 01:11:19,109
Being a striker,
your punch feels weak!

976
01:11:21,984 --> 01:11:23,442
Didn't I say I'm
a taekwondo black belt?

977
01:11:23,443 --> 01:11:24,568
How dare you!

978
01:11:24,984 --> 01:11:26,193
You city hicks!

979
01:11:26,818 --> 01:11:27,984
Let go of me!

980
01:11:28,359 --> 01:11:29,609
Stop it, bastard!

981
01:11:30,234 --> 01:11:32,568
Let's just talk!

982
01:11:34,234 --> 01:11:36,193
Who do you think you are?!

983
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:40,443
Let go of me!
I told you let me go!

984
01:11:44,443 --> 01:11:45,443
Pil-sun!

985
01:12:08,234 --> 01:12:10,318
What? You know taekwondo
or something?

986
01:12:11,693 --> 01:12:12,943
Let's talk about this!

987
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:20,734
So cool…

988
01:12:21,568 --> 01:12:23,109
You're the alpha now.

989
01:12:26,484 --> 01:12:28,109
What do we do with him?

990
01:12:28,359 --> 01:12:29,359
Up.

991
01:12:29,484 --> 01:12:30,484
What's up?

992
01:12:32,109 --> 01:12:34,318
F'ed up, it's broken.

993
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:42,942
Show me.

994
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:44,317
Show you what?

995
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,068
Let me get a quick look.

996
01:12:52,734 --> 01:12:54,983
The father of the goalkeeper

997
01:12:54,984 --> 01:12:57,568
is the chairman of Hyundae High.

998
01:12:58,109 --> 01:13:03,234
The father of the broken nose boy
is a VP of Sangwoo HQ in Seoul.

999
01:13:05,109 --> 01:13:09,233
Boys, you didn't fight,
but tried to break it up, right?

1000
01:13:09,234 --> 01:13:10,858
Dong-hyun, answer me.

1001
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:12,693
He passed out,
he probably doesn't remember.

1002
01:13:12,943 --> 01:13:14,443
Then get up and get out of here.

1003
01:13:15,734 --> 01:13:17,234
Get up, moron!

1004
01:13:18,818 --> 01:13:20,734
Chi-hyung, you didn't
hit any of them, right?

1005
01:13:20,984 --> 01:13:22,692
Those pricks were drunk!

1006
01:13:22,693 --> 01:13:24,233
Shut up and go!

1007
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:25,234
I won't leave!

1008
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:26,818
You think this is a joke?!

1009
01:13:27,818 --> 01:13:28,568
Get out of here!

1010
01:13:28,569 --> 01:13:29,734
I'm serious!

1011
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:32,483
My feet are asleep…

1012
01:13:32,484 --> 01:13:33,484
Come on!

1013
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:35,693
Dong-hyun,

1014
01:13:35,694 --> 01:13:36,943
get out of here.

1015
01:13:37,484 --> 01:13:38,734
Back to class, now!

1016
01:13:45,443 --> 01:13:47,234
I've had it with you all.

1017
01:13:47,984 --> 01:13:49,318
Christ…

1018
01:13:54,818 --> 01:13:58,734
What have you taught them in class
for them to get into fights?

1019
01:14:01,318 --> 01:14:03,443
I'm Hyundae High's
Dean Kim Ki-dong.

1020
01:14:03,859 --> 01:14:05,193
Are they the ones?

1021
01:14:06,193 --> 01:14:08,443
You girls have no fear.

1022
01:14:08,568 --> 01:14:10,608
You'll all get expelled!

1023
01:14:10,609 --> 01:14:13,318
You have no authority to expel them!

1024
01:14:13,544 --> 01:14:15,460
Have you not seen my boys?

1025
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:18,585
One of them got a broken nose and…

1026
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:21,412
They're not only good athletes
but very studious too.

1027
01:14:21,437 --> 01:14:22,812
My students are kind,

1028
01:14:25,443 --> 01:14:26,484
and…

1029
01:14:26,984 --> 01:14:28,358
Dance well too.

1030
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:30,109
Really? Dance?

1031
01:14:31,859 --> 01:14:34,858
They sure look like
they only dance.

1032
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:38,109
How much longer
must I endure this rudeness?!

1033
01:14:38,568 --> 01:14:40,068
Principal…

1034
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:49,484
Good afternoon.

1035
01:14:50,318 --> 01:14:52,859
We're their fathers.

1036
01:14:53,318 --> 01:14:55,567
Exceptional job on
educating your kids.

1037
01:14:55,568 --> 01:14:56,648
- I'm sorry.
- My apologies.

1038
01:15:00,693 --> 01:15:02,692
Sangwoo Shipbuilding?

1039
01:15:02,693 --> 01:15:03,693
Yes.

1040
01:15:04,818 --> 01:15:06,108
Did you know,

1041
01:15:06,109 --> 01:15:10,568
the father of the broken nose boy
is a Sangwoo VP?

1042
01:15:11,568 --> 01:15:13,484
Oh dear, I'm so sorry…

1043
01:15:14,318 --> 01:15:16,359
Please forgive us just once.

1044
01:15:17,318 --> 01:15:18,693
Let go of my hand.

1045
01:15:21,234 --> 01:15:23,818
Which one messed up
Jin-tak's nose?

1046
01:15:25,109 --> 01:15:26,109
You?

1047
01:15:27,068 --> 01:15:28,818
Or you?

1048
01:15:29,693 --> 01:15:34,068
I'll make absolutely sure
this doesn't happen again.

1049
01:15:34,693 --> 01:15:36,943
What is your name
and department.

1050
01:15:37,484 --> 01:15:41,484
Let's see if the daughter
gets expelled or the father fired.

1051
01:15:46,109 --> 01:15:49,484
Please subdue your anger…

1052
01:15:52,818 --> 01:15:53,818
I'm really sorry.

1053
01:15:55,734 --> 01:15:56,734
I did it!

1054
01:15:57,984 --> 01:15:59,733
I've had it with this crap.

1055
01:15:59,734 --> 01:16:02,443
I busted that boy's nose,
are you happy?

1056
01:16:02,609 --> 01:16:04,317
I just have to give up school, right?

1057
01:16:04,318 --> 01:16:05,484
Hey!

1058
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:16,818
Chu Pil-sun!

1059
01:16:17,609 --> 01:16:18,734
Pil-sun!

1060
01:16:19,693 --> 01:16:20,734
Stop!

1061
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:24,818
Did you start cheerleading
to cause trouble?

1062
01:16:25,193 --> 01:16:27,858
What will you become?

1063
01:16:27,859 --> 01:16:29,443
How should I know?!

1064
01:16:30,068 --> 01:16:32,943
But I won't live cowardly
like you, dad!

1065
01:16:36,818 --> 01:16:39,818
Go on! Hit me!

1066
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:43,193
You couldn't even
raise your voice inside.

1067
01:16:43,693 --> 01:16:48,068
Does this world look
so easy to you?

1068
01:16:48,443 --> 01:16:49,484
Is it so easy?

1069
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:52,693
Is the world so tough for you?

1070
01:16:59,109 --> 01:17:01,442
Yeah, it is tough…

1071
01:17:01,443 --> 01:17:02,818
For me…

1072
01:17:30,443 --> 01:17:31,817
One ticket to Seoul.

1073
01:17:31,818 --> 01:17:33,609
Yes, one ticket to Seoul.

1074
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:37,359
Here's your change.

1075
01:17:40,943 --> 01:17:42,568
Did you get your ticket?

1076
01:17:44,484 --> 01:17:46,733
Why did you come here?
I'm not a kid.

1077
01:17:46,734 --> 01:17:50,068
But you're a friend,
I got plenty of kids at home.

1078
01:17:51,693 --> 01:17:52,818
Did you have dinner?

1079
01:17:53,484 --> 01:17:54,608
I'm starting a diet today.

1080
01:17:54,609 --> 01:17:59,318
Gosh, Pil-sun is already
sounding like a Seoul citizen.

1081
01:18:00,318 --> 01:18:02,318
Did you call Dong-hyun?

1082
01:18:03,109 --> 01:18:04,608
I told him not to come.

1083
01:18:04,609 --> 01:18:08,443
What a spineless punk,
this is all his fault.

1084
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,609
Dang it…

1085
01:18:21,068 --> 01:18:22,568
Here, wear this.

1086
01:18:23,943 --> 01:18:26,443
I got plenty.

1087
01:18:32,943 --> 01:18:35,693
Use these to order
food with the girls,

1088
01:18:36,943 --> 01:18:40,193
and take care of So-hee.

1089
01:18:40,609 --> 01:18:41,818
Take care of yourself.

1090
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:45,567
Don't starve just for the diet,

1091
01:18:45,568 --> 01:18:50,318
and don't lose the Geoje dialect
because you're in Seoul.

1092
01:18:51,318 --> 01:18:53,068
Don't forget me too.

1093
01:18:57,734 --> 01:19:00,358
What's that?
Are you crying?

1094
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:02,818
Why should I cry?
What's with you?

1095
01:19:03,484 --> 01:19:04,692
- Rad Mina!
- What?

1096
01:19:04,693 --> 01:19:07,234
- Give me a hug.
- Stop that!

1097
01:19:13,443 --> 01:19:14,443
Pil-sun.

1098
01:19:16,984 --> 01:19:19,109
When I was by your side,

1099
01:19:20,109 --> 01:19:23,568
I felt good being
your supporting cast.

1100
01:19:30,943 --> 01:19:35,609
Mina, you're top billing
no matter what.

1101
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:38,568
We're both top billings.

1102
01:19:44,818 --> 01:19:47,234
I'll wait for you in Seoul,
join me soon.

1103
01:19:58,193 --> 01:19:59,484
Pil-sun!

1104
01:20:18,859 --> 01:20:21,193
Oh my god, so embarrassing.

1105
01:20:22,068 --> 01:20:23,484
Miss?

1106
01:20:36,984 --> 01:20:38,068
No…

1107
01:20:39,484 --> 01:20:40,568
No way…

1108
01:20:46,234 --> 01:20:47,443
Pil-sun!

1109
01:20:49,318 --> 01:20:51,109
I love you so much!

1110
01:20:51,693 --> 01:20:53,984
That moron…

1111
01:21:31,484 --> 01:21:33,608
Even tteokbokki
is delicious in Seoul.

1112
01:21:33,609 --> 01:21:35,109
You just came up with no plan?

1113
01:21:35,859 --> 01:21:38,984
I was always ready to come up.

1114
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,317
- Take it.
- What is it?

1115
01:21:47,318 --> 01:21:48,609
The audition song for our team.

1116
01:21:51,234 --> 01:21:53,483
I wasn't trying to
pressure you or anything.

1117
01:21:53,484 --> 01:21:55,568
This is the extent of my help.

1118
01:21:55,943 --> 01:21:57,109
The rest is up to you.

1119
01:22:21,818 --> 01:22:25,109
Let's call it a day!

1120
01:22:25,484 --> 01:22:29,233
I've been ordered to
get a list of your names!

1121
01:22:29,234 --> 01:22:32,609
Sir, even if you can't lend a hand,
must you do this to us?

1122
01:22:32,818 --> 01:22:35,818
I'm really worried about you all.

1123
01:22:36,443 --> 01:22:40,817
You should all think about
your family at home!

1124
01:22:40,818 --> 01:22:42,568
Did you say “family”?

1125
01:22:43,568 --> 01:22:45,734
Where were you
when Jin-su was killed?

1126
01:22:46,609 --> 01:22:48,317
You said we're family too!

1127
01:22:48,318 --> 01:22:49,318
One family!

1128
01:22:50,943 --> 01:22:55,193
We're all mourning
for Jin-su's tragedy!

1129
01:22:56,234 --> 01:22:58,484
The living must continue to live...

1130
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:02,234
You know what?

1131
01:23:02,693 --> 01:23:07,233
His family won't get workers' comp
because he drank the night before!

1132
01:23:07,234 --> 01:23:09,234
This is what you call family?!

1133
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:12,484
Must the living keep on living?!

1134
01:23:17,609 --> 01:23:19,693
Didn't I ask you to bring me a list?

1135
01:23:20,609 --> 01:23:23,817
What will you do with it?

1136
01:23:23,818 --> 01:23:26,443
Must I report to you now?

1137
01:23:28,818 --> 01:23:30,317
They're all like family.

1138
01:23:30,318 --> 01:23:33,484
Don't give me that bullshit
and get me that list.

1139
01:23:35,234 --> 01:23:36,693
What will I do with it?

1140
01:23:37,109 --> 01:23:40,108
I'll come up with an excuse
to fire every one of them, happy?

1141
01:23:40,109 --> 01:23:42,859
Hyung-woo, come on now…

1142
01:23:44,318 --> 01:23:45,734
Just stop it.

1143
01:23:46,693 --> 01:23:48,234
You're from here too.

1144
01:23:49,609 --> 01:23:51,109
Mr. Chu Woo-yong.

1145
01:23:52,693 --> 01:23:56,568
Don't talk back unless
you want to be disciplined.

1146
01:24:05,693 --> 01:24:07,109
Chu Pil-sun!

1147
01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:17,568
She's from Geoje?

1148
01:24:18,068 --> 01:24:19,359
You may begin.

1149
01:24:23,109 --> 01:24:26,818
You keep doing this,
mid-fielders should do this.

1150
01:24:30,068 --> 01:24:31,443
Yo, Kim Dong-hyun.

1151
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:33,692
I'm dropping my pride
to ask you this.

1152
01:24:33,693 --> 01:24:34,859
Answer me straight up.

1153
01:24:35,234 --> 01:24:36,442
Are you in touch with Pil-sun?

1154
01:24:36,443 --> 01:24:38,233
The match is soon,
focus on the practice.

1155
01:24:38,234 --> 01:24:39,693
You son of a bitch!

1156
01:24:40,943 --> 01:24:42,818
It's all your fault, dammit!

1157
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:44,193
It's your fault!

1158
01:24:44,194 --> 01:24:45,818
I can't reach her either!

1159
01:24:46,359 --> 01:24:47,568
Shit…

1160
01:24:54,068 --> 01:24:56,858
Hey! Where are you going?!

1161
01:24:56,859 --> 01:24:58,484
I'm quitting soccer!

1162
01:25:25,234 --> 01:25:26,568
Did you have dinner?

1163
01:25:37,943 --> 01:25:39,818
Stop looking at that
and let's practice.

1164
01:25:40,193 --> 01:25:41,567
We'll start a new routine.

1165
01:25:41,568 --> 01:25:44,358
Instead of a new routine,
can't we do a cheer stunt?

1166
01:25:44,359 --> 01:25:45,359
We can't.

1167
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,817
We can do it!

1168
01:25:46,818 --> 01:25:48,359
She said we can't.

1169
01:25:48,693 --> 01:25:50,193
Nothing's impossible.

1170
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:53,192
What if one of us get hurt?!

1171
01:25:53,193 --> 01:25:54,484
We won't!

1172
01:25:58,359 --> 01:26:00,193
We'll start the new routine,

1173
01:26:00,609 --> 01:26:03,068
so, let's stay 30 extra minutes
starting tomorrow.

1174
01:26:03,984 --> 01:26:07,234
I have to fix dinners
for my sisters, so I can't.

1175
01:26:08,693 --> 01:26:11,983
I got internship interview
prep starting next week.

1176
01:26:11,984 --> 01:26:13,484
All right, all right.

1177
01:26:14,859 --> 01:26:18,817
Forget the extra practice,
but you cannot be late.

1178
01:26:18,818 --> 01:26:20,442
You'll have to pay
extra late penalty.

1179
01:26:20,443 --> 01:26:21,817
Students have no money.

1180
01:26:21,818 --> 01:26:24,983
Why are you picking fights?
Don't be late then.

1181
01:26:24,984 --> 01:26:29,043
You think you're all that?
Wanna hit me too?

1182
01:26:29,068 --> 01:26:30,568
- Hey!
- Take it easy…

1183
01:26:30,943 --> 01:26:32,984
What are you all doing?

1184
01:26:36,443 --> 01:26:38,818
Give them a break,
they're just tired.

1185
01:26:39,318 --> 01:26:40,943
You think I'm not?

1186
01:26:42,484 --> 01:26:43,484
Hey…

1187
01:27:04,943 --> 01:27:08,568
Ma'am, can't we look front
at the end too?

1188
01:27:09,109 --> 01:27:12,693
Good suggestion but that'd
put less emphasis on the singer.

1189
01:27:13,943 --> 01:27:16,692
We dance in the back...

1190
01:27:16,693 --> 01:27:19,359
Why are we in the back,
aren't we dancing together?

1191
01:27:21,443 --> 01:27:22,443
Yes, right.

1192
01:27:23,443 --> 01:27:24,443
I'll think about it.

1193
01:27:25,068 --> 01:27:26,108
How about her?

1194
01:27:26,109 --> 01:27:27,484
Pil-sun?

1195
01:27:28,943 --> 01:27:30,193
She's gonna go far.

1196
01:27:30,443 --> 01:27:32,568
- Right?
- She gets the attention.

1197
01:27:43,943 --> 01:27:45,692
Why did you come here for?

1198
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:47,818
I didn't come here
to bring you back.

1199
01:27:48,568 --> 01:27:51,693
Your dad wanted me
to give you this.

1200
01:27:52,318 --> 01:27:52,984
What is it?

1201
01:27:52,985 --> 01:27:55,818
It's kimchi,
the radish one you like.

1202
01:27:57,984 --> 01:27:59,818
He could've sent a parcel.

1203
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:01,859
Did you have an audition?

1204
01:28:02,734 --> 01:28:03,734
I passed.

1205
01:28:04,109 --> 01:28:05,234
Is that so?

1206
01:28:06,484 --> 01:28:07,484
Congrats.

1207
01:28:07,859 --> 01:28:10,234
Didn't you have the match today?

1208
01:28:10,943 --> 01:28:12,568
I quit soccer.

1209
01:28:13,818 --> 01:28:15,483
Then what will you do?

1210
01:28:15,484 --> 01:28:19,693
My dream is always to become
a shipbuilder.

1211
01:28:19,943 --> 01:28:22,193
Then you should've studied,
why did you play soccer?

1212
01:28:22,568 --> 01:28:25,484
I wanted to make dope memories
during my school years.

1213
01:28:26,193 --> 01:28:28,484
Then you should've become
a dope striker.

1214
01:28:29,818 --> 01:28:35,109
The last line of defense suits me
more than front line attacker.

1215
01:28:37,609 --> 01:28:40,193
You're a natural born attacker.

1216
01:28:40,734 --> 01:28:46,609
Go on the TV as a backup dancer,
and do everything you ever wanted.

1217
01:28:47,734 --> 01:28:52,859
And when you're tired,
come back to Geoje anytime.

1218
01:28:54,234 --> 01:29:00,693
I'll always protect the goal
from the last line of defense there.

1219
01:29:01,568 --> 01:29:02,609
Got it?

1220
01:29:07,818 --> 01:29:09,484
The subway isn't that way.

1221
01:29:18,734 --> 01:29:20,108
Practice going well?

1222
01:29:20,109 --> 01:29:21,109
Yes.

1223
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:22,858
What are you all eating?

1224
01:29:22,859 --> 01:29:24,234
Pizza and soft drinks…

1225
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:29,068
I got good news and bad news,

1226
01:29:29,359 --> 01:29:34,443
the bad news is, our girl group
FOREVER, which will debut soon,

1227
01:29:34,609 --> 01:29:37,484
one of the members decided
to quit for personal reasons.

1228
01:29:37,693 --> 01:29:42,567
And we'll be selecting one of you
as her replacement.

1229
01:29:42,568 --> 01:29:44,233
As a member of FOREVER.

1230
01:29:44,234 --> 01:29:46,692
The boss will oversee a test
in two days,

1231
01:29:46,693 --> 01:29:51,192
you'll never get a chance
like this again, so prep well.

1232
01:29:51,193 --> 01:29:52,484
- Bye.
- Good luck!

1233
01:29:58,193 --> 01:29:59,568
A call at this hour?

1234
01:30:03,234 --> 01:30:04,692
Mina Chinese.

1235
01:30:04,693 --> 01:30:06,942
Can you deliver
a bowl of black bean noodles?

1236
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:08,109
Pil-sun!

1237
01:30:08,443 --> 01:30:09,817
Rad Mina!

1238
01:30:09,818 --> 01:30:12,443
You already have the Seoul accent!

1239
01:30:13,193 --> 01:30:16,193
Don't joke around,
I'm not gonna lose my dialect.

1240
01:30:16,484 --> 01:30:19,568
Yeah, who cares
if backup dancers got dialects.

1241
01:30:20,443 --> 01:30:21,858
Who the heck knows,

1242
01:30:21,859 --> 01:30:23,567
maybe they'll toss me
in a girl group.

1243
01:30:23,568 --> 01:30:26,193
Am I getting a celeb friend?

1244
01:30:26,609 --> 01:30:27,693
Stop it.

1245
01:30:28,318 --> 01:30:29,483
How are you eating?

1246
01:30:29,484 --> 01:30:31,234
You've never seen me skip food.

1247
01:30:31,609 --> 01:30:33,233
How are the girls?

1248
01:30:33,234 --> 01:30:34,984
How did the semifinal go?

1249
01:30:36,859 --> 01:30:40,484
We lost, because we didn't perform.

1250
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:43,234
Why? Was someone hurt?

1251
01:30:45,859 --> 01:30:48,193
I don't think
we'll perform anymore.

1252
01:30:49,443 --> 01:30:50,483
What are you saying?

1253
01:30:50,484 --> 01:30:52,193
You don't need to
worry about that.

1254
01:30:52,484 --> 01:30:54,859
Do your thing and show up
on the TV, got that?

1255
01:30:56,109 --> 01:31:00,359
You know you're our pride.

1256
01:31:01,943 --> 01:31:04,984
Long distance calls are expensive,
I'm gonna hang up.

1257
01:33:18,984 --> 01:33:21,943
Yeon-woo, I'm going to
skip the test tomorrow.

1258
01:33:23,109 --> 01:33:25,693
I only cared about me
and didn't finish something.

1259
01:33:26,068 --> 01:33:27,068
What's that?

1260
01:33:27,109 --> 01:33:29,484
The last match of the 20th Century.

1261
01:33:29,943 --> 01:33:33,483
And my dream isn't to become
a girl group, but a dancer.

1262
01:33:33,484 --> 01:33:36,233
A chance like this
will never come around!

1263
01:33:36,234 --> 01:33:39,109
How could it not,
it's me we're talking about.

1264
01:33:42,109 --> 01:33:43,359
Good luck!

1265
01:35:20,734 --> 01:35:22,818
Aren't you going to ask
what happened?

1266
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:24,484
I'm glad you're back.

1267
01:35:27,568 --> 01:35:31,359
I didn't come back
because I failed the audition.

1268
01:35:32,984 --> 01:35:38,484
You gotta cut something if you
draw the sword, but there's nothing.

1269
01:35:39,568 --> 01:35:41,734
I thought coming back
required courage too.

1270
01:35:45,984 --> 01:35:49,109
But I don't regret going to Seoul.

1271
01:35:49,484 --> 01:35:50,734
It was amazing.

1272
01:35:52,443 --> 01:35:54,733
Do you even know
what that feels like?

1273
01:35:54,734 --> 01:35:57,359
It's always work, home,
work, home for you…

1274
01:35:59,734 --> 01:36:00,818
I do.

1275
01:36:04,068 --> 01:36:07,568
It felt so good that time,
when you were born.

1276
01:36:10,693 --> 01:36:12,442
That's ancient history.

1277
01:36:12,443 --> 01:36:14,443
I was so happy that

1278
01:36:15,484 --> 01:36:18,234
I held parties for days.

1279
01:36:21,068 --> 01:36:26,443
When you were this big,
I would come home from work,

1280
01:36:26,734 --> 01:36:28,943
and you couldn't walk properly,

1281
01:36:29,443 --> 01:36:33,109
but you'd run and hug me.

1282
01:36:34,484 --> 01:36:36,693
I was so happy.

1283
01:36:39,484 --> 01:36:40,984
Don't tell me old stories.

1284
01:36:41,484 --> 01:36:47,484
It may sound corny to you,
I only remember the happy stuff.

1285
01:36:49,318 --> 01:36:50,568
Don't.

1286
01:36:51,693 --> 01:36:55,193
But I can't recollect
those memories clearly.

1287
01:36:58,443 --> 01:37:03,318
I thought I could retain
my happiness by working hard…

1288
01:37:05,109 --> 01:37:06,734
Stop it, Dad.

1289
01:37:07,568 --> 01:37:12,943
But I just don't know
what I did wrong.

1290
01:37:22,234 --> 01:37:25,609
What happened to your face?
Did you get into a fight?

1291
01:37:31,109 --> 01:37:32,234
Sweetie.

1292
01:37:33,109 --> 01:37:38,068
No matter what,
I'll always cheer you on.

1293
01:37:40,693 --> 01:37:42,109
For your life.

1294
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:48,443
I've always done that,
and always will.

1295
01:37:50,609 --> 01:37:54,484
I'm always on your side too.

1296
01:38:00,443 --> 01:38:03,109
Why are you making me cry
at the dinner table?

1297
01:38:04,068 --> 01:38:05,484
Stop it.

1298
01:38:05,818 --> 01:38:08,609
I'm not eating,
I lost my appetite.

1299
01:38:14,318 --> 01:38:15,568
Want some more?

1300
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:22,109
Yeah.

1301
01:38:35,568 --> 01:38:40,109
Adhere to working hours
and guarantee holidays!

1302
01:38:41,234 --> 01:38:43,818
If you got an extra,
let me have one.

1303
01:38:44,734 --> 01:38:45,818
Mr. Chu!

1304
01:38:58,693 --> 01:39:03,233
Abolish extra hours
and weekend labor!

1305
01:39:03,234 --> 01:39:06,608
Abolish! Abolish!

1306
01:39:06,609 --> 01:39:11,108
Adhere to working hours
and guarantee holidays!

1307
01:39:11,109 --> 01:39:14,442
Guarantee! Guarantee!

1308
01:39:14,443 --> 01:39:18,817
Abolish extra hours
and weekend labor!

1309
01:39:18,818 --> 01:39:21,693
Abolish! Abolish!

1310
01:39:22,943 --> 01:39:24,818
Principal, when was your prime?

1311
01:39:28,693 --> 01:39:30,109
What're you talking about?

1312
01:39:30,443 --> 01:39:32,568
Mine is now.

1313
01:39:32,818 --> 01:39:34,317
I want to do cheerleading!

1314
01:39:34,318 --> 01:39:35,318
Did you think

1315
01:39:35,319 --> 01:39:38,318
school is a place where
you can leave and come back

1316
01:39:39,109 --> 01:39:40,568
whenever you want to?

1317
01:39:43,734 --> 01:39:46,693
School isn't a place
you can give up so easily.

1318
01:39:49,318 --> 01:39:49,818
What?

1319
01:39:49,819 --> 01:39:52,984
Why would I kick you out?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1320
01:39:54,609 --> 01:39:59,068
You've been skipping school,
not expelled,

1321
01:39:59,484 --> 01:40:01,733
so don't ever skip school again.

1322
01:40:01,734 --> 01:40:04,109
Principal, I love you!

1323
01:40:04,443 --> 01:40:08,943
I don't love you,
we lost a match because of you.

1324
01:40:09,234 --> 01:40:11,233
Our athleticism dropped by 50%.

1325
01:40:11,234 --> 01:40:13,234
But it's not over yet.

1326
01:40:14,359 --> 01:40:15,943
The match for 3rd place.

1327
01:40:16,984 --> 01:40:20,859
I believe the opponent
is Hyundae High…

1328
01:40:21,693 --> 01:40:25,109
We may have lost
the semifinal…

1329
01:40:46,859 --> 01:40:48,359
How was Seoul?

1330
01:40:49,734 --> 01:40:51,318
Seoul…

1331
01:40:52,359 --> 01:40:53,568
Was cool.

1332
01:40:54,068 --> 01:40:55,568
It was cold, huh?

1333
01:40:56,568 --> 01:41:00,943
Welcome back to steamy Geoje,
Chu Pil-sun.

1334
01:41:04,443 --> 01:41:06,568
Not practicing for
the Hyundae match?

1335
01:41:07,859 --> 01:41:08,859
Pil-sun!

1336
01:41:14,443 --> 01:41:15,859
Hey, don't run!

1337
01:41:18,443 --> 01:41:20,109
- See ya!
- Bye!

1338
01:41:26,943 --> 01:41:28,442
Why is he barking so much?

1339
01:41:28,443 --> 01:41:30,484
I'll go take a look.

1340
01:41:46,484 --> 01:41:49,108
No whitener in mine?

1341
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:50,109
No.

1342
01:41:51,568 --> 01:41:53,443
Who are you?

1343
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:57,068
Let's go!

1344
01:42:01,818 --> 01:42:04,443
Who are you all?

1345
01:42:07,693 --> 01:42:11,108
Soon-jung is a very studious
student at my school.

1346
01:42:11,109 --> 01:42:13,192
So, who are you?

1347
01:42:13,193 --> 01:42:15,818
So, make your own damn coffee!

1348
01:42:16,693 --> 01:42:17,693
Yo!

1349
01:42:17,818 --> 01:42:19,443
Where is Se-hyun?

1350
01:42:21,568 --> 01:42:23,318
What's our leader doing here?

1351
01:43:15,568 --> 01:43:16,443
Move.

1352
01:43:16,444 --> 01:43:18,109
Are you really giving up soccer?

1353
01:43:18,443 --> 01:43:21,484
A man sticks to his word,
I said I quit.

1354
01:43:25,234 --> 01:43:26,734
Do you know who
our next opponent is?

1355
01:43:27,193 --> 01:43:28,359
It's Hyundae High.

1356
01:43:36,734 --> 01:43:42,067
When you get a pass
in the offensive zone, you pause.

1357
01:43:42,068 --> 01:43:44,567
Don't do that and just kick.

1358
01:43:44,568 --> 01:43:46,943
That's harder
for goalkeepers to block.

1359
01:43:50,859 --> 01:43:54,484
Hey! Pil-sun came back
to cheer us on.

1360
01:44:00,443 --> 01:44:03,358
The match is soon,
practice harder!

1361
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:05,818
You're back!

1362
01:44:09,193 --> 01:44:12,609
So-hee improved so much,
she's soaking it up.

1363
01:44:13,734 --> 01:44:15,859
She practiced hard
to fill your spot.

1364
01:44:16,109 --> 01:44:17,608
She's not that good yet.

1365
01:44:17,609 --> 01:44:18,609
Wait a minute.

1366
01:44:18,818 --> 01:44:21,318
You said it's crucial
for a flyer to be light.

1367
01:44:21,734 --> 01:44:22,943
Right?

1368
01:44:43,943 --> 01:44:46,318
Geoje High! Let's win!

1369
01:44:50,943 --> 01:44:52,318
Sir, here's your water.

1370
01:44:52,943 --> 01:44:54,193
Here's your water, sir.

1371
01:45:01,568 --> 01:45:05,692
They won the Blue Dragon Cup,
and 2nd place in the nationals.

1372
01:45:05,693 --> 01:45:08,943
As I've always said,
it's okay to lose.

1373
01:45:12,359 --> 01:45:13,943
But today, of all days,

1374
01:45:15,484 --> 01:45:16,484
you can win.

1375
01:45:18,943 --> 01:45:19,983
Are you confident?

1376
01:45:19,984 --> 01:45:21,359
Of course we are!

1377
01:45:22,818 --> 01:45:23,484
Let's go!

1378
01:45:23,485 --> 01:45:25,443
- Let's go!
- Go!

1379
01:45:34,068 --> 01:45:35,109
Okay!

1380
01:45:45,318 --> 01:45:47,692
I won't just cheer for our team,

1381
01:45:47,693 --> 01:45:49,818
but mom, who's having
a tough go.

1382
01:45:49,984 --> 01:45:52,483
Dad too, I'm gonna
cheer for him too.

1383
01:45:52,484 --> 01:45:54,733
I'll cheer for the chicken shops
in all of Korea!

1384
01:45:54,734 --> 01:45:57,734
I'll cheer for the last bit
of the 20th Century.

1385
01:45:58,568 --> 01:45:59,568
And you?

1386
01:46:00,693 --> 01:46:02,734
I'm going to cheer
for the soccer team.

1387
01:46:04,068 --> 01:46:05,568
That's so fresh.

1388
01:46:06,484 --> 01:46:08,568
All right, let's go!

1389
01:46:10,693 --> 01:46:11,693
Chin up!

1390
01:46:11,734 --> 01:46:13,359
Open shoulders!

1391
01:47:53,109 --> 01:47:54,942
They've improved.

1392
01:47:54,943 --> 01:47:56,108
Improved so much.

1393
01:47:56,109 --> 01:47:57,318
Indeed.

1394
01:50:31,484 --> 01:50:34,358
- A short pass to the right.
- Short pass.

1395
01:50:34,359 --> 01:50:35,693
The right side!

1396
01:50:47,818 --> 01:50:50,693
Hey! Chi-hyung,
what are you doing?!

1397
01:51:16,609 --> 01:51:18,442
Who? Who scored?

1398
01:51:18,443 --> 01:51:20,358
You know, that guy.

1399
01:51:20,359 --> 01:51:22,693
Se-hyun's brother!

1400
01:51:25,943 --> 01:51:27,233
Is it over?

1401
01:51:27,234 --> 01:51:30,068
Yes, the match is over,
it's pretty much done.

1402
01:51:33,818 --> 01:51:35,483
Are we getting a penalty?!

1403
01:51:35,484 --> 01:51:39,109
Are you kidding me?
His arm was on his side!

1404
01:51:51,859 --> 01:51:54,734
Crap, I'm so nervous…

1405
01:51:56,568 --> 01:51:57,568
Oh dear…

1406
01:52:26,318 --> 01:52:27,359
He blocked it.

1407
01:54:27,484 --> 01:54:29,818
The 20th Century is almost over.

1408
01:54:30,234 --> 01:54:32,693
Today is the last day of 1999…

1409
01:54:32,943 --> 01:54:36,484
Did you all unplug
your computers at home?

1410
01:54:37,818 --> 01:54:39,943
If you didn't, it'll get
the millennium bug.

1411
01:54:40,109 --> 01:54:42,484
Is it true? I only turned it off.

1412
01:54:43,443 --> 01:54:45,109
Your computer is useless now.

1413
01:54:45,443 --> 01:54:46,109
Should I go back?

1414
01:54:46,110 --> 01:54:49,109
It's too late, if you go now,
you'll get infected too.

1415
01:54:49,609 --> 01:54:50,609
Chills!

1416
01:54:50,734 --> 01:54:54,567
It's all pointless,
we'll all be dead anyway.

1417
01:54:54,568 --> 01:54:56,484
What's a computer good for now?

1418
01:54:57,443 --> 01:54:59,234
You're so full of crap again.

1419
01:55:01,734 --> 01:55:03,609
And you, Pil-sun?
Are you praying?

1420
01:55:03,943 --> 01:55:06,359
I'm cheering, for me.

1421
01:55:07,568 --> 01:55:08,943
And for you all.

1422
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:13,484
Let's all countdown together
and usher in the New Year!

1423
01:55:13,818 --> 01:55:14,818
Ten!

1424
01:55:14,818 --> 01:55:15,818
Nine!

1425
01:55:15,818 --> 01:55:16,818
Eight!

1426
01:55:16,819 --> 01:55:17,858
Seven!

1427
01:55:17,859 --> 01:55:18,859
Six!

1428
01:55:18,859 --> 01:55:19,818
Five!

1429
01:55:19,818 --> 01:55:20,818
Four!

1430
01:55:20,818 --> 01:55:21,818
Three!

1431
01:55:21,818 --> 01:55:22,818
Two!

1432
01:55:22,818 --> 01:55:23,818
One!

1433
01:55:24,443 --> 01:55:28,193
Everyone, the 21st Century has begun.

1434
01:55:28,443 --> 01:55:31,234
It's the era of the new millennium…

1435
01:55:38,693 --> 01:55:40,067
Bye, everyone!

1436
01:55:40,068 --> 01:55:42,818
Let's all meet again
in the next life!

1437
01:56:01,943 --> 01:56:03,484
Can I have a ticket to Seoul?

1438
01:56:04,068 --> 01:56:05,109
Two, please.

1439
01:56:06,234 --> 01:56:07,609
No, three please.

1440
01:56:10,193 --> 01:56:12,234
You'll need an interpreter in Seoul.

1441
01:56:13,068 --> 01:56:14,693
Not problem!

1442
01:56:22,818 --> 01:56:24,484
Dang it, I missed it.

1443
01:56:56,984 --> 01:56:58,693
Do you like DIVA or Deux better?

1444
01:57:00,193 --> 01:57:01,734
Don't play dumb.

1445
01:57:02,193 --> 01:57:05,984
Or do you have a dance team that you like?

1446
01:57:08,484 --> 01:57:09,984
Millennium Girls.

1447
01:57:14,693 --> 01:57:16,359
Pass!
