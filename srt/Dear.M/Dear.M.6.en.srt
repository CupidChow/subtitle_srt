1
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,760
Oppa, you're awake?

2
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,950
Hey, you... yesterday...

3
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,110
Never mind.

4
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,790
You should go up. Everyone is eating ramen.

5
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,210
Okay.

6
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,580
What did I do yesterday?

7
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,600
Joo Ah, you're up.

8
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,420
Do you remember last night?

9
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,530
Hey.

10
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,570
Did I do something wrong yesterday?

11
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,120
Did I do the "restaurant part-time" again?

12
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,140
- You don't remember?
- No.

13
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,290
I think I totally blacked out.

14
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,200
How much do you remember?

15
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,040
Me?

16
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,260
The "I like you" game.

17
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,840
What about going outside?

18
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,170
You don't remember that?

19
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,730
Outside?

20
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,730
What did I do outside?

21
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,660
My last memory was being in this room.

22
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,110
Wait, how did I even get to my room?

23
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,020
What did I do? I wonder...

24
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,470
I want to know.

25
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,730
What are you doing right now?

26
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,670
I asked, what are you doing?

27
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,330
Y-Your hair is the same...

28
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,200
I really thought it was you.

29
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,510
I'm sorry. I thought you were Ji Min.

30
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,610
He must be really drunk. I'll apologize on his behalf.

31
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,050
It's okay.

32
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,300
Ji Min!

33
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,800
Oh, good morning. I hope you all had a good rest.

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,840
We had so much fun and rested well, thank you.

35
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,150
The food was really delicious, too.

36
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,280
We didn't do much for you, but thanks for saying that.

37
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,160
Let us know when you all arrive there safely. Okay?

38
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,520
Okay.

39
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,330
I'll get going. I'll call you when I get back.

40
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,510
- Goodbye!
- Thank you!

41
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,740
- Mother, Father, goodbye.
- Okay, get in the car.

42
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,940
Hey. Is your girlfriend in that group?

43
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,060
Yes, I might get one soon.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,310
I like her the best. The red haired.

45
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,240
What?

46
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,300
- What are you saying?
- Why?

47
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,330
She's pretty, and she's friendly, too.

48
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,030
I really like her.

49
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,030
Forget it. I'll call you when I get back.

50
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,650
- Go on.
- That little...

51
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,810
Joo Ah, you can take a nap if you're sleepy.

52
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,950
I'm not sleepy at all today.

53
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,930
I'm not going to sleep until we arrive.

54
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,020
This dumpling is pretty...

55
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,350
What? Daebak.

56
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,030
Did I really kiss Moon Joon?

57
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,920
Joo Ah, what are you doing when we get back to school?

58
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,130
Huh? Me?

59
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,220
Well...

60
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,110
I'm not really doing anything.

61
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,680
Why?

62
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,540
Do you want to watch a movie with me this evening?

63
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,000
What?

64
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,520
Sure!

65
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,600
Let's go. I'll go.

66
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,470
I'll reserve the tickets.

67
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,320
What genre do you like?

68
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,100
You did say you like Marvel.

69
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,830
Yes... I enjoy pretty much anything.

70
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,140
Do you like watching movies alone?

71
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,850
Or together with someone?

72
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,770
Sunbae is asking me questions.

73
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,990
I used to be the only one asking him questions.

74
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,920
When it comes to dramas and movies,

75
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,770
I like to converse while watching them.

76
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,840
Do you like eating while you watch them?

77
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,480
Yes! Popcorn and Cola.

78
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,700
Then let's have both.

79
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,850
Yes. Sounds good to me.

80
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,340
Hyung, I'll return the rental car.

81
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,810
You must be tired from driving.

82
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,080
It's fine. It's not that difficult.

83
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,750
I'll finish up everything.

84
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,300
Okay then. I had so much fun, thank you.

85
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,540
I'm the one who had a lot of fun thanks to you guys inviting me.

86
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,990
- Everyone, get some rest.
- Okay.

87
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,660
Joo Ah, I'll see you later.

88
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,190
I'll call you.

89
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,690
Okay.

90
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,170
- Bye, Hyung.
- See you.

91
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,200
Drive safely.

92
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,960
Cha Min Ho, do you want to go to the convenience store?

93
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,130
I'm going to go get something for my heartburn.

94
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,680
No.

95
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,600
We need to talk.

96
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,340
Ro Sa, I'll call you tomorrow.

97
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,830
Okay.

98
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,870
I was too drunk last night.

99
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,090
I was looking all over for you

100
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,430
and she had the same hairstyle and perfume as you, so─

101
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,450
Still. How could you confuse her for your girlfriend?

102
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,240
I can recognize even the back of your head from far away.

103
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,330
I could have definitely recognized you if I was sober.

104
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,100
But last night...

105
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,200
Never mind.

106
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,770
I'm going crazy because I'm so upset, and I feel so pathetic.

107
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,960
How I could've made that kind of mistake.

108
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,360
Don't do that from now on.

109
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,400
Properly apologize to Ro Sa, too.

110
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,660
Of course.

111
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,360
It won't happen again.

112
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,160
I'm never going to drink until I get drunk, either.

113
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,100
I got it.

114
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,050
I'll let it go this once.

115
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,820
Thank you.

116
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,870
And sorry.

117
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,220
- Do you have an assignment today, too?
- Yeah.

118
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,290
I'm going to wash up and go right to the lab with all my stuff.

119
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,980
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,780
I'm on my way to the lab.

121
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,540
[Ro Sa] Could you return the cheat sheet that I lent you last time?

122
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,430
Can I return it tomorrow?

123
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,660
I'm already on my way to the lab.

124
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,550
[Ro Sa] The sunbae, who lent it to me, wants it back by tomorrow.

125
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,770
[Ro Sa] I need to pull an all-nighter to review it tonight.

126
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,060
Why are you doing this to me?

127
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,740
Why?

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,410
Then why did you do that to me?

129
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,160
You ghosted me after a few days of dating!

130
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,890
How can you call that dating?

131
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,120
You just followed me around because you liked me.

132
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,800
You're doing this because I rejected you.

133
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,030
Both then and now!

134
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,420
Please stop harassing me

135
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,010
and take down the SeoRab post!

136
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,930
Who is the one who smiled and flirted first?

137
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,070
When did I?

138
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,590
Ro Sa...
[The Truth about the Cheer Squad Assistant Leader]

139
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,530
I'll take down the post if you just get back together with me.
[She's man-crazy and is promiscuous...]

140
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,160
You can prove it to me throughout our relationship,

141
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,870
that you don't go from man to man

142
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,830
and you maintain a relationship with one person.

143
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,190
You're not going to believe me anyway.

144
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,160
Do whatever you want.

145
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,880
Hey.

146
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,850
You should take responsibility since you're the one who seduced me.

147
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,180
You thought I would just sit back and do nothing like an idiot?

148
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,120
I'm going to come back,

149
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,890
so if you don't want to take another leave of absence, think wisely. Got it?

150

[Cheat sheet]

151
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,170
I'm leaving the cheat sheet in front of your house.

152
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,960
The cheat sheet...

153
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,940
I'm really scared because

154
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,770
a weird guy keeps coming by.

155
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,820
Can you...

156
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,540
stay with me just for a little while?

157
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,430
During my first year,

158
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:39,500
I was in the same class as Tae Jin Sunbae.

159
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,460
I trusted him and hung out with him

160
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,330
because he took really good care of me.

161
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,820
We went to class together

162
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,770
and ate together a few times.

163
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:03,030
But then he suddenly confessed to me that he liked me.

164
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,910
I cautiously rejected him,

165
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:19,450
but he spread weird rumors about me after that.

166
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,940
The rumors were so terrible that I can't bear to say them out loud.

167
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:32,790
I struggled to go to school because of the outrageous rumors.

168
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,380
So...

169
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,970
I went on the exchange program as a means of escape.

170
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,920
My classmates, who were all friendly and laughed with me until yesterday,

171
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,720
suddenly all looked at me strangely.

172
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,940
I felt so scared and tormented.

Don't you think...

00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:14,870
they avoided you because they were all just scared of Sunbae?

175

They probably didn't actually believe the rumors.

When she asks for time apart, you should never contact her first.

299

If you contact her first and act all clingy,

300
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,150
she'll just lose all interest.

301
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,960
Just cut off all contact for at least a week

302

00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,470
Then, when Ji Min finally realizes and contacts you first,

304
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,670
this is what you say to her.

Is he disciplining himself? Training to be a monk?

310
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,240
If he really wanted you, he couldn't have lasted a day and would've called you.

Don't you think so?

Not reaching out because you asked for some time apart

means one of these two.

Either, he cares more about his pride than getting back together with you

or he has no desire to get back together at all.

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,570
- I never confessed to anyone.
- Wow.

331
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,100
So all your girlfriends confessed to you?

332
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,920
But you got dumped by all of them in less than a month?

333
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,110
Wow, Cha Min Ho. What did you do?

334
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,760
Hey. You were the real dating loser.

335
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,750
I was not!

336
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,540
What's wrong with him these days?

337
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,770
- Tteokbokki?
- I would love some.

338
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,630
- Sunbae!
- Yeong, where are you going?

339
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,410
- I'm going to class.
- First period on a Monday?

340
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,220
As expected in the first year.

341
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,290
Yes. Where are you going, Sunbae?

342
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,060
I don't have classes today,

343
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,230
so I'm going to go eat and hang out with my girlfriend.

344
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,150
This is Yeong Hui from our major.

345
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,030
See you tomorrow.

346
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,460
See you.

347
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,010
You saw the guy I was with just now, right?

348
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:55,390
That's the computer science sunbae I told you I liked last time.

349
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,230
Things are going pretty well with him.

350
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,760
By chance,

351
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,720
aren't you in Computer Science?

352
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,900
What are you talking about? Sang Gu sunbae is in my major.

353
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,620
Or...

354
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,540
is Computer Science your minor or secondary major?

355
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,690
No, it's not.

356
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,440
By chance... do you know Choi Ro Sa?

357
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,820
Ro Sa?

358
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,140
Oh. We were in the same group for an elective class,

359
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,560
so we met a couple of times for a group meeting.

360
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,940
I haven't seen her since then.

361
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,880
Ji Min.

362
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:42,250
- About yesterday's SeoRab post...
- Let's meet tonight.

363
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,280
Let's talk then.

364
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,850
Exposure.

365
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,040
Depending on whether you use high or low exposure,

366
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,750
the atmosphere of the photo can be very different.

367
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,430
There are three elements to exposure.

368
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,670
Aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.

369
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,680
First, shutter speed.

370
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,990
Shutter speed is the speed at which the shutter of the camera closes.

371
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,610
The faster the shutter speed,

372
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,060
the shorter the time it takes for the shutter to close

373
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,370
which means it'll take in less light.

374
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,870
Then what about if it's slower?

375
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,390
There's more light taken in.

376
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,580
The shutter speed not only decides the amount of exposure
[Is a woman not allowed to confess first?]

377
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:44,740
it plays an important role in determining the movement of the object in the photo.

378
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,100
Do you have a better understanding of what exposure is?

379
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,560
Yes.

380
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,530
Unni, I'll see you later.

381
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,450
- Okay, bye.
- All right. I'll see you.

382
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,380
Let's talk for a moment.

383
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,450
- Joo Ah, you're here?
- Hey.

384
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,640
Hello.

385
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:32,170
Is Joon Oppa not here?

386
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,710
Unni, you didn't know?

387
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,510
Joon Oppa has a very important meeting today.

388
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,220
An important meeting?

389
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,180
Min Ho.

390
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,470
What are you doing?

391
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,240
Oh, right. Did you find a replacement for the group blind date?

392
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,990
Hey, thanks to your rejection, Joon Hyung agreed to join us.

393
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,470
- Joon Hyung did?
- Yeah.

394
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,920
All the goddesses of the music major agreed to come out, thanks to him.

395
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,210
We're going with the flow, thanks to him.

396
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,490
Anyway, thanks for turning it down, my friend.

397
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,610
I'm off!

398
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,090
Okay.

399
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,240
Joon Oppa is going on a group blind date with another department today.

400
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,620
I heard from one of the girls who is going

401
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,150
who used to be my classmate from high school.

402
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,380
I took the time to think as you asked me to

403
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,560
and I was completely at fault.

404
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,380
I'm really sorry for lying to you

405
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,660
and for making you misunderstand.

406
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,990
Since Ro Sa is your friend,

407
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,270
I was too at ease around her.

408
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,650
But we had just made up yesterday

409
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,970
and I should've considered your feelings more.

410
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,270
I was thoughtless.

411
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,390
It really won't happen again from now on.

412
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,020
I was also...

413
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,900
too emotional yesterday.

414
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,420
I won't lie to you from now on.

415
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,740
So...

416
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,230
can you trust me a little more?

417
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,340
All right.

418
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,440
But shouldn't you be getting to class?

419
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,570
- Yes.
- You're going to be late.

420
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,870
You should go to class.

421
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,350
All right.

422
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,180
I'll call you.

423
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,630
Then why did he buy me macarons

424
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,290
and watch a movie with me?

425
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,410
What was all that?

426
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,910
- Was he playing with me?
- Nah.

427
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,970
- I don't think that's it.
- But

428
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,720
he went on a group blind date.

429
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,950
It's probably because his hoobaes asked him to.

430
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,050
You really think so?

431
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,420
But apparently, the music major goddesses will be there.

432
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,920
I probably pale in comparison, right?

433
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,550
Hey! What's wrong with you?

434
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,900
You scared me.

435
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,440
The pig squealing sound you make when you watch horror movies?

436
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,930
That's a higher octave than the opera majors.

437
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,720
It's almost dolphin level.

438
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,310
And when you

439
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,790
dance at the norebang (karaoke),

440
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,650
the rhythm of your tambourine

441
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,360
can't be matched by even the percussion majors.

442
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,670
Hey. Let's cut afternoon classes and go there.

443
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,650
Your three-piece therapy kit.

444
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,850
Shit.

445
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,910
Why in the world would you watch this?

446
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:45,780
The tension and screaming relieve stress.

447
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,400
Oh, my gosh.

448
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:57,700
Isn't this a lot scarier than expected?

449
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,340

Yes.

467
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,370
One more song?

468
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,930
Let's sing a ballad.

469
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,070
I don't sing ballads.

You always say you don't.

471
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,670
Then I'm going to sing.

Hello?

526
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:04,290
Joo Ah, I stopped by your work. I thought you would be working, but you're not here.

527
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,360
Oppa, you went to Re-Feel?

00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,150
Yes. I wanted to drop by and see your face.

Thanks for today, my friend.

Sang Gu, was it?

550
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:48,030
He wasn't a computer science major.

551
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,130
He met you for the first time for a group project.

552

Why did you lie?

553

Fine.

556
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,570
What?

557
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,050
I was interested in Ha Neul when I first saw him,

558
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,560
but he turned out to be your boyfriend.

559
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,570
I thought, why you? Just like that time with Dong Gyu.

560
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,500
At first, I thought about giving up.

But?

562
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,930
Ha Neul kept giving me leeway.

563
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,250
He drank on my behalf at the Back-to-School party,

564
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,380
he took his shirt off for me when I spilled my tint,

565
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,100
he held me in the escape room when I got scared,

566
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,300
and stayed next to me when I cried.

567
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,790
So I got greedy.

568
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,470
It's your misunderstanding.

569
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,290
Misunderstanding?

570
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,620
You say it's a misunderstanding,

571
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,560
but why did you fight with Ha Neul over a SeoRab post?

572
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,460
What?

573
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,170
You're honestly scared, aren't you?

574
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,790
That I might steal Ha Neul from you?

575
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,520
Whether it comes to preferences or interests,

576
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,780
you know that Ha Neul and I are more compatible.

577
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,020
- Hey!
- What?

578
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:34,020
Whatever you do, Ha Neul won't fall for you.

579
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,790
So before Ha Neul finds out your feelings and feels uncomfortable,

580
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,540
stop here.

581
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,990
Are you sure?

582
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,530
Yeah.

583
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,750
I trust Ha Neul.

584
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,210
If you trust him that much, then I guess you can just wait and see.

585
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,710
Aren't you curious, too?

586
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:04,370
If Ha Neul likes you as much as you think he does?

587
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,100
Why did you become like this?

588
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:18,760
Or were you always like this?

589
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,440
Think whatever you want.

590
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,460
Then again, I guess there was no point in asking.

591
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,060
Let's not talk to each other starting tomorrow.

592
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:43,670
I can't be friends with someone who's broken,

593
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,380
out of concern that I might fall apart, too.

594
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:04,040
Why didn't you go to work today?

595
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,280
Well,

596
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,170
something suddenly came up.

597
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,550
Really?

598
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,960
Did you take care of that something?

599
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,010
Yes.

600
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,190
Are you coming back from somewhere, too?

601
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,410
You didn't hear?

602
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,860
I thought you knew.

603
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,260
What?

604
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,940
I-I don't know anything.

605
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,640
I went on a group blind date today.

606
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,670
I don't like those things, but a hoobae of mine kept asking me.

607
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:41,000
Today was the first time I ever went.

608
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:44,570
I came to tell you that.

609
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,950
If you didn't want to go, you should've said no.

610
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,740
Why did you go?

611
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,960
My hoobae begged me

612
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,070
and there was also someone I wanted to make jealous.

613
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,620
What?

614
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,770
Ji Min.

615
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,090
What were you doing?

616
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:38,010
I was reviewing the content for my study group.

617
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,190
It feels like it has been so long since we held hands.

618
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,760
Although, it has only been one day.

619
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,790
Let's not fight again.

620
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,650
Okay.

621
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:02,410
Oh, yes, you said you wanted to talk about something?

622
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,730
Aren't you curious, too?

623
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:11,520
If Ha Neul likes you as much as you think he does.

624
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:21,780
I wanted to ask you what you wanted to do for your birthday.

625
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:26,830
Should we go to the restaurant that we went to for our 100-day anniversary?

626
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:28,410
Sure.

627
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,930
Let's do that.

628
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,540
Okay.

629
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,660
Are you back in the dorm?

630
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,780
She's ignoring me.

631
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,340
Min Ho.

632
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,670
Hyung.

633
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,700
What about Ma Joo Ah?

634
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,120
Joo Ah?

635
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,110
She just came back to the dorms with me.

636
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,540
Hyung, I heard you went on the group blind date.

637
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,220
I won't be going anymore, even as a fill-in.

638
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,280
Why?

639
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,190
I was confused about something,

640
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:20,100
but now, after going to the group blind date, I know how I feel for sure.

641
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,100
I'll get going.

642
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,730
Okay.

643
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,240
So you couldn't tell Ha Neul?

644
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,730
You should've nailed it into him that

645
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,680
"Choi Ro Sa likes you, so don't hang out with her anymore."

646
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,870
But I don't think I could've said anything, either.

647
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,180
It would bruise my ego.

648
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:48,980
I thought Ji Min Unni would be the type to confidently say things like that.

649
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,750
I thought so, too,

650
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,210
but now that it's happening to me,

651
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:57,340
I couldn't.

652
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,780
Ji Min.

653
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,370
Are you anxious, by chance?

654
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:06,680
That Ha Neul might fall for Choi Ro Sa if he finds out how she feels about him?

655
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,550
No.

656
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:15,550

Our school is planning to expand Seoyeon Love Admissions next year.

00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:40,980
It's a petition against that.

766
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,860
Won't they be doing that aside from the regular admissions anyway?

767
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:46,160
They just don't want the quality of our school declining.

768
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,960
The grade criteria for Seoyeon Love Admissions tends to be more lenient than for regular admissions.

00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,860
The Seoyeon Love Admissions is that one, right?

772
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,860
Everyone got into our school by ranking first place in high school,

773
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:05,050
but if they keep accepting students based on their economic status,

774
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:06,890
I would feel so cheated.

775
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,810
And based on the SeoRab post last time,

776
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:12,720
students from Seoyeon Love Admissions don't really study and ruin the studious atmosphere.

777
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,470
If they're less smart than other people,

778
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:16,700
they should work hard to keep up with them.

779
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,230
But they don't manage their grades, they drink and ruin the atmosphere.

I'm from a low-income family

784
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,650
and my grades are lower than the regular students.

785

I agree with that argument more than you know.

786
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:45,900
But not everyone sucks at studying just because they're in the program

787
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,230
and not everyone ruins the atmosphere.

00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,990
I've been preparing this since last week.

821
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:08,400
Do you know how hard it was to go to each room and ask them to sing?

822
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,460
- But as long as you're happy, I'm─
- Hold on.

823
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,800
Hyung. Is something wrong?

824
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:19,540
Ji Min...

825
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,670
broke up with me.

826
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:25,540

What are you saying all of a sudden?

830
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,870
Are you still mad about what happened?

831
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:44,240
It's not you, it's me.

832
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:50,590
I can no longer...

833

834
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,860
I feel like we'll only grow

have anything to say?

854
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:45,210
In hopes that he'll grab on to me,

855
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:48,990
I even packed my things slowly.

856

I even...

859
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:04,510
walked out as slowly as possible.

860
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:09,760
I thought that he might call me back.

861
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,850
♫ Thinking about it, it was longing ♫

862

♫ It will soon fade away ♫

863

♫ A longing that I will long for ♫

864
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:33,340
But how could he not even hang onto me? Not even once?

865
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:37,450
Now it really feels like he was just waiting to break up with me.

866
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:41,320
Like I was the only one who liked him.

867
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:54,640
Oh, okay.

868
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,770
All right.

869
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:01,190
Ji Min unni is sick, so she can't come today.

870
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,510
Wow.

871

Maybe the SeoRab post is true.

01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:09,460
Huh?

874
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,140
- What SeoRab post?
- You know!

said they're going to confess during Monday's class. Daebak!

Right. I saw it, too.

Already? It hasn't been that long since it came up.

01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:56,340
I guess I read it as soon as it came up.

I can't wait for Monday.
