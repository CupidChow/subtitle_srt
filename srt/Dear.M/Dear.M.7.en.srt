Hey, Yang Hui.

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,800
Are you here to study?

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,480
I have some books to borrow.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,870
I see.

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,670
Oppa, did you hear?

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,190
Two of the sunbaes in our major got conned.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,110
Conned?

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,720
They said they got conned by a sunbae who graduated.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,140
His name was something like Chi Woong or Chi Yeong.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,560
Chi Yeong?

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,340
The number you have dialed is not in service.

13

Please─

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,170
It was 5 million won ($5,000) for me.

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,890
And there's one more sunbae besides us.

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,320
He also gave him 5 million won.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,720
My calls went through to him until now,

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,280
but his number hasn't been in service since yesterday.

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,170
We won't get the money back, will we?

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,460
We can find our money right away if we file a report, right?

21
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,320
If you file a criminal action against him and we catch the debtor,

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,550
they can be fined or face criminal punishment,

23
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,780
but you need to file a civil action against him if you want to get your money back.

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,510
And even that wouldn't guarantee the return of your money.

25
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,070
Do you have any recorded calls or text message history?

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,410
No.

27
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,660
Ten million won isn't a small amount of money.

28
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,500
You should've left careful records.

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,030
The debtor needs to appear first in order for us to do anything,

30
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,980

Hey, I asked an acquaintance of mine. Civil lawsuit?

40
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,440
It's a huge hassle and exhausting.

41
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,630
And it's not like we signed a promissory note.

42
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,420
It'll just waste time and tons of money.

43
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,680
Unless it's a huge amount, they say the lawsuit process causes an even bigger loss.

But still...

45

I only gave him 5 million won.

A happy ending.

156

All the adversities are forced upon the main character.

But even through all those adversities and a mental breakdown,

it's always a happy ending.

I guarantee it.

So all these crappy things happening to you

163
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,100
are because you're main character material.

00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,730
Hey, I'm the thankful one

329
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,190
for you trusting in me and participating.

330
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,630
It's a little empty without Joo Ah.

331
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,500
What did you mean when you said you know for sure after the group blind date?

332
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,900
That I like someone.

333
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:11,160
I was unsure at first, but I found out for sure then.

334
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,910
And who would that be?

335
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,380
I'll let you know next time if things go well.

336
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,800
Your kimbap is ready. Please enjoy.
[Elephant Diner]

337
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,990
Ahjumma, aren't you giving out fishcakes on the house today?

338
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,580
Sure, I'll give you some more.

339
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,400
Joo Ah, give them one more portion of fishcakes.

340
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,770
- Here you go. Your fishcakes are ready.
- Thank you.

341
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,940
- Mom.
- Yes?

342
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,890
They ordered one portion of tteokbokki, but if you give out one portion of fishcakes for free,

343
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,900
how much do you make on it?

344
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,000
You always gain something when you give.

345
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,300
You know the dry cleaning ahjussi across from us?

346
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,560
He was so surprised when he learned that you attend Seoyeon University.

347
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,040
Really? So were you really proud of me?

348
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,470
Well, a little bit.

349
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:13,270
But does your school also discriminate against the early admissions students?

350
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,270
It came out on the news.

351
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,840
What?

352
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,800
There's nothing like that.

353
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,200
Then that's a relief.

354
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,870
I was just worried

355
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,860
that you might be labeled as not having money and being fatherless.

356
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,400
Other people's unwanted attention hurts more than a knife.

357
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:42,290
So, did it hurt you, Mom?

358
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,970
What do you mean?

359
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,810
You know...

360
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:54,700
At the community center, when you submitted papers indicating

361
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,010
that you're of low income and divorced,

362
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,570
you must've garnered unwanted attention.

363
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,260
Why do they keep asking for proof when you're already sorrowful about not having a husband or money?

364
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,400
I know.

365
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,600
But I wasn't embarrassed at all.

366
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,650
I have you.

367
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,550
You talk back a little,

368
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,520
but you never rebelled and grew up to be kind.

369
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,620
And this is a small restaurant,

370
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,560
but I'm in good health, so I can run the business.

371
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,730
The only things missing were those two, so why would I be embarrassed?

372
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,890
Giving to other people is good and all,

373
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,620
but buy yourself a bag.

374
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,060
What is that? It's falling apart.

375
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,050
How tacky.

376
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,700
Don't you know vintage?

377
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,100
Dear, go and do the dishes.

378
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,400
[Min Ho] I've decided against taking a leave of absence.

379
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,710
Enjoy your meal.

380
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,730
Welcome.

381
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,370
How many?

382
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,520
Just me.

383
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,320
We're a little busy right now,

384
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,840
so would you be okay with sharing a table?

385
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,910
Sure.

386
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,820
Come here.

387
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,900
Young man,

388
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,500
- would you share the table?
- Okay.

389
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,100
Ma'am, I would like a level three spicy jjamppong.

390
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,440
Okay.

391
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,650
That's going to be really spicy.

392
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,670
The jjamppong here is on the spicy side.

393
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,770
That's fine. I'm good with spice.

394
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,960
Enjoy.

395
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,600
Drink this.

396
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,520
You have to bring milk when you eat here.

397
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,780
Okay, thank you.

398
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,850
You're really going to eat that?

399
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,130
I think you're overdoing it.

400
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,100
You're really going to eat that?

401
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,500
Aren't you overdoing it?

402
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,640
You can't even eat spicy foods.

403
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,610
You said you like this. I'll eat it with you.

404
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,200
And how spicy could it be?

405
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,260
♫ I'm trying to get over our break-up ♫

406
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:13,950
♫ I'm trying to open up my hurt heart ♫

407
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,870
Park Ha Neul! Are you crying?

408
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,730
Nope.

409
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,800
It's a little hot. I think I'm just sweating.

410
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,260
It's hot in here.

411
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,020
I told you not to eat it.

412
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,390
♫ My throat keeps locking up ♫

413
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,280
Why is the jjamppong so spicy?

414
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,550
♫ The fragments of my emotions ♫

415
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:51,470
Thank you.

416
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,680
It's because it's spicy.

417
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,110
Because it's really spicy.

418
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,580
Excuse me.

419
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,930
Aren't you going to pay me back for the milk?

420
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,760
I think you drank about 1,500 won's ($1.50) worth.

421
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,140
Thank you for earlier.

422
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,310
Wow, how careless.

423
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,970
How could you just offer money and call it even?

424
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,500
Huh? Then...

425
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,600
Favors should be repaid when the other party needs it in the way they need it.

426
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,140
I don't have anyone to eat jjamppong with because I'm an outsider.

427
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,470
Please come with me next time I come to eat jjamppong.

428
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:38,400
Then we can call it even. Okay?

429
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,240
Here.

430
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,190
Give me your number.

431
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,800
My name is Ban Yi Dam.

432
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,600
Yes, my name is Seo Ji Min.

433
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,380
I'm 21 years old.

434
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,810
And you?

435
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,760
22...

436
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,580
But, is this your first time seeing me?

437
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,290
Pardon?

438
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,170
You really haven't seen me before?

439
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,430
I'm sorry.

440
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,200
Do I come out okay?

441
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,890
I saw you a couple of times.

442
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,160
We're in the same class.

443
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,400
Photo and Appreciation.

444
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,340
Min Ho Oppa! I knew you would be here.

445
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,230
Oh, you're here?

446
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,390
Oppa, the drink we agreed to grab, let's grab it today.

447
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,220
I'll buy.

448
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,110
I have a lot to do today.

449
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,040
Oppa, aren't you rejecting me too much?

450
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,490
This is the first time I've had to grovel for a drink.

451
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,600
You can give in at least once.

452
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,400
- Well...
- I'll wait here until you finish,

453
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,730
so you must drink with me today.

454
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,170
Let's go.

455
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,070
We're going for a drink?

456
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,740
Really?

457
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,220
There's a place I looked up in front of the school,

458
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,840
so let's go there.

459
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:22,110
Oppa, thanks for convincing Min Ho.

460
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,380
Let's eat.

461
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,870
[Joon Oppa] Of course.

462
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,740
[Joon Oppa] I'll see you in class on Monday.

463
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,970
Gosh. Who's the guy that's making you blush?

464
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,650
Your son-in-law.

465
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,100
My son-in-law?

466
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,130
Let's see. Let's see.

467
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,750
My son-in-law...

468
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,150
Oh, I see.

469
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,340
What was that? What's with your reaction?

470
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,900
He's not as good as Min Ho.

471
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,490
What are you saying? Why did Cha Min Ho pop up?

472
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,400
I want a son-in-law like Min Ho.

473
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,330
He's respectful, diligent, and intelligent.

474
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,380
This oppa is exactly like that.

475
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,530
He's respectful, diligent, and intelligent

476
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,440
and on top of that, he has good manners

477
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,730
and he's even handsome.

478
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,830
- Okay.
- And...

479
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,390
you said Cha Min Ho is your son.

480
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,840
How can he be your son-in-law?

481
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,960
Just choose one.

482
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,250
He can be my son-in-law who's like my son.

483
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:19,000
Cha Min Ho and I have nothing between us.

484
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,060
And without leaving out a moment, we've been best friends for 12 years.

485
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,760
You know that, too, Mom.

486
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,240
Don't even bring it up anymore.

487
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,200
I'm about to... get indigestion.

488
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,160
Does Min Ho feel the same?

489
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,330
Min Ho probably had feelings for you.

490
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,620

- This is Ma Joo Ah's store?
- Right. Why?

492
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,650
Why do you always help Ma Joo Ah solve math problems?

493
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,640
You said you're just friends.

494
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,080
I help her because we're friends.

495

She's good at everything else,

496
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,070
but she's weak in math.

497

Let her take care of her own work.

Yes.

509

Of course, it's Ma Joo Ah.

510

Ma Joo Ah has ten years with me, and you have ten days.

511

That...

516
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,400
That's because what he said was right. We've known each other for 12 years.

517
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,030
How does that mean he likes me?

When I misspoke in front of Joo Ah Unni unintentionally,

525
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,680
I was actually really embarrassed.

526
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,270
I spoke too thoughtlessly.

527
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:28,150
I was afraid of what other people might think of me

528
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,900
and that you might be disappointed in me.

529
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,200
I grew up without lacking anything,

530
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,380
so there's a lot that I don't know.

531
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,460
Did you talk it out with Joo Ah?

532
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,250
I didn't have the time to properly speak with her yet.

533
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,570
I'm going to apologize to her for sure.

534
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,940
Sure.

Oppa, since you don't have a girlfriend,

536
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,360
don't you want to date someone?

537
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,720
I need to make an app

538
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,410
and do my work-study, so I don't have the time.

00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,040
Gosh, dating is something you make the time for.

Of course, they take attendance.

00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,580
I wanted to see him in person, but he didn't come.

656
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:43,620
But why isn't Choi Ro Sa here?

657
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,670
CEO, congratulations on the success of

658
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,210
"Future Invasion," the game that launched this year.

659
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,350
Thank you.

660
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,900
And thank you for agreeing to this interview in your busy schedule.

661
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,050
I'm the one who should thank you for inviting us.

662
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:02,310
So, how did your son end up coming with you?

663
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,170
I have nothing to brag about except my son, so I told him to come.

664
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:07,160
I'm such a braggart.

665
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,180
With good reason.

666
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,730
Your son is very handsome.

667
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,900
He doesn't look like me, right?

668
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,890
You're handsome, too, CEO.

669
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,150
But he does take after me in other aspects.

670
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,150
He's very interested in app development.

671
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:29,400
He said the app that he recently created was popular among the students.

672
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,410
It was some sort of app related to the school cafeteria.

673
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,820
What was it again?

674
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,150
What was it?

675
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,160
Oh. I stopped working on that recently.

676
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,070
I'm working on a new one.

677
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:43,960
- And you're participating in an app development competition, right?
- Yes.

678
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,860
He must take after you, having that kind of talent.

679
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,680
I hope you do well at the competition.

680
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,170
Yes. Thank you.

681
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,880
Then we'll continue to ask you some questions, CEO.

682
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,130
Let's continue after a short break.

683
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,010
Sure.

684
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,770
Excuse me for a moment.

685
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,410
By chance,

686
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:13,420
will today's interview be broadcasted exactly the way it is?

687
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,540
Yes, why?

688
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,460
Don't worry.

689
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,560
We'll edit it well.

690
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,910
Sure.

691
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,410
I have some bad news.

692
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,830
The class will be canceled during the midterms.

693
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,250
Yes!

694
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,900
Instead, this month's assignment is the festival.

695
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,500
You just need to upload photos from the festival by the end of this month.

696
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,770
Good luck with your exams

697
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,960
and I'll see you after the midterms.

698
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,380
Thank you!

699
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,570
No class? Great!

700
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,630
Joo Ah Unni.

701
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:00,790
Unni, have you seen Min Ho Oppa?

702
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,450
Min Ho is absent today.

703
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:05,870
Why?

704
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,230
There's something I must tell him today.

705
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,000
Oh, you're here?

706
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,750
I'm here to get my phone from Mok Jin Hyung.

707
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,670
Min Ho Oppa!

708
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,540
I like you, Oppa.

709
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,580
I have liked you since the first time

710
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,260
I saw you in class.

711
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,580
It's the first time I've ever liked someone like this.

712
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,250
And it's also the first time I've confessed to someone.

713
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,880
Please accept my confession, Oppa.

714
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,850
Accept.

715
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,610
Accept.

716
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,360
Accept.

717
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,060
Accept.

718
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,740
Accept.

719
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,480
Accept.

720
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,120
Accept.

721
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,720
Accept.

722
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,050
Accept.

723
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,360
Congrats!

724
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,100
Congrats!

725
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,700
Gosh, what a letdown.

726
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,930
Cha Min Ho was the M in "Dear.M?"

727
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,000
I thought it was you, Joo Ah.

728
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,410
You were also disappointed that it wasn't Joon Oppa, right?

729
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,170
Yes.

730
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:57,620
I had fun reading the confession posts until now.

731
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,970
Is this how the "Dear.M" incident ends?

732
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:04,230
I bet other people who anticipated this class were also let down.

733
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,090
I don't think they'll even have the time to worry about that.

734
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,550
Why?

735
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:12,500
It's the midterm period.

736
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,670
- You're right.
- That's right.

737
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,740
I accepted your flowers earlier because there were a lot of people,

738
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,170
but I don't think I can accept these. Sorry.

739
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,930
I'm not saying we should start dating right away.

740
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:39,900
Can't you give me a chance if you're not seeing anyone?

741
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,870
It's not that.

742
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:45,430
There's someone I like already.

743
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,710
What? Really?

744
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,160
Yeah.

745
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,590
Who?

746
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,050
But it's not like you're dating that person yet.

747
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:08,260
Then I want to continue liking you.

748
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,710
I'm confident.

749
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,310
Confident that I can make you fall for me.

750
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,170
- Kim Hyo Joong.
- Here.

751
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:19,770
- Cheong Dae Seong.
- Here.

752
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,710
Choi Ro Sa.

753
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,100
Choi Ro Sa?

754
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,670
- Lee Joon Hee.
- Here.

755
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,310
- Kim Ki Hwan.
- Here.

756
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:29,200
- Cha Jong Hoon.
- Here.

757
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,830
[Choi Ro Sa] I couldn't go to class today because I'm sick.

758
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:34,930
[Choi Ro Sa] There's no one else I can ask except you,

759
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:38,780
[Choi Ro Sa] but could you lend me your notes later?

760
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,620
- Im Chae Rin.
- Here.

761
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,250
- Lee Ha Na.
- Here.

762
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,850
- Im Yo Jin.
- Here.

763
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:45,390
Okay.

764
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:56,430
[Cheer Squad Leader]

765
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,560
Leader.

766
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,570
Did you hear?

767
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,980
Joon Wu and Eun Seo are dating.

768
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,610
Oh, me?

769
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:10,650
I heard from Ji Min.

770
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,070
Keep it a secret until we open up to others.

771
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:15,190
Why? You look good together.

772
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,490
No, it's not that.

773
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,890
If they know we're dating, over the smallest mistakes,

774
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:22,340
they'll say we're not practicing because we're dating.

775
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,700
And she's still a freshman,

776
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,620
so she's cautious around the sunbaes.

777
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,570
Can you keep it a secret just until the Cheering Festival is over?

778
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,190
All right.

779
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,410
If you keep our secret, we'll vote for you

780
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:39,700
as the Cheer Leader.

781
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,310
Nonsense.

782
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:44,020
I'll keep your secret even if you don't.

783
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:05,730
A maple latte, please.

784
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:08,350
I'll let you know when it's ready.

785
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,300
We meet again.

786
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:26,900
Yes.

787
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,580
You're a noona. Please speak casually.

788
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,510
Okay, then...

789
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,770
You weren't in class today.

790
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:39,370
How did you know that I wasn't there?

791
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,100
Were you looking for me?

792
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,650
Because the professor took roll call.

793
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:47,250
I missed the shuttle bus today.

794
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,410
I should've gone to class today.

795
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:52,160
Why? So you don't get penalized for attendance?

796
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,440
No.

797
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,810
Because there was a reason I needed to go.

798
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,560
I don't mind getting penalized for attendance.

799
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,130
I got extra credit last time.

800
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,780
Extra credit?

801
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,690
The photo of you during the outdoor class,

802
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,820
that was taken by me.

803
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,510
This came out pretty nice.

804
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,840
I didn't take this.

805
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,590
Why would you take a photo of me?

806
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:20,830
You know how you want to take photos of pretty things?

807
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,730
That's why I took it.

808
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,450
Are you always this flirtatious?

809
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:31,010
No. I'm just the honest type.

810
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,210
Your maple latte is ready.

811
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:34,990
Hold on.

812
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,350
Maple latte?

813
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,370
Enjoy.

814
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,420
Did you know?

815
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,460
There are 30 applicants this year.

816
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,470
Because this is a good experience to add for aspiring announcers.

817
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:00,630
Hello, I'm in charge of...

818
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:04,490
Hello, students and staff of Seoyeon University...

819
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:10,840
Unni, you're here for the audition as well?

820
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,840
I wasn't going to try out,

821
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,350
but my classmates egged me on to try out.

People of Seoyeon University, hello.

830
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:52,480
I'm MC Ma Joo Ah, and I'm going to be a part of

831
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,490
this fun festival with you all.

832
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:57,560
Before I introduce the first group,

833
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,840
here's a surprise quiz.

834
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:05,390
What is the most frequently ordered takeout delivery by our students this year?

835
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,160
Number one, chicken.

836
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,780
Number two, jokbal.

837
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,480
Number three, pizza.

838
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,580
Number four, tteokbokki.

839
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,990
Isn't it chicken?

840
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,400
I think it's pizza.

841
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,780
Is it pizza?

842
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,730
Pizza!

843
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:21,070
The answer was number four, tteokbokki.

844
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:25,710
And the spiciest level tteokbokki was most beloved by Seoyeon students.

845
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,580
How entertaining.

846
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,070
Do you have any other quizzes?

847
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:29,900
Yes!

848
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,170
I have a bunch of quizzes prepared

849
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:34,740

855
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,800
There were a lot of really good people.

856
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,810
I don't think I'll make it.

857
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,830
Unni, I'm sorry about what happened.

858
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,970
I don't know how to read the room.

859

Oh, no.

I also put you on the spot in front of other people.

- It's okay.

Unni.

864
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:24,630
I like Min Ho Oppa.

I know.

866
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:30,030
I think 100 other people know as well.

867

That's why I want to be closer to you.

Yeah, sure...

869
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:47,420
So you and Min Ho are dating now?

870
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,780
No. I got rejected.

871
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,980
Why?

872
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:55,020
Min Ho Oppa says he likes someone already.

873
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,380
Do you know who it is?

874
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,830
What?

875
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:02,580
I thought it was you.

876
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:05,790
He said I'm not the one.

877
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:09,570
Unni, I'm not going to give up on Min Ho Oppa.

878
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:14,560
So you have to tell me if you find out who he likes.

879

the pink-haired woman with the white knit sweater is totally my ideal type.

I said it after contemplating it for a long time.
