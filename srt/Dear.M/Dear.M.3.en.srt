00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,850
He is boyfriend material, no matter what he wears.

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,840
I really wonder what type of girl Moon Joon likes.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,100
It's probably someone who's unique, right?

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,900
Someone like this? She sure is unique.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,910
Who? Who? Let me see.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,900
Her.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,870
The way you're holding that hamburger is so unique that

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,120
- I'm getting goosebumps.
- Erase that.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,100
What would happen if I sent this to Joon Hyung?

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,590
Try sending it.

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,120
You and I will both die.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,400
Why would I die? You would die alone.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,100
Because I'll also send this to Yang Hui.

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,700
- What?
- I was saving this to post it when I win the bet.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,150
"I'm going crazy right now.

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,670
I've entrusted my soul and body to these headphones

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,030
because music is the only drug that the government allows.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,100
This is the current me."

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,000
Cha Min Ho, do you want me to expose your adolescent phase?

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,600
I'll erase it. I'll erase it.

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,420
Who do you think you're messing with?

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,610
Wow. Seriously.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,500
Are you sure you don't have to go home even though it's the weekend?

24
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,370
Do you have that many assignments?

25
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,190
I do have a lot of assignments, and

26
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,230
it also takes me a long time because I'm not good at it.

27
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,040
So you're going to stay at the lab?

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,200
Yes. I can at least get the help when I'm there.

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,100
Someone had thrown Ji Min's uniform away in the trash can.

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,990
And it was all stained, too.

31
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,590
Is anything wrong lately?

32
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,690
Anything wrong? Nothing, really.

33
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,540
I would tell you if something was up.

[DAY6 - "Maple Latte"]

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,170
What song is this?

36
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,400
It's good.

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
Right?

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,050
It's called "Maple Latte."

39
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,680
A really hot song about having a crush.

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,300
A crush?

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,800
Why? Do you have a crush right now?

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,600
Yes.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,420
On whom?

44
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,420
Well...

45
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,890
A sunbae in the (entering) class of 2016 from our school.

46
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,740
I met him for the first time this semester.

47
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,530
In the entering class of 2016

48
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,820
and met for the first time this semester...

49
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,850
Then why don't you try confessing to him?

50
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,190
I'm still so nervous about having a crush

51
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,150
that I haven't even thought about confessing.

52
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,140
He might...

53
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,170
be looking forward to it (thinks she likes him).

54
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,100
Do you really think I should do that?

55
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,300
Joo Ah.

56
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,000
You can drink this while working.

57
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,920
I can drink this?

58
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,230
Yes.

59
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,600
It's my answer to your feelings.

60
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,040
What?

61
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,430
[YES]

62
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,000
Good work.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,070
It's because you helped me out.

64
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,950
Thanks.

65
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,780
[Assignments]

66
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,800
But we only finished one?

67
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,400
On top of that, this isn't the only class we're taking, either.

68
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,100
Still, at least we've cleared one assignment.

69
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,880
[Parents' wedding anniversary]

70
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,940
What is it?

71
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,520
Is something wrong?

72
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,160
No.

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,250
I forgot that it's my parents' wedding anniversary.

74
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,100
Geez.

75
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,130
How could I have forgotten this?

76
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,330
Why don't you send a cake over if it bothers you that much?

77
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,830
There are lots of cake deliveries these days.

78
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,070
Should I?

79
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,850
Hold on.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,500
Yes. Is this Ballerina Bakery?

81
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,290
Are same-day deliveries possible?

82
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,340
Yes, it's a bit urgent.

83
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,790
Oh, really?

84
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,170
Okay. Please make it pretty. Thank you.

85
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,190
We just need to send them the address and the message via text.

86
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,710
I'll give you their number.

87
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,400
You helped me with both the assignment and the cake.

88
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,820
Thank you for everything today.

89
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,100
If you're thankful, you should buy me a meal.

90
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,990
- Right now?
- Yeah.

91
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm hungry.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
Then let's have Ji Min join us too.

93
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,500
- Huh?
- I don't think Ji Min has eaten, either.

94
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,470
I'll call her.

95
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,790
Okay.

96
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,200
You should stop grilling and eat too, Ha Neul.

97
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,340
I am eating. You eat a lot.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,900
Excuse me, you're the Magnet Couple, right?

99
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,400
- Yes.
- Oh, really?

100
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,740
I've only seen you on SeoRab.

101
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,190
You guys look better together in person!

102
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,990
If it's okay with you, can I post a photo with you guys?

103
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,650
It will be great publicity if I post that you came to our restaurant.

104
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,190
That dessert cafe you went to last time blew up, too.

105
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,700
I'll give you free beverages. Please?

106
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,300
- Sure, go ahead.
- Thank you!

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,830
Can you take a picture for us?

108
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,030
Sure.

109
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,580
I'll take it then.

110
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,700
Thank you. Thank you!

111
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,660
Thank you.

112
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,350
That key ring...

113
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,510
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

114
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,720
I got it when I was buying yours as a buy two get one free deal.

115
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,790
I was thinking about throwing it out, but that would be a waste.

116
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,940
But...

117
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,210
carrying it together is a bit weird, right?

118
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,990
No.

119
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,940
Why am I the only one with a different color?

120
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,400
What?

121
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,930
I thought that color will suit you well.

122
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,390
You and Ha Neul can use it as a couple's item

123
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,730
and you and I can use it as a friendship item.

124
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,820
That's true!

125
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,180
Then will it be a friendship item for two engineering students for you two?

126
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,960
I guess?

127
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,300
Ji Min, do you want to come over to my house tomorrow?

128
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,080
- Tomorrow?
- Sure.

129
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,320
I have some leftover ingredients from yesterday's mille-feuille nabe.

130
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,510
I'll make some for you if you come over.

131
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,000
Mille-feuille nabe?

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,500
- You even know how to make that?
- Yes.

133
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,930
I'm a pretty good cook.

134
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,140
- I want to go. I'm really going, then?
- Sure.

135
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,400
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye!

136
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,440
I can't believe you remembered our wedding anniversary. I'm so touched.

137
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,640
What is it?

138
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,330
It was their wedding anniversary?

139
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,200
Yeah. I forgot about it until earlier today.

140
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,770
The cake is really pretty.

141
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,270
How did you think to pick this one?

142
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,270
Ro Sa picked it out for me earlier.

143
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,800
- They got it safely?
- Yeah.

144
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,290
Mom really likes it.

145
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,980
Thanks.

146
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,580
Oh, my! My Cha Min Ho is still awake.

147
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,600
Ta-da!

148
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,070
Wait. Are you drunk?

149
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,850
Hey.

150
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,780
Today...

151
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,070
it's a...

154
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,990
Have a bite.

155
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,640
Wash up and sleep.

156
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,740
Go inside and sleep.

157
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,880
I shouldn't have come home.

158
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,800
You should give your mom a call.

159
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,500
I think she might feel lonely on a day like this.

160
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Okay. I will.

161
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,100
[No. 1]

162
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,770
Did you really like the cake, Mom?

163
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,300
I did.

164
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,800
Since when were you so sensible, my son?

165
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,610
My friend picked it out.

166
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,530
Your girlfriend?

167
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,500
No, a friend.

168
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,100

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,170
Gil Mok Jin?

330
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,420
Yes, Noona.

331
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,540
I'm on my way to Joo Ah's part-time job. Do you want to join me?

332
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,380
- Excuse me?
- I owe you for that orange juice.

333
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,700
I'll buy the food and coffee.

334
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,770
Sure.

335
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,640
Let's go.

336
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
It's the weekend. What were you doing?

337
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,980
I was cleaning the dorm room.

338
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,470
I washed the blankets, cleaned the windowsills, and mopped the floors.

339
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,520
You washed the blankets when it's only been a week?

340
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,650
What are you saying? You have to wash them at least once a week.

341
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,800
Do you know how blissful it is to sleep smelling the scent of detergent on your blanket on Sunday night?

342
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,150
Contemplating which detergent to use every week is my joy.

343
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,300
You heard the entire conversation I had with the guy in front of the dorm earlier, right?

344
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,340
- Is it your new crush, Unni?
- No, my ex-boyfriend.

345
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,630
You're seeing him again?

346
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,700
No way. I never get back together with an ex.

347
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,580
She cut him off so brutally.

348
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,630
It was kind of scary.

349
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,970
You did well.

350
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,950
You're my dating role model.

351
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:34,370
When I date a guy in the future, I'll set your three rules as my dating motto.

352
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,690
What's that?

353
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,220
Oh, that? Three things you shouldn't do when you're in a relationship.

354
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,370
Number one, never do what your lover doesn't like.

355
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,630
Number two, no two-timing or overlapping relationships.

356
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,130
Number three, never date a guy who doesn't keep these two rules.

357
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,920
There shouldn't be a problem in your relationship if these rules are upheld.

358
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,330
How does that sound, psychology major?

359
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,220
I'm better than you at dating psychology, right?

360
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,680
He said that he doesn't see me as a woman.

361
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,790
What do I do?

362
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,820
It's okay.

363
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,680
I shouldn't have confessed to him.

364
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,900
If I hadn't, I could've kept crushing on him.

365
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,790
Hey, don't cry.

366
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,580
Let's just drink till we drop today

367
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,560
and forget about it.

368
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,810
I shouldn't have told him.

369
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,460
Then why did he ask me to watch a movie together?

370
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,230
Why did he tell me not to go on a blind date? Why?

371
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,070
What is it?

372
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,900
Why the long face?

373
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,700
You look worse than usual.

374
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,990
Did something happen?

375
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,600
Today, a customer

376
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,860
was crying because she got rejected after confessing her feelings.

377
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,240
It felt like I was looking at my future.

378
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,370
What if I end up like her?

379
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,980
One-sided love.

380
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,780
I don't think it suits you.

381
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,880
You're overthinking things now.

382
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,000
Is something going on with you, too?

383
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,400
Weddings probably cost a lot of money, right?

384
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,600
I heard on the news that it costs several million won (thousands of dollars).

385
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,020
Is Min Joo Unni getting married?

386
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,430
Yeah.

387
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,460
Amazing! That's great news!

388
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,910
Why do you look so down about such a happy event?

389
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,440
Hey...

390
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,930
- Do you feel like you're losing your noona?
- Am I a child?

391
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,550
Hey, Cha Min Ho...

392
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,370
Want to go for a drink?

393
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,950
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

394
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,440
The true delicious restaurant of Seoyeon University was here all along!

395
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,980
This is so good.

396
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,900
I told you I'm a pretty good cook.

397
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,110
This is the first time I'm cooking for a friend.

398
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,340
How touching.

399
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,210
I took a photo of this and posted it on Stargram.

400
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,420
And people are asking which restaurant this is in the comment section.

401
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,190
- Really?
- Yeah.

402
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,160
Is this

403
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,100
account yours?

404
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,190
The ID is similar to yours.

405
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,590
Yeah. I made a secondary account.

406
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,580
Why?

407
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,840
I just wanted to post photos of things I like.

408
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,980
Such as a hobby.

409
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,050
That reminds me, Ro Sa.

410
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:16,340
Do you want to split the cost and share our Yeonflix ID?

411
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,590
Among Ha Neul, you, and me.

412
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,530
Oh, I would love to.

413
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,080
It was a bit too expensive to pay on my own.

414
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,500
What do you watch on Yeonflix these days?

415
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,200
I mostly watch sci-fi and fantasy.

416
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,170
Really? You watch the same thing as Ha Neul!

417
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,640
I only watch romantic comedies, and Ha Neul only watches sci-fi.

418
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,630
Oh, really?

419
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,700
Our preferences are polar opposite.

420
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,200
So I think it's amazing that we're dating.

421
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,920
Why? How so?

422
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,230
Well, first of all, our food preferences are totally different.

423
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,730
I love spicy foods, and Ha Neul can't tolerate even a little spice.

424
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,090
I know nothing about games,

425
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,230
but Ha Neul is a total gamer.

426
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,720
The only similarity between us is

427
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,790
- that we both like baseball.
- I see.

428
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,460
They say that opposites attract.

429
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,030
Is that so?

430
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,990
Ji Min,

431
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,280
you know...

432
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,940
I'm only telling this to you.

433
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,720
There's someone I like.

434
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,070
Really?

435
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,540
Who is it?

436
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:33,000
He's a sunbae in my major, but you probably wouldn't know him.

437
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,910
- You don't have a photo?
- What?

438
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,790
I don't have a photo, and I can't seem to find him

439
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,040
on any SNS as if he doesn't have one.

440
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,270
Too bad.

441
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,170
I'm so curious.

442
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,100
My heart flutters every time I meet him.

443
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,770
But there's no one I can talk to about him.

444
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:02,530
I wanted to tell you since you told me you had a crush before.

445
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,380
- I wanted to hear your story, too.
- Yes. I'm glad you did.

446
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,830
I was so desperate in my one-sided love.

447
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,010
- Really?
- Yeah!

448
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,070
What were you like?

449
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,850
Oh, yeah. I said I would tell you the full story, right?

450
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,000
How did you two meet?

451
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,440
I never thought Noona would get married so quickly.

452
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,250
I wanted to gift it to her

453
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,360
when I saved more for her wedding fund.

454
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,300
So how much have you saved up?

455
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,660
A little over 10 million won (10,000 USD).

456
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,180
- What? Ten million won?
- Yes.

457
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,840
Hey, do you think there are a lot of people our age who have saved that much money?

458
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,010
I have 120,000 won (120 USD) in my bank account right now.

459
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,760
You saved up all that while earning your own allowance and paying for your dorm?

460
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,930
No wonder...

461
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,590
I always wondered why a full scholarship student was so fixated on work studies

462
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,940
and doing various part-time jobs.

463
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,350
That was all for your noona?

464
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,470
How much more can you do than this?

465
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,950
Your noona will be so touched.

466
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,580
You think so?

467
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,120
Look at you, our Min Ho...

468
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,880
You were taking good care of your noona all this time.

469
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,420
You're so good, Cha Min Ho.

470
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,800
Hey. We're done drinking.

471
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,810
Let's go.

472
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,140
Sure, let's go.

473
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,000
- Whoa!
- What?

474
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Our school's convenience store has choux cream macarons now. Great.

475
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,730
You scared me.

476
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,200
Hey,

477
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,180
you said Moon Joon Sunbae's ideal type was Suzy, right?

478
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,900
Yeah.

479
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,010
I'll show you Suzy tomorrow.

480
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,510
Don't be too shocked.

481
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,100
Suzy?

482
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,090
- You?
- Correct.

483
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,900
Stop spewing nonsense.

484
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,300
Hey. Do you even know my charms?

485
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,070
[Choux cream macarons are now in the Seoyeon convenience store]

486
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,300
Hey, Dongsaengdeul,

487
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,590
don't you think we can save up for the

488
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,950
robot vacuum cleaner I mention before?

489
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,400
Why do we need a vacuum when our room is small?

490
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,300
How great would it be to have it clean the room while I'm out?

491
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,180
- We can do it while you're out.
 - [Joo Ah] Hey! Are you ready to see Suzy?

492
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,880
- But you guys don't clean.
- Yes, we do.
- I'm ready to throw up.

493
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,300
If that's so, why is there so much dust then?

494
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,180
Dust is something that constantly piles up.

495
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,820
Ha Neul!

496
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,630
- You're here?
- Hello.

497
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,780
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

498
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,700
I slept late trying to finish my assignment.

499
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,240
- Still?
- Why isn't she coming out?

500
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,710
Yeah, I'm almost done.

501
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,210
Cha Min Ho!

502
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,680
Joo Ah, you're so pretty today.

503
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,410
You're getting prettier by the day because you're in love.

504
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,170
Really?

505
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,200
It's all thanks to the dress you lent me.

506
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,700
Let me know whenever you need one.

507
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,970
I'll do my best to support you.

508
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:44,550
Unni, you're the best.

509
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,900
Hey! How do I look?

510
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,580
You do look like Suzy...

511
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,860
What? Really?

512
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,490
What's going on?

513
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,410
I look like her?

514
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,110
If I look at you like this,

515
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,940
you look like her for a split second.

516
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,130
You little...

517
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,260
You're right! She really looks like her if I do that.

518
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,010
- Right, right?
- She looks similar.

519
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,030
You look just like her.

520
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,720
Aren't you being harsh?

521
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,170
No really! You look the same.

522
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,580
Everyone is so mean.

523
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,430
Hey, why did you wear heels when you can't even walk in them?

524
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,400
It's because these are new.

525
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,310
Our school is pretty big.

526
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:32,400
I realize that, too, when I have to jog with the Cheer Squad.

527
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,900
It's deadly during summer.

528
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,950
I know.

529
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,040
I can't tell if we're going to school or hiking.

530
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,200
Noona, that was a nice rhyme.

531
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,300
Going to school, hiking, and my back fat. Swag!
(T/N: All the words start with "deung")

532
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,080
Stop.

533
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,890
I'm sorry.

534
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:53,200
I'm craving something sweet since I'm exercising first thing in the morning.

535
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,400
Get in if you're on your way to class.

536
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,670
Sunbae, hello!

537
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,250
Hyung, I don't think all of us can fit.

538
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,530
That's your crush, right?

539
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,400
Get in.

540
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,850
Sunbae, I wore heels today,

541
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,550
so is it okay if I owe you a favor?

542
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,260
Of course.

543
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,570
H-Hold on.

544
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,800
Did my leg suddenly cramp up? Why does it hurt so much?

545
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,480
Hyung, can I ask you a favor, too?

546
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,100
Sure.

547
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,620
Hyung, Noona, I'll see you later in class.

548
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,200
Okay.

549
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,340
You look a little different today, Joo Ah.

550
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,980
The dress looks good on you.

551
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,380
Thank you.

552
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Joo Ah, can you give that paper bag to Min Ho in the back?

553
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,100
Yes, sure.

554
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,770
What is all this?

555
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,980
It's not much.

556
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,000
I remembered that you wanted to go to Levan,

557
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,340
so I stopped by the company to get them for you.

558
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,920
Great.

559
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,620
Hyung, thank you so much

560
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,030
for bringing me all these.

561
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,880
You're so attentive, Sunbae.

562
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,270
Joo Ah, I have something for you, too.

563
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,540
What? Mine, too?

564
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,040
Open the compartment in front of you.

565
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,610
There's a really delicious macaron place in front of my house.

566
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,030
They're really popular.

567
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,060
It seemed like you like macarons, too.

568
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,540
Thank you, Sunbae.

569
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,470
I guess everyone is so conscious about the SeoRab confession post.

570
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,160
Oh, really?

571
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,230
How cute.

572
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,360
Isn't it so pretty?

573
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,280
I've never seen so many people dress up like this for a Monday morning class.

574
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,640
Oppa, did you have a nice weekend?

575
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,360
Yes.

576
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,000
Unni, how come you look so pretty today?

577
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,660
You look exactly like Suzy today!

578
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,590
You're so disgusting.

579
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,330
Gosh, you're so...

580
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,520
It's me.

581
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,640
Nowadays, we've moved on

582
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,500
from judging based upon appearances of objects

583
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,000
onto exploring the invisible world

584
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,840
and the mysterious nature of men's subconscious.

585
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,600
Everyone, you're aware of what a maple tree symbolizes, right?

586
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,890
Midterms!

587
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,790
How funny.

588
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,610
This is a photography class, after all.

589
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:03,460
Don't you think our class should at least take photos of maple trees on campus?

590
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:08,980
So, with an open theme, I'll take you all out on a photography outing on campus.

591
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,120
Is that something to be so surprised about?

592
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,630
After you take a picture of a person on campus with your phone,

593
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,610
you must title it and

594
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,640
submit it 30 minutes before class ends.

595
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,840
Now, hoping that you will all take a photo of your lifetime,

596
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,900
shall we begin?

597
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,910
Over here?

598
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,290
I need to take a photo of my life today.

599
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,750
Okay, I'll take it for you.

600
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,510
You should take it.

601
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,710
Come here.

602
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,970
- Smile.
- One, two, three.

603
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,130
Stand up.

604
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,610
- Smile.
- One, two, three.

605
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,800
Without being awkward.

606
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,900
Thank you.

607
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,900
Oppa, can you take a picture of me?

608
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,460
Me?

609
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,320
Sure, stand here.

610
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,910
Ready?

611
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,860
One, two, three!

612
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
You're really good.

613
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,890
I was a fitting model in the past.

614
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,470
Should I take yours, too?

615
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,420
Me?

616
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,950
Sure.

617
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,280
One, two, three!

618
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,650
One, two...

619
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,350
Oppa, you're too awkward.

620
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,270
Should I take another one?

621
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,710
Sunbae.

622
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,380
Do you want to see the pictures I took?

623
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,600
When did you take this?

624
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,750
Candid pictures tend to come out better.

625
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,860
Joo Ah, stand here. I'll take a picture of you.

626
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,850
Huh? Of me?

627
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,710
Hold on...

628
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,600
Stand here. I'll take one for you.

629
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,500
- Okay.
- Which filter do you want?

630
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,310
Today, the landscape needs to come out nice,

631
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,490
- so, just the normal mode.
- Okay.

632
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,470
I'll take it now.

633
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,660
One, two...

634
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,730
You're pretty.

635
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,510
- Really?
- Yeah.

636
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,980
One, two, three.

637
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,340
Noona!

638
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,100
You haven't taken a photo yet, right? Take one with me.

639
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,850
Let's take one for each other.

640
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,790
This is tiresome.

641
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:05,290
Sure, then stand here.

642
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,680
Okay.

643
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,870
The sun is... A little more to the left.

644
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,850
No, back to the right again...

645
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,080
- Smile. Smile!
- Hurry up.

646
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,570
Okay.

647
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,810
- Check it out.
- It's okay. I'm sure it looks good.

648
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,890
You stand here now.

649
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,350
Ready?

650
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,100
Noona, you didn't even countdown.

651
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,600
- I think I blinked, so—
- You didn't blink.

652
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,200
Am I coming out great?

653
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,870
As expected, once everyone stepped out of the lecture hall,

654
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:58,500
your expressions were so cheery.

655
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,970
Looking good!

656
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,800
- You want to die?
- Wow, amazing!

657
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,690
Who took this photo?

658
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,470
Comp-sci, (entering) class of 2019, Cha Min Ho.

659
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:18,120
The person in this photo is...

660
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,700
I guess you two must be close?

661
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,240
Yes, we've been best friends since we were nine years old.

662
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,530
Then what would the title of this photo be?

663
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:33,500
"The Obstacle of My Life"

664
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,620
This photo also came out very naturally.

665
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,110
Who took this one?

666
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,280
Comp-sci, (entering) class of 2018, Choi Ro Sa.

667
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,830
Is the guy in the photo your boyfriend?

668
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,070
No.

669
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,640
Just a guy friend.

670
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,510
I submitted it because it came out the best out of all the photos I took today.

671
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,800
A guy friend.

672
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,170
Isn't that what a boyfriend is?

673
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,100
Before we end, I'll announce the first assignment of the Photography and Appreciation class.

674
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,200
Visit the Han Ah Reum Photo Exhibition in groups of two and submit a report.

675
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,600
I'll post the details on the announcement forum.

676
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,500
All right. Everyone must be tired from the photo outing.

677
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,390
This is it for today's class.

678
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:33,070
Thank you!

679
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,830
I got surprised because Ha Neul's photo suddenly appeared.

680
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,950
Oh, well...

681
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,750
I took a lot of these photos, too.

682
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,500
I need a good grade in this class,

683
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,630
so I just submitted the best photo taken.

684
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:58,510
I didn't realize Professor would display all of them like that.

685
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,570
I should've told you beforehand.

686
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:03,140
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

687
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,000
Can you send me Ha Neul's photos?

688
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,530
- So I can use them for my profile?
- Sure.

689
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,050
This is so embarrassing. My face is exposed now.

690
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,300
Why? It's a great photo.

691
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,010
Also, it's okay since your face is already exposed on SeoRab.

692
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:25,200
When should we go to the photo exhibition?

693
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,710
We both end classes early on Friday. Should we go then?

694
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:29,930
Sure.

695
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,960
- Ha Neul!
- Oh, hi, Sunbae.

696
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,940
She's our PR ambassador sunbae.

697
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,390
I met you during the interview.

698
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,610
Yes, that's right.

699
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:44,300
Ha Neul! You really look like a computer science student now.

700
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,270
How's switching majors? Is it doable?

701
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,560
It's hell.

702
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,130
You have no one to game with since Pu Reum left for the exchange program.

703
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,490
I guess.

704
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:52,870
Oh, wait.

705
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:55,530
Wasn't your wish back then to game with your girlfriend?

706
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:58,890
You can game together now that you have a girlfriend.

707
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:01,980
It's fine. I'm also busy with my major, so I don't game these days.

708
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,280
I know switching majors is exhausting but come by the club room.

709
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,370
You haven't escaped promoting the school with us just yet.

710
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,440
Okay.

711
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,830
I'll get going. Let's grab some food next time.

712
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:13,420
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

713
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,370
Do you have another assignment after class today?

714
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:24,760
Hmm... I'm going to do just one simple one today.

715
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,010
Then...

716
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,840
teach me how to game.

717
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,030
I want to try.

718
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,680
Is it because of what Sunbae said earlier?

719
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,510
It's okay. You don't usually game.

720
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,260
No.

721
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,700
My boyfriend's dream is to become a game developer,

722
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:44,230
so I should know how to play the games you make in the future.

723
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:47,970
In order to do that, I should start practicing now.

724
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,600
Teach me today.

725
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,890
- Today?
- Yes.

726
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,610
Okay.

727
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,120
Don't worry. I'm taking good care of myself.

728
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:02,220
What do you mean I sound bad?

729
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,080
A confirmation photo?

730
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,630
Okay. I'll send it now.

731
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:11,670
Then you'll believe me, okay?

732
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,960
Hey.

733
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,560
Can you lend me a drop of your blood?

734
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,970
What?

735
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:28,460

738
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,500
Thanks.

739
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,310
But what are you doing?

740
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,320
I'm diabetic. Type 1, to be specific.

741
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,500
Since yesterday, my blood sugar has been up and down,

742
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,330
and my mom keeps worrying as if she senses something.

743
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,410
So I sent her a picture of a normal blood sugar level.

744
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,600
Although, it's not my blood.

745
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,700
So, you need to measure this every day?

746
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,790
Yeah. I'm used to it now.

747
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,890
Hey, don't look at me with pity like that. I hate that.

748
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:08,700
It's not like that.

749
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,960
Then this is...

750
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,910
Oh, this is an insulin syringe.

751
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,670
Now you know what this pouch is for, right?

752
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,290
Yes.

753
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,580
I keep being indebted to you.

754
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,380
I'll repay the cost of your blood with an expensive meal.

755
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,480

Right. That photo exhibition!

759
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,330
You don't think I'll be rejected by Joon Sunbae if I ask him, do you?

760
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,700
Who knows?

761
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,040
No.

762
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,720
I'm still going to gather the courage to ask him.

763
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,830
What do I do?

764
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:55,730
I have always dreamed of going to a photo exhibition with my boyfriend.

What is this?

767
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,480
This is what I wanted.

768
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,900
Did you buy it from the convenience store for me?

769
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,300
As if. I bought it for myself.

770
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:13,800
Wow. How stingy.

771

Yeah. So I want to learn properly now.

You said more the merrier when it comes to gaming.

818
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,220
Let's go. Let's go.

819
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,660
- Sure.
- Let's go.

820
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,300
I'm going to move out, so gather at the entrance, everyone.

821
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,330
Okay. Ji Min, where are you located?

822
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:12,370
Me? I think I'm on the second floor.

823
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,270
I can't find the stairs.

824
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,390
If you see a window, just jump out since you're on the second floor.

825
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,330
I'm going to jump down now.

826
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:24,610
What? What happened to you?

827
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,820
I guess I was on the fifth floor.

828
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:34,650
Ji Min, you hide here. We'll kill them off.

829
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,130
Okay.

830
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,300
- Ro Sa, are you alive?
- Yes.

831
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,400
- Come over to me.
- Okay.

832
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,900
- Do you need anything?
- Do you have a med bag?

833
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,400
Yeah, I do. I do. I'll give it to you.

834
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,760
Hi, guys.

835
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,560
- You're in the middle of a game?
- Hyung, you're here?

836
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,170
Focus. Focus.

837
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,180
Ji Min, why aren't you doing anything?

838
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,290
Aren't you in the same game?

839
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:06,100
He told me to hide

840
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,460
since it's more distracting if I move around.

841
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,420
I understand the gist of it.

842
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,510
You're a newbie, huh?

843
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,550
You can go there.

844
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,700
Oh? That's right! Nice!

845
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,420
- That was great!
- You saw that, right?

846
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,000
You're good.

847
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,700
There you go.

848
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,700
Let's all play a different game since Oppa is here.

849
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,400
Sure.

850
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,670
Sounds good. I'll sit here.

851
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:33,900
Pass. Pass!

852
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,600
- Corner them.
- Huh?

853
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,060
- Press D.
- Good job!

854
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,540
- Press D and Space...
- Nice, nice!

855
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,070
No, it's okay. It's not over yet. We still have time. Focus.

856
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,230
- Which one am I?
- You're the guy that's running over there.

857
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:50,100
- Where's the ball?
- Right there!

858
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,880
Good. Good job! That's it!

859
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,260
- That's it! Run!
- I said S is to pass.

860
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,490
S!

861
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:58,420
No! You need to pass it to our team!

862
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,600
Shoot! Shoot!

863
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,100
Goal!

864
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,780
I should've let you score at least one goal.

865
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:17,680
Nah, you can't do that. It's a bet, so play fair and square.

866
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,220
What?

867
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,200
- Ro Sa, you're good.
- Right?

868
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,660
But...

869
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,150
don't you think I'll improve if I keep trying?

870
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,290
Well, you see...

871
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,970
I don't think you have the brain for gaming.

872
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:47,950
We can do something other than gaming.

873
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:50,080
I'm so thankful that

874
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,500
you tried to do something that I like.

875
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,210
But...

876
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:59,850
earlier, when I couldn't score a goal,

877
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,950
you were genuinely angry, huh?

878
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,320
No!

879
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,890
I was just too focused on the game that I reacted like that.

880
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,060
Focused?

881
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,720
That means you were genuine.

882
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,000
It's not.

883
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,560
- What do you mean it's not?
- That wasn't me.

884
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,830
- That wasn't you?
- Yeah.

885
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:18,200
I was on a date with my boyfriend until now, but that wasn't you?

886
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,060
I'll game less from now on.

887
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,580
I'm sorry.

888
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,760
Cheers?

889
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,050
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

890
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,100
Oh, right.

891
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,710
My boss knows about you two.

892
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,960
We were in the same club as Min Woo Hyung, so we're all close.

893
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,180
So he said we can hang out at the store freely if it's with you two.

894
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,310
SeoRab!

895
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,990
Why?

896
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:48,160
Our picture came up on SeoRab.

897
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,110
You're right.

898
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:56,160
"I am the one who wrote the Maple Latte post."

899
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,740
Whoa, daebak!

900
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,100
The topic of today's class was to take a photo of someone,
[Dear. My first love]

901
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,690
so I used that as an excuse to take a picture of that person.

902
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:08,830
That person probably didn't notice how nervous and excited I was.

903
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:12,730
I never knew I'd anticipate a Monday elective class like this.

904
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:15,020
This! This is from today's attendance screen, right?

905
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,100
Yeah.

906
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,040
I guess the Maple Latte confession guy posted this.

907
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,610
You don't think it's a girl?

908
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,500
Moon Joon Sunbae's picture is here, too.

909
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,080
Is there someone else other than me who has a crush on Joon sunbae?

910
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,430
That won't do!

911
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:29,510
Wait.

912
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:32,000
It could be Ji Min Unni or Ha Neul Oppa.

913
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,410
Wait, that won't do, either!

914
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,440
You two have such a great relationship.

915
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,460
Why?

916
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,770
Your picture is there too, Joo Ah. It could be you.

917
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,400
Me?

918
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,920
No way.

919
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,480
That's right. You could also be someone's first love.

920
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,660
Me?

921
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,660
Of course it's a very slim possibility.

922
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,150
I was wondering why you were being so nice.

923
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:57,440
The pictures taken today came up.

924
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,550
Oh, yeah.

925
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,810
- I still haven't hit you yet.
- It came out very nice.

926
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,180
- Why? It's cute. Right?
- Right.

927
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,920
Out of all the photos from today, yours was the most heartwarming.

928
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,320
Your beauty is unbelievable, Ji Min Unni.
(T/N: Literally, she said Ji Min's beauty was hard at work)

929
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,100
This came out pretty nice.

930
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,970
Why didn't you show me this?

931
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:27,500
I didn't take this.

932
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,400
Gosh, who else would take it?

933
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,670
Maybe Ro Sa?

934
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:36,200
It's not. She sent me everything she took.

935
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,580
Maybe Ro Sa forgot to send you this.

936
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,380
Did she?

937
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:47,470
[Tue 07:32]

938
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,940
[Tue 07:33]

939
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,470
What date is it today?

940
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:57,760
It's the eighth.

941
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:00,970
The eighth?

942
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:03,010
Today is the eighth?

943
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:07,950
Yeah. Today's the day Joo Ah will go on a date with her crush.

944
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,340
I hope it doesn't rain.

945
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:20,000
Why? Because you won't get to go to the photo exhibition with your crush?

946
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,200
- Yes.
- It's going to be cloudy only in the morning, and clear up in the afternoon.

947
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,620
Don't worry.

948
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:30,160
Who said that? Your personal weather anchor, Ha Neul?

949
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,070
Yes.

950
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,960
With Ro Sa?

951
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,690
Yeah. I'll let you know after asking Ro Sa.

952
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:46,160
Okay.

953
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,880
Ro Sa.

954
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,260
Do you want to do the escape room with Ha Neul and Mok Jin Oppa tomorrow?

955
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,640
Sure! Sounds fun.

956
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,720
Then I'll let them know.

957
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,000
Ji Min Unni, did you change your perfume?

958
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,220
The scent is so nice.

959
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,840
Oh, this?

960
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,300
Ha Neul gave it to me for our 100th day.

961
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,790
I've been saving it, but decided to use it today.

962
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:12,170
- It's good, right?
- Yeah. What's the name of the perfume?

963
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,400
From Purple. It really suits you.

964
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,560
The scent is really nice.

965
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,760
This is nice, right?

966
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,570
Did you wait long?

967
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:26,300
No, I just got here.

968
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,290
What a relief.

969
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,130
Shall we go?

970
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:32,590
Yes.

971
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,700
They said it wasn't going to rain.

972
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,470
It should be fine since the exhibition is indoors.

973
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:08,750
You must all be surprised by the sudden showers.

974
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:11,830
It will be raining from the afternoon in the Seoul area.

975
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:15,810
It's expected to rain a lot, at least 50mm per hour.

976
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:18,650
Please be careful driving in this rain.

977
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,080
Sunbae, I'm really sorry,

978
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,690
but can we go to the exhibition next time?

979
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:31,200
What?

980
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,850
Something urgent came up out of the blue.

981
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:36,300
Are you okay? Is it something bad?

982
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,860
Well...

983
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,380
It's something really urgent.

984
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,500
I'm sorry, Sunbae.

985
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,750
Today, on the eighth, at 7:30 in the morning,

986
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:52,100
the sedan that 47-year-old Mr. Cha was driving skidded in the rain

987
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:55,100
and collided head-on with an oncoming freight truck.

988
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,460
As a result, Mr. Cha and his wife, Ms. Lee, who was sitting in the passenger seat,

989
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,870
both passed away at the scene.

990
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,540
♫ What words could express my feelings? ♫

991
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:39,450
♫ All the words in me are not enough ♫

992
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:45,700
♫ So many clumsy words I had spoken without knowing ♫

993
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:52,100
♫ You held me together ♫

994
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,800
What about the exhibition?

995
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:02,500
I didn't go since it rained.

996
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:10,100
♫ You were always there when we were happy in that brilliant season ♫

997
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:15,710
♫ My long held dream was always you ♫

998
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:19,400
♫ My heart ♫

999
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:25,600
♫ My heart goes to you ♫

1000
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,280
♫ While looking at your smiling face ♫

1001
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:47,070
♫ I can't help but smile with you unconsciously, too ♫

1002
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:53,250
♫ I got used to it like a habit ♫

1003
01:01:53,250 --> 01:02:00,180
♫ You also became like me ♫

1004
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:03,370
♫ In each of my brilliant memories ♫

1005
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:07,710
[Dear. M]

1006
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:17,600
♫ You were always there when we were happy in that brilliant season ♫

1007
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,440
♫ My long held dream ♫

1008
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,350
~ Preview ~
It's okay if we join you, right?

1009
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:25,370
Stop getting in the way and leave.

1010
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,600
Min Ho, do you like Joo Ah?

1011
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,590
Why did the title suddenly change to Dear.M?

1012
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:33,320
Maybe M is one of their initials?

1013
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,640
I keep thinking that someone might be in love with my boyfriend.

1014
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,380
It may not mean much now,

1015
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:43,820
but you shouldn't keep making opportunities for them to be together.

1016
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:48,660
Do you like Ha Neul?

1017
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,400
♫ By your side ♫
