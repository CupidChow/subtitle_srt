[KSN Sports Announcer Lee Da Yeong's Interview Strategy]

3
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,270
How cool.

4
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,500
We would like you to introduce yourself using the item you see in front of you.

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,750
Miss Im Min Ah, you can start when you're ready.

6
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,000
Just like coffee that always gives you strength when you are stressed or sleepy,

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,400
I also want to become an announcer who can energize viewers.

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,790
Like a coffee that has an exceptional scent and flavor,

9
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:17,210
I also want to become an announcer who captures an audience with high-quality programming.

10
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,740
I don't want to become an announcer who's like a cup of coffee.

11
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,290
A baseball player who enters the major league,

12
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,300
but retires after just one game is called a "cup of coffee player."

13
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,320
They're considered "cup of coffee" players.

14
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,890
To some people, having stood on a big stage like the major leagues

15
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,040
might be fulfilling a lifelong dream.

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,920
But if I were to stand on stage as a sports announcer that I've only dreamed about,

17
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,790
I would become an announcer who doesn't miss any opportunities

18
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,480
to make sure that my first stage does not become my last.

19
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,140
The connection of coffee to baseball is original.

20
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,730
Miss Ma Joo Ah, you must be really interested in baseball.

21
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,390
You even know major league vocabulary.

22
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,380
Yes.

23
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,840
I studied diligently for well-rounded reporting.

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,060
Then, if you were an interviewer, out of the three of you,

25
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,330
who would you choose?

26
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,900
Pardon?

27
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,470
I would choose me.

28
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,660
I may lack experience compared to the other applicants,

29
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,410
but I believe that I'll be able to provide sincere reports

30
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,780
through my passion and knowledge of baseball.

31
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,860
You said yourself that you lack the experience,

32
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,580
is that what you're admitting?

33
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,400
Well...

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,390
Ma Joo Ah, right?

35
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,020
The report content is very good.

36
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,330
But you severely lack the training of an announcer.

37
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,890
You don't even have the basic skills of an announcer. Do you think it's right for us to choose you

38
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,180
for knowing a bit about baseball?

39
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,170
The reason I lack the skills of an announcer...

40
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,100
is because it hasn't been that long since I developed this dream.

41
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,620
However, I feel that as late as I started behind others,

42
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,200
I studied that much harder as well.

43
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,400
I will practice more diligently to

44
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,730
- make up for my lacking annou—
- Miss Joo Ah?

45
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,300
This isn't a place for practicing.

46
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,840
Even if you come fully prepared, this position isn't guaranteed.

It was delicious.

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,990
Then shall we go?

79
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,520
The café next door is really popular, too.

and you've been to the café.

Then you should've told me that you've been there when I sent you our date course.

I don't want to go somewhere you visited with another man.

Well...

95

Hey, why are you getting upset over that? So petty.

What?

How could I not get upset?

99
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,410
Everything's a first for me, but you've already done all of it.

100
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,170
And you could've just told me that you've been here before.

101
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,140
Why lie to me?

102
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,770
You just made me feel more pathetic.

103
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,710
I didn't lie to you. I just didn't have the chance to tell you.

104
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,000
It was your first time. Just think of it as an experience.

I don't know.

167
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,570
"Let's just leave first love as a first love."

168
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,590
Something like that, maybe.

169
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,900
SeoRab!

170
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,200
[Dear, My First Love. Thank you for presenting spring to my fall.]

171
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,230
SeoRab!

172
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,970
Daebak!

173
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,200
Ji Min Unni made Cheer Leader!

174
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,730
She did!

175
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,890
Wow, Ji Min.

176
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,100
Isn't our school's Cheer Squad Leader the ultimate authority?

177
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,500
She's so cool!

178
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,480
Let's sit here for a sec.

179
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,200
[Joo Ah] Unni, congratulations!

180
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,300
[Yeong Unni] Roomie, let's throw a celebratory party.

181
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,790
You're getting a lot of congratulatory messages, right?

182
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,860
Yes. From my close friends.

183
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,240
I bet

184
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,110
your boyfriend was the very first one to congratulate you, right?

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,050
What?

186
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,170
Boyfriend?

187
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,380
Aren't you back together with Ha Neul Sunbae?

188
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,840
No. Why?

189
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,890
Ha Neul Sunbae came looking for us.

190
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,180
I know that me asking the two of you

191
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,890
might be overstepping boundaries,

192
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,210
but this is the only thing I can do.

193
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,190
I don't think either of you want Ji Min to leave the squad either.

194
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,060
You two should know better than I do

195
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,350
how sincere Ji Min was about the Cheer Squad.

196
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,630
So we...

197
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,410
thought you two were dating again.

198
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,520
Hello?

199
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,190
Congratulations.

200
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,960
Well, thank you.

201
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,830
But you didn't even tell me that you were back in the squad.

202
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,200
I'm a little hurt.

203
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,410
Well, it just happened.

204
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,340
Then throw a celebratory party with me.

205
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,130
You haven't forgotten about today, right?

206
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,810
See you later, at 8 p.m.

207
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,690
Okay, I got it.

208
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,220
Here.

209
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,700
I washed it clean.

210
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,650
Thank you.

211
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,900
I should be thanking you.

212
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,520
- I enjoyed it.
- Sure.

213
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,990
Um...

214
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,770
I...

215
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,740
You know...

216
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,800
Hello?

217
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,360
Yes.

218
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,580
Sure.

219
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,080
Okay.

220
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,170
Yang Hui?

221
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,690
Yeah.

222
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,820
The date.

223
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,700
When are you meeting her?

224
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,700
- Later, at 5 p.m.
- Oh.

225
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,380
There's not much time left.

226
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,450
Take care.

227
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,930
And have fun.

228
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,520
Okay.

229
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,050
[4:35 p.m., November 16]

230
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,110
[Yang Hui] Joo Ah Unni! I'm in front of the dorm.

231
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,620
[Yang Hui] Can you come out for a bit?

232
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,130
Joo Ah Unni!

233
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,040
Did you do well on the cam test?

234
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,090
Huh? Not really.

235
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,880
What about you?

236
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,100
I failed miserably.

237
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,950
How are you so upbeat?

238
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,260
I can always retake the test.

239
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,430
Today's my date with Min Ho Oppa.

240
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,940
I took your advice and wore yellow.

241
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,700
How do I look? Is it okay?

242
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,030
You look pretty.

243
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,690
Really?

244
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,390
I hope Min Ho Oppa will like it, too.

245
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,920
Yeah. Of course.

246
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,170
Good luck on your date.

247
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,380
Thank you, Unni.

248
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,730
What are you going to eat?

249
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,610
The shrimp oil pasta.

250
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,430
What about you?

251
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,910
Then I'll...

252
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,840
This place is known for their shrimp oil pasta.

253
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,200
You should try it, too.

254
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,220
Okay. I'll try that then.

255
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,780
Hurry up and choose!

256
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,570
- What are you going to eat?
- The tomato pasta.

257
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,010
- You eat that, too.
- Hey.

258
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,010
It's such a waste of money to order the same thing!

259
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,940
Why not order a larger portion then?

260
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,660
I... want Gorgonzola!

261
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,680
- Let's share it.
- Sounds good.

262
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,790
- Deal.
- Deal!

263
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,650
I can't wait.

264
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,800
Oppa, how was the movie today?

265
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,630
What? Oh.

266
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,670
It was good for killing time.

267
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,680
Right?

268
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,560
I'm not sure if it's because I could relate to the female lead,

269
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,640
but the male lead's female friend got on my nerves.

270
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,710
You're also really close to Joo Ah Unni.

271
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,520
Was it twelve years of friendship?

272
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,980
Yes.

273
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,170
Oppa, what if

274
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,120
you get a girlfriend in the future...

275
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,080
Oh. Even if that isn't me.

276
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,140
Okay. And?

277
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,570
What if that girlfriend asks you not to hang out with Joo Ah Unni?

278
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,920
What would you do?

279
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,010
With Ma Joo Ah?

280
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,290
Yes.

281
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,000
There are a lot of girls who get bothered by their boyfriends' female friends.

282
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,880
Wait, so you're saying

283
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,520
that you're going to go see Ma Joo Ah while on a date with me?

284
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,980
How long were you on the phone with Joo Ah last night?

285
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,620
So annoying! Ma Joo Ah this! Ma Joo Ah that!

286
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,490
Then I won't meet her.

287
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,290
You must be a devoted boyfriend when in a relationship.

288
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,160
No... I meant that girlfriend.

289
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,650
What?

290
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,510
Shall we?

291
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,160
Let's not think about it.

Do you carry this around with you?

295
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,600

Thank you, Ma Joo Ah.

Thank you for being honest.

00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,030
For accepting my feelings.

502

Thank you to the other language moderators and their teams.

I kept you waiting for so long.

509
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,270
Sorry.

510
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,660
I read your message late.

It's okay.

512
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,310
I told you, "let's meet next time".

513
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,050
Why did you wait?

514
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:02,160
Because I wanted to congratulate you in person.

Thank you.

You probably haven't eaten either.

518
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,900
I feel bad.

519
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,430
It's fine.

520
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:27,890
I ate a little with my cousin.

Since the moment we met,

529
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,040
I think all I've done is receive from you.

530
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,880
I...

531
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,780
was always happy.

532
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,650
Thank you.

533
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,040

And finally, for the interview,

537
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,800
rather than memorizing and reciting prepared answers,

538
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,370
the important thing is to

539
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:55,790
show who you are as a person within the time limit.

540

I hope you don't forget that.

I hope this time today will be helpful to you all.

Hello, Sunbaenim.

545
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,300
Oh, are you...

546
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,700
the person who was interviewed at KSN?

547
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,080
You remember!

548
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,860
Yes, I'm Ma Joo Ah. That's right.

549
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,250
I was the one...

550
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,000
with the lack of announcing skills.

551
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,940
Oh, I see you remember all that.

552
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,890
I was responsible for the stress interview that day.

553
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:44,060
I wanted to give you some helpful feedback, but I think I came off too rigid.

554
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,730
I'm sorry if you were hurt by that.

555
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,750
It's okay! You remembered me.

556
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,530
That in itself is an honor.

557
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,070
Well, I didn't remember you as just the person with

558
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,540
a lack of announcing skills.

559
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,240
You're the one whose report content was very entertaining

560
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,060
and who would benefit significantly from just a bit of adjustment.

561
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,200
That's how I remembered you.

562
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,910
Thank you.

563
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,650
Announcing is something that improves with practice.

Yes.

566
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,720
I'll do my best

567
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,350
and meet you better prepared next time.

I don't think I can stand the sight of you as a leader.

It's because of you.

579
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,030
Even though I was Assistant Leader, you're the one

580

who stood in the spotlight!

581
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,650
And every time I tried to pursue my love interest,

582
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,510
you appeared and ruined everything.

You always get in my way

Fine.

Who am I to think that I'm better than you?

589
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,570
I thought about why in the world you would envy me and get jealous of me

590
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:13,530
and why you would be out to ruin me every chance you got.

591
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:16,530
But now I know

592
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,760
the difference between you and me.

593
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,990
You can't recognize what you've got,

594
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,260
and you only see what others have.

595
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,780
And then you wonder, "Why isn't that mine?"

596
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,060
"Why does she have what I don't?"

597
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,580
You can't hurt yourself, so you resent others.

598
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,710
That's what you do.

599
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,170
Am I wrong?

600
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,920
What you did to me...

601
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,560
I'm not going to tell anyone about that.

602
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,200
I have no thoughts of wasting time on ruining others,

603
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,210
but even if it's not me,

604
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:59,310
you're going to find someone else to envy and resent.

605
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,100
You'll trip yourself over again.

606
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,790
This is the difference between you and me.

it's me, Min Ho.

618
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,870
Now that I think about it,

619
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,990
I haven't written a letter to you since the fifth grade.

620
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,870
I had fought with a classmate that day

621
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:34,440
and you were called to the school.

622
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,490
I wrote a letter to you saying that

623
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:40,990
I was sorry, and I wouldn't do it again.

624
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:45,460
Of course, you were called to school a couple more times after that.

625
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,180
If you think about it,

626
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,400
you never missed out on coming to school for me.

627
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,890
I realized later on,

628
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,720
that, just in case you had to come to my school,

629
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,460
you were never late to work,

630
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,020
never took a vacation,

631
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,630
and never used any of your annual leave days.

632
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,940
And I can tell you now,

633
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,260
but I never once believed in Santa.

634
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:25,440
However, whenever it was Christmas,

635
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,660
you would come to me with sparkling eyes

636
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,340
and tell me that Santa visited us

637
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,750
and you would give me a present.

638
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,500
I couldn't bring myself to disappoint you, so I acted surprised every year,

639
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,710
until I graduated from elementary school.

640
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,810

You kept pushing me to participate in the competition,

667
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:26,080
so I felt anxious and asked him...

668
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,400
to join the competition with me.

669

01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:22,510
The photo isn't doing you justice.

[Dear my first love, the song that flowed out of the speakers on my way to school...]

829
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:42,480
♫ I suddenly think of you ♫

830
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,390
Dongsaengdeul, log into your SeoRab immediately.

831
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:49,690
The photography and appreciation class is totally a hot issue right now.

832
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:54,010
One of the students in the class today wrote a confession post.

833
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:57,480
♫ You keep stealing my attention ♫

834
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,970
What is this? There's a post on SeoRab's forum.

835
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,580
Noona, look at SeoRab right now.

836
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,190
There's a new "Dear.M" post.

837
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:07,400
Really?

838
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,040
♫ You also became like me ♫

839
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,850
Huh? What is this?

840
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:14,740
There is a new post from Maple Latte.

841
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:16,850
Why didn't I see this earlier?

842
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:19,940
♫ Oh, baby ♫

843
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:24,890
♫ Maple Latte, smoothly ♫

844
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:26,880
Three.

01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,630
Four.

846
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,790
Five. Stop!

847
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,670
One!

848
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:38,330
Two!

849
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:04,680
You're killing it. You're killing it.

850
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,560
All done.

851
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,590
- Did it come out nice?
- Yes.

852
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:13,000
Aren't you hungry? Do you want to go eat?

853
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,580
Sure.

854
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:16,350
Dongsaengdeul, let's go eat.

855
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,780
Sounds good!

856
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,400
Sure.

857
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,120
♫ Maple Latte, smoothly ♫

858
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,900
Should we go off campus to eat?

859
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,400
- Sure.
- What should we eat?

860
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,600
Combination platter!

861
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,000
Hyung, you always eat that.

862
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,930
I know!

863
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:31,800
What? It's delicious. Right, Yeong?

864
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,940
Let's eat that next time.

865
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,890
O-Okay.

866
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:36,410
Let's go.

867
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:39,210
Should we go on a trip again since we're on break?

868
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,200
I would love to! Where should we go?

869
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,570
How about Jeju Island?

870
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:43,440
Sounds good.

871
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,220
I, Gil Mok Jin, can't go anywhere else and leave behind Gil Mok Guest Villa.

872
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,670
I also want to introduce my Yeong.

873
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:51,120
Let's go there next time.

874
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,100
O-Okay.

875
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,530
Okay, let's go to Jeju Island. Yeah, Jeju Island.

876
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:57,580
Jeju Island's nice.

877
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:03,160
To be honest, the identity of the person who wrote the posts

878
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:06,160
probably didn't matter to us from the start.

879
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:10,550
Just like lyrics that seem to be about my life

880
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:13,370
and like poetry that seems to be about my feelings,

881
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:17,350
"Dear.M" was a love letter to all of us.

882
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:25,200
Maybe we just needed an excuse

883
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:29,310
to confirm our feelings.

884
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:33,750
An excuse to take one step toward where our hearts led us.

885
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:39,150
As passionate and excited as we were about a single post,

886
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:41,740
we were also that sincere.

887
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,980
We experienced our first loves

888
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:49,510
and were also someone else's first love.

889
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:53,810
And that's how we all

890
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:57,530
spent our season of youth.

891
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,220
- You did well.
- You, too.

892
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,010
The wedding was the best.

893
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:09,550
- Right?
- Right. It was touching and entertaining.

894
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:13,140
I know. The wedding was a rollercoaster of emotions.

895
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,600
Hyung, you were a really great MC.

896
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,480
Thank you, even though we asked you last minute.

897
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,670
My noona and brother-in-law were really happy, too.

898
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:21,990
Exactly. You were really great.

899
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:25,550
Of course. Whose boyfriend am I?

900
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:28,300
Was I good? How good was I?

901
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,320
- How good was I? How good was I?
- Yes, you were great.

902
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,590
Really? Compliment me. Compliment me.

903
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,100
You really did well.

904
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,470
What?

905
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:40,010
You guys are all dating, too.

906
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:42,680
- Did we say anything?
- Exactly.

907
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:55,800
