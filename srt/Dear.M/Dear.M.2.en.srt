[Seoyeon Pocha]

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,930
Park Ha Neul.

3
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,360
You're here, Ji Min.

4
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,540
You two already met?

5
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,190
What?

6
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,010
Ro Sa, this is my boyfriend, Park Ha Neul.

7
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,370
We already introduced ourselves because we were at the same table.

8
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,500
So, he's your boyfriend.

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,730
Nice to meet you. I'm Ji Min's high school classmate.

10
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,640
Yeah, it's nice to meet you.

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,910
I hope you two get along since you are both in the same major.

12
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,540
Sure, all right.

13
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,040
Oh, right. You said you live alone around here, right?

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,910
Right, that way. It's a short walk.

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,010
I'm going to leave now.

16
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,300
Okay, get home safely. I'll see you in the lecture hall tomorrow.

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,910
Okay.

18
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,080
Let's go.

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,470
Okay.

20
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,740
I don't think you need to prepare to seek employment, Min Ho.

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,850
Can't you just start your own company since you have the skills?

22
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,160
Founding a company is not for everyone, Hyung.

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,810
I just want to join Levan.

24
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,380
It has always been Cha Min Ho's dream to join Levan Software.

25
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,210
One of their games was Min Ho's first game ever.

26
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,590
Really?

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,240
I know someone from Levan.

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,480
If you like, I can ask them to give you a tour.

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,660
I would really love that.

30
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,480
I really wanted to visit there once.

31
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,210
Hyung, isn't that person you know your father?

32
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,420
You didn't know?

33
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,140
He's the son of Levan Software's CEO, Moon Taek Geun.

34
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,800
Really?

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,010
Hyung, can I visit your dorm next time?

36
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,550
I'm really curious about what a single room looks like.

37
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,840
Yes, you can. But there's nothing special about it.

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,220
I heard that it's more expensive than our room's monthly rent.

39
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,240
I'm so envious.

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,310
It's my dad's money, not mine.

41
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,440
So what? It's good that your father is rich.

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,100
Is it?

43
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,500
It's been a while since we took a walk on Kiss Road.

44
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,520
Do you think the curse of Kiss Road

45
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,150
is real?

46
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,540
No way. It's all just a superstition.

47
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,510
But I know couples who have broken up after walking down Kiss Road.

48
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,250
I'm sure that wasn't the reason they broke up.

49
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,700
I guess...

50
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,900
But whenever I walk Kiss Road with you, it bothers me.

51
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,330
Oh, right. Did you read the Maple Latte confession?

52
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,120
Yes. My roommate Hyung read it to me.

53
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,770
Isn't that just a joke?

54
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,400
No way. It was full of sincerity.

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,240
I would know since I had a crush on you.

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,190
You always brag about having a crush on me.

57
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,560
But keep in mind that I'm the one who confessed to you.

58
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,120
All right, all right.

59
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,730
But aren't you curious about who wrote that?

60
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,520
Not really. I'm not interested in other people's affairs.

61
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,520
Why? It could be about us.

62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,850
Doesn't everyone know that we're dating?

63
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,310
The person who wrote it could be someone who doesn't know about us,

64
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,840
or someone who knows but still wrote it.

65
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,020
There could be someone out there who has a crush on you.

66
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,510
Me?

67
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,810
If someone had a crush on either of us, it would've been you, not me.

68
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,030
It would most definitely be the curse of Kiss Road if it really was one of us.

69
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,860
Ji Min, enough about superstition.

70
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,420
Stand here.

71
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,680
Why?

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,840
You're going to take another picture?

73
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,800
- You always want to take my picture.
- So, why are you always this pretty then?

74
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,440
What the heck!

75
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,590
How could I not stand for you when you said such comments?

76
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,510
- Here?
- Yeah.

77
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,170
I'm going to take it. One, two, three.

78
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,860
Yes. That's pretty.

79
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,090
Keep your eyes closed.

80
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,940
- Like this?
- Yes.

81
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,880
Hold on.

82
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,240
Are you done?

83
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,670
Close your eyes.

84
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,870
Give me your phone.

85
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,710
What are you doing?

[Joon Hyung]

87
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,240
I want to at least have his number with me.

88
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,130
As well as take a look at his profile picture.

89
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,930
He's not really that handsome.

90
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,920
He just...

91
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,900
has a face that catches your attention?

92
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,470
About Min Yang Hui...

93
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,810
I'm getting a negative vibe about her.

94
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,880
Women always say they're getting a negative vibe from someone who's pretty.

95
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,830
What are you talking about? Women like pretty women more!

96
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,530
Don't you think she's interested in me?

97
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,670
- She was asking me this and that.
- Who knows?

98
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,100
She could be someone who's just always flirtatious.

99
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,940
Do you want to bet on which one of us starts dating first?

100
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,170
Why would you bet on something like that?

101
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,820
How about the loser has to post something humiliating about themselves on their social media page?

102
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,040
Why would you want to post something like that?

103
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,520
Why not? You just have to win if you don't want to.

104
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,410
Why? You don't have the confidence?

105
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,450
Of course, I have the confidence.

106
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,680
Let's bet! Starting now!

107
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,160
Deal!

108
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,210
Why do you have to fold your clothes to that extent, Hyung?

109
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,340
Even during my military service, I was confident in perfecting the angles (tightly organized and in place).

110
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,420
No one was better at folding the blankets and uniforms perfectly than I.

111
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,540
What do you think?

112
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,760
Perfect, right?

113
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,030
Look at this angle.

114
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,670
Take a good look. You'll learn this soon, too.

115
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,110
Did I tell you that I was a vanguard?

116
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,230
Min Ho is young, so he wouldn't yet.
(T/N: He's referring to military service)

117
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,260
You're in the second semester of your third year. Aren't you going?

118
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,490
I'm exempted.

119
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,150
I just have to serve in the reserves later.

120
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,540
Oh, really?

121
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,920
So you're a "son of god."
(T/N: slang – lucky to avoid military service)

122
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,970
Why did you get exempted?

123
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,690
It's because my dad suddenly became a national merit.
(T/N: He died while serving in the military)

124
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,670
Hello?

125
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,930
Ma'am, this is Sergeant Choi Jin Ki.

126
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,940
Hello, Sergeant. How can I help you?

127
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,270
Well... Lieutenant Colonel Park has...

128
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,740
What about my husband?

129
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,310
What happened?

130
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,980
Today, Lieutenant Colonel Park was traveling via helicopter during training and...

131
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,860
After my father passed away,

132
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,580
I developed a sense of responsibility.

133
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,310
I chose my career path as a game developer,

134
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,370
and since I had more time than others who served military duty,

135
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,960
I figured I could afford to attend college for five years.

136
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,760
That's why I also switched majors.

137
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,300
It must've been very tough for you

138
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,860
to lose him so suddenly in an accident.

139
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,150
It must've been tough for you.

140
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,350
It wasn't, Hyung. I'm fine.

141
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,250
[Wed 08:12 -> 08:13]

142
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,190
Joo Ah, you have a crush?

143
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,620
Unni, how did you know?

144
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,910
You wake up at dawn to do your makeup,

145
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,590
and only listen to songs like "Maple Latte," "Flirting," and "It's Spring By Chance."

146
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,830
Wouldn't it be weirder if I didn't know?

147
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,940
Was I too obvious?

148
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,990
I know from experience, too.

149
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,890
It's this guy? Your crush?

150
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,650
Yeah.

151
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,260
He's handsome!

152
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,300
- Right?
- Yes.

153
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,340
I want to see it, too.

154
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,570
Good-looking.

155
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,490
Good luck, Joo Ah. You would look good together.

156
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,260
- Really?
- Yes.

157
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,700
I have to run, so I'll get going. Bye.

158
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,500
- Bye, Unni.
- Bye!

159
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,870
- See you later.
- Okay.

160
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,320
Oh, yeah, Unni. You should try this, too.

161
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,230
This is an app my friend created.

162
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,750
It matches lone eaters with each other.

I just felt it as soon as I saw him.

173
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,150
He seems very reserved, yet he says what needs to be said.

174
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,620
He always texts me about the weather in the morning

175
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,240
and always lets me know when he's going somewhere.

200
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,360
Following the principle of spontaneity and autonomy,

201
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,600
human resource management is heading toward

202
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,860
favoring both corporate and individual desires.

203
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,900
In contemporary society, human resource management

204
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,950
allows individuals within an organization

205
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,390
to voluntarily contribute to reaching the goal of the entire group.

206
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,910
Thus, the development of the organization is for the individual to...

207

Can you ask him about his ideal type?

209
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,320
The role of the HR manager consists of four different...

210
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,470
Wait. If you ask him that, it'll be too obvious that I asked,

211
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,300
so ask him who his favorite celebrity is.

212
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,400
When creating an organization chart, a tree diagram is most commonly used.

213
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,750
The tree diagram resembles an upside-down tree.

214
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,730
It's the most convenient diagram to display the general...

Hyung, which celebrity do you like?

219
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,730
It means that you can build the data structure.

[Min Ho] I think it's better if you don't know.

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,580
[Min Ho] He says it's Suzy.

222
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,720
So if you connect it to your overall strategy...

223
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,110
He's more cliché than I expected.

224
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,090
That's fine. Most guys' ideal type is Suzy.

225
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,450
In our next lecture, we'll learn about a nonlinear structure similar to the tree diagram.

00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,930
We'll learn about those graphs.

00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,600
Oh, then I'll mop the floor.

327
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,110
[Honestly, I think the level of study of those who were accepted through Seoyeon Love Admission is dropping.]

328
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,890
What's Seoyeon Love Admission?

329
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,950
There's a post on SeoRab regarding Seoyeon Love Admissions,

330
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,180
but I was wondering what kind of admission this was.

331
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,320
Oh, that?

332
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,170
From what I heard, I think it's similar to Equal Opportunity Selection.

333
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,280
I see. I've heard of Equal Opportunity,

334
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,560
but I never knew something like this existed.

335
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,290
How interesting. There are so many types of selections in early admissions.

336
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,820
- Did you both get in through early admissions, too─
- Yang Hui.

337
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,060
- Yes?
- Did you eat?

338
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,480
I'm hungry. Do you want to get something to eat with me?

339
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,180
- Just the two of us?
- Yes, just us two.

340
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,090
Hyung, I'm really hungry. We can grab a bite, right?

341
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,140
Of course, you can.

342
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,120
- Let's go now.
- Okay, I would love to.

343
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,270
I thought you might be thirsty.

344
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,660
Thank you, Oppa.

345
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,370
Eat first.

346
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,670
Yes, Noona.

347
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,740
You know that I'm coming this weekend, right?

348
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,240
I made plans with my boyfriend for this Sunday.

349
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,520
Okay.

350
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,110
I'll see you at home on Saturday.

351
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,010
Okay.

352
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,320
You must be very close with your noona.

353
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,360
You call each other pretty frequently.

354
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,610
Really? Doesn't everyone?

355
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,480
You usually call your mom more often.

356
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,900
I don't have a mom.

357
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,500
Both of my parents passed away.

358
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,720
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,630
It's okay. They passed when I was young.

360
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,940
You should eat before it gets cold.

361
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,720
I can sit here, right?

362
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,350
Sure.

363
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,940
We have almost the same classes.

364
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,560
Yes, I heard from Ji Min.

365
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,710
We can go to class together from now on.

366
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,240
I don't know many people here after returning from the exchange program.

367
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,900
Sure.

368
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,660
As you can see here, int a and int b variables are determined.

369
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:36,460
And a and b have created a temporary save.

370
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,700
When you're declaring the variables, you should choose the type first

371
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,190
and declare the variable name. The type of variables are

372
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:48,010
char, short, int, long for integers.

373
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,590
As for real numbers, float, double, and long double.

374
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,860
Now, we should look into reviewing the data.

375
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,050
Thanks.

376
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,970
This is where the saved data is stored.

377
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,320
The saved data will now be editable.

378
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,390
Because the variable has only been temporarily saved...

379
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,380
One, two, three.

380
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,530
Assistant Leader, let's take your picture.

381
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,270
Okay.

382
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,370
Since I joined the team late as Assistant Leader,

383
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:25,630
I'll do my best to lead our Cheer Squad to victory this semester.

384
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,410
Okay. Thank you, Assistant Leader.

385
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,560
Thank you.

386
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,730
Good job, everyone.

387
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,090
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

388
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,240
- Let's go eat.
- Sure.

389
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,050
I'm so hungry.

390
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,020
Could we get your interview as well, Seo Ji Min?

391
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,570
Pardon? Me?

392
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,470
I thought only the Leader and Assistant Leader were being interviewed today.

393
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,460
Come on. Ji Min, you're a popular figure at Seoyeon University.

394
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,610
I think the students here would be more curious about you.

395
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,680
Please do it, just this once. Please?

396
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,650
You were chosen as the number one person by Seoyeon University students

397
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,680
when asked, "Who comes to mind for Cheer Squad?"

398
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,210
Is there a secret to your popularity?

399
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,920
It's embarrassing to call it popularity.

400
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,510
I honestly thought Ji Min Unni would become the Assistant Leader.

401
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,280
The juniors didn't choose her on purpose.

402
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,790
They were afraid they would be overlooked because of Ji Min Unni's popularity.

403
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:19,180
Honestly, if it weren't for that, there's no reason Ji Min Unni wouldn't have been it.

404
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,330
True. I guess so.

405
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,400
Even in idol groups, the center stands out more than the leader.

406
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,880
So, you said that the Cheer Squad is everything for your college life.

407
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,190
By any chance, are you interested in the next leader position at the end of the semester?

408
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,290
There are many members in the squad that are better than I.

409
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,490
Even so, I would like to try for the leader position.

410
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,580
I'll accept the result if I don't make it,

411
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,700
but I'll do my best until then.

412
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,180
That's right.

413
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,160
Hey, computer science Dongsaengdeul (younger friends/siblings).

414
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,250
Can you fix my computer later?

415
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,710
- Just reboot it.
- Just reboot it.

416
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,810
Just because you're a computer science major doesn't mean that you're good at fixing computers.

417
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,000
O-Okay.

418
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,880
I see you both are quite sensitive because of your assignments.

419
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,900
I'm done.

420
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,590
Really? You're done already?

421
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,430
Wow. You really do finish your assignments in one hour.

422
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,950
Hyung, let me see.

423
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,220
I keep getting this error,

424
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,780
but I don't know why.

425
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,760
You forgot to add this when submitting your key.

426
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,770
Oh. You're right.

427
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,090
And the BMI condition should be this.

428
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,770
I see.

429
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,600
Maybe someone like me shouldn't be a computer-science major.

430
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,860
Geez, that's not true, Hyung.

431
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,580
I've done a lot of coding since I was in high school.

432
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,180
Min Ho Dongsaeng.

433
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,410
I've also used the app you made.

434
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,560
Everything's good. Everything's good,

435
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:33,500
but is there a function not to match up with someone you've matched before?

436
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,270
The girl I met today was a bit...

437
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,890
scary.

438
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,130
I'll think about that function.

439
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,960
Great.

440
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Well, it seems that both of you are almost done with your assignment.

441
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,670
So, how about a "room meeting" with the girls' dorm?
(T/N: A group blind date with the girls in the girls' dorm.

442
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,400
I heard that your girlfriend, Ha Neul,

443
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,850
the center of Cheer Squad also lives in the dorms.

444
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,680
Why don't you arrange a room meeting with her roommates?

445
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,510
That's tiresome.

446
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,360
I'm not into it, either.

447
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,220
Come on!

448
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,080
I'll buy all the food and alcohol!

449
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,960
And...

450
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,220
I'll give this to you.
[Future Invasion]

451
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,890
Deal!

452
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,730
Hello?

453
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,340
[Cha Min Ho, what are you up to?]

454
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,120
Right now?

455
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,360
I'll call you back after I asked them.

456
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,440
Okay.

457
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,550
My boyfriend asked if you guys would like to have a room meeting with his roommates.

458
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,740
I'm single, so I'm down.

459
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,820
I currently have a crush, though.

460
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,330
They said they'll bring all the food and alcohol. Jokbal (pig trotters) and bossam (pork wraps).

461
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,930
Deal!

462
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,850
Where are we meeting them?
[Cha Min Ho, what are you up to?]

463
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,570
- The lawn next to the Business Admin building.
- [Min Ho] I'm doing assignments.

464
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,190
I'm about to sleep.

465
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,990
I can't wait!

466
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,790
Ha Neul, when are they coming?

467
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,160
Give her a call.

468
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,540
- They'll be here soon.
- Right?

469
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,990
Let's have fun!

470
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,760
Is that them?

471
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,530
Ha Neul.

472
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,190
You're here?

473
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,230
Should we say cheers? Cheers!

474
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,480
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

475
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,920
Is this your assignment?

476
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,420
I've already finished my assignments.

477
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,040
What about you?

478
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,510
Are you going to sleep on the grass?

479
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,970
Hey Dongsaengdeul, are you two fine with sharing your amylase (drinking from the same bottle) like that?

480
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,860
I can't even imagine...

481
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,970
It's fine for us since we've been doing this since elementary school.

482
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,710
We've been best friends since elementary school.

483
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,800
Really? And you came to the same college, too?

484
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,700
Yes, it's a tiring relationship.

485
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,740
Is it even possible to be friends with the opposite sex for that long?

486
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,460
Why wouldn't it be?

487
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,910
I have had a close female friend since high school too.

488
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,690
She's friends with Ji Min, too.

489
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,240
Well, yeah, I guess it's possible,

490
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,540
but what if you get drunk together?

491
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,630
It happens a lot in movies, you know?

492
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,430
Alcohol does tend to be the issue.

493
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,560
That's why we have a rule.

494
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,920
We can only drink up to three of these.

495
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:26,180
Let's just have one more shot.

496
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,240
No.

497
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,960
We...

498
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,320
can only drink up to three bottles.

499
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,520
Hey, wait for me!

500
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,510
My limit is one bottle, and Min Ho's is two bottles.

501
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,710
So we can only have a total of three bottles.

502
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,850
That's wise.

503
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:51,340
Better than getting drunk and regretting a mistake.

504
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,590
You two are quite the famous couple.

505
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,440
I also read about you on SeoRab.

506
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,290
Oppa, why do you like Ji Min Unni?

507
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:03,480
List just three things you like about Unni.

508
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,790
Why I like her?

509
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,690
Just because.

510
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,050
I just like her.

511
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,460
Seriously? How boring.

512
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,580
I honestly don't know.

513
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,180
He's very shy.

514
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,830
But why do people ask this question?

515
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,460
She'll sulk if she doesn't like the answer he gives.

516
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,270
And she'll still sulk if he doesn't answer.

517
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,240
Let's say there's a reason why he likes her.

518
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,050
If that reason disappears, is he not going to like her anymore?

519
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,270
Gosh, you really don't know a woman's heart.

520
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,970
She just wants to hear it.

521
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,110
She just wants to know why her boyfriend loves her.

522
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,040
Is it that hard to come up with three simple reasons?

523
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,410
It doesn't even cost money.

524
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,000
You've never dated before, have you?

525
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,760
Should we talk about something else?

526
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,100
Right.

527
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,890
Who do you think wrote the Maple Latte post?

528
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,830
I'm 100% sure that a girl wrote it.

529
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,600
What are you saying? It's written by a guy.

530
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,830
You don't think it's one of us, do you?

531
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,570
Everyone here takes Photography and Appreciation.

532
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,890
I guess, even when playing the Mafia game,

533
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,700
the person you least expect is the Mafia.

534
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,580
They must've left a clue in the post.

535
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,690
They wrote it well, with so much emotion.

536
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,610
In that case, they must be in Liberal Arts rather than the Sciences.

537
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,970
Then, Min Ho and Ha Neul are out.

538
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,200
Ha Neul was originally in Liberal Arts.

539
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,120
He got an A-plus in his writing class.

540
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,660
Oh, right! Cha Min Ho is good at writing, too.

541
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,610
Back in high school, he won some kind of award in a writing contest.

542
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,590
Come on. I wouldn't be good as someone who was a liberal arts student.

543
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,910
Especially with a confession post like this.

544
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,130
Oh, right.

545
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,760
Didn't you say you got accepted through your essay?

546
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:00,070
What's creepy about this post is that there is no mistake in spelling or grammar.

547
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,700
I feel like it might be someone who's a neat freak.

548
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,160
I see. A neat freak, huh?

549
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,190
Why?

550
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,850
What?

551
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,410
What is this?

552
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,400
What is it?

553
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,580
Why, what is it?

554
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,750
Huh?

555
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,460
Us?

556
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:34,400
Well, something like this was posted.

557
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:41,730
[Did the Magnet Couple break up?]

558
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,950
[OMG. Isn't that Cheer Squad assistant leader?]

559
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,970
[Did Seo Ji Min lose both the assistant leader position and her boyfriend?]

560
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,070
Oh, this?

561
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,700
I was there with them.

562
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,990
On our way out of the welcome back party, I just helped keep her from being hit by a motorcycle.

563
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,350
Exactly.

564
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,480
How could they capture that exact moment?

565
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,590
I know.

566
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,520
Then everyone's okay, right?

567
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,900
I was worried.

568
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,940
It must be tiresome to be a famous couple.

569
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,570
Don't worry. Posts like this will be reported and deleted immediately.

570
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,850
Should we raise our glasses again?

571
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,590
- Cheers.
- Sure.

572
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,670
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

573

[Thu 8:11 -> 8:12]

574
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,730
- It's this one, right?
- Yes, that one.

575
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,650
- Wear that checkered shirt today, okay?
- Okay.

576
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,860
I'll call you later.

577
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,250
All right.

578
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,650
I'm so jealous.

579
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:47,470
Later, Joon Sunbae and I will also...

580
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,250
Is your crush going well?

581
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,500
I joined the same club as Sunbae.

582
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,680
You can say, I'm seeing more hope.

583
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,520
The same club? How?

584
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,730
I applied for it.

585
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:04,740
- I'm going to get closer to him, little by little.
- I see.

586
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,760
I guess that's possible.

587
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,770
Gil Mok Jin!

588
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,960
Let me drink one of those.

589
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,120
What?

590
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,700
Wait.

591
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,090
I guess you also recover from a hangover with orange juice.

592
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,520
Now, I feel better.

593
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,410
I'll make sure to repay you with a meal.

594
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,550
You just saved my life.

595
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,800
- Your favorite...
- We're recruiting new members for our new club, Appcelent.

596
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,720
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

597
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,540
Thank you.

598
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,260
Ma Joo Ah, don't you have class right now?

599
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,090
I'm skipping it.

600
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:09,290
I told you. My dream is to be Moon Joon's girlfriend.

601
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,820
This is my chance.

602
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,200
Being by his side when he needs me most.

603
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,390
How incredible.

604
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,790
What about you? Is it going well with Yang Hui?

605
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,220
You haven't forgotten our bet, have you?

606
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,940
Didn't you see how happy she got when I asked her to eat together?

607
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,980
You should be on your toes.

608
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,520
How's your app going?

609
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,380
Well...

610
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,930
Apparently, it's not different from a dating app.

611
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,890
Gosh, I wish someone hot came out.

612
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,460
I have my hopes up high right now.

613
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,960
I'll leave you a text after our meal.

614
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,760
Okay.

615
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,810
You're from the BABting app, right?

616
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,800
Nickname, Lorelai?

617
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,290
By chance, you're Nameless?

618
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,950
Yes.

619
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,580
I'm sorry, but

620
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,570
I think I have indigestion.

621
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,170
I wonder why I haven't felt well since before.

622
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,170
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can eat.

623
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,920
- Pardon?
- I'm sorry.

624
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,100
This app is the worst. Garbage!

625
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,230
I think all the reviewers are probably paid off, too.

626
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,230
Bad reviews have been posted since yesterday.

627
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,580
They keep leaving one star, so the rating is going down, too.

628
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,520
I think it's one person doing this intentionally.

629
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,390
Who the heck is this bastard?

630
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,750
He should at least write what he doesn't like about it.

631
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,600
Well, good apps receive bad reviews, too.

632
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,770
It's still trivial, so I'm not going to worry about it yet.

633
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,050
Joo Ah, Min Ho.

634
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,360
Come and take a break.

635
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,180
Okay!

636
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,310
Daebak.

637
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,620
There are so many applicants in such a short amount of time.

638
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,980
Really?

639
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,710
Let me see.

640
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,680
Oh, you're right.

641
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,180
This is still quite a lot, even though not all will apply.

642
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,500
It's all thanks to you, Joo Ah.

643
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,020
I didn't do much.

644
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,310
Hello.

645
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,660
Hey, Yang Hui.

646
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,810
You guys haven't eaten yet, right?

647
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,000
Here?

648
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,300
I'm sleepy.

649
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:09,400
Ah, I rewatched "Avengers: End Game" last night before I went to sleep.

00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,170
- You like Marvel, too?
- Of course, I do.

Is there even someone who doesn't like Marvel?

653
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,090
If a Marvel movie is released,

654
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,900
I need to watch it in IMAX, 4D, and 2D!

She didn't even watch it when I had the tickets.

657
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:28,930
Me, too. I also watched "End Game" three times the first week it was released.

658
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,690
So, if you like Marvel, do you also like the "X-Men series"?

659
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,570
Of course!

660
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:39,050
I especially like "First Class" and "Days of Future Past."

Yes, yes. Those two are the best.

Yes, I'm a baseball fanatic.

- Of course, it's Shines.
- Really?

670

I've been a Shines fan for the past ten years!

How could you be a Shines fan when you live in Incheon?

672

Why not? I also have a friend who lives in Incheon but is a Shines fan.

I can't really eat food that's high in sodium.

680
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,320
It's probably because my mom only fed me organic since I was young.

I lent it to her because she spilled something.

Oh, really?

What did she spill?

707
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:04,620
I had a big accident long ago where my lip tint leaked all over my bag too.

708
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,950
Can't you just use the solid one instead of the liquid tint?

709
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:12,460
Oh, lipstick? Lipsticks are very pigmented, but they don't last too long.

710
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,310
You're right. It comes off when you eat.

711
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,100
Then I guess you have no choice but to use a tint.

712
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,390
But tints do dry out your lips.

713
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,920
What? Then I guess you shouldn't buy either.

00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,540
Aigoo.

806
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,290
Ji Min Unni.

807
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:18,170
Isn't this your cheer (performance) uniform?

808
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,750
It was thrown away in the trash can in the hallway.

809
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,320
What? Did someone throw it away intentionally?

810
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:31,850
I'm getting goosebumps.

811
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:56,990
[Seoyeon University]

812
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:11,660
Are you that bothered?

813
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,550
A little.

814
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:14,820
Hey.

815
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,200
Someone probably thought it was dropped and threw it out.

816
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,480
Think about it.

817
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,700
Who would hold a grudge against you and do that?

818
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,960
Don't get hung up on something so upsetting.

819
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,080
I'm sure no one hates you,

820
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,320
but let's say someone does hate you.

821
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,400
Even so, there are so many more people who like you.

822
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,310
You also have me.

823
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,180
Oh, right.

824
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,650
And...

825
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,510
This.

826
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:54,450
I kept forgetting to give you this since this morning.

827
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:57,150
For you and your boyfriend.

828
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:06,200
They're so pretty.

829
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,330
To be honest,

830
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:18,310
I was feeling bad for you because of the interview video.

831
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:22,590
And yet, you're being this considerate toward me.

832
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:27,150
Thank you so much.

833
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:32,530
You also sincerely congratulated me when I became the assistant leader.

834
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,020
Also...

835
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,360
could you keep what happened today a secret from Ha Neul?

836
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,880
He tends to overreact over trivial matters.

837
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,210
He has already got his hands full from switching majors.

838
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:52,810
I don't want to worry him too with trivial matters.

839
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,150
Okay.

840
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,470
Don't worry about that.

841
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,370
Come in.

842
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:08,660
Hello.

843
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,530
I said I'll go to your room.

844
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,040
It's fine. I wanted to check out your room too.

845
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,680
Have a seat.

846
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:20,370
How is a single room bigger than a 3-people room?

847
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:25,150
Never mind that. I have something to tell you.

848
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:27,190
We'll be receiving a grant for the club.

849
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:29,630
Like I said before, if you become the club's vice president,

850
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:32,280
you can receive a small scholarship as well.

851
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,010
Appealing to them with the app you made was a bit of help.

852
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,530
Oh, really?

853
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,610
Hyung, you must've been very busy getting that approved.

854
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:42,930
Gosh, I'm the club president, after all.

855
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,500
I should at least act like I'm working, right?

856
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,650
Hyung, I won't bother you anymore and leave since it looks like you're working on an assignment.

857
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:53,870
You can stay a little longer.

858
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:56,430
It's okay. I got to check your room out.

859
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,540
I'll come over again.

860
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:03,760
[Joo Ah] Sunbae! Come visit where I'm working part-time!

861
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,710
[Joo Ah] I'll give you a lot of free stuff.

862
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:10,160
Hey. About Joo Ah...

863
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,900
You've been friends with Joo Ah since elementary school, right?

864
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,490
Yes. Why do you ask?

865
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:18,770
What kind of person is Joo Ah?

866
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:21,880
Was she always this cheerful?

867
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,570
She has always been cheerful.

868
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,700
She's not twisted at all

869
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,120
which makes her thoughtless.

870
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:31,530
I guess you can say it would be weird if she became thoughtful.

871
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:34,590
I've never met anyone like Joo Ah.

872
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:55,780
[Joo Ah] Hey! Come over immediately to my part-time job.

873
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,430
[Joo Ah] This noona will buy you some beer.

874
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,950
Ji Min Unni and Ha Neul oppa are coming, too.

875
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:02,680
So bothersome. Why is she telling me to come and go?

876
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:21,190
You wore a different cheer uniform today.

877
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,440
Don't you usually wear that only for sports events?

878
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,000
We wanted to make today a bit special.

879
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,550
I see.

880
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,080
Oh, right.

881
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,130
Ro Sa gave me these, so we can use them as a couple.

882
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,880
It's pretty, right?

883
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,960
It's cute.

884
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,980
Should we share our Yeonflix login with Ro Sa?

885
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,890
It'll be cheaper if we split it three ways.

886
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:47,620
Sure.

887
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,910
Ta-da!

888
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,850
Thank you.

889
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,400
Is that a key ring for couples?

890
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,200
Yeah.

891
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,440
I want to have an item for couples too.

892
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,980
You can if you want, Joo Ah.

893
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:11,330
Sunbae went to a live game!

894
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:16,260
What should I put as a comment, so he can ask me to see a live game with him?

895
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,060
Appeal to him that you also see live games often,

896
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,510
and give him a strong reason why he has to go with you to the live game.

897
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,110
How about this?

898
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:31,170
"It has been so long since I've been to a live game. (Crying emoji)"

899
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,370
Daebak! That's perfect.

900
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:37,660
As expected, you're exceptional, Ji Min Unni.

901
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,010
You're a dating pro.

902
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:43,170
You said you confessed first, right?

903
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:47,320
But I'm the one who made you confess your feelings.

904
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,700
- You're here?
- Hello.

905
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,360
Hey.

906
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:58,600
I'm going home over the weekend.

907
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,590
I can't go because I'm covering for someone over the weekend.

908
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:04,790
Hey. I think Joon Sunbae likes baseball more than I thought.

909
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:08,100
He went to a live game today. Look.

910
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,650
How can you pretend to like baseball when you don't even know the rules?

911
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:13,220
I'm dumbfounded.

912
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,910
Hey. If you like someone, it will come to you naturally.

913
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:19,430
Do you even know how many players are on the field during the game?

914
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,640
Huh?

915
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,460
Isn't it five players?

916
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,090
So you can teach me!

917
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,800
Thanks to you, Sunbae replied to my comment, Unni.

918
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,590
Let's go to a live game together next time.

919
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:39,200
He said, let's go to a live game together next time!

920
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,780
Hey, hey, hey. The point is that he said, "next time."

921
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:46,530
If he really wanted to, he would've been specific on a date and not vaguely said "next time."

922
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:49,940
Geez, you little... I just ought to!

923
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,400
Hey, you need to buy a uniform if you go to a live game, right?

924
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,610
Before that, I need to learn the players' names...

925
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:08,220
- Do you like him that much?
- Yes!

926
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,040
- I like him so much!
- She says she likes him.

927
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,720
I'm going to study baseball starting today.

928
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,170
How do you have a crush on someone as if you're fangirling?

929
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:19,120
Do I?

930
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,720
It's because I don't know how to.

931
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,620
This is the first time I like someone.

932
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:29,140
I'm just doing everything I can since I don't know how.

933
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,610
Are those two really just friends?

934
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:37,440
I don't know. I think one of them has feelings for the other.

935
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,330
- Right?
- Yeah.

936
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,960
[Ro Sa] Something happened to Ji Min today.

937
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,770
[Ro Sa] I thought you should know.

938
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:48,960
- [Ro Sa] I'm in front of the dorms right now.
- Min Ho.

939
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,650
You go in first. I need to meet someone.

940
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:53,380
Okay.

941
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:02,360
That's why they wore that uniform today.

942
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,640
Yes.

943
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,910
Ji Min said not to tell you because you would worry.

944
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:10,990
But I still thought you should be aware.

945
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:19,140
I'll let you know if anything happens to her in the future, too.

946
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,580
Okay.

947
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,030
I wouldn't have known if it weren't for you.

948
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:25,380
Thanks for telling me.

949
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,500
Ji Min.

950
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,460
You know how I liked someone back in my senior year of high school?

951
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,530
It was Dong Gyu.

952
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:38,560
Why didn't you tell me?

953
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,420
Just because.

954
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:44,570
I guess I thought that you two looked better together.

955
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,400
What are you saying?

956
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:51,040
I think about it sometimes, though.

957
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,510
What would've happened if I hadn't given up and had pushed forward?

958
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,020
Then...

959
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:02,870
he would've definitely accepted your feelings.

960
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,760
Do you really think so?

961
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,840
Yeah. Of course.

962
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,400
I hope that's the case this time.

963
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,180
You know the Maple Latte post?

964
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:33,400
Why do you think they wrote a post first instead of confessing directly?

965
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,550
Probably because they were too shy.

966
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:40,730
Or maybe... perhaps it's like this.

967
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,710
They're not in a position to confess.

968
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:48,370
For example,

969
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:52,120
they've fallen in love with their friend.

970
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:56,030
- I'm going now.
- Okay.

971
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,480
Or they've fallen in love with their friend's lover.

972
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:27,620
[Dear.M]

973
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:41,280
♫ Even while staring into space ♫

974
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,090

Our picture is up on SeoRab.

975
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:47,150
Is there someone else other than me who has a crush on Joon Sunbae?

976
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:50,430
You could also be someone's first love.

977
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:52,460
There's someone I like.

978
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,440
That key ring...

979
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:59,540
But I'm upset that someone found out before me when it has something to do with you.

980
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,790
So 12 years of friendship doesn't mean anything, right?

981
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:03,810
Because it feels like you're losing her?

982
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:06,320
I don't think having a crush suits you.
