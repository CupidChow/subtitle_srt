00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,480
After going to a photo exhibition, submit a report following the announced format and schedule.

166
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,730
The final assignment will be announced at a later time.

167
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,900
Now, I'll go over a few more things on how this class will

168
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,510
proceed this semester before moving on to the lesson.

169
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,440
In Photography and Appreciation,

170
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,880
you'll study the composition and techniques of photography.

171
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,980
You'll be mostly outdoors taking photos using the techniques you learned.

172
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,080
And one person per class

173
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,210
- Cha Min Ho, you want to die?
- or per group will be presenting.

174
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,820
- How do you fall for that every time?
- One advantage of this class

175
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,410
is that you don't need a textbook or to take notes.

176
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,800
You only need to study how to take photos.

177
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,580
What?

178
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,300
- It's that guy.
- In return, you'll get to take lots of photos.

179
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,170
- The handkerchief guy from this morning.
- Oh, it was Joon Hyung?

180
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,470
He's in my major and just returned

181
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,280
this semester from his military service.

182
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,710
So, you know him?

183
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,090
I met him a couple of times when he was on leave.

184
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,900
Really?

185
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,760
Who's that woman?

186
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,100
Is she his girlfriend?

187
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,890
No.

188
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,840
She's Min Yang Hui, a freshman in my major.

189
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,370
Really?

190
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,760
She's very pretty.

She's the Queen-ka of the computer science major.

- It's not like that.
- "It's not like that."

00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,060
I have to use the bottom bunk, too.

326
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,680
Oh, I see.

327
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,670
Of course, you do.

328
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,310
Then.

329
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,780
Dear roommates, you can use these to your heart's content.

330
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,320
[Mon 19:47 -> 19:48]

331
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,900
Hyung, why are you taking first-year classes?

332
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,090
I switched majors this semester.

333
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,380
Oh, really?

334
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,900
Why did you switch majors?

335
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,740
I've never seen anyone switch majors in the second semester of their third year.

336
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,330
It just ended up that way.

337
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,480
Anyway, I guess it's just the two of us using this room.

338
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,140
How lucky.

339
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,820
I guess so.

340
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,730
Hello.

341
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,990
Business Administration (entering) class of 2020?

342
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,280
Really? You were our hoobae?

343
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,860
It's so nice to meet you, Bo Yeong!
(T/N: She's speaking informally to her)

344
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,150
Maybe it's because you're class 20 that

345
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,230
- you're giving off a freshman vibe─
- And I'm 24 years old.

346
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,170
You look very young for your age.
(T/N: She switches to speaking formally)

347
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,730
Also, I'm not Bo Yeong. My last name is Hwang Bo,

348
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,870
and my first is Yeong.

349
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,280
Okay.

350
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,360
Yeong Unni.

351
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,700
- Unni, please speak comfortably.
- Should I?

352
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,050
I have something to tell my roommates.

353
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,300
I'm diabetic.

354
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,290
Don't be too surprised when I check my blood sugar throughout the day and inject insulin.

355
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,860
If I get hypoglycemic, I might have difficulty controlling my body.

356
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,000
In that case, help me drink a cup or two of juice.

357
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,820
Also, in the very rare case that I have a seizure or fall unconscious due to hypoglycemic shock,

358
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,380
you have to call 911 immediately.

359
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,760
Of course, that's a very rare case.

360
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,390
Because you might have a seizure...

361
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,430
That's why I couldn't give you the bottom bunk.

362
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,010
I'm sorry.

363
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,320
I had no idea.

364
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,220
End of my announcement!

365
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,420
Shall we begin the move-in initiation?

366
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,200
Okay!

367
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,400
Everyone knows the rules for the move-in initiation, right?

368
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,660
The sunbae (seniors) with the most seniority has to treat the hoobaes (juniors) to whatever they want to eat.

369
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,200
Since I'm the sunbae with the most seniority in terms of the class year,

370
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,850
- I'll pay.
- No, it's fine.

371
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:33,180
I'll pay for today, and you two can pay for the move-out initiation.

372
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,910
Then I'll place the order.

373
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,110
Tteokbokki (spicy rice cake), deal?

374
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,410
Yes, sounds good.

375
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,720
Where should I order Tteokbokki from?

376
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,960
Cha Min Ho, computer science major, (entering) class of 2019.

377
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,010
Park Ha Neul, computer science major, (entering) class of 2018.

378
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,200
And I'm Gil Mok Jin, a psychology major, (entering) class of 2017.

379
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,270
Since you two entered the university straight from high school, I'm the oldest here.

380
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,890
Yes. Please speak comfortably.

381
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:04,410
Hey roomies. I know this might be a very forwarded question

382
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:08,960
but what is your MBTI?
(T/N: MBTI = Myers–Briggs Type Indicator; Personality test)

383
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,330
- ENTP.
- ENTP?

384
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,540
You're sociable, logical, and interested in various things.

385
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,000
I think I was INFP.

386
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,640
INFP?

387
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,960
You're very shy at first, spontaneous, and considerate.

388
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,490
Hold on...

389
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,710
I'm ENFP, so...

390
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,320
we're totally compatible!

391
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,360
Let's get along.

392
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,640
Be at ease. At ease.

393
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,510
But Hyung, why did you get kicked out of your previous room?

394
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,820
Because it was very dirty.

395
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:54,420
Not me! My roommates were very dirty.

396
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,410
They left their underwear and socks just lying out in the open,

397
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,490
and they left trash everywhere.

398
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,590
I got kicked out after getting into a heated argument when I told them to clean up.

399
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,380
Mok Jin Hyung.

400
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,830
We should have a Move-in Initiation.

401
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,280
This is so good.

402
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,840
I think tteokbokki is the most delicious food in the world.

403
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,620
You can eat everything, Joo Ah.
[Trash]

404
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,490
I really can eat everything. Can I really?

405
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,070
- Of course.
- I don't have anything to say to you.

406
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,670
Let's break up. Don't call me anymore.

407
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,190
Unni, are you okay?

408
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,220
Yeah, I'm fine. He's out.

409
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,830
- Out?
- Yes.

410
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,340
As you guys know, I have a health condition, so I shouldn't be too stressed.

411
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,800
So, when I'm dating someone, I dump them right away when they're no good early on.

412
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,020
How do you recognize it if they're no good early on?

413
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,670
Contact, woman, and lies.

414
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,810
I dump him right away when he screws up on any of these three.

415
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,310
Wow. How cool.

416
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,720
True. Those three are always a problem.

417
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,810
- Oh, really?
- Wait. I guess Joo Ah only met nice men?

418
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,850
Nope.

419
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,890
I've never been in a relationship.

420
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,350
- Really?
- Really?

421
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,960
Yes!

422
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,880
Pizza and...

423
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,940
Wow, they look so good.

424
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,660
Hey! Wait a minute!

425
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,440
You're going to eat in the room?

426
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,960
Dongsaengdeul (little bros), let's go eat in the lounge.

427
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,260
Why go through the trouble when we could eat in our room?

428
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,320
We can eat with the window open.

429
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,210
But still. The smell will seep into the blankets.

430
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,080
Hyung...

431
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,510
You're going to get kicked out again.

432
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,720
I'm just kidding.

433
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,140
You're sure you were kidding, right?

434
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,400
Ha Neul, you were really kidding, right?

435
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,810
Hi, Noona.

436
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,490
Noona...

437
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,930
This weekend?

438
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,460
All right.

439
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,920
Min Ho.

440
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,840
- You have a noona?
- Yes.

441
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,730
How old might that noona be?

442
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,590
She's 10 years older than I am.

443
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,170
And she has a boyfriend.

444
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,840
I see.

445
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,920
Gosh, when will I get to be a campus couple?

446
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,070
I guess I'll be eating alone again this semester.

447
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,340
Dongsaengdeul, if our breaks happen to match up,

448
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,340
would you like to eat with me?

449
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,300
- Sure.
- Sure.
- Really?

450
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,400
Everyone, take out your schedules.

451
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,240
Let's see...

452
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,420
Your breaks are...

453
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,320
Photography and Appreciation?

454
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,510
You're both taking the same class as me.

455
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,910
Really?

456
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,700
The three of us are taking the same class?

457
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,430
Wow. That's amazing. But why didn't we see each other earlier?

458
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,670
The three of us can go to class every Monday morning together.

459
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,050
Sounds good!

460
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:58,210
[Mon 23:12 -> 23:13]

461
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,130
Dongsaengdeul, log into your SeoRab immediately.

462
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,930
The photography and appreciation class is totally a hot issue right now.

463
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:19,370
One of the students in the class today wrote a confession post.

464
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,010
You know what? I'll read it to you guys.

465
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,020
Listen carefully.

466
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,460
"Dear my first love,

467
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,840
the song that flowed out of the speakers on my way to school

468
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,060
sounded so nice, so I looked it up."

469
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,900
Wow. You can tell by the delicate tone.

470
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,070
It's a woman.

471
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,370
"Honestly, when others spoke of their first love,

472
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,820
I couldn't fathom what kind of emotion that was."

473
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,420
The song that flowed out of the speakers on my way to school

474
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,450
sounded so nice, so I looked it up.

475
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,310
The title was "Maple Latte."

476
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,330
I don't know if it was because the song was nice

477
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,490
or because the weather was nice.

478
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:08,750
It was simply just a good day.

479
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:14,980
But I realized it sitting in my first class, Photography and Appreciation.

480
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,030
"Why I was so excited since this morning.

481
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:24,240
Today, I started my first love."

482
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,180
No matter how you look at it, it's a man, right?

483

I met my boyfriend at my early admission interview.

So, I immediately ended things with Dong Gyu.

Well, just think about it.

806
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,350
Okay.

807
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,340
I hear we have a student here who has switched majors.

My roommate Hyung.

Hello. I'm Park Ha Neul, (entering) class of 2018.

I'm Seo Tae Jin, (entering) class of 2016.

I have to introduce you properly.

812
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,800
Let's go around the room.

813
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,650
Just go along with it. Nothing good comes from getting on his bad side.

814
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:41,890
Okay. Got it.

815
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:47,160
This is Park Ha Neul, (entering) class of 2018.

816
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,880
- I know him.
- You do?

817
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,280
You do? I don't think you do.

818
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,560
Move it. Move.

819
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,500
Boss! One big bowl of the fruit punch, please!

820
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,490
- It's nice to meet you.
- Oh, my!

821
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,510
- Hey. Hey!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

822
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,440
- Hey, hey, hey!
- He's drunk.

823
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,430
Thank you.

824
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:10,800
Since everyone's here, we have to go around the table with the loyalty drink.

825
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,300
- Taxi?
- Meal coupon?

826
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,860
Starting from here,

827
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,530
we're going around this way.

832
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,810
You drank so little!

833
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,650
What are you doing?

834
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,850
How will he drink all that? There's too much left.

835
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:05,390
Wow! He's drinking it all!

836
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,940
He finished it!

837
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,260
Yes, Noona.

838
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,720
I'm at the back-to-school party.

839
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,180
I ate.

840
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,960
Yeah.

841

It's noisy here, so I'll call you back later.

842
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,770
Okay.

843
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,760
Noona, why did you call earlier?

844
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,790
If you're asking me out for a meal, that means you have something to say to me, right?

845
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:45,660
Right. Let's talk in person.

846
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,250
It's nothing much. I just want to eat with you.

847
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,530
Okay. See you on the weekend.

848
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:52,370

Did the part-time interview go well?

852
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,100
I passed on the spot!

853
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,460
I'm starting tomorrow.

- At re'feel café?
- Yes.

855
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,770
Is the boss okay there?

856
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,210
Why? What's wrong with him? Why?

857
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:19,640
I don't think he has good judgment, seeing how he passed you on the spot.

It's Joo Ah.

Huh? We meet again, Sunbae.

861
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,990
Since you're here, how about you go inside for a bit?

862
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:31,220
Oh, no. How can I crash another department's party?

863
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,700
I just stopped by on the way to my dorm.

864
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,290
Who cares? It's fine.

865
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:39,750
When Min Ho and I go back to the dorm later, you can go back with us.

Where did I see him before?

872
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:09,030
Oppa, who did you speak with on the phone earlier?

873
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:11,960
- Girlfriend?
- That was my noona.

874
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,720
Oh, you have an older sister.

- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Me?

876
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,470
- No.
- Then when was your last relationship?

877
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:26,560
I think... it was a year ago?

878
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,600
How long was your

879
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,810
longest relationship?

880
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,180
I spent at least one season with her.

881
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:39,600
So, that means at least three to four months?

882
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,210
Then why did you break up with your last girlfriend?

883
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:47,160
That's...

884
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,450
Well...

885
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:56,200
We broke up because we had different opinions on Sinocentrism.

886
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,870
What?

887
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,110
Yes, that's right. Well...

888
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:09,010
If we were to exaggerate it, you could say it was because of Sinocentrism.

889
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,000
You two must be really close.

890

Yeah, well...

892
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,090
You're not one of those friends with romantic feelings for each other, are you?

893
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:20,970
No way. That's tacky. How can you have a romantic feeling for a friend?

894
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:24,480
We're just best friends for 12 years.

895
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,130
I knew it.

896

What?

897
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:33,010
No matter how you look at it, I don't think Oppa would date someone like you.

898
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:35,710
What does that mean?

899
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:36,980
Pardon?

00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:41,320

968
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,550
What incident?

969
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:57,860
I have a dream starting today.

970
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,300
Hey. What's that out of the blue?

971
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:04,540
Fine. Let's hear what your dream is.

972
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:07,270
Moon Joon's girlfriend.

973
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:10,980
What kind of dream is that?

974
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,810
How naive of you.

975
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,770
- Of all the dreams you can have, you choose─
- Why not?

976
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:18,580
Can't that be a dream? Why not?

977
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,660
Hey, think about it.

978
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,070
There's no such thing as burying your bones in a company these days.

979
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:28,390
A job is something you'll have to quit in 20 to 30 years,

980
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:31,620
but a spouse is forever!

981
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:34,470
If I date Sunbae, we can become partners for life.

982
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,880
So why can't it be a dream?

983
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,620
Yeah, I guess, but...

984
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,380
I advertised your app really well.

985
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:44,580
So from now on, I need you to be the wingman for me and Sunbae.

986
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,320
Got it?

987
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,990
Help her with what?

988
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,150
It's her business.

989
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:05,700
By the way, did you read the confession post?

990
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,920
The one posted by someone from our class.

991
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,490
Yes. I read it.

992
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:17,530
Hello.

993
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,860
Okay. Understood.

994
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,910
I know I saw him somewhere...

995
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:43,090
He's Ji Min Unni's boyfriend! The Magnet Couple. That's right.

996
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:45,900
But who is that woman?

997
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:51,860
[Seoyeon Pocha]

998
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,340
Park Ha Neul!

999
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:28,230
[Dear.M]

1000
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:41,160
♫ Even while staring into space ♫

1001
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,270
~ Preview ~
You were chosen as the number one person by Seoyeon University students

1002
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:46,080
when asked, "Who comes to mind for the Cheer Squad?"

1003
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,030
I can't find my cheer (performance) uniform.

1004
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,750
Should I just step down from today's performance?

1005
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,220
Something happened to Ji Min today.

1006
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:54,240
I wouldn't have known if it weren't for you.

1007
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,460
Thanks for telling me.

1008
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,470
You can call me oppa.

1009
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:00,330
I'm 24 years old.

1010
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:02,920
The girl I met today was a bit... scary.

1011
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,580
You want to bet who starts dating first?

1012
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,870
Let's bet.

1013
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:08,110
- I look forward to it, Joo Ah.
- Okay!

1014
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:10,660
It's all thanks to you, Joo Ah.

1015
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:13,680
How do you have a crush on someone as if you're fangirling?

1016
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,790
This is the first time I like someone.

1017
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:17,680
Are those two really just friends?

1018
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,270
I think one of them has feelings for the other.

1019
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:22,390
What kind of person is Joo Ah?

1020
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:29,810
♫ I think our relationship is getting sweeter, oh baby ♫
