[My Girlfriend]

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,590
But if you truly feel that way...

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,210
If you're truly struggling and you feel uncomfortable because of me...

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,480
I'll try and get rid of these feelings.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,900
Yeah.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,030
That's the right thing to do.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,640
You're back, Cha Min Ho.

[87802]

9
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,450
Dongsaengdeul, the weather is so great today, isn't it?

10
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,180
Is it? I can't really tell.

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,950
It looks the same as yesterday.

12
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,250
Yeah?

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,420
Maybe the weather looks great because I feel great?

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,300
Aren't you curious as to why I feel great?

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,290
What reason is there to feel great?

16
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,560
I'm going first.

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,890
What the heck?

18
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,850
What's with both of their gloomy vibes?

19
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,540
I can't even brag to them when they're like that.

20
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,000
I got a girlfriend!

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,350
Escape from my single life!

22
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,470
Hey, Ma Joo Ah!

23
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,010
Huh?

24
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,730
Yeah...

25
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,210
87802?

26
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,710
Are you going to class?

27
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,860
Huh?

28
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,090
No, I'm in between classes right now.

29
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:17,280
Now that I think about it, you haven't returned my hoodie.

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,600
Tell me honestly.

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,280
You were going to keep it if I had forgotten, weren't you?

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,810
No, I wasn't!

33
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,270
I washed it. I'll give it to you later.

34
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,640
Give it back, okay?

35
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,990
It's my favorite hoodie.

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,860
When I was MC and you heard me over the broadcast,

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,530
you heard about "87802," right?

38
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,830
Oh, isn't that the number from the story they broadcast?

39
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,230
It is.

40
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,470
I went to the karaoke yesterday and turned on my jam,

41
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,730
and that song's number was 87802.

42
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,540
Really?

43
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,290
That's neat.

44
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,850
It really isn't you?

45
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,030
Min Ho Oppa!

46
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,960
Hello.

47
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,430
By chance, are you in between classes?

48
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,610
- Yeah.
- Yes!

49
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,220
You haven't eaten yet, right?

50
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,130
Let's go eat together.

51
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,770
Sure.

52
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,940
You're already here?

53
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,240
[Here is the photo on "Temptation of Wolves"]

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,510
They broadcasted the "Classic" on TV yesterday.

55
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,130
Oh, really?

56
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,470
Should we have just done "Classic" for our assignment?

57
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,550
Why? Ours is good, too.

58
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,770
Okay, then. We're all done.

59
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,390
Here.

60
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,310
Then... We've finished our assignment,

61
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,350
- so how about a delicious meal─
- Let's talk.

62
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,510
We have something to talk about.

63
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,150
Sorry, let's eat together next time.

64
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,720
Sure, let's do that.

65
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,940
See you.

66
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,240
Since when...

67
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:12,950
did you know about how Ro Sa felt about me?

68
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,990
Why didn't you tell me you knew about it?

69
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:28,020
Did you really... break up with me because of that?

70
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,100
Did you think I fell for her or something?

71
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,660
Did you have that little trust in me?

72
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,860
How could you just believe that without even confirming it with—

73
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,340
How could I tell you?

74
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,150
Even now, your upset feelings come first, right?

75
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,520
Why do you think I couldn't tell you?

76
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,040
Haven't you ever thought about that?

77
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,220
You were going through a hard time after switching majors,

78
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,570
but Ro Sa helped you with all the assignments and school life.

79
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,520
So how could I ask you not to hang out with her?

80
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,170
When you two seemed to have more in common than us...

81
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,440
The escape room, a trip to Tongyeong, and the SeoRab post.

82
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,770
So many things kept happening that bothered me.

83
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,410
I liked you first...

84
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,290
and crushed on you for a long time.

85
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:31,380
I often worried that it was only I who liked you.

86
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,780
I had hoped that you would be able to reassure me first before I even had to ask you!

87
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,990
Before I felt insecure,

88
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,740
I hoped you would be able to draw the line

89
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,360
and consider my feelings a bit more.

90
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,130
But...

91
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,120
was I being too greedy?

92
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,550
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,810
You know as well as I do that I have no sense about these things.

94
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,110
I thought that was true, so I tried to understand you.

95
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,320
But...

96
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,150
don't you think that being senseless...

97
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,110
meant that you were also just that indifferent toward me?

98
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,080
What's the point in saying all this now?

99
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,880
I'll get going first.

100
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:02,080
There's not much time left until the camera test.

101
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,930
You're right.

102
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,460
Time really flies.

103
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,660
It feels like it hasn't been long since the recruitment ad.

104
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,150
Oppa.

105
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,890
Go on a date with me once I'm done with the camera test.

106
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,990
Just to have a meal and watch a movie.

107
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,380
Thinking about going on a date with you would

108
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,910
motivate me while I prepare for the camera test.

109
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,580
Please?

110
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,750
Sure, let's do that. It's the 16th, right?

111
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,020
You promise?

112
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,930
You promise to watch a movie and eat with me, okay?

113
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,210
You promised, okay?

114
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,230
Yes.

115
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,800
Ji Min's team, since you're not participating in the Cheering Festival,

116
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,380
please assist the planning team.

117
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,960
What? The planning team?

118
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,090
Yes.

119
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,630
There's going to be a giveaway event on campus

120
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,670
and we also need to advertise the Cheering Festival.

121
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,520
Ji Min, you take the role of the planning team leader.

122
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,990
Let's practice now.

123
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,870
This is your doing?

124
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,850
I'm not going to just stand back anymore.

125
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,860
Shall we try this a little bit like this?

126
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,270
Leader.

127
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,240
I understand that we need to shorten the performance time at the Cheering Festival,

128
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,540
but can't you just let our team perform at least one verse?

129
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,530
We've been looking forward to the Cheering Festival for the whole year.

130
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,300
Preventing us from performing so suddenly like this is...

131
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,550
The other teams have already arranged their choreo, so that'll be difficult.

132
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,960
Are you...

133
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,720
being like this because of the rumors?

134
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,080
What are you talking about?

135
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,520
Why would I concern myself about a rumor that's not even true?

136
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,000
If that's not it, then it doesn't make sense for you to tell us to drop out.

137
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,090
I understand you're being put on the spot because of those rumors.

138
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,080
But while we're trying to clear up the rumors,

139
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,190
there's no need for our innocent members to miss out on the Cheering Festival.

140
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,130
Hey, Seo Ji Min.

141
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,860
I told you I don't care about those rumors.

142
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,530
Stop assuming things.

143
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,880
If you think it's that unfair,

144
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,950
you should've had your team finish practicing the second verse, too.

145
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,450
That's not...

146
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,820
At that time, I clearly said that our team had a lot of engineering students,

147
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,380
so it was difficult to find a time where everyone was—

148
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,870
You said you could manage it at the time.

149
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,390
Why are you making excuses now?

150
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,420
The Cheer Squad isn't just about standing on stage.

151
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,850
The planning team is just as important as the Cheering Festival,

152
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,490
so talk to your team and get started.

153
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,420
Here. It's the Cheer Squad's card,

154
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,900
so use this to purchase the prizes for the event winners.

155
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,940
What?

156
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,990
Why didn't you just tell Leader that I wrote the post on SeoRab?

157
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,560
If it were you, you might've told him.

158
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,310
If you discovered my weakness,

159
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:47,040
you probably would've taken the chance to expose me right away.

160
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,370
But I'm different from you.

161
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:58,980
I don't need to say anything, and I'll still beat you.

162
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,840
We'll see about that.

163
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,420
Fine.

164
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,230
Let's do our best until the end.

165
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,630
Hello?

166
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,550
Hello, this is the office of the Hanguk App Development Contest.

167
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:32,030
This is Cha Min Ho from the Give It Up team that advanced to the finals, right?

168
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,780
Yes, that's right.

169
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,910
I'm calling you because Moon Joon isn't picking up his phone.

170
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,700
Yes, what's the matter?

171
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,440
I would like to respond to the inquiry that was made yesterday regarding forfeiture.

172
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,010
Excuse me? Forfeiture?

173
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,610
I just got a call from the office of the app competition

174
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,830
and I was told something strange.

175
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,980
Did you ask about forfeiture?

176
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,300
Yes.

177
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,000
I was the one who asked.

178
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,500
What? Why?

179
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,830
Min Ho.

180
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,310
I thought about it

181
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,390
and I think there's a better option for us than participating in the competition.

182
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,520
- What...
- I'll be honest with you.

183
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,380
My father is very interested in this app.

184
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,400
I'm going to join Levan and launch this app.

185
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,580
What you need most right now is money

186
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,390
and what I need...

187
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,300
is the title of this app's developer.

188
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,040
So could you just

189
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,110
sell your app to me?

190
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,900
Hyung, but still, that's—

191
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,930
Even if we participate in the competition, there's no guarantee that we'll win first place.

192
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,960
But if you just hand the app over to me,

193
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,370
I can give you 30 million won ($30.000) immediately.

194
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,670
But still...

195
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,510
Then that means I can't launch the app under my name.

196
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,230
So the app that I worked my butt off on

197
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,070
will be owned by you and Levan.

198
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,730
Isn't...

199
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,250
what you need most desperately right now...

200
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,960
money?

201
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,770
Gosh!

202
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,680
Geez, so heavy.

203
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,820
I know.

204
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,530
We can't perform at the festival, and we're just prize shuttles.
(T/N: Sort of like an errand slave)

205
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,630
What the heck?

206
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,350
I endured one year looking forward to the Cheering Festival.

207
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,610
This is so depressing.

208
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,380
But...

209
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,850
the prizes this year are so nice.

210
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,440
Right?

211
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,490
I should've submitted a story instead of practicing for the Cheering Festival,

212
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,300
so I could win a prize.

213
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,900
You guys are still here?

214
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,560
Yes. We need to organize all the prizes

215
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,400
because we're on the planning team.

216
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,380
I see.

217
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,910
So you guys haven't eaten yet, right?

218
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,750
Right.

219
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,220
Because of Ji Min's rumors,

220
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,030
you guys are suffering, too.

221
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,560
You can't perform at the festival, and you're just doing chores.

222
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,040
It's not like Ji Min Unni did this on purpose.

223
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,170
If you think about it, Ji Min Unni is also a victim of the rumors.

224
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,050
Sunbae, were the prizes always this nice?

225
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,960
Wireless earphones and jackets.

226
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,750
It's everything I ever wanted.

227
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,060
The winners are so lucky.

228
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,660
I never have luck with these things.

229
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,060
Do you need luck?

230
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,670
It's all up to the person who chooses.

231
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,240
It's not like there's a restriction against Cheer members.

232
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,810
Isn't that right?

233
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,450
This is so good.

234
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,240
Go ahead and eat.

235
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,860
Thank you, Sunbae.

236
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,510
Thank you for the food.

237
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,780
You have good luck with a man this month.

238
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,080
Noona, are you seeing someone?

239
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,540
What in the world?

240
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,620
So the man and this noona,

241
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,210
will they work out? Are they good together?

242
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:25,690
That man seems to be younger than you,

243
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,990
and his image is very neat

244
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,330
and he's organized.

245
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,070
That's what it's telling me.

246
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,990
Really? And then what?

247
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,110
Let's see.

248
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,500
But...

249
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,160
it won't work out. Just give up.

250
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,760
What?

251
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,680

She is attracted to him at first because he's cute,

253
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,440
but after dating him, she's turned off by his immaturity.

254
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,790
What it says is

255
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,940
that he's the very clingy type.

256
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,940
It says that you'll break up after one month.

257
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,750
What are you saying?

258
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,020
Do you know how fast I matured?

259
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,630
I was known in Tongyeong for being mature since the age of five!

260
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,810
On top of that,

261
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,360
what will you do if we don't break up after one month?

262
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,100
Are you going to give us a refund?

263
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,550

but they came out so inaccurately.

275
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,930
You've been solo until now because you consider

276
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,680
dating to be something extravagant.

we haven't gathered since the MT.

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,990
Was it Seohee-dong?

332
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,230
Well...

333
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,190
The landlord suddenly raised the deposit,

334
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,280
so I think we're going to be canceling the contract.

335
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,920
We can just find another house later.

336
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
I think we're going to get a house near your school.

337
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,380
I really love the house and the fact that it's close to your university,

338
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,470
and the price is also just within our budget. Amazing, right?

339
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,040
What the heck? I just barely escaped your grasp.

340
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,200
Hey. Prepare yourself.

341
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,070
I'm going to pop in and keep an eye on you.

342
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,350
I thought about it.

343
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,390
I'll do as you say.

344
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,540
You don't have wireless earphones, right?

345
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,280
I can get them for you.

346
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,900
All right.

347
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,620
Okay.

348
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,770
Kim Jae Man, Psychology,

349
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,540
201705075.

350
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,030
The wireless earphones for me.

351
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,200
I want to give them to my boyfriend.

352
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,150
What about you?

353
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,210
My roommate is going to get mine for me.

354
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,570
Seo Joo Ran.

355
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,180
Seo Joo Ran...

356
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,040
Computer Science.

357
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,520
Oh, yeah. Bo Bae and Hyo Jeong.

358
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,490
The event results are today, right?

359
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,750
Have you finished writing the notice?

360
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,330
Yes.

361
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,950
Here.

362
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,550
[Winner Announcement]

363
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,210
You did a good job.

364
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,640
But...

365
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,440
there could be an issue with personal information,

366
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,980
so let's just cover part of the phone numbers

367
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,300
with symbols and then submit it.

368
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,220
- Okay.
- Okay!

369
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,600
It was on short notice,

370
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,300
- but you guys did a good job.
- No problem.

371
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,610
I'm going first.

372
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,150
Okay. Goodbye, Unni.

373
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:15,960
Bye, Unni.

374
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,380
- Get home safely.
- Okay.

375
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,280
You said let's eat next time, but you haven't contacted me.

376
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,520
So I came looking for you.

377
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,380
That's right.

378
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,540
You're going to keep your promise, right?

379
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,180
I'm sorry.

380
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,960
For being senseless.

381
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,930
Don't you think that being senseless...

382
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,730
meant that you were also just that indifferent towards me?

383
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,510
Why does it seem spicier?

384
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,940
I told you to order the less spicy one.

385
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,000
My pride won't allow that.

386
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,080
It's still good, though.

387
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,310
It's really good.

388
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,200
I can join you, right?

389
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,040
What are you doing here?

390
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,900
I just craved something spicy.

391
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,920
- But you can't eat spicy foods.
- No.

392
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,510
I still can when I need to.

393
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,530
You always drink this when eating something spicy.

394
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,970
You can take the taxi from here, right?

395
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,810
No.

396
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,700
I'll take you home.

397
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,590
The driver is waiting, so I think you should get in.

398
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,800
We'll just go together since we're going in the same direction.

399
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,950
Yes, get in.

400
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,950
I'll contact you.

401
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,020
Have a safe ride.

402
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,580
How did you know I was there?

403
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,980
I asked Joo Ah.

404
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,140
She said you told her you're going to go eat jjamppong.

405
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,270
Then why did you come?

406
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,730
I have something to say.

407
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,240
What is it?

408
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,000
Ji Min.

409
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,980
Can't we start over?

410
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,640
What?

411
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,290
I know I hurt you.

412
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,330
I've been reflecting.

413
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:49,550
I'm bad at expressing myself and have no sense,

414
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,340
so I made you lonely and miserable.

415
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,000
But in the end, it was all a misunderstanding

416
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,780
and what happened was not my intention.

417
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,540
So...

418
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,060
I don't know why we need to break up.

419
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:16,610
I've been too hurt by those misunderstandings,

420
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,580
so I'm still scared of starting over.

421
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,750
Are you sure you're not hesitating for another reason?

422
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,230
What?

423
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,260
Ban Yi Dam.

424
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,300
What about you? Aren't you asking to start over because of Ban Yi Dam, too?

425
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,560
What?

426
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,140
Why would you say that?

427
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,410
See?

428
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,230
We're fighting now, too.

429
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,840
How can we start over?

430
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,080
Just grab it.

431
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,720
Okay.

432
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,750
Noona, give me your phone.

433
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,890
Why my phone?

434
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,660
What is this exactly?

435
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,110
What do you have me as?

436
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:55,320
Of course, "My Girlfriend."

437
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,110
Wait, Noona. Let's choose pet names.

438
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,030
I've been thinking about something.

439
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,900
What is it?

440
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,540
Yeong and Jjin.

441
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,760
Or My Yeong and My Jjin.

442
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,560
Or since it's Hwang Bo Yeong and Gil Mok Jin,

443
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,750
Bo and Gil?

444
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,330
Or Elsa and Olaf.

445
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,330
- I reject them all.
- Why?

446
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,430
How can I use those?

447
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,990
Isn't My Yeong and My Jjin doable?

448
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,350
- It's not.
- Still. Just once. Just once!

449
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,970
- I said, no.
- Just once.

450
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,360
Why?

451
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,780
Yeong Unni!

452
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
What are you two doing here?

453
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,710
Oh, we're...

454
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,270
Oh. You're coming back from doing the assignment?

455
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,100
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

456
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,260
The assignment.

457
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,800
You just finished work?

458
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,810
Let's go in together.

459
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,500
Joo Ah, have you heard?

460
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,510
Min Ho forfeited from the app competition.

461
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,550
Huh?

462
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,220
- Forfeited?
- Yes.

463
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,700
He didn't tell me the specifics, but that's what happened.

464
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,770
It's a shame.

465
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,140
I was going to go cheer for him at the competition.

466
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,850
So?

467
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,600
You forfeited in exchange for 30 million won

468
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,400
when a bigger opportunity could come from winning first place?

469
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,860
There's no guarantee that we'll win first place anyway.

470
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,690
And even if we win first place, they'll have the copyright,

471
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,520
so I just sold it to Hyung instead of the competition.

472
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,140
No.

473
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,780
If you win the competition, you're winning with your name.

474
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,790
But you won't even be able to say

475
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,200
that you made this after all your hard work!

476
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,410
Thirty million won.

477
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,700
Sure,

478
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,120
I know that's a lot.

479
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,280
It's a very big amount.

480
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,830
But even so,

481
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,750
how could you hand over an app

482
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,180
that's like your child?

483
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,370
And the fact that a big company like Levan wants to buy it

484
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,290
means that it's that much more incredible!

485
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,760
You should think about running a business with that.

486
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,180
How could you just hand it over?

487
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,830
Then what? I want to do something for Noona!

488
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,790
I was just Noona's baggage my entire life.

489
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,570
Can't I just help her out this once?

490
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,920
Baggage?

491
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,270
You were Unni's baggage?

492
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,390
Does Unni think the same?

493
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,530
Anyway, we already forfeited

494
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,700
and I've made my choice.

495
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,270
It's my app, so I'll do what I want with it.

496
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,290
Oppa, this really isn't right.

497
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,110
Do you have to go this far?

498
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,720
But Joo Ah,

499
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,930
it's not like I stole the app.

500
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,540
I bought it from Min Ho with my own money.

501
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,740
And money is what Min Ho needed the most.

502
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,980
What?

503
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,980
Furthermore, Min Ho agreed

504
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,230
- and it doesn't seem like there's a problem.
- No.

505
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,700
There is a problem.

506
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,600
All you care about is making a transaction. You have no heart.

507
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,260
If you genuinely cared about Min Ho,

508
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,950
you would've thought about what was best for him.

509
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,400
But what you're doing,

510
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,710
is giving him money that he urgently needs at the expense of his dream.

511
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,150
That's why I bought it from him after coming to an agreement.

512
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,330
It's not like I threatened him and stole his idea.

513
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,210
Do you know what's really bad about you?

514
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,740
Not realizing that what comes easy to you

515
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,500
is essential to others.

516
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,770
That's worse than threatening and stealing.

517
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,360
You wouldn't know,

518
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,770
but this is

519
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,920
essential to me as well.

520
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,500
Is that why you said that you developed BABting, too?

521
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,340
I don't think I should be hearing all this from you.

522
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,630
Min Ho...

523
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,860
clearly said that it's okay.

524
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,330
Saying that it's okay doesn't mean it's right.

525
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,070
Do you gift wrap it as well?

526
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:22,330
Yes. Please wrap it as pretty as possible.

527
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,890
I'm going to confess to my first love.

528
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,370
[Leader]

529
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,900
Hello?

530
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,980
Seo Ji Min. Where are you?

531
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,770
Seo Ji Min, open SeoRab immediately.

532
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,050
Today, I heard in my dorm that some Cheer Squad member

533
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,470
arranged the event prizes to go to her roommate and boyfriend.

534
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,220
If this is true, isn't this peculation?

535
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,370
If they're going to take it all, why even announce it?

536
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,170
Is everyone else who participated just pushovers?

537
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,020
Please investigate properly. This is embarrassing.

538
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,990
If this is true, it's time to investigate.

539
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,910
- They're a Con Squad, not Cheer Squad.
- Explain yourselves.

540
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,770
Just disband.

541
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,270
I mean...

542
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,590
Who the hell is responsible for this?

543
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,540
Who in the planning team

544
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,150
was in charge of the event?

545
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,300
I'll take responsibility for everything.

546
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,150
I'm very sorry

547
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,040
for causing inconvenience to the members as well.

548
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,590
The image of the cheering squad has been tarnished,

549
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,910
and there are a lot of rumors about disbanding the Cheer Squad.

550
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,610
Shouldn't someone be held accountable for this?

551
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:27,410
The accountable member should be expelled in order to avoid

552
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,900
any backlash toward the Cheer Squad.

553
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,800
What is she saying?

554
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,820
I'll take

555
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,370
any punishment.

556
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,050
"To present this..."

557
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,520
To present...

558
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,500
Unni. What do you think of this outfit?

559
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,660
You're wearing that for the camera test?

560
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,690
No, for my date with Min Ho Oppa.

561
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,990
Is it too much?

562
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,850
What type of style does Min Ho Oppa like?

563
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,080
Um...

564
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,650
I don't know.

565
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,150
Can't you ask him for me?

566
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,560
I want to suit his taste since it's our first date.

567
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,230
Ha Neul, there's big trouble.

568
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,260
What is it?

569
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,140
You didn't hear about the Cheer Squad?

570
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,760
SeoRab is going crazy.

571
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,030
Cheer Squad?

572
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,510
I guess you haven't seen Ji Min's formal apology.

573
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,230
Take a look.

574
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:48,300
Hello. This is Seo Ji Min from the 41st Dionysus cheering squad.

575
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:53,200
I deeply apologize for the inconvenience and scandal caused by the event

576
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,790
that was held by the cheering squad on the 8th of this month.

577
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,510
To take responsibility for this matter,

578
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,380
I, who was the leader of the event planning team,

579
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,250
will immediately resign as a cheerleader

580
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,030
and leave the Cheer Squad.

581
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,340
Let's try it together.

582
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,600
You said you don't want to be misunderstood,

583
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,580
but you did something that could cause a misunderstanding.

584
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,920
You took the blame even though you had nothing to do with it, right?

585
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,780
Well...

586
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,390
I was still the leader.

587
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,860
Are you okay?

588
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,530
You must be so disappointed.

589
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,160
But...

590
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,700
the Cheer Squad is the one who should be disappointed.

591
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,260
Since they lost Seo Ji Min.

592
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:08,230
You said you worked hard and only looked forward to the Cheer Squad since high school,

593
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,800
so how about using this chance to try something else?

594
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,820
You've been really hurt by the Cheer Squad.

595
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:22,020
Even if it's your dream, I don't think you should do it if it upsets you.

596
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,020
Because you're still more important than a dream.

597
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,360
Leader Seo Ji Min is cool,

598
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,220
but isn't Seo Ji Min in itself a title?

599
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,260
My hobby is a bit omnivorous, so I like a lot of things.

600
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,350
Let's do this and that together and find another dream.

601
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,240
I'll help you.

602
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,230
Why are you all serious like that?

603
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,120
Are you going to scold me?

604
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,200
I heard from Joo Ah,

605
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,350
that you sold your app.

606
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:15,580
You're going to help me buy a house with the money you received in exchange for selling your dream?

607
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,020
That's nonsense!

608
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,320
Do you think I could use that money guilt free?

609
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,790
So what if you do? It's just once.

610
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,370
I told you I want to be of help to you.

611
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,380
You only think about what makes you feel better.

612
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,380
You don't think about how I would feel?

613
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,640
Do you think I could freely use the money you got

614
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,180
from selling your pride and dream?

615
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,250
Do you think this is what I really want?

616
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,350
Like you said, I'm also Mom's daughter.

617
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,160
I am, but...

618
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:59,240
I've also been your guardian until now.

619
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,860
There were times when it was too much to handle,

620
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,040
but it was my choice, and I was happy most of the time.

621
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:17,000
Just seeing you mature more quickly than other kids and grow up early...

622
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,360
That alone was enough to break my heart.

623
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,140
I really don't want to see you give up on your dreams too early.

624
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,540
Don't make me a bad person.

625
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,440
And I think you're misunderstanding something.

626
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,270
I never sacrificed myself or put you first.

627
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,700
I invested in you with the choices I made.

628
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,840
So you have to accomplish your dream, no matter what.

629
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,330
Understood?

630
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,910
I really don't want to see you give up on your dreams too early.

631
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,390
Don't make me a bad person.

632
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,350
How could you hand over an app

633
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:18,150
that's like your child?

634
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,230
[Moon Joon]

635
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,100
So?

636
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,240
When are you planning to join the company?

637
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,470
If possible, I would like to launch the app as soon as possible.

638
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:43,240
I'm thinking sometime this month.

639
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,780
Okay.

640
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,150
Good job.

641
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,800
You did well.

642
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:54,300
I was honestly a bit surprised.

643
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,130
I really...

644
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,130
underestimated you.

645
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,670
I wouldn't have asked you to join the company if I had any doubts in you.

646
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,600
I'll assign you everyone who's top in their field,

647
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,020
so increase the scale and prepare accordingly.

648
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,510
Okay.

649
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,150
[Min Ho]

650
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,870
Take it.

651
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,230
Hello?

652
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,790
Hyung, where are you?

653
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,130
I'm at my dad's company.

654
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,310
Then I'll head over there right now.

655
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,800
Right now?

656
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,930
Min Ho.

657
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,030
What brings you all the way here?

658
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,040
Hyung.

659
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,510
I'm not going to sell the app.

660
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,340

830
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,100
You would think he's in a relationship.

Therefore, rather than unconditionally opposing the development of AI,

we should study how humans control AI technically and ethically.
