1
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,690
You should've taken cover if it started raining.

2
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,790
Why were you just getting rained on?

3
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,960
Are you okay?

4
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,660
Of course, I am.

5
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,170
But you couldn't go to the photo exhibition because of me.

6
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,020
The photo exhibition?

7
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,350
We decided to go the day after tomorrow.

8
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,510
You should've just gone today.

9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,640
This day comes around every year. It's not a big deal.

10
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,260
You would've

11
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,170
done the same for me.

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,080
To be honest,

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,090
even though it has been 12 years,

14
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,700
I don't know how to console you properly on this day.

15
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,100
As your friend, the only thing I can do

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,360
is just stay with you.

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,410
So I thought I should do this faithfully.

18
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,230
Every year, on that day,

19
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:35,250
I can't stop the rain that pours in your heart,

20
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,400
but I can stand in it with you.

21
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,210
I can at least hold an umbrella for you.

22

That's what will ease my heart.

23

That's why I came.

24
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,680
Joo Seong took a leave of absence.

25
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,980
Oh, that guy who switched majors from Liberal Arts?

26
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,140
He seemed to have trouble adjusting. I guess he ended up taking a leave.

27
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,010
Honestly, you can't last in Computer Engineering unless you have a knack for it.

28
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,580
That's right. Quitting as soon as possible is the best.

29
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,390
Don't let what they say bother you.

30
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,970
Talent is important, but

31
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,640
the kids who do their best also make it.

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,000
One of my classmates made so much fuss about dropping out in their first year,

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,490
but they gritted their teeth and even got a scholarship last semester.

34
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,500
Oh, right. And this.

35
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,270
The cheat sheet I told you about.

36
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,210
You really got your hands on it.

- Did you review it yet?
- You look at it first.

38
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,500
I'll review it after finishing my assignment.

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,180
Oh, thank you.

- I'll use it well.
- Sure.

41
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,570
Don't you think the computer science group chat is so funny?

42
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,280
How is our dress code a plaid shirt even though we are computer science majors? / (T/N: Comp-sci major stereotype is nerds in plaid shirts)

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,230
What are you talking about?

44
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,540
Wait.

45
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,400
You still... didn't get the invite to the comp-sci group chat?

46
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,380
Whoa.

47
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,300
I'll invite you to the chat immediately.

48

Also, Ha Neul still hasn't paid his student fees yet.

49
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,910
What should he do in regards to the Night of the ComEn event?

50
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,260
Oh. People who haven't paid their fees just need to pay 10,000 won (~10 dollars).

51
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,650
Oh, okay.

52
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,310
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

Many sunbaes who are working now will be there,

- Sure, okay.

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,510
I'll send you all the announcements posted until now, just in case.

Hyung, what are you doing at school?

I stopped by because of work. Your app was great.

Wow, Cha Min Ho, you're pretty skilled.

There's a hyung I know who works at an investing company

65
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,400
and he said he's interested in promising apps.

66
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,830
What do you think about co-owning a business with me?

67
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,600
You develop the apps, and I'll run the business.

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,510
No way. How could I run a business?

69
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,300
Why not?

I don't have that kind of money.

Yeah? Then just let me know if you're interested.

Well, they said that was the only one left.

I read the reviews, and they said it's not that scary.

Since the pattern seems to be in a geometric sequence, the next one is...

The science majors sure are different.

How did they think of solving that through math?

Then let's approach this in a liberal arts way.

117
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,000
Maybe it has something to do with a historical event?

Or it could be an author who's active now

00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,320
- I wonder if she'll last past a month.
- Huh?

491
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,370
Huh?

492
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,990
Oh, it's nothing.

493
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,210
I really like the photos.

494

I'm sorry.

495

I'm sorry.

496

She's not looking at the photos, but somewhere else (Joon).

497

Why would you follow us here? You came to disrupt our date, didn't you?

498
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:12,080
I followed you? I just suddenly really wanted to read some manhwa books.
(T/N: Manhwa = comic books/graphic novels)

499
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,200

Joo Ah, did you choose all your books?

501
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,650
Yes, I did.

502
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,000
- Should we go?
- Sure.

503
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,220
Here?

504
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,120
Thank you.

505
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,530
Sunbae, should we eat something while reading manhwa books?

506
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,430
The spam mayo over rice and carbonara spicy rice cake is good here.

507
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,750
Sure. Let's have them.

508

Wow, it's so cozy here.

510

511

Ji Min, I don't think I can go to the photo exhibition this week.

- Yes.

520
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,970
I'm about to do everything myself because I met the wrong team member.

521
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,210
But he's more shameless the more I think about it.

522
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,730
He asked me to do everything by myself, and he'll pay for food and snacks

523
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,630
Ridiculous, right?

Are you listening?

525
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:32,490
Oh, well, we just need to go to the exhibition within the month.

526

I'll let you know after I look at my schedule.

529

Sunbae, there's a really delicious new menu item at my part-time job.

530

Also, we installed a TV to air baseball games.

531

If we go now, we'll make it in time for the bottom of the sixth inning.

- Would you like to go?
- Really?

533

- Should we?
- Yes!

534
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,820
- Then I'll go get the car.
- Okay.

535
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,550
Then I'll just use the restroom really quick.

Stop getting in the way and leave.

- Yeah?

Joo Ah, you know baseball really well.

555
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,250
I didn't know you were that big of a fan.

556
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,400
Of course. You don't know how hard I studied.

559
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,550
No way! You're saying that's a strike? It's definitely a ball!

560
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,590
Right? That was a bit high.

561
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,050
Referee Kim Han Kyeong is the best at judging strikes.

562

He's almost like AlphaGo.

Then...

587
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:23,700
My friend saved Ha Neul's number as Ma Neul on her phone.

588
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,900
This was a pet name that only I called him.

589
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,780
But all of Ha Neul's game IDs are Ma Neul,

590
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,820
so I'm thinking it could be for that reason.

591
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,900
I'm probably being too sensitive, right?

00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,310
but they only allow carryout.

651
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,320
But I don't think I need to eat it anymore.

652
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,920
I should go back in.

653
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,650
Shall we?

654
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,180
You'll probably get penalty points because it's past curfew.

655
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,610
It's okay.

656
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,830
It's only two penalty points if I get back before 1 am.

657
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:37,510
Sunbae, I had a lot of fun today.

658
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,030
Me, too.

659
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,490
Let's go, Min Ho.

660
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,070
Bye.

661
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,680
Bye, Hyung.

662
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,510
Min Ho.

663
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,880
Do you like Joo Ah?

664
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,300
What?

665
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,420
Me? Like her?

666
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,880
No way. That's ridiculous.

667
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,040
Well... Even at the photo exhibition, and now,

668
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,200
it seemed like you came intentionally because of Joo Ah.

669
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,000
No, I didn't, Hyung.

670
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,450
Really?

671
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,780
If that's the case, then that's a relief.

672
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,360
How do you feel about Joo Ah?

673
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,710
Me?

674
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,090
I get happier when I see Joo Ah.

675
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:46,930
I'll go now.

676
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,340
Okay.

677
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,600
[Joo Ah] Hey, hey, hey. Come to the lounge for a second.

678
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,730
Hey. What did Sunbae say?

679
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,690
Did he say anything about our date being good?

680
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,830
Not really.

681
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,780
He didn't say anything about me?

682
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,720
Not at all.

683
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,520
Hey. You know,

684
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,380
- I have a dream now.
- What now? To be Moon Joon's girlfriend?

685
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,840
That, too. But another dream.

686
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,600
A dream job.

687
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,110
What is it?

688
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,550
A sports announcer.

689
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,020
An announcer? All of a sudden?

690
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:42,000
I've really come to enjoy baseball. Watching it

691
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,010
and studying it is fun, too.

692
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:48,040
There wasn't anything I wanted to do until now,

693
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,910
but I feel like I could have fun with this.

694
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,390
It does seem like it'll suit your energy level.

695
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,150
Right? This is my first dream.

696
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,690
If it weren't for Sunbae, I wouldn't have gotten to know baseball.

697
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:04,110
Then I wouldn't have a dream, either.

698
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:09,210
Honestly, I like Moon Joon even more now.

699
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,070
What about me?

700
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:19,140
Aren't there things that I made better?

701
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,590
There are.

702
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,560
Moon Joon!

703
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,390
I met Moon Joon because you registered for the elective class.

704
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,350
And I got to go to the computer science party because of you

705
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,950
and held hands with Moon Joon.

706
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:38,450
Hey. Now that I think about it, how commendable of you, Cha Min Ho.

707
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:41,530
Did you call me here to spew nonsense?

708
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,400
I'm going to sleep.

709
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,370
Why?

710
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:49,690
It seemed like things were going well for you with Yang Hui, too!

711
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,890
Did you stay up late doing your assignment?

712
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,990
Ha Neul almost pulled an all-nighter.

713
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,090
Really?

714
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:04,530
Computer science is brutal.

715
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,010
He was on a remote call until dawn to finish his assignment.

716
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:10,420
That means Ro Sa was also up until that time to help you.

717
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,830
That's rough. So brutal.

718
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,340
I'm going. I'll see you at the dorm.

719
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:20,990
What time did you stay up to do your assignment?

720
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:24,150
Around 5 am?

721
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:27,780
Then you were on call with Ro Sa until then?

722
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,990
We were... only on call until around 3 am.

723
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,850
Did you call her first to ask her for help?

724
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:39,420
No. Last night, Min Ho wasn't at the dorm.

725
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,980
I was about to break down with no one to ask

726
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,540
when Ro Sa called.

727
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:50,360
Why are you so down since yesterday?

728
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,000
- Is something going on?
- Me?

729
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,040
Nope.

730
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,120
What do you mean?

731
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,450
You've been feeling down since the café yesterday.

732
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:02,630
- Nothing's wrong.
- Are you sure there's nothing wrong

733
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,130
or are you just not telling me?

734
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,540
Why wouldn't I tell you?

735
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,290
I just get that feeling from you these days.

736
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,140

740
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:31,620
Does that make sense?

00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,610
Stop it!

742
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,600

- Mine is higher than yours.

745

746
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,250
Noona!

747

That's ridiculous!

What brings you here?

- Did you eat?
- I ate.

752
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,060
Give me a tour of your school.

753
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,690

754
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:01,630
Is this your department?

755
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:12,750
How impressive, Cha Min Ho.

756
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,890
Thanks to you, I get to tour an elite school.

757
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:16,370
How nice.

758
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,950
You should've gone to college, too.

759
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:23,820
Hey, even if I had, I couldn't have gotten into a renowned university like this.

I'm happy you're attending a good university like this.

- She's in class.

763
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:35,700
Is she doing well?

764
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,360
I don't know. She's busy these days.

765
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,460
Why? Did she get a boyfriend?

766
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,640
She has become strange from having a crush.

767
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,710
- Really?
- Yeah.

768

Oh, my gosh! That's so cute!

please organize these receipts.

794
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:41,930
She's dating Manager Yoon.

795
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,520
They entered the company in the same year,

796
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,800
but the boyfriend is getting promotions because he's a college graduate

797
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,840
and she's stuck with being an office assistant because she's only a high school graduate.

798
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:57,360
I heard she placed first or second in a renowned vocational school.

799
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:00,730
If they were going to discriminate against her like this,

800
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:03,780
they shouldn't have hired a high school graduate, in the first place.

801

If you don't want the short end of the stick,
