How many exams do you have left?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,660
I have two left. What about you?

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,800
I have three left.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,380
Did you do well on your exam?

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,080
Oh, never mind.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,850
Why am I asking you?

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,370
I need to do well myself.

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,920
Are you doing well?

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,790
I think I was able to get my hands on cheat sheets during our first year,

11
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,940
but I can't find any now that I'm not active in my major.

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,290
There's no one I can ask if I have a question.

13
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,940
Or why don't you just ask your professor?

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,160
You can make an impression on him that you're a diligent student while you're at it.

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,480
Oh! Good idea!

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,030
As expected.

17
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,640
A valedictorian is different.

00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,630
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

Here. Mayo-Killer.

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,200
I was disappointed that it was missing mayonnaise.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,880
Do you carry this around with you?

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,120
I just kept the ones I got last time.

23
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,730
I'm going now. Good luck with your exam.

24
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,230
Okay. I'll see you at the school cafeteria.

25
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,330
How are your exams going?

26
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,960
Hey. I told you not to tell anyone about us dating.

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,010
Is it that difficult to keep a secret?

28
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,900
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,700
- I never told anyone.
- What the heck?

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,120
Ro Sa said you told her.

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,010

00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,690
Seriously.

Hey.

35
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,300
You're the one who exposed Joon Wu and Eun Seo's relationship.

36
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,830
Did you say that I told you about them?

37
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,900
Yes.

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,440
Why are you going this far?

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,000
Fine. Let's say that...

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,100
you did all those things because you like Ha Neul.

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,310
But what about this?

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,730
You're intentionally trying to screw me over.

43
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,470
Why are you doing this?

44
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,070
Because I don't like you.

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,330
Why?

46
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,250
I just don't.

47
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,000
I never liked you from the start.

48
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,070
What a relief.

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,130
You're saying that you dislike me for no reason.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,030
If the reason had lain with me,

51
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,460
I might've blamed myself for no reason.

52
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,340
So, your dislike of me

53
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,740
is your problem, not my problem.

54
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,170
I definitely know how you feel now,

55
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,030
so I won't concern myself with you and will do whatever I want.

56
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,530
They say that hating someone feels like hell.

57
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,900
Good luck.

58
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,660
You exclude the depreciation amount

59
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,430
and multiply the depreciation rate.

60
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,570
Then you can find the accurate value.

61
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,480
I see. Now I understand it.

62

Your passion is amazing.

67

This is the first time in my entire professor career

68
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,730
that a student came back to ask for help

69
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,150
after the exam has been completed.

70

Why do I go on living?

75
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,890
Take it as a sign from God to retake the class and forget about it.

Hey. Don't you dare tell Joon Oppa about this, okay?

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,440
Why not?

He must think I'm so pathetic.

No. I have no right to eat.

Yes.

My conscience is telling me not to eat today.

88
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,130
Then I'll take it.

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,570
Hold on. Let me just scrape the dirty part off.

You're right. I haven't really done anything, but it's already time for the festival.

169
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,290

Until the end of the festival.

Let's go.

174
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,740
Why? Are you going to send it to the person you like?

175
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,010
Yeah.

176
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,700
But I don't know whether she would like flowers or not.

177
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,060
I guess I should ask her discreetly.

Okay, I'll see you later.

181

I was trying not to cry,

186
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,070
but this scene is just too sad.

187

I'm confident I won't cry the next time I watch it.

Nope.

197
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,200
I've decided to try again next semester.

Hello.

199
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,610
Joo Ah, are you busy?

200
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,200
There aren't that many customers right now, so it's okay.

201
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,580
I'll get two Iced Americanos.

00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,900
Okay.

203
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,260
Coming right up.

204
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,830
Joo Ah, do you think our club needs to do a food stand for the festival, too?

205
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,600
It's a festival. Of course, we do.

206
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,200
We can make money and build funds for our club.

207
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,830
I'll take care of it.

208

Yeah?

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,320
Then instead of doing it alone, let's do it together.

Okay.

211

I'm glad I asked you, Joo Ah.

- I'll see you tomorrow, Joo Ah.
- Okay.

Could it be that this is the sunbae in the (entering) class of 2016?

Yes.

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,920
Yes, that's right.

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,580
How did you know, Boss?

222
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,500
Isn't he so cool?

00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,160
Where are you going?

225
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,490
Are you finished watching the movie?

226
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,850
Why are you here?

227
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,250
Were you waiting for me by chance?

228
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,200
Yes. For about 30 minutes?

229
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,000
- Why?
- To say hi.

230
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,100
But you're a real crybaby.

231
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,120
You cry every time I see you.

232
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,800
The last time was because the jjamppong was too spicy.

233
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,170
And today was because the movie was too sad.

234
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,330
I usually don't cry.

235
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,540
Seriously, I don't really cry that much.

236
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,810
I cried today because the movie was so sad.

237
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,200
It's okay.

238
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,800
You're even pretty when you cry.

239
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,100
Do you just throw comments like that out there, or do you plan it in advance?

240
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,200
Either way, it's fine as long as you feel good.

241
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,630
I never said I do.

242
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,880
But you didn't hate it, either.

243
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,510
You must be hungry since you cried so much.

244
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,540
Let's go eat.

245
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,390
Please send it to room 103 in the Social Sciences building next Wednesday at 1:00 p.m.

246
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,540
- All right.
- You're sending it to your girlfriend?

247
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,840
Please write your name and contact number here.

248
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,740
Can I send a card, too?

249
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,010
Yes, you can write your message here.

250
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,830
Ta-da!

251
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,020
What's this?

252
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,450
I'm supposed to buy it for you.

253
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,770
There's no rule like that.

254
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,360
The person who wants to give can gift it.

255
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,150
Thank you.

256
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,200
- Do you like it?
- Yes. It's really pretty.

257
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,030
I also really liked that movie you were watching.

258
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,800
Yeah? That was my fifth time watching that movie, too.

259
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,500
I liked it so much that I bought the Blu-ray disc.

260
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,520
Do you like melodramas?

261
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,140
- Yes.
- What other movies do you like?

262
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,490
Me?

263
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,880
Music-related movies?

264
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,850
Something like "La La Land" and "Begin Again."

265
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,800
- Why?
- So that I can like them, too.

266
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,270
Do you like flowers?

267
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,190
- Yes.
- Do you live in the dorms?

268
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,140
You're curious about so many things.

269
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,640
Unni, should you be drinking?

270
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,800
We finished exams today, so just a few sips.

271
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,550
Cheers!

272
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,820
Cheers!

273
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,520
Joo Ah, what happened with the MC position for the festival?

274
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,910
Did you get the results?

275
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,330
They'll announce it soon.

276
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,900
You said the audition went well.

277
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,110
I'm sure it'll work out.

278
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,400
My gosh!

279
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,970
I really hope I made it.

280
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,820
Ji Min, exams are over. Why are you down?

281
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,710
Is something wrong?

282
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,800
Well...

283
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,100
Is he out of his mind?

284
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,870
I shot him down because I didn't want to lose to him,

285
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,070
but I kept having different thoughts afterward.

286
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,500
"Am I such a bad judge of character?"

287
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,500
Or, "Am I that unappealing?"

288
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,540
What are you saying?

289
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,690
If someone says they don't like you, just reflect it back, that's all.

290
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,440
There's no need for you to dislike yourself.

291
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,770
It's not good for your mental health.

292
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,720
But I don't know whether she would like flowers or not.

293
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,040
I guess I should ask her discreetly.

294
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,200
Stop sighing, you punks.

295
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,190
At least you both have dating experience.

296
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,850
When will I be able to date someone?

297
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:35,080
How am I going to clean this all up?

298
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,640
You guys clean up, too.

299
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,350
Okay?

300
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,380
They said they would contact me to announce the MC results.

301
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,400
Why aren't they?

302
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,950
Hey, it's still lunchtime. I'm sure they'll call in the afternoon.

303
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,410
What do you think will happen? Do you think I'll make it?

304
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,470
Do you want an honest answer or a polite answer?

305
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,940
Geez. Just don't say anything!

306
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,930
I think you'll make it.

307
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,080
You're totally stage-material. If you don't make it, then who will?

308
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,300
To be honest, I also think I did very well during the audition,

309
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,200
so I think I might make it.

310
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,060
Unni, Oppa!

311
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,900
- I can sit here, right?
- Sure.

312
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,600
They said I made the MC position!

313
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,320
Oh, my gosh!

314
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,590
Oppa, you need to come to see me at the festival, okay?

315
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,290
Oh, right.

316
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,960
Unni, sorry.

317
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,640
I know you auditioned, too.

318
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,990
I forgot because I got too excited.

319
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,960
It's fine. No need to be sorry.

320
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,400
It was meant for you to get.

321
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,500
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

322
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,160
To be honest, I already bought some clothes for going on stage in advance,

323
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,270
and I was worried that I might not make it.

324
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,410
It's such a relief.

325
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,740
The person in the middle

326
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,340
definitely laughed when I answered.

327
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,130
I guess it was my misunderstanding.

328
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,810
No.

329
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,640
The others might not have,

330
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,390
but that person definitely liked you.

331
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,050
I'm touched.

332
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,420
Unni, you got flowers?

333
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,660
No, it's not mine.

334
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,540
It was delivered.

335
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,380
The dorm manager gave it to me when I came in.

336
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,330
He said it was a delivery for our room.

337
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,030
We don't know who it's intended for, though.

338
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,940
Perhaps...

339
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,340
Joon Oppa?

340
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,580
I think it's about time he confesses to you.

341
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,150
Oh, I also think it's Joon Oppa.

342
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,720
He knows that you live here.

343
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,890
Could it be?

344
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,200
Why don't you ask him subtly later?

345
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,200
Oh, when I was coming in, I saw something about the Pig Pen competition.

346
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,760
They're holding that event. What is that?

347
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,300
Oh, that. They choose the dirtiest room and reward them with fried chicken.

348
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,300
During that period, the boys' and girls' dorms are open for everyone to see.

349
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,600
Does that mean we can go check out the boys' dorm?

350
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,670
Should we go together?

351
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,230
But I need to go to Cheer Squad practice now.

352
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,340
I want to go!

353
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,640
I wanted to go since I didn't get to last year.

354
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,300
Okay. Then let's go together.

355
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,430
What is this?

356
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,290
They mess it up to this extent just for some chicken?

357
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:02,700
Apparently, it's not just one whole chicken. It's one month's worth of chicken.

358
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,200
But, why are there so many people crowded over there?

359
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,360
Should we take a look?

360
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,650
Daebak!

361
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,950
This is your room?

362
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,790
It's squeaky clean!

363
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,900
Are you the only room to use cleaning services?

364
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,850
I'm better than the average cleaning agency.

365
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,500
This room isn't participating in the Pig Pen competition?

366
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,700
We tried convincing him, but he said, never in a million years.

367
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,500
But Hyung agreed to buy us one month's worth of chicken.

368
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,680
Hey, Cha Min Ho, lucky you.

369
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,430
Oppa must do all the cleaning for you.

370

Sometimes it can be overwhelming.

371
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,760
Why? I would love it.

372
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,990
It's a hundred times better to be neat than dirty.

You know what's up, Noona.

374
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,380
He doesn't realize how lucky he is.

375
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,500
Cha Min Ho, I think I received flowers today.

376
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,280
Flowers?

377
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,460
What do you mean, you think you received them?

378
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,150
That's because the flowers were delivered to our room.

379
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,370
We're assuming it's for Joo Ah.

380

Who do you think sent it?

Are you certain?

Sometimes, intuition is the most accurate.

I've reached my goal for the day.

410
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,210
I had exactly three goals today.

411
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,600
To be face-to-face, to eat something together,

412
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,200
and to be asked a question.

413
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,300
And I've achieved all three.

Since I have a crush, I thought I might as well be forward about it.

419
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,710
Openly expressing my feelings for you and being rejected

420
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,860
is better than regretting not saying anything and losing you.

421

And this is also my first time

422

I think I'll be able to fix the bug by tomorrow.

424
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,830
Sure, and I think the main screen should be designed more intuitively.

425
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,790
Then I'll edit the main screen to only display the graph showing the goal-reaching progress.

426
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,950
Sure.

how about doing a retro or starry night concept?

432
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,700
The booth name can be Tapgol Food Stand.

00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,150
and put meaning behind his actions.

823
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:00,100
That's so unfair.

824
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:42,440
Have you seen Joo Ah and Ji Min?

825
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,600
I don't know.

826
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,160
Why are you alone?

827
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,700
Where are Ha Neul and Min Ho?

828
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,400
I don't know about them, either.

829
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:55,200
I'm hungry.

830
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,830
12,000 won ($12)?

831
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:59,300
How much cash do I have?

832
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,210
[Elsa]

833
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,390
Elsa?

834
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:09,590
Oh, this?

835
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:12,210
I chose it at some random blind date,

836
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:16,600
but I went back to the dorm when we were matching up because I felt like my blood sugar was dropping.

837
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,700
Gosh, my timing is crap.

838
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,600
Elsa...

839
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,670
was here.

840
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,120
[Olaf]

841
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,640
Aren't I so stupid?

842
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,010
Mistaking the flowers as mine when I don't even have

843
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:55,000
anyone who would send them to me.

844
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,580
Being all excited as if I'm the person

845
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,080
who the confession post is directed at.

846
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,580
Then again,

847
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,680
how could I be someone's first love?

848
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,880
There's no way.

849
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,250
Why not?

850
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:21,050
Just because you're not Joon Hyung's first love doesn't mean you can't be someone else's.

851
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:25,870
You think so?

852
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,030
So...

853
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:34,430
you might be someone's first love, too.

854
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,570
Me?

855
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:40,600
Yes.

856
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:49,770
You don't even sing at the karaoke.

857
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:52,070
How did you get the courage to go up on stage?

858
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:55,670
Then should I have just sat there when you were dying from nervousness?

859
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:13,690
Here.

860
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:18,260
This...

861
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:21,560
I was going to give this to you, but I missed my timing.

862
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,550
Look.

863
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:39,800
There you go.

864
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,560
How pretty, Ma Joo Ah.

865
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:04,710
♫ The world you spoke of ♫

866
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:06,870
♫ Now that's what is right ♫

867
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:08,930
♫ It became my everything ♫

868
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:11,320
♫ Because you are my world ♫

869
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:16,200
♫ No other reason is needed ♫

870
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,230
- You're not drunk, right?
- Huh?

871
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,280
I'm not drunk, but—

872
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,800
Then no take-backs.

873
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:36,100
♫ I've fallen in love ever since you came to me ♫

874
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:40,360
♫ It all depends on you now ♫

875
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:46,400
♫ Everything will change ♫

876
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,300
♫ Because I'm yours ♫

877
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:58,200
♫ Because you're my world ♫

878
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:04,230
[Dear. M]

879
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,400
~ Preview ~
This was the truth.

880
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,110
Seo Ji Min still hasn't gotten rid of her habit of being so boy-crazy.

881
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,610
Why are they so eager to misunderstand me?

882
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:27,300
But there are people who make an effort to understand you. Like me.

883
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,200
Just keep people like me around you.

884
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,950
Let's forget about what happened last night.

885
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:34,550
You've never gotten excited about me?

886
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,460
Cha Min Ho, get it together.

887
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,630
You really don't know I had feelings for you?

888
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,220
I did try! But I can't.

889
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,040
If you continue to be like this,

890
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,520
I can't hang out with you anymore.
