Well...

7
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,200
Is it one of those hidden tasty restaurants without a sign?

I was actually going to buy you a meal

On what grounds are you asking me this?

34

I don't want to bring up every little thing that bothers me,

35

but I still feel the need to confirm things.

36
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,790
The fact that you took Ha Neul's picture during class,

37
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,990
and saved his name as Maneul on your phone.

38
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,080
Isn't that all because you have feelings for him?

During class,

I already explained I did that to get a good grade.

And his name on my phone holds no meaning.

42
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,800
I just saved it as his nickname.

43
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,790
I save lots of my friends by their nicknames.

44

It's ridiculous that I have to explain myself to you.

- It's a picture of the sky.

You can use this opportunity to check on risky aspects

167
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,510
Fine. You won't even watch one romance drama with your girlfriend.

168
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,200
Why am I wasting my time talking to you?

169
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,510
You said it was fine!

170
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,090
You said you're fine watching it alone.

171
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,560
Did you think I was really okay?

172
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,100
Wow, look at your sense of empathy. Are you showing off that you're a science major?

173
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,140
Aigoo. Then what about you?

174
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,570
Do you talk in circles because you're studying liberal arts?

175
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,100
Forget it. Why are we even dating?

176
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,280
- Let's just break up.
- You bring up a good point.

177
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,820
You took the words out of my mouth.

178
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,770
This is why they say not to be a campus couple.

179
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,770
That couple from earlier was really funny, huh?

180
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,110
Do all couples fight like that?

181
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,450
We wouldn't know since we've never fought.

182
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,070
I know.

183
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,900
But isn't the guy right?

184
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,920
She should tell him so he knows what's going on.

185
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,630
But we don't know that couple's situation.

186
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,310
There could be a reason she didn't want to say anything.

187
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,080
Like something she didn't want him to know.

188
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,640
Or...

189
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,800
the boyfriend could've been unreliable, to begin with.

190
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,400
Oppa, would you like to eat lunch with me tomorrow?

191
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,120
[Ro Sa: Oppa, would you like to eat lunch with me tomorrow?]

192
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,240
Would be great. What time should we meet?

193
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,300
Dongsaengdeul, it means she's interested if she asked me out to eat, right?

194
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,200
You're the one studying psychology.

195
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,850
How could you not know the psychology behind dating?

196
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,590
Dating is all about the data and experience,

197
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,380
but Mok Jin Hyung has never been in a relationship before.

198
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,640
How would he know without any data?

199
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,350
You little punks are spewing painful truth right in front of me!

200
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,230
What is this? Is this real?

201
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,280
BABting will be closed for the safety of all users.

202
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,310
Thank you for using BABting until now.

203
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,790
No wonder I couldn't open the app today.

204
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,700
Joo Ah, are you okay?

205
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,540
You must've been really scared.

206
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,280
It could've ended terrible.

207
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,500
I'm glad nothing happened.

208
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,650
I've had it rough, too,

209
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,520
but Cha Min Ho really worked hard to make that app.

210
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,200
But if I were Min Ho, I would close the app, too.

211
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,230
You, above everyone else, could've gotten hurt.

212
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,890
Min Ho must be suffering, too

213
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,530
and feeling sorry toward you, too.

214
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,770
He even had to shut down the app he had worked hard on.

215
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,500
But he'll overcome it soon.

216
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,620
He'll make another app in the blink of an eye, too.

217
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,220
I know Cha Min Ho.

218
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,640
There could be a reason she didn't want to say anything.

219
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,740
The boyfriend could've been unreliable, to begin with.

220
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,170
Hyung, that doesn't look like an assignment.

221
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,340
What are you doing?

222
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,210
I've been working on a game in my free time.

223
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,900
I really want to complete a game this semester.

224
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,860
Please show me when you're done.

225
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,940
Sure.

226
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,250
Are you pulling an all-nighter, too?

227
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,300
Yes. You, too, right?

228
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,600
Let's do it with a fighting spirit.

229
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,300
Fighting.

230
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,950
[SAT 08:19]

231
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,510
[SAT 08:20]

232
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,300
Excuse me, Ro Sa...

233
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,600
Hey, you came.

234
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,420
Are you up?

235
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,510
Why are you calling me so early in the morning?

236
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,160
I want to start working out starting today.

237
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,260
I'm at the gym. Do you want to come, too?

238
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,920
Why are you doing something you've never done?

239
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,970
Running yesterday made me realize that my stamina isn't the same as before.

240
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,440
I want to increase my stamina and I might as well go on a diet, too.

241
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,820
You're really not going to come?

242
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,600
No. I'm hanging up.

243
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,080
Joo Ah is working out?

244
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,450
Yes. She's going to the gym in the dorms.

245
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,330
Really?

246
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,360
It reeks of sweat in there.

247
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,870
I went there once and thought it was for men only.

248
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,930
There are only guys there.

249
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,030
Okay.

250
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,420
Is this your first time?

251
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,890
Yes.

252
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,120
Why don't you get off for a second?

253
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,380
Look, you shouldn't go all out from the beginning.

254
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,870
Okay.

255
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,400
So you lie down like this.

256
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,410
Grab it like this and just push up.

257
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,160
Breathe out here.

258
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,530
Bring it all the way down and hold your breath.

259
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,870
Understand? Here.

260
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,280
Have a seat.

261
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,920
Give it a try.

262
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,770
That's right. Grab it like that.

263
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,820
Grab it.

264
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,600
Good. Now push all the way up.

265
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,340
As you're pushing up, breathe out.

266
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,860
Breathe in and then push up again.

267
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,970
Good. All the way.

268
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,170
Wow, you're good. That's it.

269
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,870
Thank you.

270
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,100
Are you in physical education?

271
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,400
Oh, I'm in Early Childhood Education.

272
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,910
I'm an Early Childhood Education teaching assistant.

273
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,520
Good. You did well.

274
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,370
Lower it a little and breathe in.

275
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,470
That's right.

276
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,110
Push it all the way up. Good, you're doing great.

277
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,900
Lower it slowly.

278
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,290
Right, and push all the way up.

279
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,290
Hey, Ma Joo Ah.

280
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,800
What? I thought you weren't coming.

281
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,800
My body felt a little stiff after we hung up,

282
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,260
so I thought I should loosen myself up.

283
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,800
- I'll see you next time.
- Okay.

284
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,260
Thank you.

285
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,490
Hey. He's really good at teaching exercise.

286
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,890
I think he would do really well if he opened a gym.

287
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,100
Sunbae!

288
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,000
You guys come to the gym, too?

289
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,490
Yes. You, too?

290
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,470
Yes. I come out every morning if I can.

291
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,580
That's great. Let's work out together.

292
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,500
I would love to.

293
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,800
Excuse me.

294
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,100
Hey. Aren't you overexerting yourself?

295
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,850
What are you talking about?

296
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,230
I always do this much.

297
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,510
Wow. What's that?

298
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,220
You have abs, too?

299
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,930
Hey, this is just in the morning.

300
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,660
Later in the day, they speak up for themselves, and it's worth a good look.

301
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,490
If you say so.

302
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,780
Min Ho Dongsaeng, are you okay?

303
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,580
- Yes.
- That's why you shouldn't overdo it suddenly.

304
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,300
But, Dongsaengdeul, what are you going to do about the scenery assignment?

305
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,840
Oh, right. We need to do that, too.

306
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,700
I'm going down to Tongyeong soon.

307
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,900
Do you guys want to come with me?

308
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,870
Did I tell you my family runs a guest villa?

309
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,750
Oh, really?

310
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,350
I'll offer free bed and breakfast.

311
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,440
We can go and take pictures, hang out, and relieve stress.

312
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,610
I think it might be hard for me because I have an assignment.

313
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,130
I need to create a new app, so I'll pass, too.

314
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,660
Fine. Don't go. Don't go.

315
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,700
You think I don't have any other friends besides you guys?

316
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,250
I have other friends who'll go with me!

317
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,340
We met Mok Jin Oppa in front of the dorms earlier.

318
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,270
He asked if we wanted to go to Tongyeong with him.

319
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:57,460
He said he had other friends. That was you guys?

320
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,670
Yeong Unni and Joo Ah said they wanted to vacation and do the assignment, too.

321
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,540
You probably can't because of your assignment, right?

322
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,670
I guess we can go together next time.

323
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,210
You want to go, too?

324
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,000
What?

325
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,100
No, I didn't mean it like that.

326
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,510
I was just wondering what you were going to do about the assignment.

327
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,640
Let's go.

328
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,340
I don't have assignments for a while.

329
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,620
- Really?
- Yeah.

330
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,450
We should go.

331
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,400
I honestly thought that we couldn't go anywhere for your birthday

332
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,390
since you're so busy with the switch in majors.

333
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,280
I'm so glad.

334
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,990
It's my first time going to Tongyeong.

335
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,820
Hyung, I'll go to Tongyeong with you.

336
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,160
We're just saying it's for an assignment, but it's going to be a total retreat!

337
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,080
You're really not going?

338
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,760
I don't have time. I need to make a new app.

339
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,130
Oh, right.

340
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,850
Don't worry. I'll have double the fun on your behalf.

341
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,310
Don't be tacky and take a suitcase to Tongyeong.

342
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,610
Like that time during the orientation.

343
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,930
That was because I was a freshman, and I didn't know.

344
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,450
I'm not like that anymore.

345
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,400
Do you happen to know what Mok Jin Oppa likes?

346
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,860
Hyung? Why all of a sudden?

347
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,230
Nothing. I just have a favor to ask of him.

348
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,300
But, why did you suddenly ask me to eat lunch with you?

349
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,780
Oh, well...

350
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,460
I just wanted to get closer to you.

351
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,070
I don't know that many people at school

352
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,670
because I came back from the exchange program.

353
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,740
I also did think that we would get along

354
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,770
when I met you in the game room for the first time.

355
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,500
- Really?
- Yeah.

356
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,110
Oppa, you seem to be really close with Ha Neul.

357
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,200
You're roommates, and you even went to an escape room together.

358
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,290
Yes.

359
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,700
Ha Neul seems apathetic at first,

360
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,390
but he's a good guy the more you get to know him.

361
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,310
That's because you're a good guy, and you see him that way.

362
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,980
Someone once said,

363
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,850
that it's instinctual to see the bad traits in someone,

364
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,700
but seeing the good traits in someone is a talent.

365
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,870
Gosh, you didn't have to say that.

366
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,390
Ha Neul has a lot of good traits.

367
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,110
He's good to his mom and responsible,

368
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,600
and he doesn't get mad easily.

369
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,300
He relieves his stress by gaming.

370
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,380
Oh, he must really like gaming.

371
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,890
There's a game that'll be released soon called "Last Youth."

372
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,520
He's totally excited waiting for that to release.

373
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,950
Oh, really?

374
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,240
And it's Ha Neul's birthday soon.

375
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,610
October 1st,

376
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,840
so I'm planning a party.

377
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,860
Oppa, you're so attentive!

378
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,430
You even take care of your roommate's birthday.

379
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,400
Gosh, this is nothing.

380
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,440
I would take great care of my girlfriend's birthday if I had one...

381
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,550
Excuse me?

382
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,390
Oh, it's nothing. Nothing.

383
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,520
What are you planning to do about the scenery assignment?

384
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,990
My family runs a guest villa in Tongyeong.

385
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,750
So I'm planning to gather some people, including Ha Neul and Ji Min

386
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,090
to take a visit to the guest villa for the assignment.

387
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,290
Do you want to come with us?

388
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,870
Yes. I would love to! I want to go, too.

389
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,260
Really? That's great.

390
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,650
The more, the merrier.

391
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,770
And it's good if we do the assignment together.

392
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,810
Ro Sa.

393
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,540
Are you still angry with me?

394
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,990
It's just hard to face you right now.

395
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,110
I know. Of course.

396
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,400
I'm really sorry.

397
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,130
I know it's an excuse,

398
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,540
but it's my first time seeing Ha Neul grow close to someone so quickly.

399
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,040
I guess it felt so unfamiliar to me.

400
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,690
I still shouldn't have accused you like that.

401
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:21,070
I'm so ashamed of myself, and I feel bad toward you.

402
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,610
I'm really sorry.

403
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,050
It's okay.

404
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:36,050
Actually, I went home and thought about it, too.

405
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:40,080
I think I would've been worried if I were you, too.

406
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,710
Thanks for asking me right away, though.

407
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,420
Or else, I would still be under your suspicion.

408
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:51,150
I don't want us to keep being awkward with each other either.

409
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,570
Really?

410
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,980
You won't misunderstand me again, will you?

411
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,170
Of course not.

412
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,180
Thanks.

413
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,450
I met Mok Jin Oppa earlier, and he asked me to go to Tongyeong together.

414
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,050
Can I go, too?

415
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,800
Yes! Of course, you can.

416
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,980
Oh, that's great.

417
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:26,230
Then can the app that we're developing also be utilized in aircraft?

418
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,780
Joo Ah!

419
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,710
Why did you call me?

420
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,650
Oppa, please drink this.

421
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,490
Thank you.

422
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,070
Do you know that sunbae in the sweater?

423
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,210
We take the same class.

424
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,930
Yes, I do. I've seen him around.

425
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,140
Can he come with us to your guest villa?

426
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,850
I don't know him that well, though.

427
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,420
And I don't think we'll have enough space in the car.

428
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,410
A cleaning product organizing kit?

429
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,920
I had this added to my cart.

430
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,610
If that sunbae comes with us, I'll give you that.

431
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,080
Okay. You can bring him.

432
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,370
We just need to rent a bigger car.

433
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,930
Wow, how handy.

434
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,030
The study group ended earlier than I expected.

435
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,460
What are you doing now?

436
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,110
I'm going to meet Ji Min and the others at Re-Feel later.

437
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,920
You must be really close with your roommates.

438
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,250
Yeah.

439
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,160
I heard you ate lunch with Mok Jin Hyung earlier.

440
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,470
Yes.

441
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,010
I had something to ask him.

442
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,970
Hey, Hoobaes!

443
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,930
Hoobae, is our assignment coming along?

444
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,630
Yes. You know.

445
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,790
You two look really close now.

446
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,470
I always see you two together.

447
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,140
Is that SeoRab post true?

448
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,780
That something is going on between you two?

449
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,900
- Flirting?
- No.

450
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,060
If not, fine.

451
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,000
I'll be off now.

452
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,120
If you want any food or snacks while working on the assignment,

453
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,710
just let me know what kind of food you crave.

454
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,310
I'm done with my shift!

455
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,440
Good work, Joo Ah.

456
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,080
- Good work.
- Good job.

457
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,050
Let's eat.

458
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,920
Joo Ah, thanks.

459
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,360
I was able to stay comfortably until this late.

460
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,130
No worries.

461
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,740
You can come to our café for your study group whenever you want.

462
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,580
I'm close with the boss.

463
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,070
Okay.

464
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,050
Everyone's from our class.

465
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,900
Hello.

466
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,690
Oh, these are my roommates and Cha Min Ho's roommates.

467
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:10,400
Sunbae, you should join us for a drink if you have time.

468
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,810
Please do.

469
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,820
Yes, join us.

470
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,920
Yeah. Have a beer. Let's go back to the dorm together.

471
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,130
Then, shall I?

472
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,840
Sit here.

473
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,350
Thanks.

474
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,050
Then everyone here is going to Tongyeong, right?

475
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,630
- Except Min Ho?
- Yes!

476
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,050
Retreats are fun with more people.

477
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,720
Is there anyone else who wants to go?

478
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,900
Are you guys going on a retreat?

479
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:00,000
Oh, we're going to Tongyeong for our Photography and Appreciation assignment.

480
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,560
Sunbae, would you like to join us if you're free?

481
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,440
What?

482
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,280
That's right. You're in the class, too.

483
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,530
I'm fine with you joining us.

484
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,020
Can I?

485
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,500
We rented a big car, so we have extra space, too.

486
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,200
- Let's go together.
- Yes, let's go together.

487
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,960
Yeah?

488
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,250
Then I'll drive.

489
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,600
If it's all right with you guys, then let me join.

490
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,960
I'm a good driver.

491
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,080
That's great.

492
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,370
Sunbae, would you like more beer?

493
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,580
No, it's fine.

494
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,030
Huh? What is this?

495
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,080
There is a new post from Maple Latte.

496
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,240
Why didn't I see this earlier?

497
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:52,220
"I drew this picture because I saw a blooming flower as I walked down the street

498
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,610
and it reminded me of my first love."

499
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,640
But what is this?

500
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,250
Isn't this an insult?

501
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,430
Is it a man or a woman?

502
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,490
Is it even a human?

503
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,150
The floral background is pretty, though.

504
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,370
I think they did a good job.

505
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,350
This?

506
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,540
Yes.

507
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,740
It's like modern art.

508
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,710
I also think it's nice.

509
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,560
It's like Picasso's style.

510
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,700
Perhaps, did one of you draw this?

511
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,050
Really. Is that it?

512
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,600
It's one of you, isn't it?

513
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,810
You're both suspicious.

514
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,500
And they had one more glass.

515
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,980
Wow! Thank you.

516
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,350
- Thank you!
- Amazing.

517
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,950
It seemed like you liked this one.

518
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,520
Thank you, Sunbae.

519
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,260
Something's going on between them, right?

520
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,780
The air between Joon Hyung and Joo Ah is sweet.

521
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,040
Something's going on between them.

522
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,680
They do look good together.

523
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,530
What's going on, Min Ho?

524
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,480
Is something wrong?

525
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,540
Or are you mad at me?

526
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,510
No.

527
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,480
My keyboard is usually loud.

528
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,440
Oh, yeah?

529
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:35,010
I think I see the back of your heads more often than your faces.

530
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,240
I'm lonely.

531
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,210
Gosh, I want to have a sweet romance, too.

532
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,660
Sweet...

533
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,330
Sweet romance.

534
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,970
I don't know if I ever can.

535
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,380
You're staying up all night to finish your assignment to go on the trip with Ji Min Noona.

536
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,110
Hang in there.

537
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,710
Ji Min Noona should know how considerate you are for her.

538
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,540
Don't worry about me and worry about yourself.

539
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,480
What?

540
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,210
Are you really going to be okay?

541
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,570
Sending Joo Ah and Joon Hyung on the retreat?

542
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,540
What about it?

543
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,870
Judging by today, it seems like you should step it up.

544
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,890
I don't know what you're talking about.

545
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,350
Why are you acting ignorant?

546
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,580
You're aware of it.

547
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,840
That you like Joo Ah.

548
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,560
Joo Ah Dongsaeng, are you moving?

549
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,040
She took out a few things this morning, and it's still like that.

550
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,760
I thought I would need everything.

551
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,550
Okay.

552
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,380
Min Ho. Over here.

553
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,090
Min Ho's coming, too?

554
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,180
What?

555
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,370
- You said you're not coming.
- I know, but...

556
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,060
I changed my mind.

557
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,500
Shall we go?

558
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,710
Yes!

559
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,410
- Off we go!
- Let's go.

560
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,770
Not there.

561
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,070
Sit next to me.

562
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,090
Why are you doing this?

563
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,480
I'm going to sit in the front.

564
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,680
You're going to fall asleep for sure.

565
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,600
What will Joon Hyung think when he sees you sleeping with your eyes and mouth hanging open?

566
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,370
What are you saying? You think I would fall asleep next to Joon Sunbae?

567
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,990
Joo Ah fell asleep.

568
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,580
She always falls asleep when we travel for over two hours.

569
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,720
Min Ho.

570
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,250
Are you really closing down BABting?

571
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,440
Yes.

572
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,790
You probably worked really hard on it.

573
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,820
What a shame.

574
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,280
There are a couple of other apps that I thought of,

575
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,790
so I'm working on a new one.

576
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,220
Yeah?

577
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,700
As expected of a talented one.

578
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,510
Ro Sa, what's your MBTI?

579
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,560
INFJ.

580
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,410
You were an INFJ?

581
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,350
I'm an ENFP!

582
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:37,130
Did you know that INFJ and ENFP are a match made in heaven?

583
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,960
Huh? I'm also an INFJ.

584
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,250
Then are we also a match made in heaven?

585
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,580
What?

586
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,890
There's no way that's possible.

587
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,160
That should never be.

588
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,390
It's going to be so much fun!

589
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,930
It's the ocean!

590
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,740
The weather's so nice.

591
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,200
What a bunch of tacky city people.

592
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,470
Where are you going?

593
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,690
We need to work on the assignment!

594
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,860
I took a lot.

595
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,870
What do I do? I just slept the whole ride.

596
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,900
I should have helped navigate and such.

597
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,570
You don't think Sunbae is disappointed in me, do you?

598
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,960
You should've listened to me when I told you to sit in the back.

599
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,100
Did I sleep with my eyes open again? How was I?

600
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:22,330
You were a mess, but Sunbae didn't witness any of it.

601
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,500
What a relief.

602
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,010
Joo Ah. Can I borrow your lip balm?

603
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,550
- Sure! Of course.
- Hold on.

604
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,840
My lips keep getting chapped.

605
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,340
Thanks.

606
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,290
Was the car dry?

607
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,200
They keep getting chapped.

608
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,900
This is the famous Dongpirang Mural Village.

609
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,190
There are a lot of places that are photo-worthy, so take a good look.

610
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,480
This all changes periodically.

611
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,820
So it's a little different every time you come.

612
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,740
And it also depends on who you walk with.

613
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,950
I think I've seen it in movies, too.

614
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,620
That's right! In "Ha Ha Ha!"

615
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,240
It came out in that movie.

616
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,940
And you can see sugarcanes here.

617
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,780
The view here is really nice,

618
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,840
but if you go all the way up, there are even better views.

619
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,370
In Tongyeong, there's what's called Dongpirang and Seopirang...

620
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,260
I'm going to take a good one.

621
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,710
Were you taking photos of me?

622
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,780
Look at this.

623
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,430
- You're so good.
- They look so good together.

624
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:52,750
I could also take great pictures of my girlfriend.

625
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,650
Let's go together.

626
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:01,770
♫ Our relationship is getting sweeter ♫

627
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,770
♫ Oh, babe ♫

628
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:09,510

629
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,200
♫ It remains around my lips ♫

630
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:18,650
♫ I hope you feel the same way as I do ♫

631
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,210
What are you doing?

632
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,590
Move it!

633
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,510
Gosh, seriously.

634
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,390
It doesn't suit you.

635
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,930
I just tried it on.

636
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,030
Get lost!

637
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,500
Come quickly!

638
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,980
Quickly, quickly.

639
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,410
Noona. Hyung.

640
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,170
What are we doing?

641
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:17,090
- Did everyone take their photos?
- Yes, it's so nice here.

642
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,370
Now, it's time for the highlight.

643
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,150
Are you all prepared to be cursed out?

644
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,940
Let's go! Let's go get cursed out.

645
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,970
Let's go.

646
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,260
I can still go.

647
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:37,500

I don't like you.

How much?

839
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,700
A lot.

840
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,770
What exactly?

841
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,640
Oppa, you need to respond with detail.

842
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,500
That's right.

843
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,360
Well...

844
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:20,950
When she smiles like a baby, she's cute.

845
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,670
And...

846
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:26,520
her laugh is so cheery,

847
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,650
so I end up laughing right next to her, too.

848
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,720
What is this?

849
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,420

00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:12,670
We drank quite a lot.

860
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,310
Do you want to go out for some air?

861
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:17,150
Sure. Let's go.

862
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,300
The air is so refreshing.

863
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,470
It's so nice.

864
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,420
Look at how clear the water is.

865
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,150
It's so clear.

866
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,330
I know, huh?

867
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,140
How are you so good at drinking?

868
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,770
You look totally fine.

869
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:41,340
I even outlasted all the sunbaes at the orientation.

870
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,460
How amazing.

Ro Sa.

872
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:57,360
Thank you for accepting my apology.

873
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:03,040
I'm not sure if it's because I repeated a year,

874
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,080
but it wasn't easy to make any friends in college.

875
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:11,270
Other people didn't seem to mind me,

876
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:16,670
but I just avoided them because I didn't want to make them uncomfortable.

877
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:23,140
And then I joined the Cheer Squad and even on SeoRab...

878
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:26,340
a lot of gossip formed about me.

879
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,640
It got even harder to make friends.

880
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:34,510
That's because you're really popular.

881
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,430
It's not.

882
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:43,880
But after you returned and we went everywhere together,

883
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,920
I feel like we're back in high school.

884
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,210
Me, too.

885
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:51,250
I was so glad that you were there when I returned.

886
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:56,750
That's why the day felt so long while we weren't talking to each other.

887
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:00,060
Okay, okay. Story of your life.

888
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,330
I understand you.

889
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:04,160
Hey.

890
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,260
Let's stop here. It's embarrassing.

891
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,890
It's chilly at night, right?

892
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:14,530
Yeah.

893
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:17,400
The room is pretty close, so I'll go and get some outerwear.

894
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,930
Stay here for a second.

895
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:20,710
Okay.

896
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,000
Wait.

897
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,780
Could you please get me a hair tie, too?

898
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,760
My hair keeps getting in the way.

899
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,630
Sure.

900
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:31,400
Then use this for now.

901
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,410
- Just clip it up?
- Yeah.

902
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:36,920
Should I do it for you?

903
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,430
- Can you?
- Okay.

904
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,810
This is the hairstyle that you do every day.

905
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:42,730
That's right.

906
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,960
Where were you?

907
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,820
I just went for a walk.

908
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,640
Are you okay?

909
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:59,360
Yeah, well...

910
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,790
Hyung, you drank quite a lot.

911
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:06,320
Right. I'm going to stop now.

912
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,720
I'll die if I drink any more.

913
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:17,440
Hyung, where's Ji Min?

914
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,400
She went out for some air with Ro Sa.

915
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,120
I see.

916
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,160

What in the world?

920
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:52,980
Hyung, hide your face.

921
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,230
This dumpling has been steamed well!

922
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:59,480
How delicate. Delicate dumpling skin!

923
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,730
Get up. Get up.

924
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:04,370
Let's go.

925
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:07,940
Why does this tteokbokki look rotten?

926
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,170
It's rotten.

927
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:12,870
- What's wrong with her?
- She worked for too long at her mom's restaurant.

928
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:14,810
- Tteokbokki?
- Yeah, yeah. It's over.

929
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:17,020
- I'm not done...
- Yes, you are. You're done.

930
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,880
- Sit.
- Hey!

931
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,800
That's not water! It's soju.

932
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,190
You couldn't taste the alcohol?

933
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:23,440
He must be really drunk.

934
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,020
- He can't even taste the alcohol.
- Seriously.

935
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,580
Wait...

936
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,470
You didn't even drink. Why are you cleaning up everything?

937
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:07,500

in the middle of a one-sided love these days.

But...

955
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:33,310
are one-sided loves usually like this?

you're getting a package delivery.

But that package

963
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:58,140
is so precious and beautiful,

964
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,160
so I can't open it.

965
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:07,990
I'm afraid that...

966
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,000
the answer I want won't be in the box,

967
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,760
so I'll be disappointed.

What if it's not mine?

969
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:26,900
That's why I just keep it stacked next to me

970
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,570
and I just watch over it.

971

01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:39,000
♫ The reason why my heart longs for you is all out of my greed ♫

992
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,730
♫ I end up with your photo clutched in my hand ♫

993
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:53,900
♫ The reason my heart tries to push you away is that it doesn't want to regret it ♫

994
01:04:53,900 --> 01:05:01,960
♫ All the useless thoughts just grow in my mind ♫

995
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,590
♫ There's not one day or even one hour ♫

996
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:08,990
[Dear.M]

997
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:14,770
♫ Even the moments when we cried and laughed together ♫

998
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:21,560
♫ I can't hang onto you, call on you, or see you ♫

999
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,120

Joon Oppa is going on a group blind date with another department today.

1000
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,830
Was he playing with me?

1001
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:28,470
You should go to Hyung. You know you want to.

1002
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:30,230
Can I?

1003
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:33,540
- I honestly didn't have the time to—
- Are you sure it wasn't because your heart desired it?

1004
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:36,700
You're honestly afraid, aren't you? That I might steal Ha Neul from you?

1005
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:40,900
Whatever you do, Ha Neul won't fall for you.

1006
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,320
Aren't you curious, too?

1007
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:46,350
If Ha Neul likes you as much as you think he does.

1008
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:48,870
I don't think we're going to work out.

1009
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:51,650
♫ Turn around and take a look at me ♫
