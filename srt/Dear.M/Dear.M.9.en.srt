1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,410
How pretty, Ma Joo Ah.

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,960
You're not drunk, right?

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,250
Huh?

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,820
I'm not drunk, but─

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,990
Then no take-backs.

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,620
♫ Something's wrong, clearly ♫

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,840
♫ I can't even explain it ♫

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,600
♫ Everything had changed the moment I first saw you ♫

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,700
♫ When you called my name ♫

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,970
What's wrong? What happened?

11
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,330
Joo Ah, is something wrong?

12
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,220
Nope.

13
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,190
Nothing is wrong.

14
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,490
How did I get home last night?

15
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,400
You don't remember, Dongsaeng?

16
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,480
You were passed out on the bench,

17
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,400
so I had to drag you all the way back here.

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,490
On the bench?

19
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,440
By myself?

20
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,260
You really don't remember anything?

21
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,710
You were with Ro Sa.

22
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,220
You abandoned me and left first.

23
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,750
Is it a bad hangover?

24
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,070
Do you think you can go to class?

25
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,170
Yes, I have to go.

26
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,000
Min Ho, what about you? You're not going to class?

27
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,630
I am.

28
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,400
Let's go.

29
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,500
[Min Ho] Are you up?

30
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,510
About our...

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,300
kiss... ki...

32
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,190
That thing, you know.

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,700
I was totally out of it last night.

34
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,300
I wasn't in my right mind after meeting Moon Joon's girlfriend.

35
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,200
So,

36
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,600
let's forget about what happened last night.

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,300
We were both drunk

38
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,060
and it was a mistake.

39
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,180
It wasn't a mistake.

40
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,490
What?

41
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,270
It wasn't a mistake for me.

42
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,250
What did you say?

43
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,760
We didn't even drink two bottles last night.

44
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,190
Neither of us was drunk. We were both fine.

45
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,800
Well, yeah, we weren't drunk,

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,640
but it was a festival and in many ways...

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,000
well, you know...

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,500
- we were probably drunk on the atmosphere—
- No.

49
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,300
I wasn't drunk on the atmosphere,

50
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,700
nor was it because of the alcohol.

51
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,360
I like you.

52
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,270
So last night was out of sincerity.

53
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,600
Hey.

54
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,080
This shouldn't...

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,350
be like this...

56
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:26,960
♫ All the words in me are not enough ♫

57
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,900
♫ All those days that clumsily passed by without knowing ♫

58
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,090
Cha Min Ho, get it together.

59
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,400
We were just possessed by something

60
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,100
and swept away. That's why we kissed.

61
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,770
You're momentarily confused.

62
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,540
You don't like me.

63
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,040
No, I know my own feelings.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,800
I like you. That's why I kissed you.

65
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,270
- Does that make sense?
- It doesn't!

66
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,200
I don't know why I'm like this.

67
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,330
Why I suddenly feel different about you after 12 years.

68
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,430
It's unnerving...

69
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,040
and strange that you like someone,

70
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,070
and I don't like it.

71
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,870
I'm going crazy because I don't understand why I'm like this.

72
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,840
But these nonsensical feelings that I have for you...

73
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,210
now that I've admitted I like you,

74
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,630
it all makes sense.

75
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:44,250
♫ I grow accustomed to without even realizing ♫

76
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,410
No, no.

77
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,800
Think it over carefully.

78
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,900
Let's talk once you come back to your senses.

79
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,920
If you continue to be like this,

80
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,230
I can't hang out with you anymore.

81
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,190
♫ You were always there when we were happy in that brilliant season ♫

82
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,700
♫ My long held dream was always you ♫

83
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,290
♫ My heart ♫

84
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,690
Are you done with the choreo for this song?

85
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,000
We finished the first verse, but we're not finished with the second verse.

86
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,040
I watched from the side for a bit,

87
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,210
and I think you should change the choreo for the chorus.

88
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,500
It's a little boring.

89
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,900
This choreography... was created by Ji Min Unni.

90
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,180
Then we'll ask Ji Min Unni once she arrives.

91
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,810
Bo Bae.

92
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,360
I'm telling you out of concern for your team.

93
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,060
Yes. I know, Sunbae.

94
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,770
We'll discuss it with Ji Min and adjust it together.

95
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,790
What's going on?

96
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,920
Well...

97
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:24,070
Assistant Leader expressed that we should change the choreography for the chorus.

98
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,590
What do you mean?

99
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,700
It's a little weak to be showcased at the Cheering Festival.

100
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,010
Changing it now will be difficult.

101
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,260
We need to create the second-verse choreo and don't have much time to practice.

102
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,420
The Cheering Festival is more important.

103
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,110
You can just make more time to practice.

104
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,390
It looks fine to me.

105
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,350
If anything, I'll ask Leader.

106
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,660
What do you think, Leader?

107
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,950
It looks good to me.

108
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,150
Aren't the moves for the chorus too predictable?

109
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,600
Are they?

110
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,100
Then, Ro Sa, what did you have in mind?

111
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Oh, I think the intro to the chorus

112
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,460
should include the basic leg move number two and a full turn

113
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,500
rather than the basic leg move number one and a half turn.

114
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,940
Well,

115
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,010
I think that might be too fancy for this song.

116
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,800
I think what they have right now is better.

117
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,680
Ji Min, you made this, right?

118
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,120
Good job.

119
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,670
We should do this song last.

120
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,600
- It's daebak.
- Really.

121
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,260
Hey, did you see her expression earlier?

122
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,910
Yes. Totally.

123
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,200
I was embarrassed for her.

124
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,100
Things are so tense between them these days.

125
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,800
I can't even practice because I'm walking on eggshells.

126
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,400
Exactly.

127
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,190
Then is it true?

128
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,740
That Ji Min Unni's boyfriend and Ro Sa Sunbae are dating?

129
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,800
How could he cheat on someone like Ji Min Unni?

130
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,430
That's what I'm saying.

131
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,500
I just don't get it.

132
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,270
There's a poll on SeoRab for the new Cheer Squad Leader.

133
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,740
Our poor Ji Min Unni.

134
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,640
I'm going to diligently support her as the new Leader.

135
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,910
Right.

136
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,980
She got her boyfriend stolen.

137
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,840
We can't let her leadership be stolen, too.

138
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,250
Ji Min...

139
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,910
Ha Neul!

140
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,050
Good thing I ran into you.

141
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,170
Do you want to take a part-time college interview job over the weekend?

142
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,120
- Part-time interviewing job?
- Yes.

143
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,080
They want us to fill 10 PR ambassador positions,

144
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,870
but I need more people.

145
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,300
You've put us on the back burner while you were switching majors.

146
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,500
Make it up to us and do a good job as a PR ambassador.

147
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,330
I'll take that as a yes.

148
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,250
I'll send you the specific details.

149
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,500
Okay.

150
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,180
Ji Min seems to have a good chance of winning the Leader position of the Cheer Squad.

151
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,120
Pardon?

152
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,780
I saw it on SeoRab.

153
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,900
You two didn't really break up, did you?

154
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,040
Let's grab a drink with everyone next time.

155
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,230
I'll send you a text later.

156
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,690

What? Ji Min, you're still here?

Yes. I'm working on the choreo for the second verse of the song.

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,700
It's hard to gather your group members because they're all engineering students, right?

165
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,600
Wait, you divided the groups like this intentionally?

Aren't misunderstandings default in life?

Trying to understand someone takes effort, but misunderstanding someone is easy.

Forget it.

496
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,890
You're good at studying when you set your mind to it

497
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,300
and work hard at your part-time jobs,

498
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,240
and you achieve anything you want since you put in so much effort.

I really want to come here to Seoyeon University.

I know. The school is so pretty.

00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,270
Wow.

532
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,820
- L-Look over there.
- Where?

Min Ho, did you see?

541
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,990
There was also a time when I looked at my college sunbaes with envy.

542
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,610
They were high school students?

543
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,970
Yes. The early admission interviews are this weekend.

Oh, right. Ha Neul Hyung is working part-time there.

Yeah, that's right.

- This is what college is all about.

why are so many guys crowded there?

Hey, it says to pull.

561
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,080
- Why did you push the door?
- What?

562
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,690
Did I do something wrong?

563
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,510
We made a bet.

564
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,680
If you pulled open the door, I would buy midnight snacks.

565
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,860
If you pushed it open, it's on Unni.

566

Looks like she'll be buying tonight, thanks to you.

You can wait in here until it's your turn.

575
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,930
Then go to the interview room and read the common questions.

576
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,060
Are the common questions difficult?

577

Well...

578
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,620
Wouldn't that differ for each person?

579
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,010
I see.

580
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,270
You don't need to worry too much.

581
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,920
If you start introducing yourself confidently,

582
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,680
you've already passed half the interview.

583
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,780
And you'll have more than five minutes to read over the common questions,

584
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,290
so just think carefully before going in.

585

00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,700

Seo Ji Hoon...

596
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,650
Look.

597
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,510
He looks nothing like me, right?

598
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,160
Why? He looks like you.

599
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,800
Really?

600
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,200
No.

601
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,500
But he does look cute.

602
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,200
- He does?
- Yes, he's cute.

603
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,250
But he must be busy if he's in 12th grade.

604
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:41,570
Yeah, it seems like he's busier doing something other than studying.

605
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,090
I'll introduce you to him next time.

606
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,870

608
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,300
You can sit here.

609
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,430
The charisma displayed by the interviewers is all just for show,

610
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,730
so no need to be anxious.

611
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,510
If you get too nervous, don't look them in the eye

612
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:04,220
but look between their eyes.

613
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,660
Greet them confidently.

614
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,540
Always answer directly first and foremost.

615
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,940
Seoyeon University's ideal image of a qualified person is a global leader.

00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,610
Understand?

617
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:13,920
Yes.

619
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,590
Fighting.

620
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,110
Then I'll get the premium package.

621
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:30,010
What about you, Unni?

622
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,610
The premium package is the most popular.

623
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:37,390
The price, excluding hair and makeup, is 200,000 won ($200).

624
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,340
- 200,000 won?
- Yes.

625
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,020
It includes touch-ups,

626
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,790
so it's not that expensive.

627
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,380
You're right.

628
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,890
And she's going to get a package that includes hair and makeup.

629
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,920
I'm not going to do it.

630
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,460
Unni, you don't like their concept?

631
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,810
Should we go somewhere else?

632
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,180
No, you can take yours first.

633
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,220
I'll get mine done separately.

634
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:12,920
Unni, are you mad at me?

635
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,240
Is it because of the price?

636
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,250
It's the same everywhere else.

637
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,500
People invest this much while preparing for their announcer application.

638
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,310
I'm not overdoing it.

639
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,750
I know.

640
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,230
I'm not mad at you.

641
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:37,180
I'm mad at myself for starting this without knowing all the details.

642
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,990
I'll leave first.

643
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,530
Sorry.

644
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,650
Why?

645
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,000
Did you see someone you know?

646
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,230
The person who helped me with my interview.

647
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,900
Really? Who?

648
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,410
He left.

649
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,800
- He must've taken really good care of you.
- He did.

650
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,140
I hope your future boyfriend is someone like him.

651
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,870
Why? What's he like?

652
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:20,620
He just gives off a good vibe.

653
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,090
There's a special connection between men.

654

What's the use of connecting with you? He should connect with me.

655
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,930
Oh, Joo Ah, you're back already?

656
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,490
Did you take the profile photo okay?

657
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,500
No.

658
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,170
Why not?

659
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,740
I thought everything would be fine once I had a dream,

660
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,960
but it turns out that dreams aren't just for anyone.

661
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,530
The academy costs a couple of million won

662
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,890
and there's hair and makeup and profile photo.

663
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:07,960
I would have had to spend my one month's pay.

664
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,290
And it's not like my acceptance is guaranteed the first time.

665
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,020
If I apply multiple times, I'll have to spend that much more money.

666
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,910
I thought I saved up okay, earning my own allowance

667
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:19,140
and living an okay life,

668
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,990
but this dream that suddenly knocked on my door

669
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,110
keeps reminding me

670
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,900
of my own poverty.

671
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,490
I can't anymore.

672
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,090
I want to stop now while I still have my pride intact.

673
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:48,730
I also started working right after high school because I was poor.

674
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,380
I had pretty good grades and

675
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,900
good enough scores to get into the college of my choice.

676
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:58,600
But I just gave up on college because of my family's financial situation.

677
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,410
But...

678
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,810
the kids who intended to start working right away got by without a problem

679
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:06,980
but not me.

680
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,220
Because I had to give up college, even though I wanted to go,

681
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,560
I couldn't get over it.

682
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,330
I wanted it even more since I hadn't had the college experience.

683
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:20,050
And I couldn't appreciate the money I earned.

684
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,450
So that's how I ended up here.

685
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,260
You said you want to do it.

686
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,790
Then don't think about giving up first.

687
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,890
Think about a solution and how to go about it.

688
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,640
She's right, Joo Ah.

689
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,040
We'll help you.

690
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:42,120
Let's take your profile photo right now.

691
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,330
Right now?

692
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,100
Yes.

693
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,200
We may not have money, but we've got each other!

694
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,160
My makeup skills are the only thing that improved while in Cheer Squad.

695

♫ I don't feel like the main character in the world that I was born in ♫

Thank you so much!

703
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,500
Now, let's call the photographer.

704
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,660
Unni, can we really use this room?

705
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,870
Sure, we use it sometimes for our Cheer Squad shoots.

706
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,890
I asked and got permission.

707
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,230
But who's the photographer?

708
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:11,270
Are you looking for me?

709
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,220
Oppa!

710
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:16,540
I'm Photographer Gil, your photographer for the day.

711
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,460
He took my photo for our class

712
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,700
and he was pretty good.

713
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,080
You acted like you didn't really like them,

714
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,910
but I guess you did.

715
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,400
Then should we get started?

716
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,820
Yes!

717
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,420
- You two should come out now.
- Okay.

718
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,880
Ready?

719
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,290
Joo Ah, the photo came out so nice.

720
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,910
- Really?
- Yeah.

721
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,570
Unnis, Oppa, I need to go to the library and write my self-introduction before heading back.

722
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,110
Thank you so much for today.

723
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,590
Okay, Joo Ah. Work hard.

724
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:15,630
- I'll go now.
- Be safe.

725
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,560
- Be safe.
- Okay.

726
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,720
Unni.

727
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,730
You look a little pale since earlier.

728
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,550
My blood sugar is still low.

729
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,080
Why?

730
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,370
It happens from time to time. Don't worry.

731
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,160
Are you really okay?

732
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,400
Yeah.

733
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,710
We worked hard. Should we go eat before heading in?

734
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,670
Yes, sounds good.

735
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,880
Ha Neul!

736
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:49,880
Are you going back to the dorm?

737
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,180
Yes.

738
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:59,790
We're going to eat. Do you want to come with us?

739
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:06,150
Sure.

740
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,810
Okay, let's go. What should we eat?

741
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:11,100
Unni!

742
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,180
Unni, are you okay?

743
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,180
What do we do? I think she's in hypoglycemic shock.

744
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,820
- Shock?
- Yes.

745
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,550
She said to feed her candy or juice if she ever went into shock.

746
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,660
I do. I have candy.

747
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,010
No, no. We can't feed her anything while she's unconscious.

748
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:23,640
Call 911 first.

749
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,860
Okay.

750
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,040
Choking is more dangerous than going into shock.

751
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,910
She might vomit,

752
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:32,450
so turn her on her side.

753
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,080
There's a patient who collapsed from hypoglycemic shock.

754
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,800
Please send an ambulance quickly.

755
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,360
We're in front of the Seoyeon University Engineering Building.

756
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,710
She's out of danger.

757
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,990
So you don't need to worry too much.

758
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:49,040
Thank you.

759
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,820
Thank you.

00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,710
Thank God.

761
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,010

763
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,430
and Ha Neul, please bring my laptop.

764
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:10,990
It's okay, Oppa. I'll stay here.

765
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:13,010
I can't go into the girls' dorm.

766
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,680

Why aren't you picking up?

770
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,370
It's about our assignment anyway.

771
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,150
I'll call her back later.

772
00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:00,560
Are the preparations for Squad Leader Selection going well?

773
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,950
Yeah.

774
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,020
Why did you ask to see me at that time?

775
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,570
Because of the SeoRab post.

776
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,230
I don't worry about it.

777

It's not even true anyway.

Sure.

779

I just worried it might've upset you.

I went to the café earlier, and the cake was so good there, so I bought it for you.

Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

If you came from that direction, you must've come through Kiss Road.

Right, why?

Well, I guess it doesn't matter since you're friends.

805

There's a curse that breaks couples apart if they walk that road together.

00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:27,050
[I still haven't lost hope for the Magnet Couple. | Aren't they just friends?]

820
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,890
You're up?

821
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,830
How do you feel?

822
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:55,200
I'm a little dizzy.

823
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,170
What happened?

824
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,870
You collapsed due to hypoglycemic shock.

825
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:04,310
But your boyfriend acted fast,

826
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:06,840
so you avoided a more dangerous situation.

827
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,590
Your boyfriend knew a lot about your condition and emergency treatment.

828
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:17,770
You can probably be discharged tomorrow if you're feeling okay.

829
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:19,310
Okay.

830
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,980
Boyfriend?

831
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:33,340
Noona. You're up?

832
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:37,740
Are you okay?

833
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,300
Yes.

834
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:43,340
Thank God.

835
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,390
What a relief.

836
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,160
Do you know how scared I was?

837
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,520
Fainting like that...

838
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,110
You're pale, to begin with,

839
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,620
but your face was even whiter than usual.

840
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,940
And during the whole ambulance ride,

841
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,640
my heart was shriveling up.

842
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,310
Ten minutes felt like a year!

843
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,930
Why are you overreacting?

844
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,440
What's that?

845
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,380
These are just some things you might need during your hospital stay.

846
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,830
Slippers,

847
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,620
towels,

848
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,690
wipes,

849
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,000
and a hair tie.

850
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:39,190
But how did you know about the emergency treatment?

851
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:41,630
I don't think I ever told you about that.

852
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:43,740
Oh, that?

853
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,210
I looked it up after you told me about your condition.

854
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:50,630
Things like symptoms of type 1 diabetes and emergency treatment for hypoglycemic shock.

855
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:55,170
Just in case something like that happens while you're with me.

856
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:02,880
I don't think I'll need any of these.

857
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,400
They said I can be discharged tomorrow.

858
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,820
Really?

859
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,060
That's great then!

860
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,820
We can just

861
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,410
use these next time.

862
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,250
What a relief.

863
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:19,550
I should keep these in the dorm.

864
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,570
Is Yeong Noona okay?

865
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,250
I was going to visit her,

866
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:36,900
but she said not to come since she's being discharged tomorrow.

867
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,600
And it's past visiting hours.

868
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,770
That's a relief.

869
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:44,230
Yeah.

870
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:49,060
Weren't you going to study here?

871
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,120
I'll leave.

872
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,960
I just came to get something to drink anyway.

873
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,310
So uncomfortable.

"The 2018 MLB has passed by in a blink."

our final exam will be replaced with an assignment.

910

The topic of the final assignment is

911
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:48,760
to reenact a popular scene from a movie through a photo.

912

When is the Leader Election?

01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:15,400
- The 16th.
- The 16th of this month.

932
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,640
It's because the 16th of this month is the day the person I like faces an important challenge.

933
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,840
From your 87802.

934
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,450
What on earth could that mean?
