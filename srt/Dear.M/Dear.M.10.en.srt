1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,080
How about this?

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,250
"Classic."

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,810
Oh, "Classic"!

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,000
That's good. It's a masterpiece.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,450
Right? Running through the rain holding the shirt over them and—

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,800
- The streetlight scene.
- Yes.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,780
You haven't watched "Classic"?

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,480
This masterpiece?

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,900
That's an old movie.

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,730
But still.

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,210
I guess there are people who haven't watched "Classic."

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,740
Let's do this one.

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,180
"Temptation of Wolves"?

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,940
Oh, you prefer the school setting?

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,230
I like that, too.

16
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,300
I like it, too.

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,900
I got goosebumps when Kang Dong Won appeared.

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,570
And when he jumped from the window.

19
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,660
The umbrella scene is still the winner.

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,670
Right, right.

21
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,960
Where is it?

22
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,240
Here it is!
[Business Statistics]

23
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,080
Joo Ah.

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,340
- Hello, Joo Ah.
- Hello.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,470
Thank goodness.

26
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,850
Joo Ah, we ordered malatang.

27
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,600
We were worried we ordered too much.

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,800
Have some before you go, okay?

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,160
- I have a class—
- Come on.

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,360
You still have 30 minutes left!

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,760
Eat some before you go.

32
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,270
Oh, right. Hyung!

33
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,020
- You're really photogenic.
- Huh?

34
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,590
I watched the interview you did with your father on TV.

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,400
- That was on yesterday?
- What?

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,990
You haven't watched it yet?

37
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,870
Hold on. I'll show you.

38
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,290
He's very interested in app development.

39
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,050
He said the app that he recently created

40
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,820
was popular among the students.

41
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,760
It was some sort of app related to the school cafeteria.

42
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,100
What was it again?

43
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,760
It's embarrassing. Why watch it here?

44
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,170
Come on! Let's see!

45
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,170
I found it.

46
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,080
I have nothing to brag about except my son, so I told him to come.

47
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,950
Your son is very handsome.

48
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,390
He doesn't look like me, right?

49
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,440
You're handsome, too, CEO.

50
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,000
But he does take after me in other aspects.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,440
He's very interested in app development.

52
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,310
And you're participating in an app development competition, right?

53
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,270
I hope you do well at the competition.

54
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,890
Yes. Thank you.

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,370
Hyung, you're so busy, and you're still preparing for the app competition?

56
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,820
You're really incredible.

57
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,700
I really respect you.

58
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,900
And you're photogenic on top of that.

59
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,450
Right, Joo Ah?

60
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,070
What?

61
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,340
Yes, I guess.

62
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,200
I have a report to work on,

63
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,060
so I'll get going first.

64
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,600
Enjoy your meal.

65
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,880
Who's going to be Kang Dong Won?

66
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,270
I'll do it.

67
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,130
Why, you?

68
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,100
I'm tall and younger, too.

69
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,250
Wouldn't it be best if I did it?

70
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,550
I'm also tall.

71
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,900
We'll do the scene where Kang Dong Won appears under the umbrella and smiles.

72
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,080
I often heard that I have a nice smile.

73
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,600
Oh, it's raining in that scene, right?

74
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,200
I look good with wet hair.

75
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,430
Then, Hyung, you can do it.

76
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,500
Hyung. Smile.

77
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,370
You look too awkward.

78
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,130
No, I don't.

79
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,500
Yi Dam, you should just do it.

80
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,590
I need to go to practice.

81
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,420
Taking the picture now.

82
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,470
I know how to photoshop.

83
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,480
We have to add CG (Computer Graphic) for the rain...

84
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,300
I'll do the editing.

85
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,200
Okay, thank you.

86
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,900
Noona, when is the Leader Election?

87
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,880
The 16th.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
- There's not much time left.
- Yes.

89
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,850
[16th]

90
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,640
If it's the 16th,

91
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,260
there's really not much time left.

92
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,500
I know.

93
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,660
I'm so nervous about the camera test.

94
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,130
Exactly!

95
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,410
Whoa...

96
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,120
"There are now less than 10 games left until the fall baseball season."

97
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,100
"Who will take the victor? Let's go to Gwangju Stadium together."

98
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,090
Yang Hui!

99
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,600
- You've really improved.
- Right?

100
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,030
The Criteria of Interviews class is the best.

101
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,330
They refine my pronunciation and vocalization

102
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,100
and monitor and correct my weaknesses right away, so I improve significantly.

103
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,010
Really?

104
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,510
How about you ask your parents, too?

105
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,010
No matter if you're a sports maniac, if you don't have the basic announcing skills,

106
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,160
they said that you'll never pass the camera test.

107
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,320
I'm suggesting this sincerely out of consideration for you.

108
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,100
Joo Ah Dongsaeng!

109
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,700
Oppa, hello.

110
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll touch up your profile picture today and send it to you right away.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,620
Sure. I have until the end of the week anyway,

112
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,000
so you can give it to me tomorrow.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,520
Since I took your photo,

114
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,060
you'll pass the file review for sure.

115
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,300
Okay, Oppa. Thank you.

116
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,190
What is that? That empty smile?

117
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,930
Is something wrong? Why are you so down?

118
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,310
Well...

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,370
It costs a lot of money to prepare for the announcer exam.

120
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,000
It's my first time preparing for the exam,

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,550
so I lack vocalization and pronunciation.

122
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,920
But it's too expensive to attend academies

123
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,250
like everyone else.

124
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Why don't you ask your parents?

125
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,500
Gosh, my mom cut off all allowances as soon as I got into college.

126
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,490
But still, it's not like you're using it to party.

127
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,040
You should ask her.

128
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
If she says no, then at least you know.

129
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,700
If she says yes, you can repay her later on.

130
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,380
Maybe I should do that.

131
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,340
I'm going to go home.

132
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,130
Right now?

133
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,370
The video topic is "The Battle of the Century,

134
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,320
the Candidates for the next Leader."

135
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,720
You're not going to edit me out like last time, are you?

136
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,000
Gosh, it was just an intro video last time, which was why it was short,

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,200
but this time, it'll be a long special focusing on you two.

138
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Sure. I'll do it then.

139
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,940
I'll do it, too.

140
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,410
Okay.

141
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,500
- Ta-da!
- What?

142
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,350
It's not even the weekend. What's with the sudden visit?

143
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,500
Just because. I missed you, Mom.

144
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,800
Did you eat?

145
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,050
Let me have some tteokbokki.

146
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,740
Aigoo, what have you been doing not eating?

147
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,780
Hold on a second.

148
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,250
- Here.
- It looks delicious.

149
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,130
But did you buy that drink?

150
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Yes, from the café nearby. Why?

151
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,730
Do you buy that often?

152
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,380
I work at a café.

153
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,180
I usually drink it for free.

154
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,280
I'm amazed by people these days.

155
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,340
Well, I don't know how they can buy a coffee every day

156
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,300
that costs the price of a meal.

157
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,660
Mom, you don't know.

158
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,310
No one buys coffee because it tastes good.

159
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,770
It's to boost their mood.

160
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,030
As if.

161
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,340
They spend all that money to boost their mood?

162
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,490
I drink instant coffee instead of

163
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,940
those expensive ones, but they taste just as good.

164
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,070
Still...

165
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,580
Mom, you should try it once.

166
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,930
It's not every day.

167
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,440

Do you know how many bowls of tteokbokki

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,700

171
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,990
Gosh. Grocery prices have increased a lot these days, too.

172
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,860
I tremble over 100 ($0.10) or 500 won ($0.50).

173
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,280
Right. Did you really come for no reason?

174
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,600
- Not because you have something to say?
- Huh?

175
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,040
No.

176
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,000
I just wanted to eat your tteokbokki.

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,380
Since my mom is a snack bar owner, no other place satisfies me.

Oh, the game I'm creating.

181
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,640
I'm drawing the character myself.

Oh, yeah?

183
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,030
Should I draw it for you?

184
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,730
I can draw cartoons.

185
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,520
It's okay. I want to try doing this all by myself.

186
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,190
Yeah?

187
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,050
- Yes, Mom?
 - Min Ho,

188
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,010
I sent some rice cake skewers with Joo Ah for you.

189
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,560
Joo Ah came by?

190
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,360
Yes. You didn't know?

191
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,710
No.

192
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,730
Is something wrong with Joo Ah these days?

193
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,770
There's no reason for her to make a sudden visit on a weekday.

194
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,710
She came and left after finishing some tteokbokki.

195
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,750
Isn't that strange?

196
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,570
Not sure.

197
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,030
You don't know, either?

198
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,380
I mean, she might not tell me if something's going on,

199
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,230
but she tells you everything.

200
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,730
I'll see if I can find out.

201
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,040
Okay. Please do that for me.

202
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,460
I'm worried since she's not acting like herself.

203
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,170
Okay.

204
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,370
Don't worry, Mom.

205
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,430
Mom?

206
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,970
Joo Ah's mom, to be exact.

207
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,040
You call Joo Ah's mom, Mom?

208
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,370
Wow. As expected of a 12-year friendship.

209
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,970
Oh, so Joo Ah did stop by?

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,460
Yes.

211
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,370
I see.

212
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,350
I wonder if she was able to ask her mom.

213
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,640
About what?

214
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,470
Joo Ah has a lot on her mind because of the interview prep.

215
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,050
I heard that even the crash course is really expensive.

216
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,550
She asked me for advice earlier,

217
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,890
so I suggested asking her parents for financial help.

218
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,240
Wait, she didn't tell you?

219
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,390
I told you to mend things with her.

220

For... some tteokbokki.

Yes.

I'm tired, so I'll go in first.

I don't understand why they're like that.

239
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,860
Ye Ri and Min Jeong should argue with each other.

240

Why do they always gossip about each other to me and get me exhausted?

And doesn't it seem like Ms. Jang Mi Yeong only picks on me?

331
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,330
I did pay for the ride,
(T/N: Got credit for the work without contributing)

332
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,100
so you prepped well for the presentation, right?

333
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,810
Yes.

334
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,150
I did a good job on it.

335
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,860
As expected. Don't be nervous.

336
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,850
Fighting!

337
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,400
Our group designed an app that analyzes the body mass index.

338
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,430
We targeted modern people who want to

339
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,980
conveniently measure and analyze body composition at home.

340
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,490
The core features of this app are as follows.

341
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,920
By automatically calculating the change in our BMI,

342
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,240
the app immediately provides comments

343
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,800
on precautions to be taken, health signals, and nutritional intake.

344
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,550
Our presentation so far was an explanation of the objective,

345
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,600
target population, and core functions of the BMI analysis app.

346
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,870
I will end my group's presentation here.

347
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,860
Thank you.
[Group Member: Computer Science, 201823009, Park Ha Neul]

348
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,430
Can someone turn on the lights?

349
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,850
Then, let's take a 10-minute break

350
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,280
and proceed with the next group's presentation.

351
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,870
- Okay.
- What the heck?

352
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,560
Where's my name?

353
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,000
Hey.

354
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,150
Why did you leave my name out?

355
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,530
I said, why did you leave my name out?

356
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,260
Can't you hear me?

357
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,350
What are you doing, you bastard?

358
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,160
I'll refund you.

359
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Cost for your free ride.

360
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,940
You little s**t!

361
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:25,540
If you don't want to be humiliated more, stop acting like a fool.

362
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,280
Thank you.

363
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,890
For what?

364
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,410
About Tae Jin Sunbae, earlier.

365
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,050
I felt better, too, thanks to you.

366
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,940
It felt like you avenged me.

367
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,720
I see.

368
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,390
What do you...

369
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,740
usually do during a Cheer Leader Election?

370
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,830
You do a presentation in front of the entire Cheer Squad.

371
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,920
How you'll run the cheering squad once you're elected,

372
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,770
how you contributed to the Cheer Squad until now.

373
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,870
Stuff like that.

374
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,010
It must be hard.

375
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,720
I don't think I'll have a hard time if you suppo─

376
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,900
Ha Neul.

377
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,820
I have something to tell you.

378
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,750
I...

379
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,250
like you.

380
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,710
I liked you from the start.

381
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,330
Ever since the back-to-school party. No...

382
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,100
I think I have liked you since we met in the taxi.

383
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,570
I was going to give up once I realized you were Ji Min's boyfriend,

384
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,590
but I couldn't really control it.

385
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,610
You and I have a lot in common

386
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,120
and you were by my side when I had a hard time.

387
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,800
So I thought that we were compatible.

388
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,370
Aren't you...

389
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,540
Ji Min's friend?

390
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,090
Yes.

391
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,820
Right.

392
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,570
But you broke up with Ji Min

393
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,380
- and I thought I might have a chance─
- No.

394
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:11,130
We did break up, but I still like Ji Min.

395
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,370
I was only friendly with you because you're Ji Min's friend.

396
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,360
If I had known this was how you felt,

397
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,540
I wouldn't have even been friends with you.

398
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,440
I'll pretend I never heard this,

399
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,980
so I would like it if Ji Min never found out about this, either.

400
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,160
Please.

401
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,320
Noona!

402
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,050
What are you doing here?

403
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,040
Joo Ah will be on the school broadcast today.

404
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,980
What?

405
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,370
Joo Ah's voice will be heard in a few moments.

406
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,100
Yes, we have student Ma Joo Ah today, who received a great response

407
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,820
as the MC of the Seoyeon University Festival!

408
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,360
Yes, hello.

409
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,390
I'm in Business Administration, (entering) class of 2019, Ma Joo Ah.

410
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,540
SeoRab has been raving about what a good MC you were.

411
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,540
What do you think? Would you like to join our broadcast station?

412
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:39,160
Sure, I'll think about it.

413
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,630
Okay, looks like my MC position is in peril.

414
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,260
Joo Ah, do you also know about the

415
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,710
"Dear.M" confession post that heated things up in SeoRab?

416
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,960
Yes, as it turns out,

417
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,930
I'm taking the Photo and Appreciation class in question.

418
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,440
I know about it very well.

419
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,450
But recently, there haven't been any new confession posts.

420
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,010
Hold on. It looks like

421
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,510
the person who wrote those posts

422
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,680
sent a confession to our station instead of posting on SeoRab.

423
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,940
Oh, really?

424
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,200
Really?

425
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,820
No wonder. It's been a while since the last post.

426
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,620
You think it's really "Dear.M"?

427
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,230
Why not just post on SeoRab─

428
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:22,110
Then I'll read it for everyone.

429
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,370
"First period, Monday morning."

430
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,620
"The time that everyone avoids

431
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:31,170
has become the most awaited time of the week for me."

432
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,300
"It is a time when I can meet

433
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,510
my first love once a week without exception."

434
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,860
"The reason I am sending this story today

435
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,800
is because the 16th of this month

436
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:47,110
is the day the person I like faces an important challenge."

437
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:52,580
"I would be really grateful if everyone listening to this story

438
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,490
could support that person even once."

439
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,990
That's so sweet.

440
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,490
If someone would cheer for me like this,

441
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,190
I think I would get motivated right away.

442
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,840
I almost didn't see this,

443
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,100
but this is written at the end.

444
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,100
"Sincerely,

445
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,890
your 87802."

446
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,830
87802? What might that mean?

447
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,460
Don't you think it might be a number that holds memories for the two of them?

448
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,220
Yes, it seems that the person who sent the story

449
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:32,660
left a clue, asking to recognize him even a little bit.

450
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,460
As per the wish of the person who sent the story, My First Love,

451
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,730
I hope your goal is achieved on the 16th.

452
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,820
Then we'll pause and listen to a song befitting the story.

453
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,140
"Maple Latte."

454
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,880
I also have an exam on the 16th...

455
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,400

August 7th...

464
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:56,530
Does it mean the person was born at 8:02 a.m.?

465
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,860
Hyung, what are you doing?

466
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,450
The school broadcast read a story from "Dear.M,"

467
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,130
but something's strange.

468
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,830
Why did they suddenly send the story to the broadcast station instead of posting on SeoRab?

469
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,550
The person who wrote the story left a clue.

470
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,560
"From your 87802."

471
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,280
What on earth could that mean?

472
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,550
I'm so curious.

473
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,080
It has to be a code only the two of them know.

474
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,740
Yes. So where are you going?

475
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,260
Huh? Yeah.

476
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,400
Hold on.

477
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,560
Toffee nut latte, one shot of espresso, iced. To go.

478
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,550
No, no, no. Not there. I've already been there.

479
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,960
It's just expensive and not even that good. Yeah.

480
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,120
Customer.

481
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,360
I'm sorry, but our store doesn't have toffee nut lattes.

482
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,220
Hold on. What do you have?

483
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,010
We have vanilla lattes and condensed milk lattes.

484
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,120
Yeah.

485
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,680
That sounds good!

486
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,830
Huh?

487
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,480
Customer?

488
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,700
Which one would you like?

489
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,100
H-Hold on.

490
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,220
One condensed milk latte.

491
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,670
Okay, one condensed milk latte.

492
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,660
Yes, then let's set it for that location.

493
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,920
Yeah. Then who's buying groceries?

494
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,340
Let's do this then.

495
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,830
You take Soo Hwan and build the tent first.

496
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,810
I'll pick up Tae Kyeong and come after I get groceries.

497
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,370
- Okay, okay. All right.
- The condensed milk latte you ordered is ready.

498
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,880
Okay.

499
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,200
No, I...

500
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,640
ordered a vanilla latte.

501
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,740
Pardon?

502
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,680
You ordered a condensed milk latte.

503
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,150
What are you talking about?

504
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:51,220
I ordered a vanilla latte because you said you don't have toffee nut lattes.

505
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,310
I clearly remember.

506
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,810
I even confirmed once more that you ordered a condensed milk latte.

507
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,190
Wow, how ridiculous.

508
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:04,620
You're blaming me for mishearing me?

509
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,730
I mean, if you got confused, you should be apologizing to me.

510
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,750
How can you blame the customer like this?

511
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,190
Of course not!

512
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,190
Who does that these days?

513
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,500
What crazy bastard yells at an employee when he ordered the wrong drink?

514
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,050
He even spoke down to the employee?

515
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,610
Are you talking to me?

516
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,710
Hey, you probably heard wrong.

517
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,530
You can get into big trouble like that these days.

518
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,560
So many people are watching.

519
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,170
People record everything, so he'll get ousted from society.

520
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,400
Whatever.

521
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,300
I'll let it go for today.

522
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,160
If you do that again...

523
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,500
Be careful, got it?

524
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:20,330
Hey, I can speak up for myself.

525
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,480
I was going to give him an earful,

526
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,950
but you beat me to it.

527
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,020
Why would you argue with a guy like that?

528
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,010
You need to win by speaking as less as possible.

529
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,850
You were pretty good on the school broadcast.

530
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,530
You heard it?

531
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:40,580
I actually couldn't hear it.

532
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,970
Here.

[Ma Joo Ah's first broadcast recording]

534
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,620
You...

535
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,250
- recorded it?
- Yeah.

536
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,750
I thought you might want to hear it, too.

537
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,730
Thank you.

538
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,820
But...

539
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,060
don't do things like this anymore.

540
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,760
Do what?

541
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,740
Take care of me and help me.

542
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,010
Don't do that.

543
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:28,280
When you ignore all my feelings and avoid everything,

544
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,090
I'm not even allowed to express how I feel?

545
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,920
My heart flutters.

546
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:50,230
After that kiss with you, my heart feels weird every time I see you.

547
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,940
You keep coming straight at me

548
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,440
and confess every chance you get, I also...

549
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,900
so...

550
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,790
I feel confused.

551
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,800
But so what?

552
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,150
Will we date?

553
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:11,010
What if we date and break up? We won't see each other forever?

554
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,620
Or act cool and just be friends?

555
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,950
You and I have stuck around for 12 years.

556
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:22,100
You know my feelings better than I do,

557
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,020
and you're on my side through all the fights.

558
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,120
My karaoke jam, height, weight,

559
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,110
and you even know my drinking habits.

560
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,910
What to feed me when my temper gets wild.

561
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,940
And when my mom and dad divorced...

562
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,120
You're the only one who knows

563
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,660
where I went and how much I cried after cutting class.

564
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,240
To me, you're

565
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,230
someone who's closer than family.

566
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,830
Whenever I had a hard time, I told you everything.

567
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,980
But if I break up with you

568
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,600
and have a hard time because of you,

569
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,380
what am I supposed to do?

570
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,530
I...

571
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,800
don't want to ruin

572
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,840
everything we built until now because of fleeting emotions.

573
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,580
I don't want to do that.

574
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,590
What I want from you

575
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,840
is not momentary excitement that goes away.

576
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,610
Not that.

577
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,040
I want a lasting friendship...

00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,290
don't pursue anything from here on out.

What? You're at our school?

Oh, he's not? Okay, then I'm on my way.

592

Unni, I heard about your wedding.

Congratulations! I'm so happy for you!

Thanks.

Gosh, come on!

Unni, you said Min Ho is not coming.

It seemed like you two fought, so I might have told a white lie.

601
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,330
Your fights usually don't even last a day.

602
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,590
Reconcile while you're here.

603
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,110
Why did you ask me to come?

604
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,790
Well...

605
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,900
You guys remember, right? What you promised me five years ago?

606
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,580
You're really going to do this?

607

Yes.

608
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,920
So the three of us will dance to this song?

609
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,290
You guys promised me five years ago.

610
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,660
If I do a bride's dance, you two will join me.

611
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,750
I mean, I thought

612
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,950
that meant we'll just stand there and sing.

613
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:43,320
Gosh. No way. Something like that is too boring.

614

There are no take-backs, you guys.

615
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,040
You said you would do it, so you absolutely have to, okay?

616
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,780
Then I'm going to take that as a yes.

617
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,020
I'm busy with wedding preparations,

618
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,540
so you two come up with the choreo and let me know.

619
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,840
I'll buy you guys a nice meal.

620

ln fact,

624
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:30,570
I was planning to start a business that could improve the image of our company.

625

Withdraw from that competition.

Pardon?

627
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,810
What do you mean...

628
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,580
If you win the competition, the copyright goes to the competition.

629
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,260
So there's no need to take part in the competition.

630
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,400
Let's just properly launch the app within Levan Software.

631
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,600
You can join the company through this opportunity

632
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,020
and lead the app launch. I'll set up a team for you.

633
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,650
Join the company? Me?

634
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,080
I think it's too early.

635
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,240
I started a business at your age.

636
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,030
"Moon Taek Geun's son, Moon Joon.

An article like this will be good for your career,

639
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,640
and I will also have a justification to give you a position.

640
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,960
Okay.

641
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,370
How about "Architecture 101"?

642
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,940
Sounds good. Then I'll be Suzy

643
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,290
and you will be Nabbdeuckyi, right?

Hey, honestly!

645
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,150

Where should we film it?

647
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,980
There was a place like this at our school?

648
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,600
I've been saving this place, so I could come with my girlfriend later when I have one.

649
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,530
Oh, no. You got to come here with me instead.

650
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,660
It's okay. The assignment is more important.

651
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,990
Right.

652
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,600
We need to immerse ourselves in the mood before starting the assignment.

653

This song comes to mind when you think of "Architecture 101."

Yes. I like eating alone.

Why?

664
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,250
Because I feel bad when people choose their menu out of consideration for me.

Proof that Seo Ji Min and Leader are dating.

697
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,370
One. Seo Ji Min is unprecedented

698
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:31,580
in that she became the center right away in her first year.

699
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,820
The current Leader was the Assistant Leader at the time

700
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,840
and Seo Ji Min was aligned with the Assistant Leader.

701
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,490
Two. During the New Vision Declaration Ceremony, Seo Ji Min lost her uniform,

702
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:43,070
and the Leader forced everyone to put on the group cheerleader suit, so she could be on stage.

703
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,120
Three. After Seo Ji Min joined the team,

704
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,020
all Cheering Competition interviews were done by Seo Ji Min.

705
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,740
Even during the Leader and Assistant Leader interview,

706
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,370
the interview was more focused on Seo Ji Min than on the Assistant Leader.

707
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:56,150
Four. Seo Ji Min's center song is always the finale song.

708

The center finale song for the upcoming Cheer Festival is also reserved for Seo Ji Min.

Sunbae.

826
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:54,900
Hey, Won Joong. I heard you're applying for an internship at our company.

827
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,860
Right, I'm applying to several companies with alumni.

828
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,350
Sunbae, you consistently attend the alumni meetings, right?

829
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:03,100
Please put in a good word for me.

830
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,860
Yes, of course.

831
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,170
I heard some rumors about you, though.

832
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,470
Those are really just rumors.

833
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:16,640
There isn't much time left for you as Leader.

834
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,680
Don't spill oil on the fire and end things on a good note.

835
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,760
Okay. I understand, Sunbae.

836
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,340
Let's gather for a moment.

837
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:45,140
I have an announcement.

838
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,990
During the Cheering Festival, the participation time for each school is reduced by five minutes.

839
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:52,550
So I have no choice but to remove one team.

840
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,770
No way.

841
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:56,770
Seo Ji Min.

842
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,800
Your team hasn't finished practicing, right?

843
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:04,720
Our choreo is all done, and we just need to practice.

844
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,990
Other teams are almost done with practice,

845
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,220
so I think Ji Min's team should drop out.

846
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:18,400
Leader, our team can synchronize dance movements.

847
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,590
And we've already perfected the first verse.

848
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:24,160
Teams that have finished practicing the second verse.

849
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,130
Look at that.

850
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,060
We can't remove a team that already has the second verse down.

851
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,490
Ji Min's team should compromise this time.

852
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:43,860
There are five methodologies for qualitative research.

853
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,690
The first one is evidence-based theory.

854
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,960
These theories are based on specific situations.

855
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:55,680
It's about discovering abstract analysis of a certain phenomenon.

856
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,560
[Yeong Noona] Come to the Business Admin building at lunchtime.

857
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:03,950
As for the theory of positivity, you research as you reflect on a certain time frame.

858
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:22,240
You... do you really like me?

859
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,820
Yes.

860
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,850
Then tell me five reasons why you like me.

861
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:32,860
- Geez, does it have to be five?
- I'm counting to ten.

862
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,960
One, two...

863
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,510
One, you're pretty. Two, you're kind and respectful to elders.

864
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:39,900
Three, you look cold-hearted, but you're warm-hearted.

865
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,380
Four, you're sexy when you twirl your pen as you study.

866
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:46,570
Five, it's fun when I talk to you.

867
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:49,190
Okay. Pass.

868
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,540
You know I don't forgive two-timers or overlapping relationships, right?

869
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,150
I got rid of the potential boyfriend from last time.

870
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,510
What? What do you...

871
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,250
Gosh, honestly, you have no tact!

872
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,470
I'm saying that I like you, too.

873
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:05,350
Let's date.

874
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:08,400
What is this?

875
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,540
What's with your reaction?

876
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,970
No...

877
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:14,860
I'm just really happy.

878
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,700
Never mind.

879
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,380
Let's go eat. Follow me.

880
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:23,310
Should we eat the combination platter?

881
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:25,000
Sure.

882
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,790
Thank you.

883
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:29,150
What about this?

884
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,630
Just be on standby here.

885
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:35,680
- I leave this interview up to you guys.
- Got it.

886
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:56,570
You shoot from the front

887
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:59,910
- and you shoot from the side, okay?
- Okay.

888
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,480
If I become Leader,

889
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:06,690
I'll first create an opportunity for female members to wear pant uniforms.

890
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:11,990
I want to create a never-before-seen cheering squad.

891
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:15,740
The Seoyeon University cheering squad, Dionysus,

892
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:19,370
has already been carrying on its 42-year tradition.

893
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:23,880
I want to be a leader to continue the momentum of our sunbaes.

894
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,420
First, I would like to show off Seoyeon's positive influence

895
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:32,560
by doing more activities in support of external sponsorship events.

896
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,100
Finally, I would like to ask how you feel about the upcoming Cheering Festival.

897
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:40,140
I'm nervous and excited at the same time,
[You have a comment for the post, "Leader's special treatment of Seo Ji Min that an insider told me"]

898
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:43,210
but with the expectation that we can show you what we've prepared,
[You have a comment for the post, "Leader's special treatment of Seo Ji Min that an insider told me"]

899
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:46,130
I think I'm more excited.

900
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,680
Great, thank you for your hard work.

901
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,030
Good job!

902
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,800
Good job!

903
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:58,910
Hey.

904
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,950
Let's talk.

905
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:09,170
This was your doing?

906
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,020
Do you pry into other people's cell phones, too?

907
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:18,150
I hoped it wasn't you.

908
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:21,120
To think you're the one who submitted this post.

909
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,210
Everyone in school is talking crap about me because of you,

910
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:26,730
and we even had to drop out of the Cheering Festival.

911
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:31,050
Is this what you wanted?

912
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:34,280
Yes.

913
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:37,930
That's exactly what I wanted.

914
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,490
You're...

915
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,300
more hopeless than I thought you were.

916
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,700
Fine.

917
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,300
You can dislike me for no reason. Liking Ha Neul...

918
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,850
Yeah, well.

919
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:06,060
Let's say that could happen. But...

920
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,230
the only thing you wanted

921
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,460
was for me to break down?

922
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,210
I feel so sorry for you.

923
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,930
What?

924
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:23,860
You are proving yourself now.

925
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,260
The only way you can beat me

926
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:30,780
is if I break down.

927
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:42,730
I'm not going to just stand back anymore.

928
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:46,420
Continue committing your dirty acts.

929
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,830
I'll beat you...

930
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,940
fair and square.

931
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:08,120
You shoot from the front

932
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,550
and you shoot from the side, okay?

933
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:11,040
Okay.

934
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:37,630
What's with you?

935
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,100
What?

936
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,850
You said you're Ji Min's friend.

937
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:45,300
Ha Neul, I think you're misunderstanding something─

938
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,790
So you're the one who posted that.

939
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:55,220
I didn't even realize...

940
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:56,920
I had my own reason─

941
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,500
You said you took a leave of absence because you suffered from rumors.

942
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,960
You said you were scared and miserable. And you still!

943
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,520
How could you hurt someone else the same way?

944
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,260
How could you do that

945
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,790
when you know exactly how difficult that is?

946
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:23,050
Even so, I trusted you.

947
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,820
I'm really disappointed.

948
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,760
If something happens to Ji Min because of you,

949
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:53,860
I'm not going to let it slide.

950
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:15,860
This is the beginning, right?

951
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:17,550
Yeah, that's right. And then you do this.

952
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:20,200
One, two, three, four.

953
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,730
Five, six, seven, eight.

954
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,090
Okay.

955
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:29,000
And then for the chorus,

956
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,850
remember, the steps are...

957
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:35,680
One, two, three, four.

958
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,800
Five, six, seven, eight.

959
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,900
One, two...

960
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:46,640
And then do a wave and then a turn.

961
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,390
And turn and...

962
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:01,850
That's all I need to do, right?

963
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,370
Yeah.

964
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:07,170
Should we take it from the start?

965
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:08,390
Yes.

966
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:10,590
Yeah, sure.

967
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,590
Aigoo.

968
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:33,660
Thank you.

969
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:52,220
Are you doing another agenda item

970
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:55,430
besides this for Unni's wedding?

971
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:56,490
No.

972
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:58,490
Geez.

973
01:05:58,490 --> 01:05:59,760
At least write a letter.

974
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,470
That's so cringy. Why would I do that? This is hard enough.

975
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:07,510
It's once in a lifetime, so what if it's a little cringy?

976
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:10,540
Don't regret it after your noona is married.

977
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:13,400
You secretly do want to write one.

978
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,750
Who says? I don't.

979
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:19,450
You think I don't know you?

980
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:23,130
If you know me so well, how come you won't recognize my feelings?

981
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:35,330
Ma Joo Ah.

982
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:38,230

Around 150 times?

987

Should I let you win this time, too?
