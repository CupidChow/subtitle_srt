=Dream in the Mirror=
=Episode 20=

2
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,079
Why do you come?

3
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,840
I was entrusted by His Majesty

4
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,799
to escort the hostage back to Dongque.

5
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,640
It is my duty.

6
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,879
Mozhu.

7
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,359
Get it ready.

8
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,280
My lord, are you going as well?

9
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,760
How could I possibly

10
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,680
miss this final scene?

11
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,359
Protect the hostage.

12
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
Don't you dare touch my daughter!

13
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,479
General Su.

14
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,719
Stay here.

15
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,680
Don't go out.

16
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,240
You cannot die.

17
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,080
If you die, more people will die.

18
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,120
Thanks, General.

19
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,719
General Su.

20
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,719
Are you okay?

21
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,520
You are Zhao Qingqing, right?

22
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
You know everything.

23
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,879
I saw your letters with my daughter.

24
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,120
I am sorry.

25
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,560
General Su.

26
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,400
Hold on.

27
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,879
We'll get out of here.

28
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,560
Definitely out of here.

29
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,560
I've always said
that luck is on your side.

30
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,839
Until I see for myself how you die,

31
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,240
I just can't feel at ease.

32
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,920
Jiang Beimo.

33
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,639
I was just out of my mind
to send you to school.

34
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,519
Just let you starve in the bathroom.

35
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,240
I've got to where I am today.

36
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,199
Isn't it a result of being pushed

37
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,560
by those who looked down on me?

38
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,000
What's the use of rebirth
via the Double Blossom Mirror?

39
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,839
Don't you ever just hate that
you can't fight

40
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,279
and protect those you want to protect?

41
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,519
With death knocking at your door,

42
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,759
you still need others to protect you.

43
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,399
Baili Jingxing.

44
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,360
Don't you like Zhao Qingqing?

45
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,600
Zhao Qingqing.

46
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,639
You had a point earlier.

47
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,560
Without you back then,

48
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,759
there wouldn't be me now.

49
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,399
Now as long as you kill Baili Jingxing,

50
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,079
you're still my Zhao Qingqing.

51
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,480
Everything will be as it was before,

52
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,439
okay?

53
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,288
Qingqing.

54
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,096
Don't.

55
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,920
Qingqing.

56
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,519
Su Nanyan.

57
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,759
Your Majesty.

58
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:49,279
This is from my father.

59
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,560
This

60
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,519
is from Si.

61
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,439
This

62
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,199
is from Zhao Qingqing.

63
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,199
This last one

64
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,959
is from me.

65
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
When rabbits die,

66
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,600
dogs get cooked.

67
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
I miscalculated.

68
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,120
But I did nothing wrong.

69
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,919
My life,

70
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,559
my choice.

71
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,600
A fate-connecting red thread.

72
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,399
Just tie it on someone's hand,

73
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,360
think about where you want to go,

74
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,039
and you two will get through anything

75
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
to get there.

76
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,120
Father.

77
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,960
Yan.

78
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,559
Make sure to send the hostage

79
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,000
back to Dongque.

80
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,559
Father.

81
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,000
Father.

82
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,728
Qingqing.

83
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:00,928
Qingqing.

84
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,639
No need to wait.

85
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,519
She's not coming back.

86
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,752
(General Su's Tomb)

87
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,399
Where are you going?

88
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,159
My mother is still in Nanyuan.

89
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,399
He killed my father.

90
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,799
I'm going for revenge.

91
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,320
In Nanyuan,

92
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,480
people would say that
General Su died fighting to protect me.

93
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,960
Your father sacrificed his life

94
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
for the safety of the Su family

95
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,159
for the rest of their days.

96
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,360
Leave the rest

97
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,320
to me.

98
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,440
You're going...

99
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,919
To Palace of Dongque.

100
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,600
If becoming King of Dongque

101
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,080
is required to protect all,

102
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,120
then

103
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,720
I will take the job.

104
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,039
(On the 23rd year of Nanyuan,)

105
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,600
(King of Nanyuan attached Dongque.)

106
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,440
(People struggled to survive
amidst the chaos of war.)

107
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,000
(King of Dongque Baili Jingxing)

108
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,480
(led the troops Personally
into Nanyuan's camp,)

109
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,399
(and killed King of Nanyuan
with his own hands,)

110
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,480
(annexing Nanyuan into Dongque.)

111
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,080
(The war ended.)

112
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:08,640
(Baili's Mansion)

113
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,559
Your Majesty, it's getting late.

114
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,519
Time to return.

115
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,080
This guest,

116
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,840
I see your forehead looks a bit pale
and your cheeks flushed.

117
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,279
Do you often find yourself

118
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,600
tossing and turning at night?

119
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,879
Or perhaps you feel bored,

120
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,919
looking for some fun

121
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,639
to spice up your days?

122
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,440
No, no.

123
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,559
