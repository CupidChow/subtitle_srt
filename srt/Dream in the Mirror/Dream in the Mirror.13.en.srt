=Episode 13=

2
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,159
They invited us to a feast at night.

3
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:37,479
The chancellor must have ill intentions.

4
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,399
Knowing it's a setup,

5
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,759
yet you still come alone,

6
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,119
without even bringing Si.

7
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,840
I have to find you a chance

8
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:53,280
to probe where the roots
of these assassins lie.

9
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,240
Less people, less concern.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,920
We'll act smartly.

11
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,359
Baili is coming over.

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,680
Good.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,239
Good.

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,159
Good.

15
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,008
Good.

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,560
Good.

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,519
General Su,

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,840
I am not well-learned, my apologies.

19
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,200
Mozhu.

20
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,519
Why so rude?

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,840
And

22
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,319
with your marital arts,

23
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:49,312
how can you surpass
the Top Master in Nanyuan?

24
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,159
Everyone, don't be troubled by this

25
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,319
and lose your good mood.

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,239
With the charm night scenery,

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,280
today we won't return unless drunk.

28
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,480
- Okay!
- Okay!

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,560
Come on.

30
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,480
Come on.

31
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,000
Mr. Chancellor,

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,360
I will take my leave first.

33
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,496
Go ahead.

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,159
Not good at drink, are you?

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,479
I'll drink on my own.

36
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:22,976
Come on.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,360
As you expected,

38
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,560
the fighting style of this man in black

39
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,479
is exactly like those assassins'.

40
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,199
The person behind Jiang Beimo

41
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,896
must be the chancellor.

42
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,199
You must be careful.

43
00:02:39,552 --> 00:02:41,120
This young man in black's martial arts

44
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:42,912
are much stronger than those assassins'.

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,159
So,

46
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,919
the Chancellor knows you're here,

47
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
and he won't possibly
harm me during this feast,

48
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,560
yet why would he go to such lengths?

49
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:57,800
This is bad.

50
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,400
It's almost dawn.

51
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,360
We should leave.

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,919
Go.

53
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,759
Mr. Chancellor,

54
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,199
I shall take my leave.

55
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,719
Baili,

56
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,719
I haven't had enough to drink with you.

57
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,840
Once you return to Dongque,

58
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,080
I won't have the chance
to drink with you again.

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,400
Thinking back

60
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,280
when you first arrived in Nanyuan,

61
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,719
you were only this tall.

62
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,280
I even held you in my arms.

63
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
In the blink of an eye,

64
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,879
you've grown into a big lad.

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,960
Early to bed and early to rise,
take care of your health.

66
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,439
Nanyan?

67
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,304
Nanyan.

68
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,936
Let's go.

69
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,360
Chancellor wants you to stay.

70
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,920
You two shouldn't be so distant.

71
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,600
Let go.

72
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,439
Mr. Chancellor,

73
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,319
she is feeling unwell.

74
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,720
We'll leave.

75
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,800
Mozhu.

76
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,168
Let's go.

77
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,040
You're exposed.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,800
Exposed?

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,240
Tell me.

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,000
Does Jiang Beimo know
what the Double Blossom Mirror can do?

81
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,720
He should know.

82
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,680
So he...

83
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,560
I never expected

84
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,680
that such a treasure really exists.

85
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,839
It all depends on Chancellor's fortune.

86
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,560
Never expected the Double Blossom Mirror

87
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,240
ended up back in our hands.

88
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,920
Finally, I have unraveled

89
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,680
the puzzlement that has been
lingering in my mind.

90
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,240
What do you mean?

91
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,240
Su Nanyan

92
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,199
rejected my affections.

93
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,920
Yet she suddenly came to me
on her wedding day,

94
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,199
crying on my shoulder,
tears streaming down.

95
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,399
This is one thing.

96
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,800
On the day of their banquet,

97
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Su Nanyan cursed at me loudly

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
and even struck me in front of everyone

99
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,519
with no manners,

100
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,399
unlike her usual style.

101
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,639
This is the second thing.

102
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,079
That night, Su Nanyan came to me,

103
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,319
and told me about Zhao Qingqing's death.

104
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,480
When she woke up the next morning,

105
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,560
she was filled with hatred towards me.

106
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,959
All such things

107
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,920
finally made sense

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,480
until I found the Double Blossom Mirror.

109
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,759
I've checked the time.

110
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,480
It's time
for Baili's hostage to set off.

111
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,839
What now?

112
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,319
What should we do?

113
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,720
Or maybe,

114
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,759
I should go out and deal with them.

115
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm not good at martial arts,

116
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,759
but my trickery is top-notch.

117
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,519
Wait for me here.

118
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,000
Chancellor, I have important news.

119
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,120
No rush.

120
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,279
Wait until I finish
this game with Mr. Jiang.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,319
My lord, I have lost.

122
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,399
Some things are the arrangement of fate.

123
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,360
A loss is a loss.

124
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,560
Well said.

125
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,240
Come, let's hear it together,

126
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,920
the final outcome of this pair.

127
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,160
All dead.

128
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,800
Not a single survivor left.

129
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,480
Not a single survivor left, huh?

130
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,560
All of our people are dead.

131
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,160
What?

132
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,959
Sit tight, we're going home.

133
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,480
Zhao Qingqing
doesn't know martial arts, does she?

134
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,600
Double Blossom Mirror?

135
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
It's all lie!

136
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,159
I got it.

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
Some of the assassins we sent out before

138
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,879
were able to escape and return alive.

139
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,720
Those who died all committed suicide.

140
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,480
Only this time

141
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,080
and the time with Su Nanyan in the jail,

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,399
not a single survivor was left.

143
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,440
They silenced

144
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,080
the witnesses?

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,519
Exactly.

146
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,320
Before, Su Nanyan never kills.

147
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,576
But these two times, she struck to kill.

148
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:17,200
This indicates

149
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,000
the murderer

150
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,679
was not Su Nanyan.

151
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,440
