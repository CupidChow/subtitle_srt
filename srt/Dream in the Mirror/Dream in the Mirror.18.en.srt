2
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:35,240
This battle

3
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,600
we cannot win.

4
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,280
No.

5
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:39,679
I must go back.

6
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:48,600
Father,

7
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,320
why?

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,560
Yan,

9
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,200
you cannot leave today.

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,640
Why?

11
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,679
Didn't you ask me
to protect the hostage?

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,679
But now,

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,320
the Emperor wants him dead.

14
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,359
Once the hostage died,

15
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,400
people will suffer greatly, Father.

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,519
Now the Emperor sees clearly

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,840
that you and the hostage
share a common enemy.

18
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,439
I'm afraid that...

19
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,400
He has saved my life!

20
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,840
I cannot be an ungrateful person.

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,599
Yan,

22
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,120
listen to me.

23
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,760
In order to save my life,

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,120
you have already killed a common girl.

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,799
And now you want to kill Baili Jingxing

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,280
and more innocent people?

27
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,239
How dare you!

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,319
Do you know what you're saying?

29
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,879
You are no longer

30
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,040
that great general
who had the world at heart.

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,760
Guards,

32
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,840
take her down!

33
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,480
You people?

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,560
You think you can stop me?

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,959
Su Nanyan,

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,319
today

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,439
If you dare take half a step out,

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,039
you will see your father

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,879
die before you.

40
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,360
Baili, Miss Su

41
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,719
went to the General's

42
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,400
and has not yet returned.

43
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,039
Qingqing!

44
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,759
Let's go.

45
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,400
What has happened?

46
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,599
Si is dead.

47
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,800
What did you say?

48
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,039
Talk outside.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,599
General.

50
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,160
Let's go.

51
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Baili Jingxing,

52
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,840
do you know a hostage learning
martial arts is a capital crime?

53
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,719
I have no intention of rebelling.

54
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,839
You've known all along.

55
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,360
We cannot afford the consequences
of covering up for the hostage.

56
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,120
Today, the two of you

57
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,000
can't take even a step out
of the General's Mansion!

58
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,000
General,

59
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
I don't want to hurt you.

60
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,360
Baili Jingxing,

61
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
if you make a move
in this current situation,

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,839
it will result in a lose-lose outcome.

63
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,040
You should just give up.

64
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,439
At least I can ensure Yan's safety.

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,680
Why should I believe you?

66
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,639
At the Flower Festival,

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,800
why ate your word?

68
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,839
As a general,

69
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,399
I must protect the well-being of many.

70
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,079
You even deceived your own daughter!

71
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,319
As my daughter,

72
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,600
you should know the greater good.

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,759
I am not your daughter.

74
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,759
You are just a tool
of the King of Nanyuan.

75
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,079
Even I understand this.

76
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,800
Why don't you?

77
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,360
If you can,

78
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,000
arrest us to claim credit.

79
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,800
Mr. Baili,

80
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,959
if the two of you leave this place,

81
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,480
I can't save either of you.

82
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,160
Don't listen to him.

83
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,920
I beg of you,

84
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,120
let her go.

85
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,360
General,

86
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,920
if I am willing to take on all of this,

87
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,800
can you guarantee to save her?

88
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,160
Do not forget

89
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,519
that she is my daughter.

90
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,240
There really is such
a miraculous thing in this world?

91
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,399
It comes from the Floating Sea Market
of the Western Regions.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,879
Now by Baili Jingxing's side,

93
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,639
Zhao Qingqing who can't do martial arts
has the day,

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,439
and Su Nanyan has the night.

95
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,680
It seems after I deal with Dongque,

96
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,360
I must go have a look at
the western city.

97
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,839
Your Majesty, whatever you want,

98
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,560
I will try everything to get it.

99
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,120
Your Majesty,

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,319
a secret report from Dongque.

101
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,839
King of Dongque died yesterday.

102
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,199
They kept it secret,

103
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,000
waiting for Baili to return

104
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,040
for the throne.

105
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
This is earlier

106
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,839
than my estimation.

107
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,264
Beimo,

108
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,639
just as you've said,

109
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,600
kill the hostage during daylight.

110
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,120
I will send you the best assassin.

111
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,240
As for Su Nanyan, or Zhao Qingqing',

112
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,120
since they are in love,

113
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,639
just send them on their way together.

114
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,000
Anyway, once the hostage dies,

115
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,160
all people in the General's Mansion
must be buried with him.

116
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,560
General,

117
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,560
from Lady Nanyan,

118
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,560
I just found a letter.

119
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,720
To whom?

120
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,720
It seems

121
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,360
to be a woman named Zhao Qingqing.

122
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:25,639
(I saved you.)

123
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,439
Zhao Qingqing?

124
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,439
I see.

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,040
Your Majesty,

126
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,920
if the two of them join forces
with the General,

127
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,240
it will be difficult.

128
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,439
Su Mu holds heavy troops

129
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,560
and is deeply loved by the people.

130
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,639
Do you have any ideas?

131
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,160
Under the name of protecting hostage,

132
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,959
firstly take control of them,

133
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,800
isolate them from the General.

134
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,639
Baili Jingxing

135
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,120
will start his journey
back to Dongque soon.

136
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,199
We must not give them the chance
to conspire.

137
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,439
Then, when do we take action?

138
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,040
Right when Baili Jingxing sets off
back to Dongque.

139
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,600
Once they leave Nanyuan,

140
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,800
we will make our move.

141
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,040
Zhao Qingqing can't do martial arts.

142
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,600
Baili Jingxing alone

143
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,759
cannot withstand it.

144
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,040
The future king of Dongque

145
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,319
will not die in Nanyuan State.

146
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,600
This is one point.

147
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,560
Secondly,

148
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,800
since you're concerned that
the general's power and popularity

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,800
might affect your position,

150
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,159
we can send the general

151
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,159
to escort the hostage back to Dongque.

152
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,879
If the General dies in battle,

153
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,120
the trouble with the Su family
will be resolved.

154
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,440
The Founding Grand General of Nanyuan

155
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,000
died protecting
the future king of Dongque,

156
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,320
I presume Dongque people

157
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,360
won't find any fault with this.

158
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,720
And such a heroic deed,

159
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,799
isn't it precisely the reputation
General Su desires?

160
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,759
My lady?

161
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,919
Hello?

162
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,000
Miss

163
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,120
My lady?

164
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:15,744
General,

165
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,759
His Majesty sent someone here.

166
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,720
Why you here?

167
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,399
Come with me.

168
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,200
Let's go.

169
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,912
Qingqing,

170
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,080
don't listen to Su Mu.

171
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,240
If it weren't for me,

172
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,039
you wouldn't be involved.

173
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,256
Qingqing,

174
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
Su Mu is Su Nanyan's father.

175
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,279
He won't hurt you.

176
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,519
But you can't say

177
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,000
he won't do anything to you!

178
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,080
If he reveals your martial art

179
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,159
to King of Nanyuan,

180
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,200
it will be too bad.

181
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,639
No, you must go.

182
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,600
Let's go!
