2
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:35,759
Kneel down.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,679
The sun is about to set.

4
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,159
Can't you come tomorrow?

5
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,880
My name is Zhao Qing...

6
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,960
My name is Su Nanyan.

7
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,640
I've come to report that the girl,
Zhao Qingqing, has been murdered.

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,600
Su Nanyan.

9
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,039
Are you Su Nanyan, the daughter
of the founding general, Su Mu?

10
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,759
Miss Su, tell me what happened.

11
00:01:00,832 --> 00:01:01,479
I...

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,320
Sir, I have been wronged.

13
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,760
I have been wronged.

14
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:08,416
(Baili's Mansion)

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,040
(After that girl's blood was taken,)

16
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,319
(she was thrown off the cliff
by a masked person.)

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,359
(Now her corpse)

18
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,439
(is probably already eaten
by birds and beasts.)

19
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,760
Your qi and blood are weak.

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,840
Seems to have been sick for years.

21
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,599
I'll prescribe you
two doses of medicine.

22
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:44,920
What is this?

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,439
So, you're interested in this?

24
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,840
This is
the Qiankun Fragmented Jade Disk.

25
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,640
When you are in danger,

26
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,519
just throw it on the ground,

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,359
and you can run away
in a cloud of smoke.

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,239
Fifty taels.

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,840
And...

30
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,319
The Zhiwei stars descend from the sky.

31
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,359
Just grasp them in your hand

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,800
and make a wish to the sky,

33
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,199
and then you can

34
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,120
hear people from the stars.

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,439
Amazing, right?

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,479
Thirty taels.

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,560
Interesting.

38
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,599
Where did you get all these things?

39
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:26,240
In a place very far away,

40
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,840
there is a land beyond the world,

41
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,360
the Floating Sea Market.

42
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,960
It seems you've been to many places.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
Of course.

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,759
I really envy you.

45
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,879
Envy me?

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,319
I get it.

47
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,879
Take a look at this.

48
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,879
The Thousand-Mile Red String.

49
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,680
Just tie it on someone's hand

50
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,639
and think of the place you want to go,

51
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,319
and then the two of you
will cross everything

52
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,879
and get there.

53
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,639
I'll take this one.

♪Do not drink alone beneath the flowers♪

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000

56
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,000
Is it so?

Be careful with fire
in such dry weather.

00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:38,784
(Silence)

63
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:42,304
(Night)

64
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,080
Sir, spare my life.

65
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,360
Sir, I am wrongfully accused.

66
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,400
Spare my life, please.

67
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,039

68
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,199
Please spare my life.

00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,199
Please spare my life.

70
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,400
Spare my life.

71
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,479
Miss Su, tell me

72
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,719
what happened.

73
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,520
How was that girl
Zhao Qingqing murdered?

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,040
Zhao Qingqing?

75
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,160
She's dead?

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,120
Well...

77
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,120
She...

78
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,319
Su Nanyan went to the yamen,

79
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,879
and then suddenly ran away.

80
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,959
I saw it with my own eyes.

81
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,600
If this Su Nanyan

82
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,160
wanted to clear her name,

83
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,000
with her agility,

84
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,600
she could have easily

85
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,879
killed that Divine Ximen.

86
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,920
Then there would be no evidence.

87
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,439
But she insisted on
taking him to the yamen.

88
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,839
If she really wanted
to report it to the yamen,

89
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,319
then why did she

90
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,240
run away without saying anything?

91
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,480
This really doesn't seem like
the act of the same person.

92
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,480
Where did she go after that?

93
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,839
Su Nanyan is really agile.

94
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,399
I got quickly shaken off.

95
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,680
Mr. Baili, perhaps
she would have gone to...

96
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,879
Have someone watch over.

97
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,079
Mr. Baili.

98
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,560
You'd better stay away from this.

99
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,560
We're going to return soon.

100
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,120
Don't...

101
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
I can ignore other matters.

102
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,759
I must get the bottom of this matter.

103
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,839
Early to bed and early to get up
make a man healthy.

104
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,560
It's morning again.

105
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,360
Where is this?

106
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,839
Wasn't I at the yamen?

107
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,199
You're awake.

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,399
Mr. Baili, you've had a nightmare again?

109
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,639
I know,

110
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,920
all these years,

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,399
you always have her in mind,

112
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,040
the girl named Zhao Qingqing, right?

113
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,959
Over these years,

114
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,560
I often dream of myself

115
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,240
waking up to find myself
with her at a place

116
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,000
called the Floating Sea Market,

117
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,199
being far from the court

118
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,199
and being free and unconstraint.

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,480
Mr. Baili, since she has passed away,

120
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,560
let's move on.

121
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,560
If it's really Su Nanyan who killed her,

122
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,600
what would you do then?

123
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,160
At this time,

124
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,519
you really should endure it.

125
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,240
Back then, she clearly cured me.

126
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,160
Yet I could only lie about
how sick I am getting.

127
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,720
Because only in this way,

128
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,920
would the people of Nanyuan
let their guard down.

129
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,959
Mr. Baili, staying far from hometown,

130
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,480
you had to do so.

131
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,160
Even if Su Nanyan
didn't kill Zhao Qingqing herself,

132
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,920
this matter is related to her.

133
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,279
Mr. Baili, you'd better...

134
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,000
Enough.

135
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,759
I have to find out the truth.

136
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,120
Mr. Baili.

137
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,879
I've already sent people
to look for Miss Su.

138
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,399
But she has never been found.

139
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,800
And no word
from the general mansion, either.

140
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,399
Move!

141
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,680
The person who just passed by
was Miss Su, right?

142
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,959
I dragged that man to the yamen,

143
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,639
and then I felt a bit dizzy,

144
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,040
and

145
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,679
I woke up in the Dianmo Studio.

146
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,279
How come I don't remember

147
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,519
anything in these two nights?

148
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,960
There are two sets of chopsticks
on the table.

149
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,879
I can't eat

150
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,759
with him at the same table.

151
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,200
(The Double Blossom Mirror)

152
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,080
(allows me to appear
in Su Nanyan's body.)

153
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,879
(What about Su Nanyan then?)

154
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,559
(In that case...)

155
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,480
(I get it.)

156
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:08,224
(Baili's Mansion)

157
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:21,360
(Su Nanyan, I am Zhao Qingqing.
It was my blood that saved you.)

158
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,279
(I am Zhao Qingqing.)

159
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,320
(It was my blood that saved you.)

160
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:34,600
(Two Days Ago)

161
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,639
Now that we are married,

162
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,639
we have a long future ahead.

163
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,709
(Two Days Ago, Day)
Early to bed

164
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,000
and early to get up
make a man healthy.

165
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:43,080

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,440
Be careful with fire
in such dry weather.

167
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,840
(Two Days Ago, Night)
The daughter of the general

168
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,039
has an affair with the top scholar.

169
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,320
It's really disgraceful.

170
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,519
Yan, you have greatly disappointed me.

171
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,443
(I thought I was recovering
from a serious illness.)

172
00:10:07,443 --> 00:10:08,000
Father.

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,559
(And I did something
that disgraced the family.)

174
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,840
I am sorry.

175
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,559
(So, all of this)

176
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,960
