Master,

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,320
I've just arrived and am penniless.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,759
I wish to exchange this treasure
for some traveling funds.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,199
To tell you the truth, this thing

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,480
can store a person's soul.

(Zhao Qingqing, itinerant physician)
Double Blossom Mirror.

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,719
It's said that it can place
a person's soul

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,640
into the body of someone
with the same birth date and time.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,320
Get out of here.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,039
Do you take me for a fool?

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,200
This mirror is so beautiful.

13
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,479
Can you sell it to me?

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,640
Get out.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,479
I really want it.

16
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,079
Stop there.

17
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,479
I want it.

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:43,648
The mirror.

19
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,159
You are so generous.

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,719
You are so kind to me.

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,640
Then how will you repay me?

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,399
I'll count to five.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,799
If you can catch me,

24
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:07,400
I'll be yours.

You've surpassed me.

30

Father, please don't joke with me.

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,800
Aren't you afraid I might hurt you?

32
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,400
You are the publicly acknowledged

33

How could that be fortunate?

Yan,

38
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:29,759
your illness

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,919
can be cured now.

Aren't you afraid
of ruining your fiancé's reputation?

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,759

this medicine is?

General,

55
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,959
I've never seen
such a strange thing before.

56
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,279
According to Miss Su's serious illness,

57
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,160
ordinary people often do not
live past twenty.

58
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,839
Yet she miraculously recovered
overnight.

59
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,839
May I ask

60
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,120
what kind of miraculous medicine
Miss Su took?

61
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,879
Heaven blesses our family

62
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,120
to allow Yan to continue serving
His Majesty.

63
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,879
Then I shall take my leave.

64
00:04:59,319 --> 00:04:59,959
Yan,

65
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,360
I need to discuss something with you.

66
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,439
Father, please go ahead.

67
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,199
His Majesty intends to betroth you
to Mr. Baili.

68
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,360
Father, are you referring to

69
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,519
the hostage from Dongque,

70
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,680

71
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,120
Yes.

72
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,360
Baili Jingxing has always been sick.

73
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,040
In addition, due to the agreement
between the two nations,

74
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,480
the hostage is forbidden
to practice martial arts.

75
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,560
Now the time of the hostage's return
is approaching.

76
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,360
Various powers are targeting him.

77
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,279
His Majesty wishes to use the marriage
as an excuse

78
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,560
to covertly protect Baili Jingxing?

79
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,160
Baili Jingxing

80
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,560
has become the only heir
to the King of Dongque.

81

82

in Nanyuan,

83

into chaos.

complete trust.)

of the future King of Dongque,)

(only then will His Majesty
be more relieved.)

Miss Su, why are you not happy?

100
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,839
Today is the big day.

104
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,720
You are so beautiful today.

105

I'll just give it to you.

It's almost dawn.

111

Aren't you going to see Miss Su?

112
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,480
You must have waited for me all night.

113
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,240
Now that we are married,

114
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,480
we have a long future ahead.

Scoundrel.

125
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,879

in your hands.

- Put it over there.
- Someone!

132
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,720
Mr. Baili, what happened?

133
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,759
Why did she leave?

134
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,720
Shall I go after her?

135
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,920
No hurry.

136
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's see what she's going to do.

137
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,080
Congratulations, General Su.

138
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,399
The top martial arts master of Nanyuan

139
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,159
has married the future King of Dongque.

140
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,639
Truly a perfect match.

141
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,759
But I've heard

142
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,799
that your daughter likes someone else.

143
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,840
Those are all baseless rumors.

144
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,759
Yan indeed has a lot of admirers.

145
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,240
But she and Mr. Baili

146

Jiang Beimo?

153
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,399
Sorry.

Please feel free to browse here.

155
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,519
Let me take a look at that.

156
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,120
Okay.

157
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,080
How is it not new?

158
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,639
What are you talking about?

159
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,360
Have I offended some big shot?

160
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,679
Luckily, I ran fast.

161
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,200
I need to find Jiang Beimo.

162
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,200
Miss, you know Jiang Beimo?

163
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,159
Who is Jiang Beimo?

164
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,440
You don't know that?

165
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,320
They all say this year's top scholar
Jiang Beimo

166
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,279
is really impressive.

167
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,120
After completing
the policy questions test,

168
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,399
His Majesty directly rewarded him
with this mansion

169
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,480
and personally inscribed the name
"Dianmo Studio".

170
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,120
Who is this girl?

171
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,799
I don't know.

172
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,519
(Dianmo Studio)
Why is she here in the wedding clothes?

173
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,440
Jiang Beimo.

174
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,056
(Jiang Beimo, Newly Crowned Top Scholar)

175
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,919
It really is you.

176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,159
I thought I was dreaming.

177
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,039
I don't even know what happened.

178
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:29,679
Why are you here?

179
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,600
Come with me first.

180
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,679
Shouldn't you be at the wedding?

181
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,919
Why did you come here?

182
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,440
Yes.

183
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,120
Am I not supposed to marry you today?

184
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,480
How come I wake up to find myself
marrying someone else?

185
