00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:32,768
=Dream in the Mirror=
=Episode 7=

2
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:47,168
(Yao Jiagu, Western Barbarian Strongman)

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,840
This is Yao Jiagu,

4
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,520
the top strongman
of the Western Barbarian.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,560
Everyone.

6
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,320
I am very curious

7
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,719
between the top strongman
of the Western Barbarian

8
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,079
and the top master of Nanyuan Nation,

9
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,040
who is better?

10
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,400
Yao Jiagu.

11
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,120
You can have a friendly spar with
the top master of Nanyuan Nation.

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,159
Okay.

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,319
I have long wanted to see

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,239
the skills of the top master
of Nanyuan Nation.

15
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,680
I didn't expect the Floral Feast
to have such an event.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,239
That's pretty amazing.

17
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,799
Why are they looking at me?

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,816
Nanyan,

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,879
you are the top master.

20
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,319
Come out and show us something.

21
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:35,760
Jingxing.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,920
- You don't mind, do you?
- Your Majesty.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,680
I...

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,120
I don't mind.

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,239
No, I can't do it.

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,799
General Su, I've heard
so much about you.

27
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,000
Today I can finally fight you.

28
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:56,959
Please.

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,920
Wait.

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,560
Well...

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,599
Maybe next time.

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,239
Nanyan.

33
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,959
Such an opportunity
doesn't come by often.

34
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:07,840
Go!

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,360
Maybe wait until it gets dark.

36
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:11,808
Right.

37
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,800
Wait until it's dark.

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,680
Tonight Yao Jiagu will set off
to return to the Western Barbarian.

39
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:19,800
Really?

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,960
Mr. Baili.

41
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,199
Why do I feel
that Miss Su is somewhat...?

42
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,759
It's fine.

43
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,360
You've also seen how agile she is.

44
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,120
Let her show her abilities
in front of these officials.

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,599
It can make those with ulterior motives

46
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,360
back off.

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,680
Your Majesty.

48
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,479
General Su is worried about
injuring Yao Jiagu.

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,000
They are all guests.

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,479
If he gets injured,

51
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,919
it's truly against our hospitality.

52
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,319
If I get injured, it's all my fault.

53
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,159
General Su, don't hold back.

54
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,240
Please protect yourself.

55
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,159
That's not what I meant.

56
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,960
Miss Su took advantage of her agility

57
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,879
to perform the evasive technique.

58
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,240
Miss Su's technique

59
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,439
is indeed rare to see.

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,599
Help!

61
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't come over here.

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,560
Well...

63
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,439
Don't come over.

64
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,080
Don't come over.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,520
Wait.

66
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,240
Shall we call it even?

67
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,080
Could this be the legendary technique

68
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,639
that dazzles the opponent's eyes?

69
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,759
General Su is indeed the top master
of Nanyuan Nation.

70
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
It's coming.

71
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,159
The final battle is coming.

72
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,560
This decisive battle
between the barbarians and Nanyuan,

73
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,120
who will be the winner?

74
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,120
Let's see...

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,080
Well...

76
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,719
Well...

77
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,360
Well...

78
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,479
Did you see it clearly?

79
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,080
No.

80
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,960
Did you see it clearly?

81
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
This swift technique

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,120
calculated

83
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,159
the wind force, the resistance,

84
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,439
and even the endurance of the strongman.

85
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,000
Seems like a coincidence,

86
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,319
but it is actually carefully planned.

87
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,599
Your Majesty.

88
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,520
General Su

89
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,520
deserves to be the top master
of Nanyuan Nation.

90
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,160
Brilliant!

91
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,040
Bravo!

92
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:31,808
(Nanyuan)

93
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,759
The days we counted on our fingers

94
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,000
are finally coming to an end.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,439
Do you think this Su Nanyan

96
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,160
is a bit off?

97
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,879
She?

98
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,800
She is indeed incredible.

99
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,279
She has unpredictable techniques.

100
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,464
No.

101
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,959
This is different from

102
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,680
what I saw last night.

103
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,279
I don't quite understand.

104
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,759
Do you mean...?

105
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,040
During the day and at night,

106
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,240
I think she's like two different people.

107
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,000
The techniques she had just performed
at the Floral Feast

108
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,560
are totally different from
the techniques she used to protect me

109
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,439
last night.

110
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,759
Is it because as the top master,

111
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,040
she knows a wide variety
of martial arts techniques

112
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,959
that you and I have never seen before?

113
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,319
Are there still
any martial arts techniques

114
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,079
that are unknown to us both?

115
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,959
Unless she only knows
martial arts at night.

116
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,720
Let's try her sometime.

117
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,576
Mr. Baili.

118
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,199
Why do you always
find Su Nanyan trouble?

119
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,959
Zhao Qingqing is already dead.

120
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,720
The dead can't be brought back to life.

121
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,519
We should just wait for

122
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
our return to Dongque.

123
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,319
If it weren't for Zhao Qingqing,

124
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,279
I would have died of boredom
in this cage by now.

125
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,199
Compared to her,

126
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,439
the throne of Dongque means nothing.

127
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,519
Now Su Nanyan

128
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,519
is very likely to be related
to the death of Zhao Qingqing.

129
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,560
There's no way I'd miss any clue.

130
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,912
Alright.

131
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,759
Mr. Baili.

132
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,480
You're fine the way you are.

133
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,720
Actually, you're more like
the men of our Dongque country now.

134
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,399
Do you remember

135
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,759
the last time Su Nanyan mentioned
Jiang Beimo drugging her?

136
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,319
I trust her on this.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,279
I think this Jiang Beimo

138
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,319
must be up to something.

139
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,040
The assassins we sent out last night,

140
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,920
only one returned.

141
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,519
Is this your plan?

142
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,560
I didn't expect Su Nanyan

143
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,959
to get along well
with Baili Jingxing that soon.

144
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,120
It's my fault.

145
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,000
That sounds like you've overestimated

146
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,120
your importance in Su Nanyan's mind.

147
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,800
Feeling a bit jealous, are you?

148
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,240
I dare not.

149
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,079
Do you know,

150
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,720
once the assassination
of the hostage is exposed,

151
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,600
what crime will I be charged with?

152
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,759
Rest assured, Chancellor.

153
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,560
The men I sent

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,480
are all loyal men of sacrifice.

155
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,480
I am here to get rid of your worries.

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,639
I will certainly not trouble you.

157
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,920
As long as I am here,

158
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,279
Baili Jingxing

159
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,360
will surely not leave Nanyuan.

160
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,000
Once the hostage dies,

161
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,000
His Majesty will certainly blame Su Mu

162
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,160
for failing to protect the hostage.

163
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,439
In the future,

164
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,160
no one would dare to go against you.
