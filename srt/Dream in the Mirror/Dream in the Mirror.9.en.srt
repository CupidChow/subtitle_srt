2
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,479
Father.

3
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,759
Can I ask you a question?

4
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,079
What is it?

5
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,520
How was my illness cured?

6
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,240
Haven't I already told you?

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,920
I spent a fortune
seeking therapy around.

8
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,679
Finally, I found a divine doctor.

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,880
He saved your life.

10
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,159
Do you know

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,880
where the medicine came from?

12
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:01,960
Yan.

13
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,159
What's up?

14
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,280
Are you feeling alright?

15
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,159
Do you know

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,120
that the medicine was made
with the heart blood of a living person

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,760
as the core ingredient?

18
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,280
I've no idea what you're talking about.

19
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,079
Jiang Beimo gave you that medicine,
right?

20
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,120
I said

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,120
it was the divine doctor
who saved your life.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,799
I just doubted

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,439
that Jiang Beimo
was the assassin of the hostage prince.

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,079
You didn't have even a shred of doubt.

25
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,159
So you must have known him.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,239
But when did you have
such private relationship with him?

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,640
How could I possibly have
private relationship with him?

28
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,079
Actually,

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,799
I planned never to tell you this.

30
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,560
When this old doctor Ximen

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,239
came to see you,

32
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,000
he said your illness could only be cured

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,680
using heart blood of someone

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,640
with the same birth date and time
as yours.

35
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,879
No other way.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,719
I drove him out right then.

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,479
A few days later,

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,759
Jiang Beimo came with a medicine,
saying it could save you.

39
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,439
I saved Nanyan's life.

40
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,759
Why can't I marry her?

41
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,879
Mr. Jiang,

42
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,400
If there's anything else you want,

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,919
as long as I have it,

44
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,520
I will definitely give it to you.

45
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,039
But marrying my daughter,

46
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,719
sorry I cannot agree.

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560
My daughter Nanyan

48
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,639
is already engaged
to Baili, the hostage prince.

49
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,400
Actually,

50
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,759
when Jiang Beimo gave me the medicine,

51
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,240
I did have a faint feeling

52
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,199
that it was made with heart blood.

53
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,879
But I was so eager to save you.

54
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,688
Father.

55
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,840
You've asked me to practice
martial arts since young,

56
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,919
just to protect others.

57
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,439
But now,

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,520
I can't even protect a woman.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,520
I might even have caused her death.

60
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,199
Do you know how I feel?

61
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,120
We were born on the same month and date
of the same year.

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,319
But now, she is dead to make me live on.

63
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,360
Is this because

64
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,000
I am the daughter of you, General Su?

65
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,680
I have to thoroughly investigate this.

66
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,520
If Jiang Beimo really
killed Zhao Qingqing,

67
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,599
I will definitely not let him off.

68
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,479
Zhao Qingqing?

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,560
It's her heart blood?

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,319
Exactly.

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,360
Not only that.

72
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,319
She grew up together with Jiang Beimo.

73
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:58,120
If Jiang Beimo holds office,

74
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,159
Nanyuan Nation is going nowhere.

75
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,120
Yan,

76
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,319
have you ever thought

77
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,240
that if people knew you were saved

78
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,719
by Zhao Qingqing's heart blood,

79
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,680
then you...

80
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,120
If I have to pay for her life,

81
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,800
I'm willing to give my life back to her.

82
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,079
I know where that Ximen lives.

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,800
He might know more about the truth
behind Zhao Qingqing's death.

84
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,680
Tonight I will guard Baili's Mansion.

85
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,800
Feel free to go.

86
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,759
Excuse me, are you Divine Ximen?

87
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,120
Didn't Su Nanyan say
she wanted to join hands with me?

88
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,120
What does she want now?

89
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,199
Sir.

90
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,839
Sir, where is this?

91
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,519
Why am I kept here?

92
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,199
Sir.

93
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,120
Sir.

94
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,199
Not strange.

95
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,720
Murder, often happens when out of mind.

96
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,000
I just can't remember.

97
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,399
Me either.

98
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,040
I was told

99
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,839
that I'm a maniac killer.

100
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,079
Even Zhong Kui couldn't catch me.

101
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,040
I do remember

102
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,759
how I carved the flesh
off that unfaithful man's body,

103
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,199
piece by piece.

104
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,519
You...

105
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,720
You all killed?

106
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,639
Exactly.

107
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,600
Didn't you?

108
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
Then how would you end up
in this death cell?

109
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,319
Take her away.

110
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,264
Yes.

111
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,279
Cruel devil, do you confess your crime?

112
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,040
What crime have I committed?

113
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,680
Dare to argue.

114
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,079
Last night,

115
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,839
(Divine Ximen died, killer caught, facts clear)
you stabbed Divine Physician Ximen.

116
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,079
Do you admit it?

117
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,240
Su Nanyan killed Divine Ximen.

118
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,920
Su Nanyan?

119
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,600
She is the daughter of General Su Mu.

120
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,040
This case is beyond my authority.

121
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,000
Report it now.

122
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,240
Yes sir.

123
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,839
Let me out.

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,120
I didn't kill him.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,512
General.

126
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,160
Any news of Nanyan?

127
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,399
General, General.

128
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,399
We found the Miss.

129
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,319
She's back?

130
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,399
The Miss is locked up in the death cell.

131
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,040
Early this morning,

132
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,639
Divine Ximen was found dead
at his residence.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,639
The Miss was lying next to him,
holding a sword.

134
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,920
You come to see me off?

135
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,839
Su Nanyan can never be trusted.

136
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,439
She must have done it
to destroy evidence for Jiang Beimo.

137
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,800
Su Nanyan, oh Su Nanyan.

138
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,680
For someone like Jiang Beimo,

139
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,759
sacrifice yourself?

140
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,879
With me?

141
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,360
Seems like she's cursing someone.

142
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,399
Whom?

143
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,440
Should be Su Nanyan.

144
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,080
Su Nanyan, daughter of General Su Mu?

145
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,080
Dare to curse
the daughter of General Su?

146
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,600
Who is she?

147
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,759
Su Nanyan.

148
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,416
Nope.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,480
Your Majesty,
when it's placed, it's placed.

150
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,519
Just let me rethink about it once.

151
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,159
Your Majesty,
General Su Mu requests an audience.

152
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,904
Summon.

153
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,159
Summon.

154
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:03,879
Your Majesty.

155
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,639
My daughter is imprisoned.

156
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:06,784
What?

157
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,039
What happened?

158
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,080
Last night,
Divine Ximen from the clinic died.

159
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,960
My daughter was arrested as the killer.

160
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,519
Your Majesty, you know it.

161
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,120
She has missions to fulfill.

162
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,159
It's absolutely impossible
that she committed such a ludicrous act.

163
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,120
Your Majesty, please look into it.

164
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,799
I believe,
this isn't something Nanyan would do.

165
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,840
Your Majesty, this is a critical matter.

166
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,840
How about let me investigate it?

167
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,039
If Su Nanyan didn't do it,

168
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,399
I will definitely clear it up.

169
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,799
General Su, what do you think?

170
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,399
It would be excellent
if Mr. Chancellor can step in.

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,399
If my daughter has done something wrong,

172
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,279
please punish her according to the law,

173
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,000
to protect our state.

174
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,759
Didn't I tell you
to protect Divine Ximen?

175
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,200
How could he die?

176
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,720
Mr. Baili.

177
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,000
Yesterday, that Divine Ximen

178
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,399
suddenly got a windfall,

179
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,519
and bribed our subordinates,

180
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
sending them all away.

181
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,799
A windfall?

182
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,080
As I see,

183
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,600
it was Miss Su.

184
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,679
After gaining our trust,

185
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,799
she made a backstabbing move.

186
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,320
Now that Divine Ximen died,

187
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,720
the identity of the masked person

188
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,080
will never be known.

189
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,279
In my opinion,

190
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,279
that masked person is Su Nanyan herself.

191
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,200
Can't be.

192
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,679
With her skill,

193
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,360
even if she had killed someone,

194
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,039
she wouldn't have got herself
caught in the death cell.

195
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,080
Mr. Baili,

196
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,159
pardon me for being frank.

197
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,840
All these years in Nanyuan Nation,

198
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,200
haven't you suffered enough humiliation?

199
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,120
You took it all.

200
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
Now for Zhao Qingqing,

201
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,519
you risk your life, time and again.

202
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,960
Isn't returning to Dongque

203
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,720
not as important as Zhao Qingqing?

204
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,159
Zhao Qingqing's victimization
is just part of the story.

205
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,840
I always feel that there is a hand
manipulating all these from behind.

206
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,159
General's Mansion.

207
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,840
Jiang Beimo.

208
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,320
Dongque.

209
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,039
Nanyuan.

210
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,759
I have a bad hunch.

211
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
Then what's your plan?

212
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,240
The matter of utmost urgency

213
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,840
is to rescue Su Nanyan out.
