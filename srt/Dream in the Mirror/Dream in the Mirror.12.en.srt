=Dream in the Mirror=
=Episode 12=

2
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,079
Did you miss me?

3
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,159
I did.

4
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,240
What took you so long?

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,159
Guess what I brought you today.

6
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,679
Where's the mirror I gave you last time?

7
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:47,679
Still have it.

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,079
Let me see.

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,640
Not on me.

10
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,679
Our Miss has it.

11
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,039
Mr. Baili gave it to me.

12
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,200
Why did you give it to your Miss?

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,039
You already gave it to me. Give me that.

14
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,000
Give me that.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,240
Why?

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,759
What if someone sees us?

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,399
I know a good place. Come with me.

18
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:04,719
Go. Let's go.

19
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:05,799
- Don't.
- Go ahead.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,799
Rebirth?

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,959
With this mirror?

22
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,280
From what happened,

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,920
yes, it is.

24
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,519
Jiang Beimo.

25
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,680
You wanted to follow the General,

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,840
but was rejected.

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,680
I gave you the opportunity,

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,799
to have every step well planned,
and become who you are today.

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,519
I didn't expect

30
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,560
that you're so desperate
for quick success.

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,879
Look at your silly words.

32
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,120
I wouldn't dare.

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,359
Don't make excuses
for your foolishness anymore.

34
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,920
Su Nanyan is a martial artist,
isn't she?

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,319
I don't believe,

36
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,120
she never feels tired.

37
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,599
Keep recruiting death warriors.

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,280
Put Baili Jingxing on his deathbed.

39
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,879
Farewell to Mr. Chancellor.

40
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,159
This guest,

41
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,879
this is Double Blossom Mirror.

42
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,599
I wouldn't take it out for just anyone.

43
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,639
So

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,560
what's special about this mirror?

45
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,000
Legend has it that

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,759
it can put a person's soul

47
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,080
into the body of another

48
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,800
born on the same month and date
of the same year.

49
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,560
I see you are not nobody.

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,919
Just fifty taels of silver for it.

51
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,520
Well, well.

52
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,159
You even dare to deceive me?

53
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,680
I didn't deceive you.

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,080
If one day

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,879
I am in the body of someone else,

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,599
make sure you recognize me.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,960
(Double Blossom Mirror.)

58
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,039
(Shouldn't it have disappeared
with Zhao Qingqing?)

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,840
(How is it in the hands of Su Nanyan?)

60
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:13,760
(Baili's Mansion)

61
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,360
Caiwei.

62
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,159
Did you see my mirror?

63
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,719
After you returned,

64
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,400
I haven't seen you take it out.

65
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,400
Could it be left in the cell?

66
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,840
What's missing?

67
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,319
Double Blossom Mirror.

68
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,879
I've always wanted to ask

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
where this Double Blossom Mirror
came from.

70
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,960
How could it

71
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
be in Miss Su's hands?

72
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,560
Good question.

73
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:51,680
Caiwei.

74
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,280
Do you know where
this Double Blossom Mirror came from?

75
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,400
I, I found it somewhere.

76
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,439
Found it somewhere?

77
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,280
Are you hiding something from us?

78
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,719
I wouldn't dare.

79
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,840
Mr. Baili.

80
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,400
Bad news, Mr. Baili.

81
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,648
Mr. Baili,

82
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,879
Mr. Baili, Xiao'er
from the bridgehead clinic died.

83
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,960
On the day Divine Ximen died,

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,959
he reported it to the authority.

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,759
What?

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He committed suicide out of guilt.

87
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,480
He left a blood-written note
on the floor

88
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,160
saying that both Zhao Qingqing
and Divine Ximen

89
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,040
were killed by him.

90
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,040
Another scapegoat
Jiang Beimo found for himself.

91
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,040
It must be him.

92
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,439
What does the authority say?

93
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,360
The authority already concluded that

94
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,040
Xiao'er was the killer,
and committed suicide out of guilt.

95
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,360
No, I must overturn the case.

96
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,040
Do you have a way to prove his crime?

97
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,920
Jiang Beimo is malicious.

98
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,519
Don't harm any innocent people anymore.

99
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:45,720
But...

100
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,040
Caiwei,

101
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,959
you're dismissed.

102
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,079
Yes.

103
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,439
It is definitely not that simple.

104
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,040
Just by himself,

105
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,839
it's impossible for him
to be so powerful.

106
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,439
There must be someone else

107
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,879
behind Jiang Beimo.

108
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,120
Someone else?

109
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,439
They all have one

110
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,519
clear purpose.

111
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,680
That is, to put me to death.

112
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,759
Every time you're not by my side,

113
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,639
assassins take bold actions that night.

114
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,279
Perhaps we can find some clues

115
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,759
from the matter of assassinating me.

116
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,240
Moreover,

117
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,160
you are now General's daughter,
Su Nanyan.

118
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,720
It won't be as easy for them
to target you

119
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,279
as it is for Zhao Qingqing.

120
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,160
So you must play Su Nanyan well.

121
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,360
Don't let anyone find out

122
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,000
that you have no martial skills
during the day.

123
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,680
Since our enemy is Jiang Beimo,

124
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,639
let's find out the one behind together.

125
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,088
I.

126
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,560
You.

127
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,560
And Su Nanyan.

128
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:49,959
I announce,

129
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,759
the three of us
are officially in alliance.

130
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,199
(Starting from today,)

131
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,639
(I will play the role of Mrs. Baili
during the day.)

132
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,879
(Do not raise any suspicions.)

133
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,399
(The task of protecting you)

134
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,240
(is left to Su Nanyan at night.)

135
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,600
Mr. Chancellor.

136
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,879
Please calm down.

137
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,319
Now the time of the hostage's return
is approaching.

138
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,560
He is unhurt, even a hair.

139
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,759
How can I trust you anymore?

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,639
Mr. Chancellor.

141
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,720
Please give me more time.

142
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,959
Beimo still thinks

143
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,879
Double Blossom Mirror has something.

144
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,560
What are you still thinking about
that stupid mirror for?

145
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,199
I promise it's true.

146
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
As things stand now,

147
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,920
it's better to believe it

148
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,000
than not.

149
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,560
I'll give you one more chance.

150
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:41,504
(Dianmo Studio)

151
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,800
Where did this come from?

152
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,279
Mind your own business.

153
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,920
Good for you.

154
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,839
Get packed now.

155
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,839
How did this mirror come back again?

156
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,439
What's up?

157
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,439
This mirror

158
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,240
is exactly the same
as the one I picked up before.

159
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,000
But I gave it away.

160
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,960
What are you doing here?

161
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,080
- Mr. Jiang.
- Mr. Jiang.

162
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:45,960
You're dismissed here.

163
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,688
Yes.

164
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,759
Jay.

165
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,399
This mirror...

166
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,600
I was just talking nonsense.

167
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,919
Mr. Jiang, please do not punish me.

168
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,279
It's alright.

169
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,120
Don't be afraid.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,159
Who did you say you gave this mirror to?

171
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,279
I didn't.

172
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,200
Jay.

173
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,200
Since I came to this Dianmo Studio,

174
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:27,960
you have been looking after me.

175
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,559
You are not still afraid of me, are you?

176
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,960
Actually,

177
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,399
I picked up this mirror

178
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,720
by accident on the carriage.

179
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,799
I thought it quite beautiful.

180
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,080
So I gave it to Caiwei
from Baili's Mansion.

181
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,639
Does your Caiwei know

182
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,679
you picked up this mirror from my place?

183
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,919
No, she doesn't.

184
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,879
How could I say I picked it up?

185
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,080
I said it was a gift from you.

186
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,720
Very well.

187
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,960
Today,

188
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,159
I have another gift for you.

189
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,320
Really?

190
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,159
I know my mistake.

191
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
I lied.

192
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,320
Caiwei,

193
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,799
what happened?

194
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,960
Get up and speak slowly.

195
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,360
Mr. Baili asked me
about Double Blossom Mirror.

196
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,399
This Double Blossom Mirror

197
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,960
was a gift from Jay of Dianmo Studio.

198
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,120
He said

199
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,679
Jiang Beimo gave this mirror to him.

200
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,639
Is it true?

201
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,720
I didn't tell the truth

202
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,799
because I fear if the Miss knows

203
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,440
about my secret affair with Jay,

204
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,720
you would punish me.

205
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,600
Caiwei, we all need love.

206
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,960
How could I punish you?

207
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,120
Caiwei,

208
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,799
go find Jay.

209
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,480
Tell him I want to see him.

210
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,159
But I just

211
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
heard from Xiaofeng of Dianmo Studio

212
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,559
that Jay is no longer alive.

213
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,480
What?

214
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,304
This...

215
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,600
Report.

216
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,320
Jiang Beimo from Dianmo Studio
requests an audience.

217
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,159
Jiang Beimo.

218
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,919
What brings you here this late at night?

219
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,120
Mr. Chancellor is having
a birthday banquet.

220
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:43,440
I am specially sent to invite

221
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,480
Mr. and Mrs. Baili to the banquet.

222
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,559
Got it.

223
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,879
Anything else?

224
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,320
Caiwei,

225
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,960
as a servant,

226
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,639
you should be happy
if your masters are happy,

227
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,639
and sad if your masters are sad.

228
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,120
Mr. and Mrs. Baili

229
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,200
are having such a good relationship.

230
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,799
Why aren't you happy?

231
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,720
Are you sad for something?

232
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:31,799
Coincidentally

233
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,720
I have something here.

234
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,399
You will like it.

235
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,904
Si.

236
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,120
Send Caiwei back first.

237
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:58,759
Yes.

238
00:12:58,759 --> 00:12:59,279
Caiwei.

239
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,840
You're not going to the banquet.

240
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,559
I must go.

241
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,559
Jiang Beimo surely has someone
behind him.

242
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,080
We must find out

243
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,679
who our enemy is.

244
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Are you suspecting

245
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,519
the Chancellor?

246
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,039
Do you remember

247
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,519
you once said that

248
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,200
these assassins
seemed to learn from the same master?

249
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,399
It's time for us to take moves.
