2
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:35,719
You're truly brilliant.

3
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,600
This is a win-win,

4
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,000
not only protect Mr. Baili,

5
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,640
but also took down Jiang Beimo

6
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,479
and Chancellor.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,719
Both dealt with.

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,679
Truly satisfying.

9
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:43,679
Do you think

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,759
they can't turn the tables now.

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,880
Before returning to Dongque,

12
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,960
he should not make any more moves.

13
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes indeed.

14
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,600
They have made a fool of themselves

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,320
at the festival.

16
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,200
Everyone saw that.

17
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,439
And I think

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,119
this time nobody

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,039
can save them.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,439
If it were not for this move,

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,079
the situation now

22
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,280
would be hard to say.

23
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,799
I've saved you again.

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
How will you thank me?

25
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,719
You've reminded me.

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,120
I've put Jiang Beimo

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,359
into the dead cell.

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,439
You should thank me properly.

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,319
How is it that I owe you a favor now?

30
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,879
Mr. Baili,

31
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,439
if you truly
have affection for Zhao Qingqing,

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,799
I won't interfere.

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,079
It's just that

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,519
now I share a body with her,

35
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,519
many things are inconvenient.

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,599
You need to give me some time

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,719
to adjust.

38
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,920
Si?

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,599
Si!

40
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:07,760
What's wrong?

41
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:15,159
The assassin's sword was poisoned.

42
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:16,759
Call doctor.

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,080
I'll call.

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,599
Mr. Baili,

45
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,719
my condition,

46
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,800
I'm very aware of it.

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,319
Si?

48
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:28,960
Si.

49
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,280
Si...

50
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,120
I

51
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,240
won't be able
to accompany you back to Dongque.

52
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,120
Someone, call the doctor!

53
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,120
Si!

54
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,039
Si.

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,919
You must beware of everyone around you.

56
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,400
Although Jiang Beimo and Chancellor
have been imprisoned,

57
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,360
the general has not returned yet.

58
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,120
And the reason is unknown.

59
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,639
Mr. Baili,

60
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:09,159
I know you dislike court affairs.

61
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
But some people,

62
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,520
you cannot protect them
with your strength alone.

63
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,360
Only by caring for the world

64
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,199
can you protect the important ones.

65
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,719
Si!

66
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,319
Miss Su,

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,159
protect him.

68
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,000
Si?

69
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,800
Si...

70
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,439
Si!

71
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,280
Si!

72
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,000
Father,

73
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
where did you go today?

74
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,479
Why weren't you protecting the hostage?

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,000
Your Majesty.

76
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:27,959
Your Majesty!

77
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,560
Save me!

78
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,959
How dare you, at the Flower Festival,

79
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,439
try to hurt the hostage?

80
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,279
Who can save you now?

81
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,839
It's Jiang Beimo.

82
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,319
It's all Jiang Beimo.

83
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,079
He told me to do so, Your Majesty

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,680
Your Majesty!

85
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,879
Greetings to Your Majesty.

86
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,439
When I was asking questions,

87
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,319
I learned of your abilities.

88
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,879
I awarded you with Dianmo Studio

89
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,959
to enlighten you, Jiang Beimo.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,639
You shall serve the country.

91
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,560
But I did not expect

92
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,279
that you would collude with scoundrels,

93
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,560
carelessly

94
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,000
plotting to harm the hostage.

95
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,079
You have disappointed me.

96
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,240
Your Majesty,

97
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,759
these accusations are unfounded.

98
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,600
I schemed against the hostage,

99
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,920
but all of this

100
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,199
was for you, Your Majesty.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,319
Surmising my will?

102
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,000
Do you know your crime?

103
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,160
I heard General Su

104
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,839
guarded the empty city gates
all day long.

105
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,800
Do you know

106
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,839
if not for today's close call,

107
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,040
the Su family would fall into the trap.

108
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,240
At the least, imprisoned,

109
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,240
at worst,
the execution of the whole clan!

110
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,279
Not to mention if the hostage died,

111
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Dongque might seek revenge from Nanyuan.

112
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,759
Two countries in a war,

113
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,319
will the common people

114
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,240
have good days ahead?

115
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,560
Yan,

116
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,199
all this,

117
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,360
how could your father not understand?

118
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,800
But as a general,

119
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,240
I have my duties.

120
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,240
The sovereign's order
must not be disobeyed.

121
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,040
Baili Jingxing
frequently encounters assassinations.

122
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,959
How could you be unaware?

123
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,319
During the Flower Festival,

124
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,000
the general's troops

125
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,040
are so crucial
for protecting the hostage.

126
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,000
You must be well aware too.

127
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,319
Yet you insisted

128
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,959
to have the general guard
the empty city gates.

129
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,920
Your Majesty,

130
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,920
forgive my bold speculation,

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,480
you did this

132
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,000
because you want Baili Jingxing to die.

133
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:31,839
How audacious!

134
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,279
If the hostage died,
we will start a war.

135
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,879
How could I want the hostage dead?

136
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,879
The founding General,

137
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,079
commanding significant forces,

138
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,639
deeply cherished by the people.

139
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,079
This is your concern.

140
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,920
You cannot directly strip him
of his military command.

141
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,439
Thus, for so many years,

142
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,720
it's always been the Chancellor
maintaining a balance with him.

143
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,879
If his son-in-law, Baili Jingxing dies,

144
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,240
the Chancellor
would surely make a big fuss out of it.

145
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,120
Then you may take the opportunity

146
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,879
to seize his military power

147
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,519
and remove this concern.

148
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,800
This is one thing.

149
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,399
The heirs of the King of Dongque died
one after another.

150
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,399
He, Baili Jingxing,

151
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,800
is the future king of Dongque.

152
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,480
If this sole heir dies,

153
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,200
Dongque will surely fall into chaos.

154
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,360
Your Majesty, you would certainly
not miss such a great opportunity.

155
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,960
At that time, we can take down Dongque

156
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,559
and reap the benefits.

157
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,879
What makes you think so?

158
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,159
Your Majesty, as the ruler of a nation,

159
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,519
deigned to visit this death cell

160
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,919
to see me, a disabled man.

161
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,919
You must have something to say to me.

162
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,080
You are quite clever.

163
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,919
It's a pity that Chancellor

164
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,639
has such a narrow perspective.

165
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,559
It was a waste of talent.

166
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,120
So all of this

167
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,399
was the King of Nanyuan's idea.

168
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,399
When the sovereign orders death,

169
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,679
the subject must die.

170
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,480
This battle,

171
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,279
we cannot win.

172
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,639
Your Majesty,
thank you for the great grace!

173
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,120
I will certainly serve you
with diligence.
