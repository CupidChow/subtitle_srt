00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,960
=Dream in the Mirror=
=Episode 14=

2
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,880
So you're actually that amazing.

3
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:39,960
But why you...

4
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,640
I've heard that hostages

5
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,479
practicing martial arts
is a capital offense.

6
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,520
From now on,

7
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,799
you must listen to me.

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,560
Don't you remember me?

9
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,599
I've traveled all over the place

10
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,239
and met too many people.

11
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,879
Memory lapses happen.

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,120
Does the Floating Sea Market
really exist?

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,120
How do you know about it?

14
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,879
I told you?

15
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,560
Of course.

16
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,680
Double Blossom Mirror came from
the Floating Sea Market.

17
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,079
You saw it yourself.

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
It worked, didn't it?

19
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,959
The stuff I sell works

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,640
just like the store owners tell me.

21
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,359
I spent a lot on them.

22
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,319
But every time I sell something,

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,719
they called me a swindler.

24
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,680
You're injured?

25
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,799
What?

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,879
By day, it's Zhao Qingqing,

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,000
at night, it's Nanyan?

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,920
Why would I lie?

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,359
But let me tell you,

30
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,959
you mustn't tell anyone.

31
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:17,840
Forgot the water.

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,759
Mr. Baili, you're injured?

33
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,000
It's nothing.

34
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,599
Let me apply medicine for you.

35
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,879
No need, you may go.

36
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,759
I'm idle anyway.

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,000
I also feel reassured

38
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:39,960
watching you here.

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,680
Idle, seriously?

40
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,599
Have you chopped the wood?

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,879
Fed the fish?

42
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,680
Swept floor? Cleaned windows?

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,840
So many things to do,
yet you see no work.

44
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,000
Mr. Baili,

45
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,479
if I did all these chores,

46
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,719
what would servants do?

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,719
Just do it.

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,759
Apply the medicine.

49
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,560
What are you looking at?
Take off your clothes.

50
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,719
If you don't undress,

51
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,879
how should I apply it?

52
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,080
Sweep the floor?

53
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,639
I'm doing all the chores.

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,400
Sweep the floor,

55
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,199
mop the floor...

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,879
General,

57
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,080
Baili's attacked again?

58
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,400
Are the injuries severe?

59
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,280
Some minor injuries.

60
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,039
Where're they?

61
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,879
They are in the room.

62
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,120
Is it Jingxing's Room?

63
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,840
General, wait.

64
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,599
Why do you like
to blindfold people so much?

65
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,680
How can I apply medicine if I can't see?

66
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,199
Your skin is so delicate and tender.

67
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,279
Mr. Baili!

68
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,384
General.

69
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,800
Yan?

70
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,720
How were you injured?

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
I'm not injured.

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,000
It's him who got injured.

73
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,040
The person behind Jiang Beimo
turns out to be Chancellor.

74
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,839
Last night, Nanyan tested it.

75
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,360
The black-clad guy at Chancellor's place

76
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,720
has the same moves

77
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,720
as that of the assassin
who tried to kill me.

78
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,680
Didn't expect they would do this
in broad daylight.

79
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,839
Luckily, my daughter is highly skilled.

80
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,328
Yes.

81
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,480
Thanks to her,

82
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,040
I survived.

83
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,199
Right.

84
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,759
I use the Green Dragon, White Tiger

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,759
and many other moves,

86
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,000
and killed them all.

87
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,600
These days,

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,759
I will send additional manpower
to strengthen the guard.

89
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,399
You better not go out
if it's not necessary.

90
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,439
Thank you, General.

91
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,600
If you died,

92
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,959
wouldn't Nanyuan be in great turmoil?

93
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,519
Why would Chancellor do this?

94
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,560
Chancellor Li and General Su

95
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,399
are King's right and left arms.

96
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,360
They're well balanced in skills.

97
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,040
But now,

98
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,199
The King of Nanyuan
betrothed Su Nanyan to me.

99
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,920
Once I return to Dongque,

100
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,639
the General's power will surge.

101
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,040
But if I were to die,

102
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,600
Chancellor Li could then
accuse the General

103
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,240
of failing to protect the hostage.

104
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,240
When my father seeks accountability,

105
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,600
the Su family may become
the scapegoat for Nanyuan.

106
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
This is too much.

107
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,439
This is getting more complicated.

108
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,879
It's not just my issue alone.

109
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,439
You, and the Su family,

110
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,879
we must work together to stop them.

111
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,720
Rest assured.

112
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,759
I will take you away from here.

113
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,912
(Nanyuan)

114
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,000
Mr. Baili,

115
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,480
if one day you can return to Dongque and

116
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,319
ascend the throne,

117
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,120
you'll surely be great.

118
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,959
Governing a country needs intelligence,

119
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,800
not violence.

120
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,079
And,

121
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,519
stop mentioning Dongque's throne.

122
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,079
Now that Qingqing was found,

123
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,199
once I leave here,

124
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,839
I am determined to take her

125
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
to live a carefree life.

126
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,519
A woman

127
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,279
has made you give up the throne?

128
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,000
Endure a bit more.

129
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,639
Soon, you'll be free.

130
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,319
Endure?

131
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
I've endured 15 years.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,759
Can I not endure?

133
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,839
I just hope

134
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,319
that your patience

135
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,560
can make them spare you.

136
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,279
Mr. Baili.

137
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,759
Where is he?

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,639
Where is he?

139
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,079
I just wonder

140
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,319
how is my family doing.

141
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
From youth,
you came to this foreign land with me.

142
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,199
I've seen you as my brother.

143
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,800
When we leave here,

144
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,600
I'll accompany you to your home first.

145
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,919
Okay.

146
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,279
One more round.

147
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,480
Mr. Baili,

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,200
this time I will try my best.

149
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,279
Can't do it.

150
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,840
I can't move even a bit.

151
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,759
And you still want to protect me?

152
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,320
Mr. Baili,

153
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,159
I've been holding this in for long.

154
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,639
I'm not sure
if it's appropriate to say it.

155
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:22,960
Say it.

156
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,039
You really can't

157
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,519
reveal your martial arts in public.

158
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,519
If you get caught,

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,360
you'll die here.

160
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,240
You're aware of that day.

161
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,919
How could I just stand by?

162
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,559
The general will send extra guards
to protect us.

163
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,759
Besides,

164
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,120
in broad daylight,

165
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,639
they wouldn't dare to storm in.

166
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,960
We should be safe staying here

167
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,960
during the daytime.

168
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,679
The Flower Festival in ten days

169
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,600
is when Dongque and Nanyuan

170
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,159
are due to conclude a peace treaty.

171
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,519
As a hostage of Dongque,

172
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,519
I must attend it.

173
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,039
I fear that will be a challenge.

174
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,000
Who's it?

175
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,120
How did you get in?

176
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,399
I...

177
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,159
I...

178
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,519
What did you hear?

179
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,399
I... I heard

180
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,360
you say I'm not versed in martial arts.

181
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,320
So I...

182
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,120
I...

183
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,519
I have an idea.

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,639
Let's hear it.

185
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,159
Since Su Nanyan is
Top Martial Arts Master in Nanyuan,

186
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,399
that means

187
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,279
this body

188
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,240
is very talented in martial arts.

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,759
You just mentioned

190
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,320
that festival or something,

191
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,519
isn't it ten days later?

192
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,879
How about you teach me martial arts?

193
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:52,519
These days,

194
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,759
I dreamt of gliding across rooftops

195
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,159
and exerting fatal moves with ease.

196
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,039
Perhaps,

197
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,480
with this body,

198
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,279
I could truly become Nanyuan's top...

199
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,279
No, the 108th top masters.

200
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:14,519
Chancellor,

201
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,440
a spy reports

202
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,759
the General arranged men

203
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,039
patrolling near Baili's Mansion.

204
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,639
Our people can't get close.

205
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,840
Have them all pull back.

206
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,559
Do not alert them.

207
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,000
The Flower Festival in ten days,

208
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,360
Dongque's hostage will surely attend it.

209
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,039
At that time, let Mozhu

210
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,879
join forces with the masters here

211
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,639
to strike together.

212
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,440
With so many people present,

213
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,000
the Dongque hostage

214
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,559
can't show his martial skills.

215
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,080
This time,

216
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,759
I will make sure
they cannot escape their fate.
