00:00:29,044 --> 00:00:32,992
=Dream in the Mirror=
=Episode 19=

2
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,960
Where are they taking us?

3
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,679
It's not going back to Baili's Mansion.

4
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,759
General is releasing us now.

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,759
Only one possibility.

6
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,799
You mean...?

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,039
It's the King of Nanyuan?

8
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,520
Have you...smelled something

9
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,640
strange?

10
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:10,304
General.

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,519
The hostage and Miss were

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,920
taken away by His Majesty.

13
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,040
General.

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,840
Are we not telling His Majesty

15
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,760
that Baili practices martial arts?

16
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,400
Returning to Dongque
in just a day or two.

17
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,280
No need to complicate matters.

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,760
But...

19
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,439
His Majesty took away

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,760
the hostage and Miss now.

21
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,439
It feels strange.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,159
Would he think that

23
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,400
we are conspiring something,

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,640
so he wants to break us apart?

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,400
How dare you!

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,400
Do not guess about the imperial will.

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,599
I wouldn't dare.

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,519
I'm just afraid that

29
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,200
His Majesty might use the hostage issue

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,584
to re...

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,959
remove you.

32
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,719
Wake up! Wake up!

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,840
This place is...

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,719
Slept well?

35
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,120
You two.

36
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,439
This mesmerizing incense was chosen
by Zhao Qingqing

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,400
out of goods from the Western Regions,

38
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,840
and given to me.

39
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,280
I didn't expect it to be so effective.

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,879
Had I known,

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,599
I would have asked you for more.

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,400
Haven't you always wanted to know

43
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,520
how you died?

44
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
It's right here.

45
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,360
I asked Divine Ximen

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,520
to take your heart blood.

47
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,000
Jiang Beimo, you despicable villain.

48
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,800
If His Majesty finds out,

49
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,599
you will surely go to hell.

50
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,560
Stop yelling.

51
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,759
Zhao Qingqing.

52
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,520
Think about it.

53
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,680
I was captured by His Majesty.

54
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,360
How could I appear here safe and sound?

55
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
Anyway,
you two don't have many days left.

56
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,919
It does no harm to tell you.

57
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,919
It was His Majesty who sent me here

58
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,759
to send you both to death.

59
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,039
I knew it.

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,680
The King of Nanyuan wants to
use my death

61
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,360
to send troops to Dongque, right?

62
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,920
Your father, the King of Dongque,

63
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,519
died a few days ago

64
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,680
unexpectedly.

65
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,920
If you were dead also,

66
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,560
His Majesty wouldn't even need
to send troops.

67
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,759
Your Dongque

68
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,279
would become a complete mess.

69
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,639
Jiang Beimo.

70
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,759
Rest assured.

71
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,720
Today is not your last day.

72
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,920
So any little lovey-dovey things

73
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,319
you couple have

74
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,720
to say to each other,

75
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,600
just say it.

76
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,680
I

77
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,879
will not disturb you.

78
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:08,960
Oh right.

79
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,720
This mirror is of no use to me.

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,360
Here you go.

81
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,120
Consider it as

82
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,199
a parting gift.

83
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,480
General Su Mu.

84
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,600
His Majesty summons you.

85
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,600
You were still dragged into this.

86
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,199
It's not you who dragged me into this.

87
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
It's Jiang Beimo.

88
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,720
Without this mirror,

89
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,680
I would have been dead long ago.

90
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,000
Qingqing.

91
00:05:59,648 --> 00:06:01,120
- I...
- The top priority right now

92
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,279
is to find a way out.

93
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,896
Right.

94
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,439
They lock us up here now.

95
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,600
They must intend to kill us

96
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,399
out of Nanyuan.

97
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,800
There's something
I find quite surprising.

98
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,199
General knows about your martial skills.

99
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,879
And yet he didn't tell His Majesty.

100
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,319
Otherwise, King of Nanyuan wouldn't
have gone through so much trouble,

101
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,199
not to kill us until we leave Nanyuan.

102
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,920
Jiang Beimo knows that during the day

103
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,240
you're Zhao Qingqing.

104
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,240
They will surely kill us during the day.

105
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,800
They have woven a large net,

106
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,319
waiting for us to jump in.

107
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,759
I told the servant

108
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,519
before going to the Mansion.

109
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,600
If I do not return overnight,

110
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,360
they will notify Dongque.

111
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,920
Then Dongque will send someone
to find us.

112
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,079
But before that,

113
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,199
we must hold on.

114
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,360
No idea that tomorrow

115
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,480
who're the guards sending us to Dongque.

116
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,519
Poor people.

117
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,120
They will die along for no reason.

118
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,199
General Su.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,199
You've sacrificed a lot for my Nanyuan.

120
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,000
Now I heard
that the King of Dongque died suddenly.

121
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,319
Various forces

122
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,959
will surely be eyeing Mr. Baili.

123
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,800
I can only

124
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,519
protect Baili temporarily.

125
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,759
But tomorrow out of the city,

126
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,560
I can only leave you this vital task.

127
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,439
Thus, I can be at ease.

128
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,160
Your Majesty.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,120
How about guarding the city?

130
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,560
I have made a plan for you.

131
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,279
Tomorrow, your deputies

132
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,160
will stay to guard the city.

133
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,720
I'll send our state's best hands

134
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,639
to go with you tomorrow.

135
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,399
Your Majesty's grace.

136
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,560
I followed the former emperor
all my life,

137
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,600
fighting for stability and peace.

138
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,959
Today, I am entrusted by Your Majesty

139
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,120
with the task of escorting the hostage.

140
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,439
I will surely not fail this mission.

141
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,639
Bro.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,840
Bro.

143
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,720
You bunch of animals.

144
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,759
I will...

145
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,639
General.

146
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,360
I don't believe

147
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,919
this place can trap me

148
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,279
Zhao Qingqing.

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,320
Plenty of experts are out there.

150
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,480
My strength alone

151
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,320
may not be enough.

152
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,200
Why fear?

153
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Isn't Su Nanyan

154
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,080
coming soon?

155
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,960
Qingqing.

156
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
If she arrives,

157
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,080
then such a beautiful bamboo forest

158
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,679
would all be destroyed.

159
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,879
What a pity.

160
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,240
I am here
on the order from the King of Nanyuan

161
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,600
to escort the hostage back to Dongque.

162
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,159
General Su.

163
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,960
It's not yet dawn. Not safe out there.

164
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,240
Besides,

165
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,639
His Majesty sent Mozhu to head the team,

166
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,000
and assist the General.

167
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,240
Why am I feel so weak?

168
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,679
Incense abounds.

169
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,960
What exactly happened?

170
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,840
It's about to dawn.
