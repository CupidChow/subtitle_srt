=Episode 5=

2
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,640
Master,

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,079
time to rest.

4
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,000
You haven't had any sleep
for several days.

5
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,679
Ever since Yan married Baili Jingxing,

6
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,079
her behavior has become more
and more strange.

7
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm really worried

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,679
if she can protect the hostage well.

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,600
Others' daughters are the apple
of their parents' eye.

10
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,399
Yet you push Yan into
the most dangerous place.

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,280
You don't get it.

12
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,000
If Yan can truly

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,439
be with Baili Jingxing,

14
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,680
when Baili Jingxing returns to Dongque,

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,480
Nanyan's life will get somewhat better.

16
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,560
I'm doing this for her own good too.

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,480
The imperial edict has arrived.

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,480
According to the edict by His Majesty,

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,040
the Floral Feast is approaching,

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,920
now order General Su Mu to lead the army
to station outside the city

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,120
to protect the envoys
from all countries.

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,680
I will obey the edict.

23
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:45,824
(Su Nanyan, I'm Zhao Qingqing.
The blood from my heart saved you.)

24
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,959
(Sooner or later
I will find out the truth.)

25
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,120
(Good and evil will eventually
be repaid.)

26
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:57,640
Mr. Baili.

27
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,439
Dianmo Studio.

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,760
After leaving the yamen,

29
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
she went to find Jiang Beimo again.

30
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:02,920
Really?

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,319
Yes, I'm sure.

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,439
Is Jiang Beimo also involved
in Zhao Qingqing's death?

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,624
Let's go.

34
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:11,520
Mr. Baili.

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,360
Go to Dianmo Studio.

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,199
Beimo greets Lord Baili.

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,319
It's so late.

38
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,479
Where does Lord Baili wish to go?

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,840
Don't you know

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,919
where we are going?

41
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,599
Should I know?

42
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,879
Lord Baili, do you wish to ask

43
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,159
why Miss Su was with me last night?

44
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,080
You abducted my wife last night.

45
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,479
How can you be so self-righteous?

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Your wife left in a hurry this morning

47
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,479
and left something behind.

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,800
Put it down.

49
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,159
Mr. Baili, he is clearly provoking us.

50
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,800
I told you to put it down.

51
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
Since it's already been returned
to its owner,

52
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,439
I'll take my leave.

53
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,840
Mr. Baili,

54
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,960
Jiang Beimo and Su Nanyan

55
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,319
must have an unspeakable relationship.

56
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,560
You don't have to endure anymore.

57
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,639
Isn't this a good thing?

58
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,879
I'm worrying about not having
a reason to drive her away.

59
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,160
Miss Su.

60
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,600
This is?

61
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,680
Sent by the top scholar.

62
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,879
This isn't mine.

63
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,920
Mr. Baili, there must be
some misunderstanding.

64
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,160
Is it also a misunderstanding
that you didn't return all night?

65
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:57,519
(The night before)

66
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,920
Miss Su, tell me

67
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,279
what happened.

68
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,079
How was that girl
Zhao Qingqing murdered?

69
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,199
Zhao Qingqing?

70
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,760
You...

71
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,008
This...

72
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,399
Su Nanyan.

73
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,920
What are you going to do now?

74
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:20,959
Listen.

75
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,879
I don't know what happened.

76
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,360
If I slandered you,

77
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,560
I'll apologize to you.

78
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,319
Do you know

79
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,319
Zhao Qingqing?

80
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,319
How do you know Zhao Qingqing?

81
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,000
Do you know

82
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,199
why I ignored the affection
you have for me?

83
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,040
You are the daughter of a general.

84
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,040
My status is low.

85
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,399
It's normal that you look down on me.

86
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,000
I once inadvertently

87
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,040
saw a letter Zhao Qingqing wrote to you.

88
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,199
She must be your wife-to-be.

89
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,680
Zhao Qingqing is dead.

90
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,199
After she told me

91
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,720
she was coming to Yu City,

92
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,199
there was no news from her ever again.

93
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,959
I originally wanted to treat her well.

94
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,720
But after I arrived in Yu City,

95
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,079
I met you

96
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,800
and fell in love with you.

97
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,920
Mr. Jiang,

98
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,120
I came today as a friend

99
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,439
to inform you of what I know.

100
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,240
And I'm already married
to Baili Jingxing.

101
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,120
That's all between you and me.

102
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,399
I know.

103
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,519
That day when you scolded me
at Baili's Mansion,

104
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,600
it has already awakened me.

105
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,160
I don't know how to explain that.

106
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,519
If there's nothing else,

107
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,519
I should leave now.

108
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,639
Let's finish this drink.

109
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,680
From now on,

110
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,319
we'll go our separate ways

111
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,920
as strangers.

112
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,120
I take my leave.

113
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,399
What's wrong with you?

114
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,639
I...

115
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,800
I...

116
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,639
I don't remember

117
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,319
what happened after that.

118
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,600
You don't remember

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,120
or it's inconvenient to say it?

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,680
I...

121
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,279
Si,

122
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,759
wait for me in the study.

123
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,639
Yes.

124
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,319
Su Nanyan.

125
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,120
As a general's daughter,

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,800
unexpectedly, you're so flighty.

127
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,759
If you truly like Jiang Beimo,

128
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,920
tomorrow, I will petition His Majesty

129
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,560
to let you be with him.

130
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,759
Mr. Baili, wait a moment.

131
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,959
I went to Dianmo Studio last night

132
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,160
because I heard

133
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,560
the news that Jiang Beimo's
childhood sweetheart had died,

134
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,439
I just went there to tell him.

135
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,240
But

136
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,000
I truly don't remember

137
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,240
what happened after that.

138
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,320
Master,

139
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,559
you asked me

140
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,840
why I alerted them at this time.

141
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,480
Su Nanyan's martial arts
are exceptional.

142
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,720
Only if they're not aligned,

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
can the assassination of the hostage
be accomplished with half the effort.

144
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,360
Once the hostage dies,

145
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,639
your anxiety will be gone.

146
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,000
Have you thought it through

147
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,519
what the next move should be?

148
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,639
I've already arranged everything.

149
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,360
When the right time comes,

150
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,720
we will take action and
strike directly at the target.

151
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
When is the right time?

152
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,559
Tonight.

153
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:14,592
(Baili's Mansion)

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,840
Zhao Qingqing is Jiang Beimo's
childhood sweetheart?

155
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,039
I heard long ago that Jiang Beimo
was already betrothed.

156
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,440
Never expected it to be her.

157
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,399
I get it.

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,159
The person who killed Zhao Qingqing

159
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,399
must be Su Nanyan.

160
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,840
So Divine Ximen

161
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,559
dared not reveal the true identity

162
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,360
of the masked person
in front of Su Nanyan.

163
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,399
But that day she was so angrily

164
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,200
taking Divine Ximen
to report to the officials.

165
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,759
It didn't seem to be fake.

166
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,960
But she didn't report
to the officials after all.

167
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,056
Who's that?

168
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,159
(If Zhao Qingqing owns the body
during the day)

169
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,320
(and I own it at night,)

170
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:20,960
(then last night...)

171
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,519
Let's finish this drink.

172
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,639
From now on,

173
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,360
we'll go our separate ways

174
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,840
as strangers.

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,584
Hurry.

176
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,600
I'm the hostage from Dongque.

177
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,159
Do you know the consequences
of killing me?

178
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,519
Jiang Beimo drugged me last night.

179
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,639
He was clearly trying to drive a wedge
between you and me.

180
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,360
He went to great lengths just for this?

181
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,080
You're overestimating yourself.

182
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,120
Mr. Baili, are you alright?

183
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,159
No need to go after him.

184
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,480
Someone has to tell them

185
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
who their opponent is.

186
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,240
Is this the Top Martial Arts Master
in Nanyuan?

187
