=Episode 3=

2
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,799
September 19th, maintain the house.

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,560
September 20th, bake potatoes.

4
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,719
September 21st, practice calligraphy
and play the instrument.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,119
September 22nd, clean the birdcage.

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,479
(King Nanyuan/Chancellor Li)
Chancellor Li.

7
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,520
In my opinion,

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,960
this hostage Baili really
harbors no ulterior motives,

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,240
and he has Su Nanyan by his side.

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,479
Maybe

11
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,200
we should remove those
who are monitoring him.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,880
Your Majesty.

13
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,119
Your Majesty.

14
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,679
The hostage has a special status.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,560
It's still wise to be cautious.

16
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:07,328
(Baixiang Mansion)

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,200
Thank the Chancellor for me.

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,640
Mr. Baili.

19
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,280
Why do I think that Chancellor
is not trying to save you

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,359
even he delivers medicine
to you every day?

21
00:01:42,592 --> 00:01:43,200
Instead...

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,359
So many years have passed,

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,920
it wouldn't make a difference.

24
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,239
It's better not make any more trouble.

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,680
Mr. Baili.

26
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,200
There's one more thing.

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,439
I wonder...

28
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,200
Go ahead.

29
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,640
Miss Su likes Jiang Beimo, right?

30
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,200
Why did she suddenly curse him yesterday

31
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,480
and in public with you...?

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,439
In that case,

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,240
why is she avoiding you today?

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,439
I knew I shouldn't say it.

35
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,280
But I am still curious.

36
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:17,840
She...

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,479
Where is she?

38
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,039
She has been in the room all along.

39
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:34,800
Su Nanyan.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,520
Su Nanyan.

41
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,800
Then I'll get this straight.

42
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,680
In here,

43
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,879
you can do whatever you're supposed to.

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,319
Except that,

45
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,800
don't interfere with my life

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
by doing something unnecessary.

47
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,120
Save me.

48
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,319
Save me.

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,960
Su Nanyan.

50
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,400
Miss Su is all right.

51
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,199
After a short rest, she will wake up.

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,400
Thank you.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,840
Mr. Baili, let me take your pulse.

54
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,280
No need.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,199
Thank you.

56
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,280
Your condition was still manageable.

57
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:58,039
But after that misdiagnosis a year ago,

58
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,120
you got worse.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,479
But I can do nothing with it.

60
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,199
I am truly ashamed.

61
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,599
Sir, it's not your fault.

62
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,680
The misdiagnosis is all because of me.

63
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
It has nothing to do with you.

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,000
May I know

65
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,759
if you know any trace
of that swindler recently?

66
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,879
Sir, we have been searching him,

67
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,519
yet we still haven't found him.

68
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,600
In this world, those who did evil
will surely get their retribution.

69
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,639
Take care.

70
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,040
Anything unusual
at the mansion yesterday?

71
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,120
Mr. Baili, nothing.

72
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:42,839
Besides,

73
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,800
everyone said

74
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,560
General Su's daughter, Su Nanyan,

75
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,120
is the top master of Nanyuan Country.

76
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,279
How could anyone possibly hurt her?

77
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,199
What are you doing?

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,720
Mr. Baili.

79
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,279
The Su Nanyan's slap
is indeed extraordinary.

80
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,240
Go investigate Su Nanyan again

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,519
to see if she has ever worked
as a physician.

82
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,560
Mr. Baili.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,519
She has lived in the mansion
since childhood.

84
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,199
She can't be that person.

85
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,399
They all have a Double Blossom Mirror
at their waists,

86
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,639
and their hands are as hot as fire.

87
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Definitely not
the hands of an ordinary person.

88
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,879
This surely is no coincidence.

89
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,120
Go check it again.

90
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,879
He looks frail and delicate.

91
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,879
Why does he always think of
taking advantage of me?

92
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,240
Miss Su.

93
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,399
Have some tea.

94
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,639
No, thanks.

95
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,399
Why don't you get me something to eat?

96
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,464
Yes.

97
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,680
Where do you want to go this time?

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,800
You! You rake!

99
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,800
Stay away from me.

100
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,800
I saved you,

101
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,160
yet you don't even thank you?

102
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,199
You saved me?

103
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,079
Do you know that someone
in your mansion wants to hurt me?

104
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,439
You, the top master of Nanyuan Nation,

105
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,759
could someone want to hurt you?

106
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,000
The top master of Nanyuan Nation?

107
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,319
No wonder they are all afraid of me.

108
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,600
You humiliated me
in front of the guests yesterday.

109
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,959
I thought

110
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,439
you were feeling guilty
and committed suicide as an apology.

111
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,168
Pah!

112
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,600
The one who should be feeling guilty
is Jiang Beimo.

113
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,519
Yesterday I was just trying
to expose his true colors.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,600
Yesterday I...

115
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,160
I...

116
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,879
Right.

117
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,439
Wasn't I scolding him yesterday?

118
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,000
(But)

119
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,439
(why can't I remember
what happened last night?)

120
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,319
Su Nanyan.

121
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,839
The reason I agreed to marry you

122
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,839
is that I didn't want
to offend King of Nanyuan.

123
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,839
You'd better behave.

124
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,600
Let's do what we are supposed to do.

125
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,240
Don't create any more trouble.

126
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,304
Oh.

127
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,680
Is the mirror at your waist yours?

128
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:53,952
Forget it.

129
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,160
I don't trust you.

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,439
Mr. Baili, I heard something

131
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,079
might be related
to the mirror you mentioned.

132
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
It is said that Su Nanyan
was suffering from a serious illness,

133
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,399
and could not live past twenty.

134
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,759
But before she married you,

135
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,759
this illness suddenly got better.

136
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,600
She cured it herself?

137
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,519
Then,

138
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,240
it was her who cured it?

139
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,399
I have brought the person
who cured Su Nanyan.

140
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,759
You are...

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,759
Greetings.

142
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,000
Did you cure Su Nanyan's illness?

143
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,240
No, no.

144
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,519
I was just talking nonsense.

145
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,080
That's not what you said just now.

146
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,919
I got drunk just now,

147
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,000
but I am sobered up now.

148
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,519
Are you telling the truth?

149
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,600
Yes, I promise.

150
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,279
How dare you!

151
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,360
Do you know even the current King

152
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,159
favors Mr. Baili well?

153
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,120
If you dare to lie to him,

154
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,440
I'll make you die brutally.

155
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,519
I wouldn't dare.

156
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,559
Please spare my life.

157
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,879
What do you want to know?

158
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,519
I will tell you everything.

159
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,320
This is becoming
more and more mysterious.

160
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,952
No way.

161
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,919
I must find my body

162
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,720
and escape from here.

163
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,240
Miss Su, Mr. Baili wants to see you.

164
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,080
Mr. Baili, Miss Su is here.

165
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,480
Su Nanyan.

166
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,360
I'll give you one last chance.

167
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,720
You must tell me the truth.

168
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,600
What truth? Tell me more.

169
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,320
You've been seriously ill
since childhood.

170
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,919
The imperial physician predicted
you wouldn't live past twenty.

171
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,200
Yes or no?

172
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,000
But before you and I got married,

173
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,159
this illness was cured.

174
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,639
Yes or no?

175
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,360
What do you mean?

176
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,759
You got cured
because you took a medicine.

177
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,120
Yes or no?

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,240
Do you know
what this medicine was made of?

179
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,720
The blood of a living person.

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,704
Come on.

181
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,440
Repeat what you

182
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,759
just told me.

183
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,000
That day,

184
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,879
I heard
that Miss Su had a strange illness.

185
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,919
But after seeing her that I knew

186
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,440
that this strange illness required

187
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,559
the blood of a person
with the identical birth date and time

188
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,440
as the core ingredient

189
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,519
for the medicine.

190
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,320
I told General Su Mu about it,

191
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,480
but the general said

192
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,759
that this was
an unorthodox and improper method

193
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,639
and kicked me out of there.

194
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,519
A few days later,

195
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,519
a man with a masked face

196
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,960
came to me with a girl,

197
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,240
saying

198
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,720
this girl had
the same birth date and time

199
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,799
as the general's daughter, Su Nanyan.

200
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:33,600
So I used the girl's blood

201
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,879
as the core ingredient.

202
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,440
Do you still remember

203
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,320
that woman's birth time and date?

204
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,279
That woman and you both were born

205
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
on Xin Chou,

206
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,519
- Xin Mao, Xin Hai,
- Xin Mao, Xin Hai...

207
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,279
and...

208
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,279
Ren Chen.

209
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,320
Why do you have this mirror?

210
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,519
Isn't this from that girl?

211
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,519
Where is Zhao Qingqing?

212
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,639
Where is she now?

213
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:06,440
Zhao Qingqing?

214
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,360
Who is Zhao Qingqing?

215
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,480
She is the girl you mentioned,

216
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,519
with the Double Blossom Mirror.

217
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,144
This...

218
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,159
This...

219
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:15,799
Tell us now.

220
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,240
I'll tell you.

221
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,639
That girl...

222
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,879
That girl's corpse

223
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,000
has been thrown off the cliff long ago.

224
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,759
What did you say?

225
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,799
After that girl's blood was taken,

226
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,159
she was thrown off the cliff
by a masked person.

227
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,440
Now her corpse is probably
already eaten by birds and beasts.

228
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,559
When that girl was brought
by the masked person,

229
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,039
she was already dead.

230
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,879
I didn't kill her.

231
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,360
What about that masked person?

232
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,799
I don't know.

233
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,039
Well...

234
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,159
After then,

235
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,320
I never saw him again.

236
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,559
Su Nanyan.

237
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,039
What do you want to say?

238
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,159
Let's go to the yamen.

239
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,080
Let's go.

240
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,080
Well...

241
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,000
Su Nanyan.

242
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,696
Mr. Baili.

243
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,120
Su Nanyan just said

244
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,519
to go to the yamen herself.

245
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:17,559
Mr. Baili.

246
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,600
Before the matter is cleared up,

247
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,759
you are not in a position
to get too involved.

248
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,320
We will be returning to Dongque soon.

249
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,840
You'd better stay away from the trouble.

250
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,600
But that is...

251
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,480
I understand, Mr. Baili.

252
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,960
Trust me.

253
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,639
I will definitely
get to the bottom of this.
