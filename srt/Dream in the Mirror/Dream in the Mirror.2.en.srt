=Dream in the Mirror=
=Episode 2=

2
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,119
What's wrong, Yan?

3
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,520
Did I scare you?

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,240
It's okay. It's okay.

5
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,119
Don't be afraid.

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,159
Don't be afraid.

7
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,520
- Let go of me!
- Don't be afraid.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,584
Someone!

9
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,840
Take her away.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,599
Open the door.

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,000
You've mistaken me for someone else.

12
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,040
Let me out. Let me out.

13
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,480
(What's going on?)

14
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,280
(Did this mirror)

15
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,359
(take me into this body?)

16
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,640
(Who do you say I am?)

17
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,400
You are Su Nanyan,

18
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,480
the one I love the most.

19
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,759
Su Nanyan?

20
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,759
Adulterers.

21
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,080
No way.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,360
I must find a way to locate my body.

23
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,280
Mr. Baili.

24
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,439
What's wrong

25
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,800
with Su Nanyan today?

26
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,479
She's

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,840
not taking us seriously at all.

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,199
I'm a hostage.

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,800
She is the general's daughter.

30
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,360
It's normal that she doesn't

31
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:48,800
take me seriously.

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,680
We've been in Nanyuan Nation
for so many years,

33
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,199
being trampled upon all the time.

34
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,879
How can you bear all this?

35
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:58,439
I just want to leave Nanyuan alive.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Our return date is approaching.

37
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,719
At this critical moment,
the King of Nanyuan

38
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,240
insists on betrothing
the general's daughter to me.

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,520
He must have another purpose.

40
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,759
All these years, he doesn't allow you
to practice martial arts.

41
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,759
Before we leave,

42
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,199
he still wants to plant a spy?

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,599
By the way,

44
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,400
why don't we use what just happened

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,759
(A poem)
to call off this marriage?

46
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,120
Only by marrying Su Nanyan,

47
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,919
can I live a bit more comfortably
in Nanyuan.

48
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,520
That's true.

49
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,919
Now the King of Dongque
only has you as the heir.

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,479
After your return to Dongque
to inherit the throne,

51
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,879
Su Nanyan will be at our disposal.

52
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,759
Who says I'm going back
to inherit the throne?

53
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,840
It's just from one cage

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,240
to another.

55
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,719
Don't even know if I can get a chance

56
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,719
to see the place she mentioned,
which is beyond this world.

57
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,599
Let's go.

58
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,400
Well,

59
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,479
where to?

60
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,159
To meet the guests in the front hall.

61
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,280
(The nearer to home, the more timid,
not daring to ask about the visitors.)

62
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,160
Where are you going?

63
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,360
I...

64
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,759
Have you forgotten

65
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,160
what you promised me?

66
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,199
Now you've changed your mind

67
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,120
to embarrass me?

68
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,399
I said I'm not...

69
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,759
What responsibility do you have

70
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,879
for marrying Baili Jingxing?

71
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,720
You know it very well.

72
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,920
Don't let me down.

73
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,560
(A wise man knows when to retreat.)

74
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,360
(Find a way to calm him down first.)

75
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,439
(Then I'll look for an opportunity
to escape.)

76
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,319
Father, I know I was wrong.

77
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,639
I'll apologize to you.

78
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,480
Then hurry to Baili's Mansion with me

79
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,639
and apologize to Mr. Baili?

80
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,000
Then what are we waiting for?

81
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,759
Let's go. Don't keep my husband waiting.

82
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,240
Go, let's go.

83
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,279
I heard that Miss Su went
to Jiang Beimo's Mansion

84
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,240
right after her wedding.

85
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,600
One is the newly crowned top scholar,

86
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,800
while the other is a hostage who only
knows how to attend to flowers.

87
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,399
If you were her,
which one would you choose?

88
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,639
As I say, Baili's Mansion

89
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,879
is really quite rough.

90
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,959
- It's far inferior compared to my palace.
- Mr. Baili has arrived.

91
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,800
- Mr. Baili has arrived.
- Stop it.

92
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,519
Stop talking first.

93
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,399
Mr. Baili.

94
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,800
Your Highness.

95
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,240
Mr. Baili.

96
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,279
Your house is full of empty birdcages.

97
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,160
Where have all the birds gone?

98
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,079
I like...

99
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,519
I get it.

100
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,399
Have they all flown
to someone else's home?

101
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,800
I'm back.

102
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,879
She's back?

103
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,720
General.

104
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,160
- General.
- General Su.

105
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,079
You better come up with a method

106
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,160
to make amends
for the rudeness just now.

107
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,079
Otherwise, don't even think
about leaving here.

108
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,399
Don't worry.

109
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,279
Sorry about this.

110
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,000
This...

111
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,959
This...

112
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,519
(Anyway, it's not my mouth.)

113
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,639
Miss Su is so...

114
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,240
The newly crowned top scholar,
Jiang Beimo, has arrived.

115
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,800
The top scholar is here.

116
00:07:00,096 --> 00:07:00,720
The top scholar is here.

117
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,560
Mr. Baili.

118
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,800
I am here to offer congratulations.

119
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,839
Unfaithful man!

120
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,079
You still have the nerve to come here?

121
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,920
Miss Su,

122
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,839
I don't get it. You...

123
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,560
Pah!

124
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,680
I was so blind in the past

125
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,360
that I believed you.

126
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,000
Everyone at present,

127
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,839
open your eyes wide
and take a close look.

128
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,759
This top scholar, Jiang Beimo,

129
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,160
has a betrothal
to his childhood sweetheart.

130
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,959
Yet he...

131
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,800
He tried to have an affair with me.

132
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:36,439
What?

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,439
What is their relationship?

134
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,240
Be careful with fire
in such dry weather.

135
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,040
(Night)
Be careful with fire in such dry weather.

136
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:14,944
(Luoying Pavilion)

137
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,040
My master has already heard

138
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,040
about what happened
at Baili's Mansion today.

139
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,560
Even the Su family looks down on you.

140
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,920
On what basis do you think

141
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,879
my master will take you
under his command?

142
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,159
I know well that one can't serve
two masters.

143
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,720
The master is way out of my league.

144
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,679
It's quite bold of me
to seek a chance to meet him.

145
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,840
Good that you know it.

146
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,639
A mere top scholar

147
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,080
dares to cling to my master?

148
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,440
Get out of here now.

149
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,480
I have a way to solve the problem
that bothers the master.

150
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:52,928
Stop.

151
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,000
My master said

152
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,960
he couldn't hear you.

153
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,840
I have a plan

154
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,440
to solve the problem
that bothers the master.

155
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:44,704
(The Next Day)

156
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,759
