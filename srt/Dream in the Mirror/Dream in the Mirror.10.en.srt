=Episode 10=

2
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,119
Mr. Chancellor.

3
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,799
What happened to Divine Ximen...

4
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,799
It was my doing.

5
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,280
Do you know,

6
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,119
what it means

7
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,399
once it's revealed?

8
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,719
All that I have done

9
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:00,920
is for you, Mr. Chancellor.

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,439
Well.

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,280
Want to involve me in as well?

12
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,560
I wouldn't dare.

13
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,159
We failed to
assassinate the hostage prince twice.

14
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,560
Both because
we underestimated Su Nanyan.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,959
But now

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,159
she is imprisoned in that cell,

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,400
in danger herself.

18
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,079
With such little tricks,

19
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,640
can you frame Su Nanyan?

20
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,719
Solely on my own,

21
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,439
I certainly cannot do this.

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,799
But I heard

23
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,120
that His Majesty

24
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,439
has entrusted Chancellor with this case.

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,879
As long as Chancellor delays this case
till tomorrow,

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,599
without Su Nanyan in Baili's Mansion,

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,239
Baili Jingxing will meet his end
tonight.

28
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,439
Don't you

29
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,680
care about your beloved Su Nanyan?

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,239
After today, she might no longer exist.

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,920
Beimo will be happier

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,439
if General's Mansion no longer exist

33
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,400
after tonight.

34
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,360
Mozhu,

35
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,000
how long have you been working
for Mr. Chancellor?

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,960
None of your business.

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,080
Do not think that little tricks

38
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,960
are enough to gain Chancellor's trust.

39
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,439
You're in no position to talk to me.

40
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,759
Hurry, hurry. Open the door.

41
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,879
What's going on?

42
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,879
It's poisoned.

43
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,159
How could this be?

44
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,560
What should we do?

45
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,960
Should we send her to the clinic now?

46
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,120
But...

47
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,759
Didn't you say

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,319
she is General Su Mu's daughter?

49
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,840
If she were to die here,

50
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,719
do you think we can live on?

51
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,240
Quick, quick.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,639
Come on.

53
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,319
Slow.

54
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,520
Careful.

55
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,479
Miss Su, when did you start

56
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,240
to use these filthy tricks?

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,400
You look like an old friend of mine.

58
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,840
Mr. Baili, this is
the assassin of last night.

59
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,879
What are we doing here?

60
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,319
Aren't we going to
investigate the death of Divine Ximen?

61
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,199
Be careful with fire
in such dry weather.

62
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,800
Miss,

63
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,560
don't blame us.

64
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,560
If you confess,

65
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,480
you will not go through the torment.

66
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:05,879
Mr. Baili, be careful.

67
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,800
Si, how are you?

68
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm fine.

69
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,079
Go save Mr. Baili.

70
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,560
You know martial arts.

71
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,319
I'm sorry, then.

72
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,959
Mr. Baili. Mr. Baili.

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,319
Mr. Baili.

74
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,040
If you dare tell Su Mu,

75
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,319
I will definitely not spare you.

76
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,079
Mr. Baili.

77
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,079
Mr. Baili.

78
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,399
Mr. Baili.

79
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,000
Mr. Baili.

80
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,839
Are you okay?

81
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,759
Thankfully, Nanyan arrived in time.

82
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,200
I'm fine.

83
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,560
Yan.

84
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,639
What are you doing here?

85
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,480
Aren't you locked in the death cell?

86
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,120
I'm worried about Mr. Baili's safety.

87
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,639
So I broke out of the cell.

88
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,319
His Majesty has asked Chancellor

89
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,879
to investigate the case of Divine Ximen.

90
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,319
Your escape

91
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,639
may make it harder to clear your name.

92
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,680
Right.

93
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,040
Tell me what happened last night.

94
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,079
Father, last night I...

95
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
I went to check on Si.

96
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,824
Okay.

97
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,920
When I arrived at Divine Ximen's home,

98
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,639
I found him dead inside.

99
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,199
Then, I was hit
by the mesmerizing incense.

100
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,519
It seems like

101
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,199
there is someone behind this.

102
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,199
Even the assassin tonight

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,600
must be arranged by the same person.

104
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,279
It's just that Divine Ximen died.

105
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,639
No one can prove
that Jiang Beimo is the murderer.

106
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,399
Yan,

107
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,040
are you really going to
continue the investigation?

108
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,488
Father.

109
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,639
Zhao Qingqing got involved

110
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
ultimately because of me.

111
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,600
I should look into it.

112
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,959
Tonight, I will assign more people
in the Mansion.

113
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,959
I'm afraid tomorrow will be tougher.

114
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,519
Thank you, father.

115
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,360
Eavesdropping isn't good, is it?

116
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,519
Do you know that a hostage
should not practice martial arts?

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,840
Why do you help me?

118
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,960
Why do you practice martial arts?

119
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,440
Do you have other agenda
about Nanyuan Nation?

120
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,960
I'm not interested in governance.

121
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,639
Martial arts are just to kill time.

122
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,320
I only want to leave this place.

123
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
And be an ordinary person.

124
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,559
This is a hostage from Dongque.

125
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,200
His father-king
doesn't want him anymore.

126
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,120
Let's go. Do not play with him.

127
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,320
Miss Su might want to think about

128
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,720
who's trying to kill me all along.

129
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,120
I'm afraid this person

130
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,200
has hidden agenda about Nanyuan Nation.

131
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,960
You suspect?

132
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,320
Jiang Beimo.

133
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,960
But surely not just him.

134
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,879
The person behind this,

135
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,039
I cannot make rash conclusions yet.

136
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,919
So the best way right now

137
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,039
is that we cooperate.

138
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,600
This person can send me
to the death cell.

139
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,960
He must have quite some influence
in the court.

140
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,519
Now that you can protect yourself,

141
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,039
I can better focus on
the matter of Zhao Qingqing.

142
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,159
You heard it.

143
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
I didn't kill the person.

144
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,279
Someone wants to frame me.

145
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,320
The matter of Zhao Qingqing

146
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,039
truly has nothing to do with you?

147
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,840
Before that,

148
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,679
answer me a question first.

149
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,919
Why do you care so much
about Zhao Qingqing?

150
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,080
Now, I am asking.

151
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,120
Your answer

152
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,399
decides my answer.

153
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,159
She saved my life.

154
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,519
She gave me this.

155
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,519
She said this red string

156
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,120
could take me to a place
beyond this world.

157
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,200
I know she might just be deceiving me.

158
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,399
But I choose to believe her.

159
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,840
She kept me going this far.

160
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:32,799
Like this?

161
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,679
Looks like

162
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,799
the covenant of two

163
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,440
is turning into a covenant of three.

164
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,879
Zhao Qingqing you've been thinking about

165
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,759
