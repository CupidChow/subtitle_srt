2
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,280
Be careful with fire
in such dry weather.

3
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,200
Mr. Baili.

4
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:47,799
What's up?

5
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,359
Miss Su.

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,200
You're back.

7
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,159
You and Zhao Qingqing...

8
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,399
I'm sorry, Miss Su.

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,200
Well,

10
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,760
sorry to disturb you.

11
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,879
But you need to understand

12
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,760
she's now

13
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,879
using my body.

14
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,879
A big credit this time!

15
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,879
Master.

16
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,040
We may have a chubby grandson next year.

17
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,680
So soon?

18
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,519
The hostage has always been
physically frail.

19
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,959
Father. Mother.

20
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,000
You're here.

21
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,680
You...

22
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,480
Why are you here?

23
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,719
Father.

24
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,759
I know

25
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,439
I have a mission with this marriage.

26
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,000
I dare not forget it at any time.

27
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,840
Actually,

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,080
you can forget it occasionally.

29
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,879
General. Madam.

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,920
Miss Su.

31
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,232
Father.

32
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,240
Please assign extra hands
on the Flower Festival.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,240
Help me protect Mr. Baili's safety.

34
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,520
Okay.

35
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,879
Then, thank you.

36
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,199
Thank you, Miss Su.

37
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
Then, I will take my leave.

38
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:06,199
(If the two of you have offspring,
what shall I do)

39
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,560
(If the two of you have kids,)

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,759
(what should I do?)

41
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,400
Why aren't you practicing martial arts?

42
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,520
Su Nanyan left a letter

43
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,039
telling me General's protection plan.

44
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,800
So I won't be needed.

45
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,319
This letter that Su Nanyan left you

46
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,039
mentioned only this?

47
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,759
Nothing else?

48
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,120
Nope.

49
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,280
Nothing else.

50
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,159
Mr. Baili.

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,280
This Flower Festival,

52
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,400
Chancellor suggests public mask-wearing.

53
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,199
It seems they are planning a move
during the Flower Festival.

54
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,240
After all, this is their last chance.

55
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,199
Go and tell General Su about this now.

56
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:00,896
Yes.

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,719
This Flower Festival

58
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,159
should be during the day.

59
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,520
I can only rely on General Su now.

60
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,399
What do you mean?

61
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,920
You think little of me, huh?

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,800
Don't go.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,839
Stop right there.

64
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,759
Caught you.

65
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,759
Give it to me.

66
00:04:48,627 --> 00:04:51,712
(Flower Festival)

67
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,079
Bravo. Bravo.

68
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,319
Bravo.

69
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,160
Bravo.

70
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,000
Bravo.

71
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,079
One more.

72
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,319
Didn't the general say

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,920
that he would meet with us here at noon?

74
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,399
That's right.

75
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,920
Why isn't he here yet?

76
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,360
No mishaps, I hope.

77
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:15,840
Mr. Baili.

78
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,759
Shall I go to the General's Mansion
to see what's going on?

79
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,680
Bravo.

80
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,519
Impressive.

81
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,879
Bravo, one more.

82
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,360
That is...

83
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,079
Bravo. Bravo.

84
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,680
Mr. Chancellor, keep calm.

85
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,560
How can I keep calm?

86
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,199
Assassination like this?

87
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:47,560
Not to mention the increased security
on the streets out of nowhere.

88
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,120
What if something goes wrong?

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,199
If King of Nanyuan finds out

90
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,759
I intend to assassinate the hostage,

91
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,360
what should I do?

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,040
In my opinion,

93
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,519
today is the best timing
to assassinate the hostage.

94
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,079
Once the hostage dies,

95
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,439
the general will be surely be offended.

96
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,480
But the death of the hostage

97
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,879
is a matter involving
bilateral diplomatic relations.

98
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,120
Can Mr. Chancellor really
get away with it unscathed?

99
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,519
If in front of His Majesty,

100
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,519
we force him to show his martial arts.

101
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,439
Mr. Chancellor could even be credited.

102
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,040
While General Su will be

103
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,720
accused of the crime of sheltering
the hostage's martial practice

104
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,879
and treason.

105
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,959
Wouldn't this be better?

106
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:41,408
(Nanyuan)

107
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:45,920
General.

108
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:47,584
It is the Flower Festival.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,959
All are inside the city.

110
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,079
Why do we guard the city here?

111
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,480
Right, General.

112
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,079
If Mr. Chancellor takes action,

113
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,560
how about the hostage and the Miss?

114
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,279
Mr. Baili.

115
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,200
The General's Mansion is empty.

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,480
The General's Mansion is empty?

117
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,500
Did they say where they went?

118
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,680
No idea.

119
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,399
They disappeared suddenly.

120
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,120
What should we do?

121
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,959
His Majesty is here.

122
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,759
They wouldn't

123
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,300
take action in front of His Majesty.

124
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,480
His Majesty is here.

125
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,439
It's more attractive to them.

126
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,560
I cannot show martial arts.

127
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,439
No, Mr. Baili.

128
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,879
The three of us

129
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,519
all count on me?

130
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,480
Bravo. Bravo.

131
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,639
One more.

132
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,800
Bravo. Bravo.

133
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,040
This move is awesome.

134
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,879
Look.

135
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,959
Really impressive.

136
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,800
Great. Great.

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,879
Bravo. Bravo.

138
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:48,960
Stop it.

139
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,519
Nobody moves.

140
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:01,720
Your Majesty.

141
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:02,799
(Flower Festival)

142
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,559
At this Flower Festival

143
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,919
celebrating the peace
between Dongque and Nanyuan,

144
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,600
the Dongque hostage broke the iron law

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,960
that hostages shall not
practice martial arts.

146
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,440
Everyone

147
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,799
saw it.

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,200
A hostage learns martial arts?

149
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,480
What if it leads

150
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:20,159
to a war?

151
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,000
Baili Jingxing.

152
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,799
Are you aware of the crime
for a hostage learning martial arts?

153
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,919
Guards, seize him.

154
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,536
This...

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,759
It's alright.

156
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,759
Your Majesty.

157
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:54,059
Assassinating the hostage
and General's daughter in the street.

158
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,039
What's the crime?

159
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,399
This...

160
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,599
I have been frequently assassinated.

161
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,499
These assassins will make a move
during the Flower Festival.

162
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,799
To protect peace,

163
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,440
I had to resort to this plan.

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,600
Jingxing.

165
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Do you know who wants to harm you?

166
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,200
Tell me.

167
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,559
I'll handle it for you.

168
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,399
Nanyan protected me from assassins

169
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,159
and found these assassins have the same

170
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
martial arts moves.

171
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,360
It must be the same person.

172
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,639
The person who framed me today

173
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
must be that assassin.

174
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,159
I did not believe it at first.

175
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,120
Mr. Chancellor is kind-hearted.

176
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:34,110
How could he do such things
that would destabilize the country?

177
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,120
I had to resort to this plan.

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,159
Risk myself

179
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,799
to capture this assassin in front of us.

180
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,120
Exactly.

181
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,639
This young man in black

182
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,000
is Mozhu from Chancellor's residence.

183
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,559
He assassinated me in the street.

184
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,720
Now he stands here brazenly
watching the show.

185
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,960
Waiting for his reward?

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,399
How dare you use the hostage?

187
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,799
Have you cared about the safety
of Nanyuan's people?

188
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,960
Your Majesty, spare me.

189
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,440
It's all him.

190
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,639
It's all the idea of Jiang Beimo.

191
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,240
Your Majesty.

192
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,799
