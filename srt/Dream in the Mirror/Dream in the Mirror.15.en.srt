2
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:50,880
Hand it over.

3
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,759
Hold it there.

4
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,200
Si, are you alright?

5
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,239
Sorry, so sorry.

6
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,239
Sorry.

7
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,168
Where're you?

8
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,079
Where're you?

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,640
Mr. Baili.

10
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,280
What happened again during the day?

11
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,599
I feel sore all over.

12
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,760
As if I've been beaten up.

13
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,000
But no wound.

14
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,319
The assassin switched to sticks
this time?

15
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,000
I taught Qingqing a few moves.

16
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,280
Then

17
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,879
how is she learning?

18
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
It turns out

19
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,120
that talent for martial arts
has nothing to do

20
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,040
with physical build.

21
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,960
Master, please take a rest.

22
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,919
It's so late at night. Still reading.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,960
Speaking of Chancellor Li.

24
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,759
To bring down our Su family,

25
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,400
he's even contemplating
murdering the hostage.

26
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,039
If the hostage really dies in Nanyuan,

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,840
the worst I can get is

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,120
the charge of failing
to protect the hostage.

29
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,919
But our two nations

30
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,520
will fall into endless wars.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,639
How can Chancellor Li be so muddled?

32
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,000
The King of Nanyuan is young and simple.

33
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,319
He's probably still held in the dark
by Chancellor Li.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,759
Such hard work for our Yan.

35
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,879
Being alert everyday with the hostage.

36
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,080
As I see,

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,199
this hostage Baili

38
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,280
truly likes our Yan.

39
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,240
But I heard from Caiwei

40
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,479
that they haven't slept together.

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,520
Is it true?

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,319
Indeed it is.

43
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,479
No way.

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,120
Tomorrow, come with me
to Baili's Mansion.

45
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,439
We will have a good talk with them.

46
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:21,248
(Baili's Mansion)

47
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,439
Come on.

48
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,719
Watch this.

49
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,120
Be careful.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,479
What are you two doing?

51
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,800
Mr. Baili,

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,439
the General and his wife are here.

53
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,144
General.

54
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,040
This is?

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,319
It's better to make some preparations
in advance.

56
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,360
Yes indeed.

57
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,000
Does Mr. Baili have some complaints

58
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,560
about our daughter?

59
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,560
No, no.

60
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,959
I heard that
you still sleep in separate rooms.

61
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,959
What happens at night

62
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,480
is not my decision.

63
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,399
Then it seems

64
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,319
there's some problem with Mr. Baili.

65
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,279
No.

66
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,639
I have no problem.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,839
This is the fine wine I happened to find

68
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,639
when traveling in the Northern Desert.

69
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,439
Today,

70
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,959
we gather together.

71
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,160
Let's have a drink.

72
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:11,872
How about it?

73
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,040
Be careful.

74
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:21,959
Slow down.

75
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,720
My Lady.

76
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,360
Do you know the wonder
of this wine from the Northern Desert?

77
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,680
It can make people speak the truth.

78
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,000
Baili Jingxing.

79
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,240
You are truly good-looking.

80
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,319
General.

81
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
What are you looking at?

82
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,360
Don't disturb them.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
General, actually,

84
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,000
I can read lips.

85
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,079
Come on, hurry.

86
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,120
Quickly, quick.

87
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,560
You are much better-looking

88
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,560
than Jiang Beimo.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,624
Right.

90
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,920
Much better-looking than Jiang Beimo.

91
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,800
If I hadn't grown up

92
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,399
knowing only one guy, Jiang Beimo,

93
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,759
how could I have been tricked by him?

94
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,839
Tell me.

95
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,480
Why didn't we meet earlier?

96
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,439
Actually,

97
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,319
we knew each other long ago.

98
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,160
Mr. Baili says,

99
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,279
I have long been in love with you.

100
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,639
Why are you keeping a distance from me?

101
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,759
You are the future king of Dongque.

102
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,639
Even if we had met earlier,

103
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,560
it's impossible for you

104
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,120
to stay with me, Zhao Qingqing.

105
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,560
Mrs. Baili says,

106
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,279
"Stop talking.
I'm also in love with you".

107
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,040
We can stay together day and night here

108
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,439
just because

109
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,976
I...

110
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,959
I take the body of Su Nanyan.

111
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,240
I thought

112
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,439
I could find out the cause of my death.

113
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,120
But I...

114
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,079
I see that murderer Jiang Beimo

115
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,360
is right before my eyes.

116
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,360
Yet I can't do anything to him.

117
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm so useless.

118
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,600
What are they talking about?
Why this atmosphere now?

119
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,240
This is playing hard-to-get.

120
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,279
According to my experience,

121
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,759
it's settled.

122
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,840
Settled.

123
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,320
Settled.

124
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,440
Kid.

125
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,399
Let's go.

126
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,480
Come on, let's go.

127
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,240
I will definitely uproot both him

128
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,000
and Chancellor.

129
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,320
You're already so difficult

130
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,720
but you need to help me.

131
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,039
I can't do anything right.

132
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,600
At night, Su Nanyan can protect you
with her martial arts.

133
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,080
But during the day,

134
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,960
I am just useless.

135
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,120
So useless I am.

136
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,240
So useless!

137
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,200
Zhao Qingqing.

138
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,840
You saved me.

139
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,039
Stop comforting me.

140
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,879

141
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,879

143
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,480
I'm waiting for you.

144

I don't even know if this is real.

150

of the Floating Sea Market deceived me.
