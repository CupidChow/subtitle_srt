00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:32,768
=Dream in the Mirror=
=Episode 11=

2
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,679
A bunch of trash.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,960
The three of you

4
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,119
can't even keep a single person.

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,856
My lord,

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,240
the assassins sent tonight

7
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,799
would never return.

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,679
What?

9
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,960
None of our people have come back?

10
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:52,840
None.

11
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,280
This is impossible.

12
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:03,159
Even if Su Nanyan had wings,

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,239
she couldn't have made it in time
to save Baili Jingxing.

14
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,159
Get out.

15
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:11,719
Get out.

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,239
All get out.

17
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:15,680
Off now!

18
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:47,640
Help!

19
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,480
I'm out?

20
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,040
Shouldn't I be in the death cell?

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,599
Where is the Double Blossom Mirror?

22
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,520
Oops.

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,080
Haven't I left it in the death cell.

24
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,599
Zhao Qingqing.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,560
What's up?

26
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,080
Encircle this place.

27
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,639
Don't let the murderer escape.

28
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:41,719
Yes sir.

29
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,199
Who dares!

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,039
General Su.

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,800
How dare you.

32
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,520
A mere county magistrate
dares to encircle this place.

33
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,159
I wouldn't dare.

34
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,719
It's just that the suspect in this case,
Su Nanyan

35
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,560
escaped from the cell last night.

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,199
Today the Chancellor
will interrogate the prisoner.

37
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,479
If I don't bring the person in,

38
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,120
I will face punishment.

39
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,120
So Su Nanyan told you everything.

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,879
I misunderstood her.

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,319
Anyway, the Double Blossom Mirror

42
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,080
gives me a chance to revenge.

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,080
I will never let Jiang Beimo off.

44
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,520
How can you be sure

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,080
that he killed you?

46
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,000
That core ingredient

47
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,280
requires the heart blood of a person

48
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,360
born on the same month and date
of the same year.

49
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,159
The only one who knows the birth date
of mine and Su Nanyan's

50
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,280
is Jiang Beimo.

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
Are you really Zhao Qingqing?

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,360
What do you mean by that?

53
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,840
Do we know each other?

54
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,479
Of course.

55
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,479
You treated me a year ago.

56
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,159
(Oh my.)

57
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,919
(I might have deceived him.)

58
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,719
(He's not here for revenge, is he?)

59
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,960
You might have mistaken me
for someone else.

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,120
How come I don't remember treating you?

61
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,800
I wouldn't.

62
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,280
Your hands are different.

63
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,520
Does this ring a bell?

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,439
A red string crossing a thousand miles.

65
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,039
A red string crossing a thousand miles.

66
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,400
A red string crossing a thousand miles.

67
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,279
I don't remember.

68
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,839
Mr. Chancellor has arrived.

69
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,160
How dare you.

70
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,160
Mr. Chancellor.

71
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,199
Mr. Chancellor.

72
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,879
The mansion of General Su's daughter

73
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,560
is not a place you can just barge into.

74
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,839
I wouldn't dare.

75
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,319
It's just that Su Nanyan

76
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,480
is a suspect in the Divine Ximen's case.

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,879
I am well aware

78
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,319
that you, Chancellor,
are tasked with the investigation.

79
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,839
So I wanted to take her back.

80
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,639
Mr. Chancellor.

81
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,879
Thankfully, my daughter returned
just in time last night.

82
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,879
Otherwise, the hostage prince
might have been murdered.

83
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,959
General Su, no need for more words.

84
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
The safety of the hostage prince
is of the utmost importance.

85
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,639
Nanyan did have her reasons.

86
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,560
Thank you, Mr. Chancellor.

87
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,879
However,

88
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,279
His Majesty tasked me with this case.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,920
I have to report back
to His Majesty today.

90
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,639
If my daughter is entrusted to you,
Mr. Chancellor,

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,360
I have no worry at all.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,519
Guards.

93
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,839
Ask the Miss out.

94
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,856
Yes sir.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,519
No need.

96
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,319
I'm here.

97
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,079
Since the Miss is here,

98
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,959
then shall we move?

99
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,199
Qingqing,

100
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,360
hide your identity.

101
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,920
I will find a way to save you.

102
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,439
My lord, please see
this through-and-through wound.

103
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,360
The same night,

104
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,480
Miss Su used the same sword.

105
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,839
The assassin's through-and-through wound

106
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,560
was stabbed diagonally
from left to right.

107
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,439
That of the Divine Ximen's, however,

108
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,639
was from right to left.

109
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,240
I see.

110
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,920
The assassin was killed by someone
wielding a sword with left hand.

111
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,839
Ximen, however, by someone
wielding a sword with right hand.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But Nanyan has unmatched martial skills.

113
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,720
She can wield a sword with either hand.

114
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,720
It proves nothing, right?

115
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,800
My lord,

116
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,879
Miss Su injured her right hand
the night before,

117
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,399
and was unable to wield a sword.

118
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,519
Correct.

119
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,079
A few days ago,
Miss Su injured her right hand

120
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,120
when playing with Mr. Baili.

121
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,959
If my lord does not believe it,

122
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,680
you may check it yourself.

123
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:47,959
Mr. Chancellor,

124
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,839
Su Nanyan's right arm is indeed injured.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,279
Not possible to wield a sword.

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,560
My lord, this...

127
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,279
I knew it.

128
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,360
How could Nanyan did this.

129
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,160
Since Nanyan has been proven innocent,

130
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,879
she is now dismissed.

131
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,319
I will report to His Majesty right away.

132
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,560
General Su, please rest assured.

133
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,800
I will not let the real culprit go free.

134
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,040
Thank you, Mr. Chancellor.

135
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:26,399
(Withdraw)

136
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,079
Mr. Chancellor.

137
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,000
As a hostage,

138
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,000
I shouldn't get involved in this.

139
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,439
But my wife's innocence

140
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,279
cannot be tarnished by anyone
with hidden agenda.

141
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,639
Otherwise,

142
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,480
I will show no mercy.

143
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,079
Let's go.

144
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,680
Thank you, Mr. Baili, for your help.

145
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,319
You're welcome, General Su.

146
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,656
Zhao...

147
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
She is now my wife.

148
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,519
It's my duty.

149
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,639
Then I won't disturb you any further.

150
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,920
I'm feeling more assured

151
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,879
with Nanyan being with you now.

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,799
Such a big meal!

153
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,399
Have however much you like.

154
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,799
When I was killing time in the mansion,

155
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,759
I enjoyed working on these dishes.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,879
Did you make all these?

157
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,360
Have a try.

158
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,759
What you spoke to Chancellor just now.

159
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,200
Are you truly in love with Su Nanyan?

160
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,440
Who I care,

161
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,360
can't you tell?

162
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,480
I can.

163
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,279
You're so nice to me.

164
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
Is there any deal between you and her?

165
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,120
Qingqing.

166
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,879
It's just that Divine Ximen died.

167
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,039
It's not that simple

168
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,759
to catch Jiang Beimo.

169
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,519
No worry.

170
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,519
It has caused an uproar here.

171
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,840
The case of you and Divine Ximen

172
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,679
will surely have a conclusion.

173
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,520
Go ahead.

174
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,000
Not only is Su Nanyan safe now.

175
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,679
The hostage is also unharmed.

176
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,600
Is this your plan?

177
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,279
Mr. Chancellor.

178
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,120
Give me one more chance.

179
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,240
I was so close...

180
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,000
so close to success.

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,120
Do you wish to drag me into this too?

182
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,679
Now Su Mu is pressing His Majesty.

183
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,840
Force me to thoroughly
investigate the case

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,240
of Divine Ximen and Zhao Qingqing.

185
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,879
You tell me what to do.

186
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,279
Mr. Chancellor, save me.

187
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,279
How?

188
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,759
They were married for just a few days.
