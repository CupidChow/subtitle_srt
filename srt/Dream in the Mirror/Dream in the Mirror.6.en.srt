=Episode 6=

2
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,200
Mr. Baili,

3
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,119
Su Nanyan is really strange.

4
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,560
First, she seduced you,

5
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,159
then ran away from the wedding,

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,759
and then spent the night
at her lover's home.

7
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:45,880
And now,

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,320
she risked her life to save you.

9
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,640
Is Su Nanyan

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,759
playing hard to get with you?

11
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,159
Mr. Baili.

12
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,560
Don't think I'll keep you here

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,000
just because you saved me.

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,000
Mr. Baili.

15
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,239
I admit

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,280
that my marriage to you was not
out of love.

17
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,920
Once the fifteen-year hostage
agreement is up,

18
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,000
someone will definitely
be targeting you.

19
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,719
I'm under His Majesty's order
to protect you.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,359
You're frank to me after all,

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,799
which makes me seem narrow-minded.

22
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:27,760
In this case,

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,200
once we return to Dongque,

24
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,959
I'll certainly set you free.

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,280
Now the assassins have taken action.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,760
This place won't be at peace
in the coming days.

27
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,159
You need to be careful.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,120
Let's not talk about that now.

29
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,680
I have something to ask you.

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,760
That deceased girl Zhao Qingqing

31
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,200
was really Jiang Beimo's
childhood sweetheart?

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,416
Yes.

33
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:53,680
I have long been aware

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,319
of the relationship
between Zhao Qingqing and Jiang Beimo.

35
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,840
I went to Dianmo Studio for this matter.

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,800
You just told me

37
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,000
that Jiang Beimo drugged you

38
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,199
to drive a wedge between you and me.

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,319
I'm a hostage.

40
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,960
You are the daughter of a general.

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,879
As a top scholar,

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,199
how could he have so much nerve?

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,879
What exactly is he after?

44
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,919
(Now the assassins have taken action.)

45
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,919
(If they find out Zhao Qingqing
owns the body during the day,)

46
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,080
(it will surely endanger the hostage.)

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,039
(No, I must join forces
with Zhao Qingqing.)

48
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,199
(Zhao Qingqing.)

49
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,840
(I didn't about the blood
of your heart.)

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,680
(I have long been aware
of your relationship with Jiang Beimo.)

51
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,159
(So I've never done anything with him.)

52
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,080
(If this was really done
by Jiang Beimo,)

53
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
(we still need evidence.)

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,800
(If you act rashly,)

55
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
(with your skills,)

56
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,560
(not only will you not be able
to avenge,)

57
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,039
(but you'll also implicate others.)

58
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,400
(How about this?)

59
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,120
(You and I should join forces.)

60
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,280
(I need you to gain his trust)

61
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,759
(and stay by his side.)

62
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,360
(Play my role well during the day,)

63
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,919
(and I'll investigate
what you want to know at night.)

64
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,960
(There is also one more thing
I need to remind you of.)

65
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,479
(Once the assassins)

66
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,479
(find out that Su Nanyan doesn't know
martial arts during the day,)

67
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,520
(both you and Baili Jingxing
will be in great danger.)

68
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,560
She did make a point.

69
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,240
How about

70
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,560
trusting her once?

71
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,800
How's the investigation
on last night's assassins going?

72
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,479
These people all seem to be
sworn retainers.

73
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,599
They would rather kill themselves

74
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,039
than divulge even a bit of information.

75
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,960
Looks like my place

76
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,840
is going to be drawn into the vortex.

77
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,120
Mr. Baili,

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,680
so you're giving Su Nanyan
so many things

79
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,800
to win her over

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,960
and have her protect you?

81
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,479
That's just one of the reasons.

82
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,719
The relationship between Su Nanyan
and Jiang Beimo

83
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,080
is really weird.

84
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,319
I always feel

85
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,280
that the key to unraveling the truth
of Zhao Qingqing's death

86
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,879
lies with Su Nanyan.

87
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,439
She wants to gain our trust.

88
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,040
So we'll use her instead.

89
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,680
It's Zhao Qingqing again.

90
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,560
This is?

91
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,839
Consider it as thanks
for saving my life last night.

92
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,360
Save your life?

93
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,879
What did I do last night?

94
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,600
I mean

95
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,399
I want to hear you say it again.

96
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,319
Miss Su, have you forgotten?

97
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,439
Last night,

98
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,319
a few assassins suddenly appeared

99
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,000
In times of danger,

100
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,199
you

101
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,560
descended from the sky,

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,399
like an invincible warrior,

103
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,639
used

104
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,120
your great martial arts skills,

105
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,759
and took all of them down.

106
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,519
In an instant,

107
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,839
petals flew into the garden

108
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,959
and solidified

109
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,199
into summer snowflakes.

110
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,639
She's so awesome?

111
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:45,879
What?

112
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,480
I mean,

113
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,399
I'm really awesome.

114
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:55,680
Right?

115
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,120
Miss Su, that's truly impressive.

116
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,639
(If Su Nanyan really is so impressive,)

117
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,199
(joining hands with her
might not be a bad thing.)

118
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,680
(Isn't it just about gaining
a man's trust)

119
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,360
(and pretending to be
the top martial arts master?)

120
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,439
(I'm good at this kind of thing.)

121
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,279
(If that Taoist priest was
telling the truth,)

122
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,680
(then this matter)

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,639
(must be done by Jiang Beimo.)

124
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,160
Right.

125
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,759
I forgot to tell her.

126
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,839
I'll chop you to death.

127
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,279
Chop you to death.

128
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,600
I'll chop you to death.

129
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,120
Chop you to death.

130
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,079
There's one more thing.

131
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,759
Today, His Majesty invited me
to bring you

132
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,800
to join the Floral Feast together.

133
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,680
Please go with me.

134
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,000
Floral Feast?

135
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,319
There must be a lot of delicious food.

136
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,199
No problem.

137
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,240
So this is where His Majesty lives?

138
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,879
I've never been here before.

139
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,759
As the general's daughter,
you've never been here?

140
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
I mean,

141
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,279
as your wife, it's the first time.

142
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,600
I heard she had an affair
with Jiang Beimo.

143
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,759
I've also heard about it.

144
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,759
Baili.

145
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,000
I want to eat that.

146
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,360
I want to eat that.

147
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:32,240
I didn't expect that
the Top Martial Arts Master in Nanyuan

148
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,159
would be so gentle

149
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,600
and lovely in private.

150
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,759
I didn't expect that the hostage

151
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,159
was still sponging off a woman
after getting married.

152
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,720
How can you say that?

153
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,000
What's wrong with being a hostage?

154
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,200
My husband loves me
and is willing to take care of me.

155
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
If you're envious, just say it.

156
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,080
Why are you being so sarcastic?

157
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,080
(Man,)

158
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,200

that you two are not getting along

169
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,320

170
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,320
I felt a bit annoyed before.

171
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,879

172
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,080

173

Your Majesty,
sorry for being impolite just now.

175
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,000
Just now, my wife was talking with me

176
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,360
about a play we watched last night.

177
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,360
Hope Your Majesty can forgive us.

178
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,600
Yes.

179
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,960
A play?

180
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,240
Today I have also prepared
a play for you.

181
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,384
Let's take a look.

182
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,120
