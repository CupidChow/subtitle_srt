00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:32,832
=Dream in the Mirror=
=Episode 8=

2
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,840
Mr. Jiang, here.

3
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,280
Report.

4
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,679
Mr. Jiang, an old Taoist
wants to see you.

5
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,479
Do you need to bother me for this?

6
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,840
Just send him away.

7
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,679
Useless.

8
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:03,759
Didn't you hear me?

9
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,000
He asked me to mention Zhao Qingqing,

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,400
and then you would definitely meet him.

11
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:13,504
(Baili's Mansion)

12
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,879
(Su Nanyan, I can join forces with you.)

13
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,799
Miss Su, Mr. Baili wants to see you.

14
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,680
Baili.

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,480
Why don't you speak?

16
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,000
In the day, you call me Baili,

17
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,599
while at night,

18
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,640
why do you call me Mr. Baili?

19
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,680
King of Nanyuan
has bestowed us the marriage,

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,519
so of course you are my Baili.

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,680
As for the night,

22
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,120
I am being shy.

23
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,000
Really?

24
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,199
Of course.

25
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,000
Now that we are married,

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,199
I shall certainly treat you well.

27
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,280
But you told me

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,599
that your marriage to me

29
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,080
was only to protect me,
the hostage from Dongque,

30
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,319
and not out of affection.

31
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,479
You said this just yesterday,

32
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,199
and now have you forgotten?

33
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,240
H-How could I have?

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,520
I mean,

35
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,680
I must protect you well.

36
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,960
You are now in mortal danger.

37
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,280
There's no time to talk about affection.

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,879
Am I right?

39
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,759
Then you better think it carefully.

40
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,639
Now I'm being targeted by assassins

41
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,919
surrounded by dangers.

42
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,400
Well...

43
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,919
No assassins during the day, right?

44
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,240
They don't have the guts

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,479
to come here in broad daylight

46
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,960
and assassinate me.

47
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,560
Besides, my wife is the top master.

48
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:26,159
They should not dare to come.

49
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,000
Of course.

50
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,599
Even if they dare to come,

51
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,639
I will not spare a single one.

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,840
What's wrong?

53
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,879
It's okay.

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,879
Didn't you say to protect me?

55
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
As a grown man,

56
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
you should protect me.

57
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,576
You!

58
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,319
Mr. Baili.

59
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,520
She did a pretty good job

60
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,240
grabbing you back there.

61
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,400
Does it count as knowing martial arts?

62
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,720
Su Nanyan.

63
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,920
Where did you learn
your martial arts from?

64
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,839
I've seen you make moves.

65
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,399
But the techniques you used
seem to be of two different styles.

66
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,560
Well...

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,439
Speaking of it,

68
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,839
I have a long story to tell.

69
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,319
I started learning
from a Shaolin elder at three,

70
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,480
mastered
the Nine Yin Scriptures at five,

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,959
and comprehended
the Great Compassion Mantra at eight.

72
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,959
At twelve, a Bodhisattva
came to me in a dream.

73
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Upon waking,
I had attained an indestructible body.

74
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,360
My martial arts techniques
are unfathomable.

75
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,199
You don't know martial arts,

76
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,120
of course, you couldn't tell.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,560
What?

78
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,399
Don't you believe me?

79
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,839
No.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,800
You saw how that strongman lost

81
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,040
to me.

82
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,399
I had already seen through
his moves at that time.

83
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
I did my moves to confuse him

84
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,360
at the start.

85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,600
In war there is no deceit too great.

86
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,480
All for that final move.

87
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,519
Mr. Baili.

88
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,639
Are you okay?

89
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,920
You're injured.

90
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,720
Si, Mr. Baili is injured again.

91
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,240
Mr. Baili.

92
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,160
You're bleeding.

93
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,720
Mr. Jiang.

94
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,680
We haven't met before.

95
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,480
What do you want with me?

96
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,199
If you do not know me,

97
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,040
why would you agree to meet me?

98
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,439
I have worked for years,

99
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,639
and I am especially sensitive to scents.

100
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:09,000
The fragrance of southern locust
on you is quite unique.

101
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,920
I wonder if you still remember

102
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,439
you didn't wear a mask

103
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,480
when you asked me
how to cure Su Nanyan's illness

104
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,040
the first time.

105
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,560
Previously,

106
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,040
Baili Jingxing from Dongque

107
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,040
and the daughter of General Su Mu

108
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,920
once came to me for a talk,

109
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,360
yet I said nothing.

110
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,000
Feel free to speak your mind.

111
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,680
Five hundred taels.

112
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,600
You will remain a masked man.

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,920
Making a bargain?

114
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,279
Mr. Jiang.

115
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,800
You killed Zhao Qingqing just for...

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
One thousand taels.

117
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,639
Leave Nanyuan Nation forever.

118
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:55,040
(Baili's Mansion)

119
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,360
Did Zhao Qingqing

120
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,439
go to Jiang Beimo for revenge?

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,519
Caiwei.

122
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,312
Caiwei.

123
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,160
Tell me, who sent you?

124
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,600
Tell me.

125
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,639
You'll never know.

126
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,199
Mr. Baili.

127
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,639
Mr. Baili.

128
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,399
Mr. Baili.

129
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,879
Where's Mr. Baili? He was just here.

130
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,399
I'm right here.

131
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,759
Miss Su.

132
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,360
Don't, this is Mr. Baili.

133
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Come on, Mr. Baili.

134
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,200
Mr. Baili, I've come late.

135
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,600
Not late, Miss Su.

136
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,120
You've arrived just in time.

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can already move now?

138
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,799
What's going on?

139
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,080
Did an assassin injure you?

140
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,840
Miss Su.

141
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,799
You did it during the day.

142
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,279
I...

143
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,399
Zhao Qingqing

144
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
knows that I have
to protect the hostage.

145
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,000
Why does she let him get injured?

146
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,919
Doesn't she want to join forces with me?

147
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,039
Go patrol again.

148
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,639
Yes.

149
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,200
Yan.

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,640
Father.

151
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,000
You're injured?

152
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,399
It's nothing serious.

153
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,480
Father, weren't you outside the city?

154
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,440
I heard there were assassins
at the Baili's Mansion recently,

155
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,759
and I really can't rest assured,

156
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,799
so I rushed over overnight.

157
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,480
Yan.

158
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,360
What happened to your hand?

159
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,480
Father, let's talk inside.

160
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,480
You...

161
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,200
Yan, you...

162
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:00,960
Father.

163
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,519
I have caused you
a lot of trouble before.

164
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:05,960
Rest assured.

165
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,320
From now on, I will definitely
protect Mr. Baili well,

166
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,279
not to fail His Majesty and you.

167
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,919
Yan.

168
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,080
It's good that you understand.

169
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,960
Have you found out the identity

170
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,360
of the assassins at Baili's Mansion?

171
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:22,919
Not yet.

172
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,279
But I think

173
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,120
that this is related to Jiang Beimo.

174
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,720
Jiang Beimo?

175
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,679
What benefits does he have

176
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,799
in doing this?

177
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,440
Yan.

178
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,200
Anything weird to Baili today?

179
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,519
Father.

180
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,919
I have a question.

181
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,159
What is it?

182
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,080
How was my illness cured?
