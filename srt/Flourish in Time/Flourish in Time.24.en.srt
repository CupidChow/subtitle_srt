Bless me.

Where is Miao?

00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,080
She’s praying upstairs.

Don’t make strange noise!

37
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:49,760
Sorry.

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,860
(Bless)

540?

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,759
530?

46
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:56,479
Seriously?

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,960
I’m out of the First Tier Line?

48
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,679
What should I do?

49
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:01,679
570.

50
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,839
10 points higher
than Capital University’s line.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
570!

52
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:10,440
Great!

53
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,199
I can go to Beijing

54
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,360
with you!

55
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
Awesome!

56
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,759
Congcong, did you hear that?

57
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,360
I can go to Beijing with you!

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,720
Congcong, did you see it?

59
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:30,479
Guoguo, let’s take a group photo.

60
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,399
One. Two. There.

61
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,000
Take a look.

62
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,360
Guoguo, I wanna take a photo with you.

63
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,240
- Come on.
- Join us.

64
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,279
One. Two. There.

65
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,600
Cheese!

66
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:44,800
Just the provincial team.

67
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,639
Negative Score.

68
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,679
What’s the fuss about?

69
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:48,720
You can have a try too.

70
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,240
Guoguo, ignore him.

71
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,440
- No one takes photo with him.
- It’s fine.

72
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:51,960
- He’s jealous.
- It’s fine.

73
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,199
Come on, Che. Come.

74
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,360
We’ve never taken a photo

75
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:56,639
all these years.

76
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,399
Come.

77
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,559
In the future,

78
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,960
I need to show your photo

79
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,360
when I introduce my first teacher.

80
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,080
Three, two, one.

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,000
Cheese!

82
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,160
Ziye.

83
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,279
Why don’t you

84
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,360
take a photo with Che?

85
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,800
No.

86
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:12,919
No.

87
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,440
How about

88
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,839
we three take a photo together?

89
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,519
Yes, make it a memorial.

90
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,040
Here.

91
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,559
Look at the camera.

92
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,720
Look at the camera.

93
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,200
One. Two. There.

94
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,200
Mr. Wen.

95
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,079
Are you taking photos?

96
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,279
I’m wearing an ordinary outfit. I...

97
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,559
Never mind.

98
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:36,239
Mr. Wen.

99
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,720
Please take a photo for us.

100
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,359
Yes.

101
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,559
Okay. Three, two, one. Cheese!

102
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,079
Well, you...

103
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,440
We haven’t shot in the basketball hall.

104
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,480
Yeah.

105
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,000
Mr. Wen, we are going.

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,799
Go.

107
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:50,350
- Bye.
- Bye, Mr. Wen!

108
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,066
Bye, Mr. Wen!

109
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:52,880
- Bye, Mr. Wen!
- Bye!

110
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,160
This is a moment for them.

111
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,040
Don’t take it to heart.

112
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,279
These students

113
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,799
are a handful.

114
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,799
I didn’t think I could be with them
for three years.

115
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,079
In a wink,

116
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,200
they’ve graduated.

117
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,720
You’ll get used to it.

118
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,679
That’s how it is for a teacher.

119
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,239
Don’t be too sentimental.

120
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:12,399
Learn to face it.

121
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,440
I wish to teach them
for another three years.

122
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,559
Now you’ve become

123
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,279
a capable class teacher as well.

124
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,480
Come. Let’s take a photo.

125
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,559
Okay. Let’s take a photo.

126
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,760
Ms. Lei.

127
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,000
Can we take a photo with you?

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,359
Go ahead.

129
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,980
(Class 10, Grade 3)

130
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,440
He’s coming.

131
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,119
Hurry and get ready.

132
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:46,799
Salute!

133
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,839
Hello, Mr. Wen!

134
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,920
Did you deliberately avoid me

135
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,839
in the playground?

136
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,440
Miao.

137
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,040
You’ve been with Mr. Wen

138
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,760
from Grade 1 to Grade 3.

139
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,399
You may say it.

140
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:03,880
Mr. Wen.

141
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,399
In these three years,

142
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,839
we caused you many troubles.

143
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,760
Especially me.

144
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:10,359
And they two.

145
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,799
Thanks for being with us

146
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:14,880
in these three years.

147
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,399
It’s the best time of our life.

148
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,799
Thanks for your care.

149
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,519
Thanks for your help.

150
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,559
Thanks for never forsaking

151
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,679
any of us.

152
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,480
Through this ceremony,

153
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,440
we’d like to tell you,

154
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,519
graduation doesn’t mean the end,

155
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
but the beginning of a new journey.

156
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:38,760
We graduated!

157
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,359
I’m going to travel!

158
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,239
Manga!

159
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:43,000
Games, I’m coming!

160
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,959
Su Daifei!

161
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,799
Reply to my message!

162
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,720
Do you have a thing with her?

163
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,519
Guoguo, that’s...

164
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,000
That’s unrealistic.

165
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,799
I know it’s unrealistic.

166
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:57,799
I’m just shouting it.

167
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:00,239
She’s a nice girl.

168
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,399
I support you.

169
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,600
She and you...

170
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,040
When did you two make peace?

171
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,320
We’ve graduated.

172
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,200
Be mature.

173
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,399
Then again, Che,

174
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,279
you and Ziye

175
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,239
do have a tacit understanding.

176
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,119
We don’t!

177
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,239
It’s been three years.

178
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,959
We all got mature.

179
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,040
I agree.

180
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
I’ve changed a lot

181
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,160
in high school.

182
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,839
I used to be

183
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,880
apparently excellent.

184
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,119
Now, I’m shining

185
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,279
from the inside out.

186
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:36,920
Honestly,

187
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,480
I prefer the way I am now.

188
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,760
Enough of it.

189
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,480
What you should change the most

190
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,399
is that you’ve never changed.

191
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,679
You are mean as before.

192
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,160
You...

193
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,839
Stop, guys.

194
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,559
Don’t argue.

195
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,480
I am the one who changed the most.

196
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,880
I used to sleep late.

197
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Now I get up earlier

198
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,040
even than the alarm clock.

199
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,519
But you still sleep

200
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,440
in the morning classes.

201
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Guoguo.

202
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,320
You didn’t change.

203
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
You just changed

204
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,440
where you slept.

205
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:06,559
Miao.

206
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,160
I’ve made a good atmosphere.

207
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,320
Why did you expose me?

208
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,679
I think,

209
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:14,640
I’m the one

210
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,480
who didn’t change at all.

211
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
But did you forget it?

212
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,440
In Grade 1,

213
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,160
we made a border on our desks.

214
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,279
That’s a gap

215
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,160
between a genius and an underachiever.

216
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,760
Now we’ve been best friends.

217
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,880
Isn’t it

218
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,200
a huge change?

219
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,400
I was at a loss before.

220
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,880
I thought everything

221
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,679
came with standards.

222
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,760
Being with you guys,

223
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,200
I found it good to be casual.

224
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,159
The present feelings matter the most.

225
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,479
So, I’ll try to learn more

226
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:51,880
about myself.

227
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,080
What about you?

228
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,440
It feels like I’ve grown up,

229
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,239
but I don’t know

230
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,280
where it is.

231
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,039
I used to live by feelings,

232
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,760
and never stopped to think.

233
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,880
To me, the future

234
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:12,640
is as vague

235
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,359
as a fog.

236
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,520
It’s like I’m moving forward,

237
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:17,919
yet it’s also like

238
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,640
I’m not moving at all.

239
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,520
Now the fog

240
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,719
disperses a little bit

241
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,799
and I can see farther.

242
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,840
It feels great.

243
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,960
I think we will have more changes

244
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,039
in the future.

245
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,359
How do you think

246
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,280
we will change?

247
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,679
I believe I’ll be

248
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,400
more handsome,

249
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,320
taller

250
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,760
and leaner.

251
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,359
I’ll be successful

252
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:46,280
and marry a beauty!

253
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,559
You dummy.

254
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,640
I’m different.

255
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,440
I wanna be a basketball superstar

256
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,280
in the world,

257
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,080
serving for the country,

258
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,679
and traveling globally with my love.

259
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:03,039
Che.

260
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,359
What you said

261
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,599
is equivalent to mine.

262
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,000
You want to be successful

263
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,039
and marry a beauty, too.

264
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,440
I’m wrong!

265
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,320
Alright.

266
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,599
Anyway,

267
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,119
we’ll become

268
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,440
the kind of people we want to be.

269
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,599
No regrets.

270
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,840
Tomorrow morning.

271
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,039
Take them all away.

272
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,640
At 10 o’clock.

273
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,359
Yes.

274
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,799
To sell sweet soup or something.

275
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,280
Good.

276
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,559
See you tomorrow.

277
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,520
It’s too messy

278
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,359
to stand somewhere, right?

279
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,559
Don’t worry.

280
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,320
I’ve arranged it.

281
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,359
All these will be taken away tomorrow.

282
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,599
Will you really sell them all?

283
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,359
I’m not made for gambling.

284
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:03,119
These mahjong

285
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,280
and cards

286
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,159
make me sick now.

287
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:16,599
Haoyue.

288
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,000
Here.

289
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,039
Look.

290
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,799
Try this.

291
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,110
Have some water.

292
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,090
Thanks.

293
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,679
How is it?

294
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,520
The taste of childhood.

295
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:36,440
I used to cook for you

296
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,880
when you were little.

297
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,239
When the shop opens,

298
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,599
if anyone asks you

299
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:43,400
about my job,

300
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,159
you can proudly tell them that

301
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:46,840
your father

302
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,280
is a legit businessman.

303
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:52,919
Okay.

304
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,280
Businessman.

305
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,359
What’s the name

306
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,799
of our store?

307
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
I have no idea yet.

308
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,400
Sweet soup store.

309
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,200
Time flies.

310
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,359
Things change.

311
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,159
Our surname is Jiang.

312
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:16,856
How about naming it

313
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,599
Jianghu Sweet Soup?

314
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,760
Good. I agree.

315
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay. That’s the name then.

316
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,840
Jianghu Sweet Soup.

317
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,320
Jianghu.

318
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,500
(Jianghu Sweet Soup.
Welcome)

319
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,837
Dad, should I put it outside?

320
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,618
Yes. Put it outside.

321
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,517
On the table.

322
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,760
Jianghu Sweet Soup.

323
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,559
It is your store by the name.

324
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,679
You silly.

325
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,640
Why do you keep her outside?

326
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,799
Girl.

327
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,080
(Jianghu Sweet Soup)

328
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,359
Be seated.

329
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:55,599
Okay.

330
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:01,719
My mung bean soup is done!

331
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:04,799
Many tendrilleaf fritillary bulbs

332
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,559
and herbs are added.

333
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,119
Is it really mung bean soup?

334
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:09,880
Not tonic anyway.

335
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,960
It’s helpful for heatstroke

336
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,599
and cough. Understand?

337
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,880
Good!

338
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,520
Miao.

339
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,039
Come and have tonic!

340
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,960
No. Come and have soup!

341
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,119
Annoying.

342
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,080
She’s out.

343
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,840
Didn’t she tell you?

344
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:26,440
The exam is over

345
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,760
and she always hangs out.

346
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,080
She didn’t go out for fun.

347
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,159
Miao and Jiang

348
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,119
went to help in Mr. Jiang’s store.

349
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,400
Where?

350
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,559
In Mr. Jiang’s store.

351
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,359
Let me try it.

352
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,559
Are they

353
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,520
together now?

354
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,400
What are you worried about?

355
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,599
Whatever,

356
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,719
why are you reacting like this?

357
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,640
Don’t you agree?

358
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,039
I...

359
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,239
It’s not that I disagree.

360
00:13:59,239 --> 00:13:59,520
I just hope

361
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,280
she can have an easy life.

362
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,640
Listen.

363
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,039
They’ve grown up.

364
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,000
They should

365
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,359
handle their own business.

366
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,440
Do you wanna be

367
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,239
in their way of free love?

368
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,799
Don’t be like your mom.

369
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,760
She bitterly

370
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,200
disagreed you to marry me.

371
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,719
I understand her now.

372
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,000
I just want Miao to have a happy

373
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:34,239
and easy life.

374
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,039
Do you mean

375
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,840
it’s bad to marry me?

376
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:42,200
Eat up and go.

377
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,559
Let’s go.

378
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,440
613.7.

379
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,359
Girl.

380
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,359
Try this.

381
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,280
It looks great.

382
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:58,760
You are awesome, Uncle Jiang.

383
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,880
Thanks for your help.

384
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,760
Don’t mention it.

385
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,159
Having good cakes,

386
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,520
I can’t be happier.

387
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:13,640
Are you alright?

388
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,400
Miao.

389
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,679
Are you hurt?

390
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,359
I’m fine. The shoelace is broken.

391
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,799
Let me get you a pair of slippers.

392
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,919
Don’t bother.

393
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,280
It’s not far away.

394
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,359
I’ll do the rest. Hurry and go.

395
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,359
But, Dad,

396
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,440
I haven’t finished counting the bills.

397
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,760
Jiang Haoyue, hold her.

398
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:31,840
Be careful.

399
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,799
Carry her back home.

400
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,119
Let me carry you back home.

401
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,440
No.

402
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:40,559
No, thanks.

403
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,280
She said no.

404
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:44,880
For my sake.

405
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,640
Let me carry you back then.

406
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,440
Be careful.

407
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,719
Let him carry you. It’s fine.

408
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:52,880
Go.

409
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,520
Get on.

410
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,582
Dad, we’re going.

411
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:00,710
- Go ahead.
- Uncle Jiang, we’re leaving.

412
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,119
Take care.

413
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,200
Be careful.

414
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,960
He has low EQ.

415
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:11,520
Who is he like?

416
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,280
Am I heavy?

417
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,479
How about putting me down?

418
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:28,919
Not heavy.

419
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,200
I feel at ease

420
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,760
with you on my back.

421
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,000
No matter how heavy I am?

422
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,520
I’ll eat more tonight.

423
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:41,880
Eat what?

424
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
Roasted pork with bamboo shoots
or mustard ribs?

425
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,080
Ribs in oyster sauce.

426
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,840
I was startled.

427
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,679
Are you alright?

428
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,559
What happened to your foot?

429
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:55,840
Nothing.

430
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:58,039
My sandal was broken.

431
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,799
Your sandal?

432
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,119
I thought your foot was broken.

433
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,679
Get down now.

434
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
It’s fine. I...

435
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,479
Here.

436
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:05,079
Hurry.

437
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,839
Hurry up.

438
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,199
She’s being mischievous.

439
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:09,239
Why did you do this too?

440
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,000
Have you put them on?

441
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,640
Mom, it’s true.

442
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,640
What is it about then? Come in.

443
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,040
Wash your hands for dinner.

444
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,640
I’m going home then.

445
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:24,119
Okay.

446
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,719
Sorry for messing up your hair.

447
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:04,160
It’s fine. Let me help you, Aunt Fang.

448
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,160
No. Don’t touch it.

449
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:12,880
Aunt Fang. I have something to tell you.

450
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,680
What?

451
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,199
I...

452
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,040
I like Miao.

453
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,439
I mean,

454
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,119
I wanna be with Miao.

455
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,599
Aunt Fang.

456
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,239
I’m telling the truth.

457
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,160
You know,

458
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,079
I’ve been

459
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,400
watching you grow up.

460
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,160
I know what kind of person you are.

461
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,560
You are a good kid.

462
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,400
You also know Uncle Lu and me

463
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,119
very well.

464
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:24,680
We love Miao

465
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,119
very much.

466
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:30,239
We’ve been working hard,

467
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,680
because we don’t want her

468
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,359
to have a hard life

469
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,760
and suffer.

470
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,839
I just hope

471
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,280
she can find an easy job

472
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,719
after graduation,

473
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,280
and marry someone

474
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,839
who can protect her

475
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:56,959
and give her

476
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,319
a simple and happy life.

477
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,199
Do you understand?

478
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,040
Yes, I do.

479
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:13,640
Aunt Fang.

480
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Please trust me.

481
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,800
I’m the person

482
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,400
who can protect her.

483
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,839
Have you slept?

484
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:45,880
Not yet.

485
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,079
How about

486
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,719
I stay here with you for a while?

487
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:52,160
Mom.

488
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,359
Did you quarrel with my dad again?

489
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,280
Of course not.

490
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,479
Also, he never wins in a quarrel.

491
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
I just want to

492
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,280
warm up here.

493
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,439
So warm.

494
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,800
Mom. It’s hot.

495
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,239
Move there a bit.

496
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,400
Did you...?

497
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,680
Did you push me?

498
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,680
You’ve grown up, huh?

499
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,880
You were so little before.

500
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,119
Suddenly, you’ve

501
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,880
become a big girl.

502
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,640
Is it that fast?

503
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,319
How come it feels like

504
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:25,040
I’ve been in school for ages?

505
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,239
Isn’t it good in school?

506
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:34,680
That’s the happiest time.

507
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,239
You’ll have the feeling
when you grow up.

508
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,560
Is it hard to be an adult?

509
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,560
Of course.

510
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,359
But Jiang said,

511
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,719
he wants to be an adult.

512
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,359
Then he can make choices himself.

513
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:05,119
I wanna make choices, too.

514
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,640
What choices do you want to make?

515
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,280
Do you like him?

516
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:17,800
Mom, why are you saying this?

517
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:21,479
You don’t like him?

518
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:24,479
That’s good.

519
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:25,280
I like him!

520
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,160
I really like him!

521
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,000
Do you know about liking someone?

522
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,319
I do.

523
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,520
When I

524
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,719
waited for bus with him

525
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,599
at the bus stop,

526
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:42,640
I picked up his bookmark.

527
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:45,560
A line of his poem was on it.

528
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,959
It reads, “I am all alone

529
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,439
in the heavy snow”.

530
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,479
I thought,

531
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,400
he must be very lonely.

532
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,920
I don’t want him to be lonely.

533
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,760
I wanna be with him.

534
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
I wanna watch the snow with him,

535
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,760
and watch the sea.

536
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,599
Being with him,

537
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,280
you’ll have a hard life,

538
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,000
for you have to look after him
all the way.

539
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,160
Why?

540
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,359
He is Jiang Haoyue!

541
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:27,520
If I can look after him,

542
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,160
I’ll be too awesome.

543
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,760
I’m so happy thinking about it.

544
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:36,239
How come you are so silly?

545
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,800
Mom.

546
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,160
When I was in junior high school,

547
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,199
you bought

548
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,119
pickled chicken feet for me. Remember?

549
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:01,640
At that time,

550
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,760
I got sick

551
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,040
and made a scene to eat chicken feet.

552
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,800
You didn’t allow me.

553
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,640
When I went home after school,

554
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,520
I saw a big jar of chicken feet

555
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,760
on the table.

556
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,359
You came to me and told me

557
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,920
to wash before eating,

558
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,959
and not eat too much.

559
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,319
Why do you bring this up?

560
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,560
Because

561
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
it reminds me that,

562
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:28,199
you are

563
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:29,920
sharp-tongued but soft-hearted.

564
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,319
Are you setting me up?

565
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,319
Mom.

566
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,040
Don’t worry about me.

567
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,680
I know it’s for my good

568
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,880
and you’re worried about me.

569
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:55,040
But every day with Jiang

570
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,680
is happy

571
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,040
and meaningful.

572
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:04,640
Besides,

573
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,959
I’ve made it to go to Beijing
as I wished.

574
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,199
I can have a happy life

575
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:12,400
with my own strength.

576
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,119
It’s so good.

577
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,000
I’m independent now.

578
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,680
So,

579
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:22,719
Mom,

580
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,439
what else are you worried about?

581
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,560
Fine.

582
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,060
(No-Relationship-In-Highschool Contract)

583
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,400
End the contract.

584
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,719
I like you. Let’s be together.

585
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,640
Are you sure

586
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,160
to confess so seriously?

587
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,839
Get to the point.

588
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,359
I think,

589
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:16,040
it’s so simple and serious.

590
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Lu Miao is a liberal arts student.

591
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,040
They like

592
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,959
a romantic way.

593
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,280
You may show more affections.

594
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,719
Any example?

595
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,479
Like,

596
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,599
“You shine in my life,

597
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,640
and light up my way forward.

598
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,319
Since the moment we met,

599
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,439
we’ve been meant to be”.

600
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,199
You may keep it

601
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:50,640
for yourself.

602
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,199
Do you understand or not?

603
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:09,800
Thanks.

604
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,680
How will you spend the holiday?

605
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,880
In a relaxing way.

606
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,520
Like?

607
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,000
Like...

608
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:26,040
Like what it is now,

609
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,599
sitting here

610
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,479
with a fan,

611
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:29,839
eating ice cream and reading comics.

612
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,199
Don’t you wanna hang out?

613
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,439
It’s scorching outside.

614
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:36,959
The sun is big.

615
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:37,400
I won’t.

616
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,280
I’ll go with someone else then.

617
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,239
What are you going to do?

618
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,040
Make up for last year’s graduation trip.

619
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,239
Graduation trip?

620
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,959
I have time. Let’s go.

621
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,280
It’s scorching outside.

622
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,920
Young people should go out more often

623
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,359
and bath in the sun for calcium.

624
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,719
Where would you like to go?

625
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:34,640
Is this what you brought?

626
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,760
I’m going to them.

627
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,239
Be careful.

628
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,160
Ziye! Guoguo!

629
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,760
Why are you here?

630
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,560
Miao!

631
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,680
What brings you here?

632
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,680
Miao.

633
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,160
Do you come here as well?

634
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:51,800
Yes.

635
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,160
The itinerary you posted

636
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,800
looked great.

637
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,199
Qu Wei.

638
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:56,920
Come here.

639
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,160
So you come here too?

640
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,439
I don’t wanna make a new schedule.

641
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,920
Hey, why are you here?

642
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:05,520
I am curious.

643
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,680
Aren’t you gonna confess?

644
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,040
Who told you that?

645
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,040
Isn’t it your plan?

646
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,239
I’m ready to assist you.

647
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,560
What the odds? You are here, too!

648
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,000
Since everyone is here,

649
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,239
why don’t we play a game?

650
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,640
Okay. Let’s go.

651
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,468
Go!

652
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,439
Here!

653
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,160
Here!

654
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,680
To me!

655
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,800
Look! It’s here!

656
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,839
Are you using your hands?

657
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,560
Catch it.

658
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,199
Go over there.

659
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:35,760
Give me!

660
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:36,880
Stop her!

661
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,599
Give me the ball!

662
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,839
Let go!

663
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,439
No!

664
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:42,239
Che!

665
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:43,760
To me!

666
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,160
Catch it!

667
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,880
To me!

668
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,137
Che, stop her!

669
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:47,359
Che, stop her!

670
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,959
Chase the ball quickly!

671
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:49,800
Chase the ball!

672
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,599
Here!

673
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,120
Pass it this way!

674
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,199
Pass it here!

675
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:57,479
Negative Score. What are you doing?

676
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:58,900
What’s going on?

677
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,839
Nice!

678
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:01,239
Come on.

679
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:02,000
Again.

680
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,100
Chlorophyll.

681
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,020
Coming.

682
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,719
Jiang Haoyue, you cheated!

683
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:09,640
Yes.

684
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,620
We got it!

685
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:14,660
♪We run into the young secret♪

686
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,580

♪The young riddle remains unknown

00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,020
♪Needs an answer♪

693
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,199
One shot per person.

694
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:41,359
Whoever gets it in first

695
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,400
is the winner.

696
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,319
I’ll do it first.

697
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:46,119
Almost.

698
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,000
Your turn.

699
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:52,040
You failed, too.

700
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,239
I’ll have another try.

701
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:56,400
Yes!

702
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,560
You got it in

703
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,040
because of the wind!

704
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,680
Are you not convinced?

705
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,479
Another round.

706
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:03,599
Wait.

707
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,599
For the barbecue tonight,

708
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,199
Shi Che and Xie Ziye
went to buy ingredients.

709
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:07,959
Let’s go buy some drinks.

710
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,680
Let’s go.

711
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,400
Qu Wei.

712
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,920
Chen Guoguo is waiting for you
to make a fire.

713
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,880
Chen Guoguo is waiting for you
to make a fire.

714
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,319
Guoguo is waiting for me to make a fire.

715
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,239
I’m going.

716
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:28,000
Go and buy drinks.

717
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,520
Bye.

718
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,319
Let’s go.

719
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,839
I’ll buy those

720
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:39,680
only for adults.

721
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,119
No, we won’t buy these.

722
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,239
These only.

723
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:50,880

724

Let’s go.

726
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,479
I used to dream of the sea.

727
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,479
What kind of sea?

728
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,839
The green sea

729
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,839
glowing in the sun.

730
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:24,079
Like this sea?

731
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:32,610
Not so beautiful.

732
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,070
Not so beautiful.

Is this the notebook

782
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,840
you recorded things?

783
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,760

Give it back!

785
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,080
Give it back!

786
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,320
Are you hiding something?

787
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:04,719
Don’t come!

788
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,320

No. Give it back!

00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,639

794
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,120

801
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,600
You can never get full marks.

802
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,159
Chlorophyll.

803
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:56,439
What?

804
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:59,879
I do have many shortcomings

805
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:01,479
and don’t deserve full marks.

806
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,560
But when I deserve

807
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,520
full marks,

808
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:07,679
I hope

809
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:09,479
you can keep your promise.

810
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,520
Don’t go back on your word.

812

Confess when I get full marks.

813
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,080
You are far away from that.

814
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,159
Look.

815
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,120
The fire is on.

816
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:00,000
Why are they so slow buying things?

817
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:03,320
Leave them alone.

818
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,120
Isn’t it fun to make a fire?

819
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,239
Yes, it’s very fun.

820
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,040
Give me a hand.

821
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,840
We can roast when they’re back.

822
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,840
You are back.

823
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,120

824
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,479
I’m starving.

825
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:16,439
Where is Miao?

826
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,520
They

827
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,600
went to buy drinks.

828
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,959
Didn’t you see them?

829
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,280
No.

830
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,399
I guess

831
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:25,840
they have more important things to do.

832
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:29,919
Could it be...?

833
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,479
Here they are.

834
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,280
They’re holding hands.

835
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,639
Looks like he made it.

836
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,420
Congratulations.

837
00:37:41,585 --> 00:37:42,680
Congratulations.

838
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,840
Thank you.

839
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,040
Sit.

840
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:56,719
What’s wrong, Che?

841
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,080
What’s the matter with you?

842
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:00,679
I can’t see you guys

843
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,080
anymore.

844
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,120
I feel sad.

845
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,280
I feel sad, too.

846
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,959
Don’t be too emotional.

847
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:11,560
You’ll still meet someday.

848
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,239
Knock it off.

849
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,000
You went too far last year.

850
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:17,360
Don’t you remember?

851
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,080

852
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,639
Right.

853
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,199
Our friendship won’t end
with graduation.

854
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,120
Also,

855
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,360
we have phones.

856
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,439
Yes. Let’s have some food.

857
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:32,760
I’m starving.

858
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,959
What did you buy?

859
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,239
Seafood.

860
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,879
After the dinner,

861
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:40,439
let’s fire sparklers.

862
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:41,399
Okay.

863
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,199
What would you drink?

864
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,919
Back in that year,

865
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:51,080
we dreamed to have the whole world.

866
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,600
But what on earth is the whole world?

867
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,560
I think,

868
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,360
it’s the blue sky.

869
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,760
The vast sea.

870
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:02,280
The green in summer.

871
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:07,000
The starry sky and the bright moon.

872
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,199
A bunch of shining fools.

873
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:12,679
Like the refreshing wind by the sea.

874
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:15,479
Like the warm light at night.

875
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,360
From dawn to dusk.

876
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,760
School on and off.

877
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,439
From the past to the future.

878
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,959
They’re like
