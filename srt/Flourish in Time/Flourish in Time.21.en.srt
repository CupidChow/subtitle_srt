Hey, where’s Lu Miao?

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,840
Meng is now a loner.

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,280
She doesn’t speak,

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,600
doesn’t go to the milk tea store
and the book store.

34
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,280
Looks like Miao’s changed.

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,680
She’s really in a hard time.

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
Her grandpa’s sick,

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,360
her parents are divorcing

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,640
and Jiang Haoyue is leaving.

39
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,320
She must be heartbroken.

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,040
Is Jiang Haoyue so important to her?

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,280
You’ve gone through plenty.

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,760
Jiang Haoyue is very important to her,

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,400
don’t you know?

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,600
So we’ve got to do something.

45
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,720
Yeah, we can’t just watch.

46
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,600
We’ve got to do something.

47
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,560
Can you prevent her parents
from divorcing?

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,680
Prevent her grandpa from being sick?

49
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,520
And prevent Jiang Haoyue from leaving?

50
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,440
What’re you thinking about?

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
Preventing Jiang Haoyue from leaving.

52
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,600
Don’t do anything stupid.

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,580
Well, Che,

54
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,660
calm down.

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,720
I’ve decided.

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,760
I’d do anything for Meng.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,080
What’s it?

58
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,160
Why are you leaving?

59
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,720
Why?

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,160
You want me to stay?

61
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
I want you to leave,

62
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,520
as far as you could.

63
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,920
But Lu Miao wants you to stay.

64
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,880
Have you thought of her?

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,080
She cares about you,

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,960
and you’re leaving at this moment.

67
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
I wish her to live well.

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,000
So stay if you do!

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,680
Can’t believe what you are thinking.

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,960
A studious idiot, hah?

71
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,960
I leave so she could live well.

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,960
I leave so she could live well.

73
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,960
The second role in a soap opera, hah?

74
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,040
What are my lines?

75
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,200
Lu Miao is mine
and I’ll take good care of her.

76
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,120
Dose Lu Miao adore me?

77
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,780
(Morocco)

78
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,320
Che, why do you make
so many paper planes?

79
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,880
Confession.

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,440
What?

81
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,800
Again?

82
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,200
Not again.

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,280
It never worked.

84
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,080
Is it where you fell down

85
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,440
where you lie down?

86
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,280
It’s different.

87
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,640
Yeah, it is. You got me in.

88
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,360
And the result will be the same.

89
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,880
The result

90
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,440
doesn’t matter.

91
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,720
What do you mean?

92
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,400
Jiang Haoyue is going abroad.

93
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,760
And you’ll have an opportunity?

94
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,120
I have a plan.

95
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,680
Jiang Haoyue is leaving

96
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,480
and I’m happy.

97
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
But I want Meng to be happy, too.

98
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,320
So I’ll make him stay for her.

99
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,800
I appreciate your attempt.

100
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,440
But do you believe Jiang Haoyue

101
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,240
will stay because of

102
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,480
your confession?

103
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,680
If I were him, I would.

104
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,040
If I were a girl I’d make you my man.

105
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,120
I’d not make you mine.

106
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,240
Miao, is that bad?

107
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,240
Tell me, what’s the matter?

108
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,520
I planned to say goodbye
to Jiang Haoyue,

109
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,320
but I cowered before him.

110
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,720
It looked like

111
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,720
I was not ready to say goodbye.

112
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,960
Growing up is a course
of losing and saying goodbye.

113
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,520
When I was your age,

114
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,880
I was not as brave as you are.

115
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,640
So how did you

116
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,480
become braver and braver?

117
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,080
Am I brave?

118
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,080
To me,

119
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,560
you’re the bravest man in the world.

120
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,800
My bravery is in my trunk.

121
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,400
Miao, take the pump, please.

122
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,400
Look what I’ve got.

123
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,760
What is that?

124
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,000
Miao, this is a water rocket.

125
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,080
Where did you buy it?

126
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,200
Buy?

127
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,800
When I was young,

128
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,440
we couldn’t afford toys.

129
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,720
We made our toys. Awesome?

130
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,100
Come, Miao,

131
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,100
put water in it.

132
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,280
When I was unhappy as a kid,

133
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,960
I’d come to the sea

134
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,640
with the water rocket,

135
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,120
whoosh, I fired it away.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,440
All the unhappiness was gone to the sky.

137
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,400
Now write your unhappiness

138
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,000
on the water rocket.

139
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,380
(Jiang Haoyue, goodbye)

140
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,680
Dad, your turn.

141
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,320
It’s my turn.

142
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,100
(Fang comes home)

143
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,240
Done.

144
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,080
Let’s blow it up.

145
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,720
Come, Miao,

146
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,840
hold my arm.

147
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,040
Let us

148
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,560
fire our unhappiness to the sky.

149
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,760
One, two, three.

150
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,640
Dad, you’ve got water on your face.

151
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,740
Go, go, go.

152
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,280
She’s coming.

153
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,040
She’s coming.

154
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,240
Ready?

155
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,320
Three, two, one.

156
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,580
Look up there!

157
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,760
Planes! Many of them!

158
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,200
Lu Miao,

159
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,280
do you know how many

160
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,080
countries there are in this world?

161
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,360
One hundred and ninety-five.

162
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,760
I don’t know how to make you happy.

163
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,800
I’ve made you flights

164
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,040
to every one of them.

165
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,960
Don’t be afraid to start.

166
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,720
I promise,

167
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,880
wherever the destination is,

168
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,320
it’ll be the most beautiful trip.

169
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,560
I’m going to Morocco!

170
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,400
I’m going to France!

171
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,200
I’m going to Mauritius!

172
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,440
This is not an unrealistic dream.

173
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,600
This is our future.

174
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,960
Lu Miao,

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,760
I adore…

176
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,400
What did you say?

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,280
I didn’t hear it!

178
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,560
Wait up there!

179
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,000
I’m going to you.

180
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,240
No way!

181
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,280
Again?

182
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:22,920
Out of power?

183
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,680
I must do the confession!

184
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,740
(Switzerland)

185
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,600
Go, go, back to class.

186
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,480
Che,

187
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,760
what are you doing?

188
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,800
Lu Miao, I adore you.

189
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,320
I’m not

190
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,040
the victim of your prank.

191
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,960
Come on, let’s go.

192
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,640
I adore you.

193
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,880
Do you adore me?

194
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,960
Sorry,

195
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,320
I adore someone else.

196
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,040
I’m sorry.

197
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,520
Got you there, victim.

198
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,360
Wish you’ve seen your face,

199
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,800
yeah.

200
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,960
Sorry,

201
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,240
I adore someone else.

202
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,080
I adore someone else.

203
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,040
Is that funny?

204
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:20,920
No…

205
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,560
Dare you do it again?

206
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,960
No…

207
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,880
Shi Che, stop!

208
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,760
Stop!

209
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,360
What do you mean?

210
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,520
What do you mean!

211
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,200
Packing up?

212
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,560
In your dreams.

213
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,960
You’ll not take

214
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,560
anything from the house.

215
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,080
Wow, that’s good!

216
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,120
(Time Book)

217
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,180
Are you sure that was a prank?

218
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,200
Are you sure that was a prank?

219
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,480
A prank has a reason.

220
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,680
But a guy like Che,

221
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,840
I’m not sure.

222
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,240
I’d tell you the truth.

223
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,760
He always adores you.

224
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,880
He adores you

225
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,520
and envies Jiang Haoyue.

226
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,200
The confession at the school games,

227
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,480
he wrote it to you.

228
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,280
It can’t be!

229
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,560
I know it, and Guoguo does, too.

230
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,880
He doesn’t allow us to tell you.

231
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,720
He hopes you will

232
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,120
feel his heart.

233
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,720
I just tugged his armpit.

234
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,000
So,

235
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,480
any idea about
how to get along with him?

236
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,480
He said it was a prank

237
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,840
and you believe it was a prank?

238
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,880
If the one I adore doesn’t adore me,

239
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,520
pretending nothing happened,

240
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,600
and making fun of me every day,

241
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,600
it’s killing me.

242
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,040
I’d better avoid him.

243
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,320
Qu Wei got a full mark.

244
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,000
Did you confess to him?

245
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,560
Confess?

246
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,280
Didn’t you promise that

247
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,760
you’ll confess to him
if he gets a full mark?

248
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,240
Checking the assessment result.

249
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:06,960
Yeah.

250
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,800
I was busy with the exams.

251
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,640
I’ll check it later.

252
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,360
I envy you.

253
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,440
I wish I could

254
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:19,860
control my mood

255
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,720
(Switzerland)
control my mood

256
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,060
like doing math.

257
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,880
like doing math.

258
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,640
Wake up, Xie Ziye,

259
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,680
you’re dating a full-mark guy.

260
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,240
Ziye.

261
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,600
Wei.

262
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,920
You want a talk with me?

263
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,400
For me?

264
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,560
Emm.

265
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,080
Thank you.

266
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,040
This is a confession gift.

267
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:33,800
Confession?

268
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,600
Too sudden.

269
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,880
Not at all.

270
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,080
Since grade one,

271
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,400
I’ve been assessing every boy

272
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,640
I meet.

273
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,480
Wei, you top my list.

274
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,240
You fit my criteria best.

275
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,380
(Jiang Haoyue 96 Qu Wei 100)

276
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,560
Didn’t expect I win over Jiang Haoyue

277
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,160
in your system.

278
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,160
Wei,

279
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,960
is my confession accepted?

280
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,400
Sorry, it’s not.

281
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Why?

282
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,040
Wei, doesn’t the system

283
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,520
prove

284
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,640
I fit your criteria best?

285
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,480
But I didn’t feel

286
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,880
you adore me.

287
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,140
Well, Wei,

288
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,880
you’re good at chemistry

289
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,840
and you should know

290
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,080
adoring is a reaction of substances.

291
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,440
At first-sight or coming in time,

292
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,560
as long as your brain

293
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,080
produces enough phenethylamine,

294
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,240
you’ll feel you adore someone.

295
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,760
Love is indeed chemistry,

296
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,200
but in the right sequence.

297
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,480
You meet someone you adore first,

298
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,080
then you produce phenethylamine.

299
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,040
Phenethylamine doesn’t decide

300
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,360
who you’ll adore.

301
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,920
Ziye, don’t despair.

302
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,920
Use your heart to feel the chemistry.

303
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,360
Thank you.

304
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,760
Is the noodle

305
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,640
for me?

306
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,440
Emm.

307
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,560
Do you not want to go?

308
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,540
If you don’t, stay.

309
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:17,860
Tell me.

310
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,920
I’ll talk with Chen Lu.

311
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,820
(Air ticket booked)

312
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,760
Don’t bother.
Take care of your own business.

313
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:06,260
(Export completed)

314
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,960
I wish her to live well.

315
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,040
So stay if you do!

316
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,480
Can’t believe what you are thinking.

317
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,680
I leave so she could live well.

318
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,440
Dose Lu Miao adore me?

319
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,920
Lu Miao is mine
and I’ll take good care of her.

320
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,000
Are you sleeping here?

321
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,560
Leave me alone.

322
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,400
My heart’s broken.

323
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,800
Fix it then.

324
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,560
You’ve helped me, anyway.

325
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,360
Shouldn’t you

326
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,280
say something to comfort me?

327
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,320
I said you have no hope,

328
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,040
and you…

329
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,320
Are you crying again?

330
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,080
I knew it from the beginning.

331
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,720
But it still hurts.

332
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,400
I got it.

333
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,760
I know something
that can heal your sadness.

334
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,440
What’s it?

335
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,040
I’m afraid you dare not to try.

336
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,960
Hey,

337
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,600
Shi Che

338
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,280
dares to do anything in this world.

339
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,960
Are you afraid?

340
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,000
Hey,

341
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,080
Shi Che is not afraid.

342
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
It’s fine. It’s about the fifth floor.

343
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,760
Fifth floor? Let me go!

344
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,040
Too late.

345
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,654
♪Laugh together♪

346
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,600
Let me go!

347
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,300

I’ve identified my No. 1.

390
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,720
I confessed to him,

391
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,520
but was declined.

392
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,920
Why?

393
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,040
He said

394
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,760
fit doesn’t mean adoring.

395
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,600
Adoring

396
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,720
is from the bottom of your heart.

397
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,000
Another loser.

00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,920

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,280
It’s fine.

401
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,440
You did nothing wrong.

402
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,120
Adoring is sort of

403
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,200
a lucky draw.

404
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,240
Sometime

405
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,760
you meet someone similar to you.

406
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,560
But most of us are unlucky.

407
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,720
But someday you’ll

408
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,160
meet someone who truly adores you.

409
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,480
When that day comes,

410
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,200
you’ll be truly happy

411
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,080
for meeting the one.

412
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,200
You will.

413
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,960
I’m truly happy today.

414
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,160
I was a bit scared,

415
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,560
but I’m very happy.

416
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,880
After you.

417
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,200
It’s so nice of you, Meng.

418
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,200
No…

419
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,160
Still mad at my prank?

420
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,960
I admit.

421
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,240
You take me as a brother
but I tried to woo you.

422
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,640
It was definitely my bad.

423
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,040
But you have a generous heart.

424
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,800
And I’ve decided not to adore you.

425
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,480
Let’s turn to a new page.

426
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,040
It’s a lifelong brotherhood.

427
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,440
A lifelong brotherhood?

428
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,320
Or, sisterhood?

429
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,280
Great, a lifelong brotherhood.

430
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,600
Take anything you want. It’s on me.

431
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,180
Come on.

432
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:17,780
Okay.

433
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,920
Thanks, Meng, for the treat.

434
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,360
It’s fine. I hit you.

435
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,640
This is for your armpit.

436
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,440
It didn’t hurt.

437
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,280
Excuse me.

438
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,280
Jiang Haoyue, we need a talk.

439
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,880
I yelled at you.

440
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,000
I failed to control my emotion.

441
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,600
I’m sorry.

442
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,960
I’m the one who should say sorry.

443
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,760
I shouldn’t leave you at this moment.

444
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,200
Nonsense.

445
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,080
You have a future.

446
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,960
You wanna go somewhere far and better.

447
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,640
It’s natural.

448
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,520
I’m your childhood friend

449
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,960
and I should support you.

450
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,600
I made this with my own hands.

451
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,960
You must wear it. An amulet.

452
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,320
That was all I wanted to say.

453
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,040
Goodbye.

(Take You To The End Of The World)

455
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,600
My life would be like this,

456
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,800
going to school alone.

457
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,560
It’s not bad, anyway.

458
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,960
Nobody tells me not
to eat too many snacks.

459
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,680
I’ll eat as much as I could.

460
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,880
Nobody pushes me to do my homework.

461
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,920
Freedom!

462
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,200
I’ll not be afraid of

463
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,400
failing exams and disgracing him.

464
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,000
I’ll be happier than I was.

465
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,480
Cheers!

466
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,160
Is this Jiang Haoyue’s laptop?

467
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,440
Checking it out

468
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,480
is not infringement of privacy.

469
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,800
And I don’t really want to.

Jiang Haoyue was sending it to me?

472
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,480
I thought we’d lead
the college of science,

473
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,920
but you’ve changed the track.

474
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,280
I’d be bored if you go.

475
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,760
You’ll get used to it in 21 days.

476
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,400
That’s coldblooded.

477
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,520
Did Lu Miao hear the same thing?

478
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,080
She was quiet, and she understands.

479
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,120
That’s fine.

480
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,280
Or you’ll feel guilty.

481
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,400
I shouldn’t leave you at this moment.

482
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,720

490
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,480
I’m starting to regret.

491
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,920
Where are you going?

492
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:49,680
Dike!

493
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,200
It’s April 18, 2018,

494
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,120
eight years since

495
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,920
we first met.

496
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,240
When we were little,

497
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,440
I actually hated

498
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,560
you stuck to me every day.

499
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,000
Jiang Haoyue, nice to meet you.

500
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,720
I’m Lu Miao.

501
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,150
You may call me Miao.

502
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,720
You may call me Miao.

503
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,880
Now you have a sister.

504
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,560
She’s me.

505
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,450
Jiang Haoyue, don’t go.

506
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,880
Jiang Haoyue.

507
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,175
You’re now Terminator No. 2.

508
00:38:24,175 --> 00:38:24,240
You’re now Terminator No. 2.

509
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,825
And I’m No. 1.

510
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:25,520
And I’m No. 1.

511
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,840
You’re terminated by me.

512
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,400
I don’t know when it started.

513
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,560
I got used to it

514
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:33,950
that you waited for me in the games.

515
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,320
that you waited for me in the games.

516
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,150
Because of you, my childhood

517
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,800
Because of you, my childhood

518
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,080
had colors.
