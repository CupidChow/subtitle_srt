Jiang Haoyue, leave me alone.

31
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,120
Time to go home.

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,360
I don’t want to.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,480
No one is home, anyway.

34
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,020
Have some water to calm down.

35
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,600
You know what?

36
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,640
I was very happy

37
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,200
to tell my mom about my scores.

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,080
I thought she’d come back,

39
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,120
but she asked me

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
which one I would choose.

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,840
My dad or her?

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
I never expected

43
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,120
such kind of irrational event

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,160
would happen to me.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,320
Jiang,

46
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,040
tell me a story, OK?

47
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,480
What kind of story?

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,640
I want to listen to

49
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,880
a warm

50
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,600
and sweet

51
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,320
fairy story about love.

52
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,420
Once upon a time,

53
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,440
Ms. Rabbit

54
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,760
opened a mushroom shop in a village.

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,920
One day,

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,440
Mr. Dog who always wandered around

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
happened to pass by.

58
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,640
Come on.

59
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,520
He was falling in love with

60
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,600
Ms. Rabbit at first sight.

61
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,160
But Mr. Dog

62
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,120
liked entertainment

63
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,560
and had bad reputation.

64
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,840
So, Ms. Rabbit

65
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,480
refused to date with him.

66
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,680
One day,

67
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,400
a local tyrant Wolf

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,600
came to Ms. Rabbit’s mushroom shop

69
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,840
and threatened her

70
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
to send him mushroom

71
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,600
every day.

72
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,320
For protection.

73
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,160
Or he’d destroy her shop.

74
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,560
Why does your fairy story

75
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,960
have protection fee?

76
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you want me to continue?

77
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,560
Yes.

78
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,160
Go ahead.

79
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,080
Continue.

80
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,760
Later…

81
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,720
Bro!

82
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,440
The news

83
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,240
was heard by Mr. Dog.

84
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,880
Gosh!

85
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Mr. Dog came to stop Wolf immediately.

86
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,400
Stop!

87
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,000
Sir, please!

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,560
Please don’t!

89
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,080
Smash it!

90
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,800
Freeze!

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,280
Stop it.

92
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,000
Ms. Rabbit was sad

93
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,160
and felt sorry.

94
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,440
Step into my business?

95
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,040
No.

96
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,120
Then,

97
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,040
Mr. Dog

98
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,560
bit the Wolf’s neck,

99
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,080
and Wolf fell in blood.

100
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,640
Then, this matter was reported

101
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,160
to the village head,

102
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,640
and Mr. Dog was caught.

103
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,560
How could justice be at disadvantage?

104
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,440
Several years later,

105
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,760
Mr. Dog was released.

106
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,600
He still loved Ms. Rabbit

107
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,800
and proposed to her.

108
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,000
I don’t have any skills

109
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,040
or money.

110
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,680
He told Ms. Rabbit that

111
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,320
he could

112
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,600
give up his life for her.

113
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,280
Ms. Rabbit was moved

114
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,800
and agreed his proposal.

115
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,280
The love story ends here.

116
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,840
What happened next?

117
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,760
You want to know?

118
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Tell me more.

119
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,800
Mr. Dog and Ms. Rabbit

120
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,440
had a baby soon.

121
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,000
It’s Cat.

122
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,480
Rabbit

123
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,280
and Dog.

124
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Why should they have a kid Cat?

125
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,200
I’ll be quiet. You continue.

126
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,360
Continue.

127
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,800
Milk is coming.

128
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,480
Later,

129
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,600
Ms. Rabbit

130
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,720
was always busy doing her business

131
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,720
and looking after their baby.

132
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,640
But Mr. Dog always

133
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,840
sneaked into the mushroom shop

134
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,120
and stole the most expensive mushroom.

135
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,800
Jiang Haoyue.

136
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,520
He always came home drunk.

137
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,240
Smile.

138
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,840
You’re back.

139
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,480
Good. You feed him.

140
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,120
I’ll cook.

141
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,800
Someone is waiting for me.

142
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,400
What?

143
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,360
I can’t do it myself.

144
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,080
Come on.

145
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,960
Stop it!

146
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,480
I told you. I can’t do it myself.

147
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,080
Someone is waiting. I’m going!

148
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,520
Jiang Yi, will you go to drink again?

149
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,160
Ms. Rabbit

150
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,400
and Mr. Dog

151
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,560
argued many times.

152
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,640
But Mr. Dog…

153
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,320
Here, baby.

154
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,920
Has never changed his bad habit.

155
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,040
Mr. Dog could give up his life

156
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,000
for Ms. Rabbit,

157
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,640
but why couldn’t he

158
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,880
change his habit?

159
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,160
Yeah.

160
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
Mr. Dog could give up his life

161
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,240
for Ms. Rabbit,

162
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,400
but couldn’t live ordinary life

163
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,600
with her.

164
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,640
You can bet now.

165
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,680
Is this OK?

166
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,080
Yes.

167
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,280
Straight!

168
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,520
This is our bill.

169
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,440
We only have money out,

170
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,160
nothing in.

171
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,800
Have a look.

172
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,800
Jiang Yi, tell me,

173
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,280
will you make a living?

174
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,960
What are you doing?

175
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,000
Beat me? Come on!

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,320
You can only do this, right?

177
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,560
You can’t make money.

178
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,000
You can only beat me.

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,680
You said it. Right?

180
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,600
- Beat me!
- You asked for it!

181
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,880
I can’t make money?

182
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,800
You can’t!

183
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,960
Ms. Rabbit decided to

184
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,560
leave Mr. Dog finally.

185
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,920
What about their kid Cat?

186
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,480
Ms. Rabbit thought Cat was a trouble,

187
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,400
and

188
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,560
left him behind.

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,920
Cat liked to

190
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,800
stay with Mr. Dog.

191
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,240
One day,

192
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,040
Cat went to a hill

193
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,200
and fell in the valley,

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,320
breaking one of his legs.

195
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,040
But luckily,

196
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,360
Cat met Chick in the valley.

197
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,720
Chick has round head,

198
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,480
big eyes,

199
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,600
and twitters every day.

200
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,120
She’s very happy every day.

201
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,640
Cat and Chick grow up together.

202
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,080
Chick has worries suddenly.

203
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,080
She begins to worry about

204
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,920
the world outside the valley.

205
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,720
Someday in the future,

206
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Chick will have to leave the valley.

207
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,760
What should she do

208
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,600
to face the strange world outside?

209
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,920
Cat holds Chick’s hands and says,

210
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,680
“Look at me when you’re scared.

211
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,840
I have visited

212
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,080
the outside world for you.”

213
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,200
You’re upset?

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,880
No.

215
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,160
Look, give me a smile.

216
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
I’ll give you a smile.

217
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,160
Leave me alone.

218
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,600
What happened to you?

219
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,800
My parents may divorce.

220
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,120
Why?

221
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,400
What happened?

222
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,480
I thought it was because of
my bad performance.

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,880
But it seems that I was wrong.

224
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,360
I can do nothing to help.

225
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,440
If your parents divorce

226
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
and get married with others,

227
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,760
you’ll get four red packets

228
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,160
in the Spring Festival.

229
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,040
So they divorce because

230
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,320
they want to marry others?

231
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
No.

232
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,640
I didn’t mean that.

233
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,440
Meng, I spoke out of turn.

234
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,880
Shut up now.

235
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,000
How about this?

236
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,040
This is a supreme comic card.

237
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,000
Swipe it anytime with my name.

238
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,480
Take it as my apology.

239
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,560
(Teachers’ Office)

240
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,480
Nothing serious.

241
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,560
I just want to know

242
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,360
something about Lu Miao.

243
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,080
What’s wrong with her?

244
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,480
She’s not in good state recently.

245
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,360
She slept in the class.

246
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,280
Now she even doesn’t do homework.

247
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,640
So I want to know

248
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,680
what happened to her.

249
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,720
I know

250
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,960
you’ve been supervising her study.

251
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,400
I hope you can

252
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,720
help her make some adjustments.

253
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,400
If she continues like this,

254
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,840
I will inform her parents.

255
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,440
I see.

256
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,560
Don’t inform her parents.
I’ll speak to her.

257
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,320
This is what I mean.

258
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,200
Uncle Lu.

259
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,040
Jiang,

260
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,120
you’re back so late.

261
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,800
Go back to have rest now.

262
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,800
Uncle Lu,

263
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,600
you didn’t smoke before.

264
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,040
Well,

265
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,440
I smoked occasionally.

266
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,880
Will

267
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,800
Aunt Fang come back?

268
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,720
She will.

269
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,040
Uncle Lu,

270
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
are you arguing with Aunt Fang

271
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,120
for me?

272
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,240
Silly boy,

273
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,080
you’re over thinking.

274
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,920
How could it be for you?

275
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,960
Go home and study now.

276
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,080
Come on.

277
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,400
I’ll add some fuel for my car.

278
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,080
Come on.

279
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,180
30th day of this month,

280
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,400
(Blue moon is coming)
30th day of this month,

281
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,120
(Blue moon is coming)
the second full moon will come.

282
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,480
The one who loves astronomy

283
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,180
may witness the wonder of blue moon.

284
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,120
may witness the wonder of blue moon.

285
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,480
How to make a webpage?

286
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
Look at this place.

287
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
I think we should make some adjustment.

288
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,000
But the text is not enough.

289
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,440
Jiang Haoyue,

290
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,960
are you kidnapped?

291
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,600
Look what you are doing now.

294
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,120
Fantasy girl style.

295
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,440
Isn’t it good?

296
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,840
It took me several hours last night.

297
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,200
For Lu Miao?

298
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,600
She’s upset recently.

299
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
I should do something

300
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,120
to cheer her up.

301
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,800
Life is difficult.

302
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Even you begin to do this.

303
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,000
But I don’t think

304
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,440
Lu Miao will like it.

305
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,840
She is girlish.

306
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,600
Are you sure she’s girlish,

307
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,480
not boyish?

308
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,440
Jiang,

309
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,840
why are you here?

310
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,560
Don’t you have night classes?

311
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,000
It’s 9:30 PM.

312
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
It’s so late.

313
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,280
Are you coming to ask me back?

314
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,280
I don’t want to go home now.

315
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,360
I’ll read some books here with you.

316
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,160
Look at this.

317
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,840
Don’t you want to make a wish?

318
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,680
It must be deceptious.

319
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Don’t you believe it?

320
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,320
But this leaflet is obviously fake.

321
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
Look at this edge.

322
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,360
It must be drawn by hand.

I will try again.

352
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,000
Not again.

353
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,920
Why doesn’t it come out?

354
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,680
She really believes it?

355
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,680
How could you ensure

356
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,480
she’ll get her lucky number?

357
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,760
It’s preset that the entered number

358
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,000
will come out after 50 tries.

359
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,280
50 tries?

360
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,320
How could you ensure

361
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,080
she won’t give up before 50 tries?

362
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,640
She will never give up.

363
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,960
Still trying?

364
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,240
Not again.

365
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,080
1 to 999.

366
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,600
There are a lot of possibilities.

367
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,280
Why not share the website link to me?

368
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,400
Let me give you a hand.

369
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,360
Can it be done this way?

370
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,520
The Wishing Guide

371
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,320
doesn’t specify it.

372
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,560
Forget it.

373
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,520
I should be sincere to make a wish.

374
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,560
I’ll do it myself.

375
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,760
I got it.

376
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,160
Impossible.

377
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,200
You got it?

378
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,560
I got it!

379
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,240
Well...

380
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,320
Is this the wishing pool?

381
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,600
It’s too scaring.

382
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,440
You see it now.

383
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,120
You may leave.

384
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,920
Are you sure?

385
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,400
You have a lot of work to do.

386
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,640
You can’t do it without me.

387
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,600
How did you find

388
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,640
such a shabby place?

389
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,040
I came here when I was a kid.

390
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,640
Hang all the wishing cards on the tree.

391
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,080
Well...

392
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,040
This tree is too big.

393
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,320
Jiang Haoyue,

394
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,400
it must be the first coin you made.

395
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,080
Thank you for your help.

396
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,320
Look,

397
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,480
Lu Miao is a high school student.

398
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,840
Will she believe this?

399
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
You have no idea.

400
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,280
She’s curious about everything

401
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,600
that science can’t explain.

402
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,480
For example,

403
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,640
she always bows to Conan

404
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,680
before exam

405
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,560
and draws lots before leaving home.

406
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,040
Or why would I

407
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,200
make such a coin for her?

408
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,600
I never expected materialistic

409
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,280
Jiang Haoyue would do this.

410
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,920
Sometimes, there is only a fine line

411
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,240
between Science and metaphysics.

412
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,880
30th day of this month,

413
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,360
the blue moon will come.

414
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,760
I knew you had something in reserve.

415
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,120
But what if it rains that day?

416
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,600
The blue moon won’t come in rain.

417
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,040
I checked it.

418
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,720
It’ll be sunny that day.

419
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,440
I’ll make her believe again that

420
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,760
miracle will happen.

421
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,360
It looks more like a wishing place.

422
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,000
Let’s go.

423
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,160
You received it?

424
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,840
I want to make a wish, too.

425
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,680
It’s too late.

426
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,840
I accumulate luck every day.

427
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,960
Never mind.

428
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,720
I’ll do it next year.

429
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,080
Don’t bother.

430
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,680
It’s just a coin.

431
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
Game coin is the same.

432
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,840
Jiang Haoyue.

433
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,880
Look.

434
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,200
This is my exclusive wishing coin.

435
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,160
I spent many days to get it.

436
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,440
Am I lucky?

437
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,320
I think this wishing coin

438
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,160
is really special.

439
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,320
Really?

440
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,560
You have good taste.

441
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,520
Let’s go. Time for class.

442
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
I’m leaving now.

443
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,120
Dad,

444
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,800
what’s wrong?

445
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,040
I got burned.

446
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,120
These days,

447
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,000
I felt more about how hard

448
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,360
your mom worked before.

449
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,440
She had to make money

450
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,200
and look after both of us.

451
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,280
I miss

452
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,400
the braised pork chops my mom cooked.

453
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,440
Hello, are you Lu Yongfei?

454
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Do you know Jiang Yi?

455
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,480
Yes.

456
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:57,880
What’s the matter?

457
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,520
He’s in our police station now.

458
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,760
What?

459
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,360
Come here now.

460
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,120
I’ll be there soon.

461
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,320
Have a drink?

462
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,720
With you?

463
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,120
Don’t you like betting?

464
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,480
Dare you bet with me?

465
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,240
For what?

466
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,720
If I drink more than you,

467
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,240
you quit betting.

468
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,080
Lu Yongfei,

469
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,240
I never lose to anyone in drinking.

470
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,360
Let’s go!

471
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,160
Drink!

472
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,360
Jiang Haoyue?

473
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,320
Are you going to make a wish?

474
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,640
Yes.

475
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,840
Looks like it’ll rain.

476
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,480
Why don’t you

477
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,240
quit?

478
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,520
No.

479
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,760
The leaflet says

480
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,040
that it’s a good day
to make wishes tonight.

481
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,160
She’s happy now.

482
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,080
I’d better not let her down.

483
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,360
I’ll go with you.

484
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,680
Don’t bother.

485
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,360
If it does rain,

486
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
it’ll be troublesome.

487
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,640
Let’s go.

488
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,480
Are you very curious?

489
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,480
Can you drink more?

490
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,080
Here,

491
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,360
cheers!

492
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,000
Cheers!

493
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,080
What do you mean?

494
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,880
You can’t drink?

495
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,800
You lose, right?

496
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,920
From now on,

497
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,800
can you stop coming to me for help?

498
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,480
I beg you!

499
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,840
Who can I come to?

500
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,000
I have no money.

501
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,400
Should I come to Jiang Haoyue?

502
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,000
Look,

503
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,480
you’re a good guy.

504
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,960
But

505
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,280
you hit my son.

506
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,600
You owe us

507
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,400
for all your life.

508
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,960
I admit

509
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,120
that I owe you,

510
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,320
but why should my wife and daughter

511
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,720
suffer with me?

512
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,600
Why?

513
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,360
I owe Jiang Haoyue.

514
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,920
I owe my wife.

515
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,160
I owe Miao.

516
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,720
But I

517
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,280
never owe you,

518
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,160
Jiang Yi!

519
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,480
You hear that?

520
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,240
I never owe you!

521
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,880
But you met me.

522
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,840
You deserve it!

523
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,560
Jiang Yi!

524
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,040
What?

525
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,620
Why not behave yourself?

526
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,200
(Spicy Hot Pot)
Why not behave yourself?

527
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,520
It’s cold today.

528
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,880
Let’s go back soon.

529
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,800
I’m afraid you may get sick.

530
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,040
I’m fine.

531
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,480
This is Qinglongwu.

532
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,720
It’s shabby here.

533
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,960
And it’s cold.

534
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,360
Why not make your wish the other day?

535
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,880
Maybe this eudemon

536
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,040
is so unusual.

537
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,920
Look, there is no one else.

538
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,880
It’s impossible to realize your wish.

539
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,520
Why not come the other day?

540
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,800
The fewer people, the better.

541
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,640
Then I’ll be an exclusive VIP

542
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,240
for this eudemon tonight.

543
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,640
I’ll make my wish now.

544
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,400
I wish...

545
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,720
I wish...

546
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,080
Bad luck!

547
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,080
Bad luck!

548
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,120
What are you doing?

549
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,080
I’ll go find it.

550
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,520
It’s too cold to stay in water.

551
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,600
It’s fine. I saw it falling in water.

552
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,520
I’ll surely find it.

553
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,640
No.

554
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,800
What if you get ill?

555
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,360
I won’t.

556
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,880
Don’t worry.

557
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,280
How could it be?

558
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,080
I’ll be anxious if you get ill.

559
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,960
You know?

560
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,960
It’s fine. I won’t get ill.

561
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,880
And there will be a blue moon tonight.

562
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
I will find my coin to make a wish.

563
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,600
It’s fake.

564
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,360
There is no eudemon,

565
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,640
no miracle.

566
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,520
No one believes this wishing pool now.

567
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,040
You believe it.

568
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,480
I know you believe.

569
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,280
When we were kids,

570
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,200
I saw you come here.

571
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,440
This is the only place you made a wish.

572
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,960
The wish I made then

573
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,160
hasn’t come true till now.

574
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,800
Do you give up?

575
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,960
I won’t give up.

576
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,840
Although I don’t know
what your wish was,

577
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,720
I believe it can come true one day.

578
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,600
So the wish I’ll make

579
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,280
will come true, too.

580
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,600
Jiang Haoyue, why are you here?

581
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,560
I’ll help you.

582
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,920
No. Jiang Haoyue, leave here.

583
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,200
Let’s find it now.

584
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,080
No. Leave here now.

585
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,960
I’ll leave after we find it.

586
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,280
I don’t want it. Let’s go now.

587
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,640
Didn’t you say

588
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,560
you wouldn’t give up?

589
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,600
But

590
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,120
your leg...

591
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,560
It’s fine.

592
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,520
Let’s go.

593
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,560
I mean it.

594
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,320

Mom,

does grandpa

641
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,960
feel better now?

642
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,960
Yes.

643
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,680
In a few days,

644
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,840
I’ll take grandpa

645
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,480
to a hospital near our home.

646
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,160
You mean you’re back?

647
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,880
Great!

648
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,360
Mom, look outside now.

649
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,840
Tonight,

650
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,280
the moon is blue.

651
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:17,175
(Lu's exfoliate gel)

(Lu's towel)

653
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,640
It seems that my dad is back.

654
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,920
I’ll tell him this.

655
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,000
Dad.

656
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,320
Dad.

657
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,120
My mom said she’d be back soon.

658
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,800
Great!

659
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,360
What’s wrong, Dad?

660
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,960
I’m fine.

661
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,160
Let me see.

662
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,600
How did you get hurt?

663
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,400
It’s slippery outside.

664
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,840
I fell down. It doesn’t matter.

665
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,120
Come on.

666
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,840
Sit on the sofa.

667
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,880
I’ll deal with it for you. Come.

668
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,800
How could you get hurt?

669
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,280
Is it hurt?

670
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,800
No.

671
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,400
Miao,

672
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,120
I want to tell you the truth.

673
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,040
What’s it?

674
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,680
Your mom

675
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,800
is angry

676
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,840
not because of money,

677
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,040
or your performance at school.

678
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,200
It’s all my fault.

679
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,480
I am too selfish.

680
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,760
Your mom is right.

681
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,120
I am not a real good man.

682
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,120
These years,

683
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,560
I wanted to be responsible for Jiang,

684
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,200
but I

685
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,200
ignored you and your mom’s feelings.

686
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,120
Sorry.

687
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,760
Dad,

688
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,960
Jiang Haoyue is our family too.

689
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,800
I support you

690
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,240
on this.

691
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,240
Miao.

692
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,640
My mom will understand you

693
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,600
like me.

694
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,200
She loves us so much.

695
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,760
She won’t leave this home,

696
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,640
am I right?

697
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,920
You fought again?

698
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,320
Lu Yongfei was

699
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,480
upset at home.

700
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,480
He vented anger on me.

701
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,880
Luckily, I’m strong enough

702
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,000
to beat him.

703
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,000
You beat Uncle Lu?

704
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,240
Why?

705
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,280
I am your dad, not him.

706
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,960
Just because of money.

707
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,640
(Bail Bill)

708
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,480
Lin Wenfang’s reluctant to pay for you.

709
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,540
She’s angry and gone.

710
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:31,560
She’s angry and gone.

711
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,600
Lu Yongfei

712
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,240
is crazy.

713
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,080
The artificial leg was paid by Uncle Lu.

714
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,640
So Aunt Fang and Uncle Lu argued

715
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,320
because of you.

716
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,160
Why are you mad at me?

717
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,280
They hit your leg.

718
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,680
They should pay for it.

719
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,520
Do you remember what my mom said?

720
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,760
She said,

721
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,760
you

722
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,880
are a bastard!

723
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,880
I won’t let you hurt them again.

724
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,360
Behave yourself.

725
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,240
Mom,

726
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,240
I decide to come to you.

727
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,160
Finally you think it through.

728
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,320
I want to go there soon.

729
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,640
OK. I’ll hand the formalities.

730
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,600
I’m so glad that

731
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,800
we can reunite soon.

732
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,640
When you come abroad,

733
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,520
we can get rid of Jiang Yi completely.

734
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,520
I wish my mom can come to see me soon.
