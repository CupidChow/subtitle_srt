Jiang Haoyue.

31
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,280
About this line,

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,920
I find it awkward.

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,160
Could you help me out?

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,920
Do I have something on my face?

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,960
Are you in a key class of liberal arts?

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,160
Yes.

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,920
It's terrible.

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,760
There should be many students

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,240
who can help you solve this problem.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,200
Ready, go.

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,480
It doesn’t matter, Miao.

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,160
We stand in the shape of trapezoid now.

43
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,560
One more time.

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,880
Okay.

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,040
You stand in your places.

46
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,000
Drop your basketballs.

47
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,920
Let’s call it a day.

48
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,520
I haven’t finished my homework
of Excellence Training Class.

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,680
I have a basketball battle this evening.

50
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,520
Then I will go home for dinner.

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,680
Well…

52
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,600
We haven’t finished our rehearsal.

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,160
The gala is around the corner.

54
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,480
Our rehearsal is not good.

55
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,960
It’s fine.

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,080
With our tacit understanding,

57
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,040
we can learn it very soon.

58
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,240
Let’s have a rehearsal tomorrow.

59
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,000
Che,

60
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,600
why do you think
we have tacit understanding?

61
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
Well,

62
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,720
think about our poor performance
in the class.

63
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,800
Do we have tacit understanding?

64
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,160
Can’t you be more serious?

65
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,880
Can’t we be more cohesive?

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,760
Aren’t we accompanying you
to practice?

67
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
Accompany me?

68
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,000
Isn’t it our show?

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,240
We represent the whole class.

70
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,280
Have you watched others’ shows?

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,800
How excellent they are!

72
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,760
At the beginning,
we agreed to have this show,

73
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,680
so as to leave some beautiful memories

74
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,480
for our youth, right?

75
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,160
But what about now?

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
In each rehearsal,

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,440
you had quarrels or became distracted.

78
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,360
Since you feel reluctant to rehearse,

79
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,880
then we won’t do it.

80
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,520
Let’s quit.

81
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,920
Anyway, I have nothing to do
with your youth.

82
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,200
What to do?

83
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,920
Why bother to ask?

84
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,040
Hello. Same as usual.

85
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,960
Super large. Much sugar.

86
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,720
Why are you alone?

87
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,240
I feel much better. It’s not crowded.

88
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,040
Here you are.

89
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,120
Okay. Thank you.

90
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,480
This show is terrible.

91
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
So funny.

92
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,760
I agree.

93
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,000
Is it too late to go?

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,640
It’s not late.

95
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,440
Let’s go.

96
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,300
(This show is terrible)

97
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:13,442
Guoguo,

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,560
go play basketball with us.

99
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,800
No.

100
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,440
There is a saying that
liberal mind brings health.

101
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,680
It’s petty of you to do like this.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,880
Nonsense!

103
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,840
What are you doing?

104
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,800
You’re so cold. Are you apologizing?

105
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
Am I cold?

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,640
Are you not?

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,400
Stand still.

108
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,160
Guoguo,

109
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,200
we will rehearse well afterwards

110
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
and leave a beautiful memory

111
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,960
for our youth.

112
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,280
In fact, I kind of like our show.

113
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,400
Of course, we have a good choreographer.

114
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,920
If we finish our rehearsal,

115
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,280
our show must win over other shows.

116
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,880
Words don’t work.

117
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,200
Just wait and see.

118
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,120
We won’t give you the chance

119
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,600
to use the practice room alone.

120
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,200
Right?

121
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,080
I mean if you apologize,

122
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,440
you have to take some action.

123
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,520
Of course.

124
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,000
Yushui North Street.

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,600
Here we go.

126
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,120
Let’s go.

127
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,940
(Class 10, Grade 1)

128
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,040
Cheers.

129
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,640
Here. Guoguo.

130
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,720
Have some barbecue.

131
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,760
Don’t be angry.

132
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,080
I was not angry long ago.

133
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,040
By the way, I think of a new plot

134
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,800
for our show.

135
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,440
I’ll use a basketball

136
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,000
to detect you two robots.

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,600
Never thought you actually
like playing basketball.

138
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,000
You want to fight against all mankind
with basketball as your weapon.

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,520
But at last, we two scientists

140
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,040
find your evil intention

141
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,920
and manage to resolve
the survival crisis of all mankind.

142
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,720
I agree with

143
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,640
your turning point.

144
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,440
But I think

145
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,840
I should dominate the universe
with basketball.

146
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,200
Because you look like a fool.

147
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,160
So I’m removing an evil
from the people.

148
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,760
You want to dominate the universe?

149
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,880
You are an idiot!

150
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,480
Look!

151
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,760
A fool’s true colors.

152
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,720
You…!

153
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,440
We aren’t eager
to dominate the universe.

154
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,000
But it’s been a long time
since we played basketball last time.

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,040
Che, how about

156
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,320
finding others and

157
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,440
playing basketball on the court later?

158
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,360
Alright.

159
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,960
I think we’d better go home for a rest.

160
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,200
We have to rehearse tomorrow.

161
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,800
We should get some exercise.

162
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,120
That’s right.

163
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,520
What if you get hurt?

164
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,160
Alright.

165
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,040
Stop that.

166
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,560
To celebrate the success of our show
in advance,

167
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,760
let’s drink this cola up.

168
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,000
Here.

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,880
Cheers.

170
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
I told you not to play basketball.

171
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,800
Guoguo, since you get hurt,

172
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,760
our show…

173
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,560
Mr. Wen, it’s no problem.

174
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,240
They’re still here.

175
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,760
Mr. Wen, please rest assured.

176
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,400
However, we will play this show well.

177
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,120
I don’t want to force you to do it.

178
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,440
We are not forced.

179
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,680
Mr. Wen, please believe in us.

180
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,760
We can make it.

181
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,040
Mr. Wen, please don’t cancel our show.

182
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,920
See? I’m alright now.

183
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Sit down.

184
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,560
Then continue your rehearsal.

185
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,320
Don’t bring disgrace upon our class.

186
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,080
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

187
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,560
Go back.

188
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,640
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,360
Let’s go.

190
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,640
Go.

191
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,080
I’m fine.

192
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,720
Help him.

193
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,200
I’m fine.

194
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,520
Heal your wound.

195
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,320
Okay.

196
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,960
Distinguished leaders,

197
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,440
teachers, and students,

198
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,840
this is the end of the New Year Gala.

199
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,880
The end?

200
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,560
Isn’t there a last show?

201
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,480
Lu Miao’s show?

202
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,360
I heard that someone gets hurt.

203
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,960
Their show may be cancelled.

204
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,160
Before it is determined,

205
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,040
don’t change the list.

206
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,800
Although we have made a promise
to Mr. Wen,

207
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,640
how on earth

208
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,680
will we turn the situation?

209
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,360
Our show is selected

210
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,560
just because of Guoguo.

211
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,600
So Guoguo can’t quit.

212
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,400
How about this?

213
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,200
Guoguo, let’s change places.

214
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,680
Can I?

215
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,840
Of course.

216
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,440
My movements are not hard.

217
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,320
I can learn your movements.

218
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,040
You walk while swinging your arm and leg
on the same side.

219
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,120
Let me do it.

220
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,040
After all, I learnt it when I was a kid.

221
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,400
How do you have the nerve

222
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,680
to say that you have learnt it?

223
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,800
It’s better than you.

224
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,240
I don’t swing my arm and leg
on the same side.

225
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,440
I volunteer.

226
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,200
I have good physical coordination.

227
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,320
How about me?

228
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Alright.

229
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,240
In this case,

230
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,320
we will select someone
in the fairest way.

231
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,480
What way?

232
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Che.

233
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,800
Don’t avoid it. You can’t avoid it.

234
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,040
It will happen sooner or later.

235
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,200
Come on!

236
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,680
Come on!

237
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,360
Come on!

238
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,960
Right, hang on.

239
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,760
Lower.

240
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,000
No.

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,240
Hang on. You can do it.

242
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,560
No,

243
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,640
I can’t.

244
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,840
Awesome!

245
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,240
Amazing!

246
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,800
You can!

247
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,840
You can, Miao.

248
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,720
You can do it.

249
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,040
Really?

250
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,280
In this case,

251
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,680
I’ll leave this heavy duty to you.

252
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,480
Go for it.

253
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,760
26,

254
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,040
27,

255
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,840
28,

256
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,400
29,

257
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,760
30,

258
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,840
31.

259
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,160
Jiang Haoyue, are you a pupil?

260
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,400
I don’t know what others told you.

261
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,800
But I want you to believe my words.

262
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,680
I bought this hair pin for you.

263
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,560
You look good when wearing it.

264
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,280
So,

265
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,440
keep wearing it.

266
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,000
Well…

267
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,400
Don’t pull my hair afterwards.

268
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,800
Come on! Hang on.

269
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
No.

270
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
I have a cramp, Guoguo.

271
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,880
One more try.

272
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,800
One more try. You can do it.

273
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
I can’t hold on.

274
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,540
How about you try my part?

275
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,160
The last time.

276
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,000
You can do it, Miao.

277
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,800
Up…

278
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,320
Stretch your leg first…

279
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,720
Down…

280
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,760
Up…

281
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,800
Where is my note?

282
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,800
Miao, you made it!

283
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,000
Miao, you made it.

284
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,560
Miao made it.

285
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,680
What happened?

286
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,840
It hurts.

287
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,880
Meng made it!

288
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,600
She made it.

289
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,480
It hurts.

290
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,320
Warm-up is over.

291
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,720
I try it again.

292
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,680
Be careful.

293
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,520
I can’t.

294
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,480
It’s fine.
You can make it after practices.

295
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,680
If you feel tired,

296
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,960
why not go downstairs?

297
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,400
I can practice on my own.

298
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,240
I never see you work so hard.

299
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,400
We have made an agreement

300
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,720
that we will leave a beautiful memory

301
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,280
for our youth.

302
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,200
After five years,

303
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,040
ten years,

304
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,000
or even longer,

305
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,280
I can tell myself with pride

306
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,880
that my youth is excellent

307
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,560
and I have no regret.

308
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,600
But

309
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,640
for most people,

310
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,080
they all have regret in their youth.

311
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,240
But if it is you,

312
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,520
you may have no regret

313
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,000
in your youth.

314
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,360
I will try it again.

315
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,840
One, two, three.

316
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,720
Students, please take your seats.

317
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,880
Please keep quiet.

318
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,640
Our gala is about to start.

319
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,920
This white shirt is very suitable
for you.

320
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,640
I chose a tie for you.

321
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,360
Wear it.

322
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,280
No need.

323
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,840
I have this.

324
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,960
Next, let’s welcome

325
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,160
the host and hostess,

326
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,800
Jiang Haoyue, Su Daifei.

327
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,000
Distinguished leaders.

328
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,160
Dear teachers,

329
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,120
classmates.

330
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,080
Happy New Year.

331
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,280
Welcome to the New Year Gala

332
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,320
of Nanfeng No. 1 High School.

333
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,120
How time flies.

334
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,800
In a twinkling, we bid farewell

335
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,040
to yesterday

336
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
and usher in a New Year

337
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,480
that we are looking forward to.

338
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,760
In this spring full of vitality, we…

339
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Look!

340
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,720
That tie…

341
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,680
It’s my hair pin.

342
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,200
Hair pin.

343
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,400
Okay, I got it.

344
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,320
Lower your voice. It’s embarrassing.

345
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,680
Let’s give our warm welcome
to Su Daifei

346
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,600
and her opening song.

347
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,556

For the sake of our students’ safety,

396
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,400
our gala will be finished

397
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,240
half an hour in advance.

Two.

We have no choice.

401
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,040
We have to choose one.

402
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,560
The other one will be canceled.

403
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,680
Which show do you think
will be canceled?

404
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,680
I think High Show of Class 10, Grade 1

405
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,600
can be canceled.

406
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,920
Because during the rehearsal,

407
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
someone got hurt.

408
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,880
But they made adjustment quickly.

409
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,760
And their show has a high degree
of completeness.

410
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,200
Jiang Haoyue,

411
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,160
I know it’s your sister’s show.

412
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,240
So you want to keep it.

413
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,040
But according to the actual situation,

414
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,520
this show has the risk of going wrong.

415
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,240
We once

416
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,360
went through the lines

417
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,520
without this show.

418
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,640
If one show has to be canceled,

419
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,960
it is the most reasonable choice.

420
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,240
You announce

421
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,480
based on the process without this show.

422
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,640
Leave the rest to me.

423
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,280
Chlorophyll, are you nervous?

424
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,520
No.

425
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,720
I’m nervous.

426
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,640
Adjust yourself.

427
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,360
Guoguo, go for it.

428
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,200
Go for it.

429
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,400
What do you think?

430
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,840
It’s good.

431
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,920
It’s my first time

432
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,000
to dance in front of so many people.

433
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,040
I even want to pee.

434
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,480
Mr. Wen,

435
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,960
are you here to cheer for us?

436
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,600
I’m telling you,

437
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,400
we’re not nervous at all.

438
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,040
Right?

439
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,560
Please rest assured.

440
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
I’m very sorry.

441
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,240
I may have bad news for you.

442
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,840
The lovers are rowing a boat.

443
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,560
Their boats swing to and fro. Glasses
are passed on from one to another.

444
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,800
Thank Luo Mengjie from Class 5, Grade 1

445
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,280
for her excellent show.

446
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,840
This classical music of guzheng

447
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,800
still lingers in the house.

448
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,720
What wonderful experiences

449
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,320
will the next show

450
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,120
bring us?

451
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,000
Next, let’s welcome Class 10, Grade 1…

452
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,280
The last show of Grade 1

453
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,320
is also the last one

454
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,480
of this gala.

455
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,240
Mr. Hat.

456
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,960
Welcome them with applause.

457
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,200
In this list,

458
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,680
isn’t there High Show
of Class 10, Grade 1?

459
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,400
Because of the bad weather,

460
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
one show has to be cancelled
temporarily.

461
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,240
Do you know about this show?

462
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,920
Is Shi…

463
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,520
It’s up to their arrangement.

464
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
I know you have

465
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,280
a lot of misunderstandings about me.

466
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,600
Can we have a chat after this?

467
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,320
What does the gala mean to you?

468
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,440
What?

469
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,000
For you,

470
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,520
you will accept compliments again

471
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,640
on the stage, right?

472
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,920
But do you know

473
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,560
this stage which means nothing to you

474
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,640
is a coveted opportunity

475
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,920
for many people?

476
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,360
You just said

477
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,520
this is the most reasonable choice.

478
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,800
Solving the problem through

479
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,840
depriving of other’s opportunities.

480
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,960
In my opinion,

481
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,920
it is extremely unreasonable.

482
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,280
I think

483
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,280
we have nothing to talk about.

484
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,640
Che,

485
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,600
we may have three days off

486
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,720
for the New Year holiday.

487
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,480
We have

488
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,280
a basketball battle.

489
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,880
Remember?

490
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,720
Ziye, would you join him?

491
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,640
What’s wrong, Miao?

492
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,080
You look sad. It’s unlike you.

493
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,040
It’s no big deal. Right?

494
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,360
In our youth,

495
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,000
there must be other beautiful memories.

496
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,560
Right?

497
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,160
Because of the bad weather,

498
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,720
this is the end of the gala.

499
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,280
Please take care when you leave.

500
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,000
Everyone, I want to introduce

501
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,680
the last show to you.

502
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,520
This show experienced a lot of setbacks.

503
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,400
But they never give up.

504
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,640
Many students and I

505
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,000
have witnessed their rehearsal.

506
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,600
In such a short period,

507
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
they joined hands,

508
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,120
performed their functions

509
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,040
and added glory to this show.

510
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,840
Finally,

511
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,200
they have this most expected show

512
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,320
tonight.

513
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,160
They are full of fighting spirit.

514
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,560
They are insistent.

515
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,960
For me, this process is the shiniest
in the youth.

516
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,400
Hurry up!

517
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,920
Let’s welcome

518
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,200
Lu Miao, Chen Guoguo

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,720
Shi Che, Xie Ziye

520
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,040
of Class 10, Grade 1.

521
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,520
Meng, hurry.

522
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:44,920
Go.

523
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,360
Go.

524
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,680
Go for it.

525
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,480
It starts.

526
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,320
Here, sit down.

527
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,600
It is finished.

528
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,000
Go for it.

529
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,760
Lu Miao!

530
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,680
Go for it!

531
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,640
My son is not bad, right?

532
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,560
Very good.

533
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
They are my students.

534
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,720
What do you think?
They’re not bad, right?

535
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,600
Class 10, Grade 1.

536
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,280
Let’s go.

537
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,120
Meng, are you ready to go?

538
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:33,640
Hurry up.

539
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,520
Coming.

540
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,560
Stop watching her.

541
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,120
Go.

542
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,360
Go.

543
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,040
Let’s go.

544
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,160
Lu Miao.

545
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,960
I want to apologize to you.

546
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,240
I told a lie

547
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,480
about the hair pin.

548
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,160
I just ran across Jiang Haoyue.

549
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,800
Why did you lie?

550
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,840
I think

551
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,640
I was a bit jealous of you.

552
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,800
He treats you specially.

553
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,120
I…

554
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,560
I like Jiang Haoyue.

555
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,240
I advise you to give up
as early as possible.

556
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,360
He won’t like you.

557
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,800
It’s fine.

558
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,920
I still like him,

559
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,640
even if he doesn’t like me.

560
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,160
Why?

561
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,960
I like him

562
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,880
not because I want him to like me.

563
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,160
Lu Miao,

564
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,040
you also like Jiang Haoyue,
don’t you?

565
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,200
When he was in Grade 1,

566
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,880
a bad girl from another school,

567
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,080
like you,

568
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,040
warned us in our school that

569
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,640
no one was allowed to like Jiang Haoyue.

570
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,760
It was fired up at the time.

571
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,320
But afterwards,

572
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,680
she became our friend.

573
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,160
Because

574
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,920
Jiang Haoyue doesn’t like anyone.

575
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,680
I’m going home.

576
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,200
I’m not a bad girl.

577
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,880
I’m just…

578
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,560
not good at studying.

579
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,280
It stops.

580
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,520
Here.

581
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,560
Let’s go.

582
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,080
Haoyue,

583
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,040
thank you today.

584
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,400
For what?

585
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,280
Our show

586
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,520
was almost canceled.

587
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,880
If your show was canceled,

588
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,840
my company for such a long time

589
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,120
will be in vain, right?

590
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,760
You look cool today,

591
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,560
especially with this tie.

592
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,240
Your show is also cool,

593
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,280
especially you.

594
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,280
Well,

595
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,560
What do you think of Su Daifei?

596
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,080
Why ask about her?

597
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:17,790
I can’t hide it.

598
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,600
Su Daifei likes you.

599
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,520
You call her name now.

600
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,320
Is it the point?

601
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,200
I said she likes you.

602
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,560
You know she likes you?

603
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,360
I know it now.

604
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,000
Jiang Haoyue,

605
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,200
how can you treat it lightly?

606
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,280
Girls from classes of literal arts

607
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
like to pursue boys

608
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,680
from science classes.

609
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,720
Just like that in the TV play.

610
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,440
At the beginning,

611
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,000
the boy doesn’t spare a glance
for that girl.

612
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,160
He thinks she has low IQ and EQ.

613
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,040
He doesn’t like

614
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,440
her appearance.

615
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,520
But at last,

616
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,000
they become enamored of each other.

617
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,480
I’m talking about an important thing.

618
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,600
Why do you laugh?

619
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,680
Although I’m inferior to you in studies,

620
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,560
I watch more TV plays than you.

621
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:15,920
I admit it.

622
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,560
I agree with what you said.

623
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,960
Truly, that’s the plot of TV plays.

624
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,520
It makes sense.

625
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,760
Right?

626
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,400
What’s more, she does well in studies.

627
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,680
They all say

628
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,480
you are a perfect couple.

629
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,160
In fact,

630
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,480
she doesn’t do so well in studies.

631
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,720
So you dislike her
because of her bad grades?

632
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,680
Grades don’t represent everything.

633
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,080
What’s the problem with girls
who have bad grades?

634
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,200
They also have

635
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,280
shining points.

636
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,520
You’re right.

637
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,560
Girls with bad grades

638
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,400
also have many shining points.

639
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,840
She is lovely,

640
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,680
enthusiastic,

641
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,000
and charming.

642
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,840
It’s perfectly normal that

643
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,720
I like her.

644
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,360
Well,

645
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,520
why do you speak for Daifei?

646
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,760
She’s absolutely not good

647
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,520
as you imagine.

648
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,160
Jiang Haoyue, stay awake.

649
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,720
You can’t have puppy love.

650
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,600
You will be in Grade 3 soon.

651
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,360
Puppy love will affect your study.

652
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,040
As No. 1 in your grade,

653
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,560
how can you take it lightly?

654
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,960
Do you know how many students

655
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,200
want to take your place?

656
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,160
I can’t have puppy love.

657
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Neither can you.

658
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,160
You hear me?

659
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,960
Let’s go.

660
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,960
Verbal statements are no guarantee.

661
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,920
Agreement of No Puppy Love?

662
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,780
Writing it down is more serious.

663
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Serious?

664
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,600
You?

665
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,360
Agreement of No Puppy Love.

666
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,640
Party A and Party B

667
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,280
sign this Agreement

668
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,160
based on the principle
of equity and justice.

669
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,040
Both parties shall

670
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:25,343
perform their duties

671
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:26,225
according to terms of the Agreement.

672
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:28,487
If there is a violation,
it can be settled through consultation.

673
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,560
If it can’t…

674
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,320
If it can’t be solved,

675
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,160
it’s up to Party A.

676
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,440
Party A and Party B
are childhood friends.

677
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,240
Given that both of them are minors,

678
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,093
young, innocent, and immature,

679
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,640
in order to not delay their study,

680
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,120
thereby they sign this agreement.

681
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,920
Article 1,

682
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,360
neither Party A nor Party B

683
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,160
has puppy love before becoming an adult.

684
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,920
Article 2,

685
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,720
both Party A and Party B

686
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
should keep a distance

687
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,840
from people of the opposite sex.

688
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,400
Article 3,

689
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,280
neither Party A nor Party B

690
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,960
call people of the opposite sex
pet name.

691
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,040
For example…

692
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,920
For example,

693
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,560
dear,

694
00:36:13,243 --> 00:36:14,320
darling,

695
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,520
and other similar words.

696
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,280
A little more trust,
a little less questioning.

697
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,320
Sign your name.

698
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:26,760
Here.

699
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,534
Here you are.

700
00:36:37,268 --> 00:36:38,200
I sign.

701
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,380
(Party A: Lu Miao)

702
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,600
I don’t care. I just want it.

703
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,120
You’re noisy. I can’t stand it.

704
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,456
See, our neighbors are laughing at you.

705
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,520
They’re not watching me.

706
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,040
Mom, buy me that.

707
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,760
Mom, please.

708
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,520
When did I promise you?

709
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,840
I just said…

710
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,760
Look!

711
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
This is the evidence.

712
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,160
I have written it down.

713
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,560
When did you put it in my bag?

714
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,080
I have put it.

715
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,800
I have written it down.

716
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,560
It’s true I promised you.

717
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,240
But I didn’t promise
I’ll buy it right now.

718
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,600
But I have been waiting for long.

719
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,640
How long?

720
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,520
We don’t buy it, okay?

721
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,920
No, I want it right now.

722
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,800
Mom.

723
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,120
Listen.

724
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,800
If you don’t behave well,

725
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,360
I’m telling you,

726
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,440
little monsters will catch you.

727
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,880
I don’t care. I’m leaving you here.

728
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,120
So scary!

729
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,360
Don’t frighten me

730
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,040
Mom, come out.

731
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,400
Anyway, I want it.

732
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,080
Mom, I want it.

733
00:38:13,618 --> 00:38:15,200
Adults are liars.

734
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,960
They cheat kids.

735
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,680
Is it for me?

736
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,640
Don’t cry. It’s noisy.

737
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,480
I’m not crying because of toys.

738
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,600
Really?

739
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,400
I cry

740
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,200
because Mom promised me

741
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,840
but failed to do it.

742
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,040
Adults don’t like to keep their promise,

743
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,640
do they?

744
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,520
I don’t know.

745
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,320
Haoyue,

746
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,600
will you keep your promise
when you grow up?

747
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,880
I will.

748
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,760
So will I.

749
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,520
It’s so funny.
