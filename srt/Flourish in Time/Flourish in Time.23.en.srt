Only 100 days left!

33
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:42,600
Only 100 days left!

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,240
You have to shoot ahead immediately.

35
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,780
Time is score!

00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,000

He never stops.

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,560
I hope you study harder!

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,560
OK.

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,920
Let’s begin our class.

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,080
I think I should learn more from Ziye.

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
- Count me in.
- Take out your paper answered yesterday.

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,320
So active?

44
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,160
I feel something strange.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,560
I will become a basketball talent

46
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
in the future.

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
I should study hard.

48
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,000
You should understand

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,480
the main parts of the question,

50
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,720
then you’ll know how to answer it.

51
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,000
Many students gave wrong answers,

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,240
because of the misunderstanding.

53
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,320
Given A1 B1

54
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,880
is perpendicular to the plane BCDE,

55
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,480
and plane A1 B1

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,400
intersects plane BCDE at B1.

57
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,600
From question 1,

58
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,040
A1O is perpendicular to the plane BCDE.

59
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,480
Got it?

60
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,680
But, why?

61
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,600
Did you look into her eyes?

62
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,280
Yes!

63
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,640
Who looked away first?

64
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,160
You

65
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,320
like that girl.

66
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,400
But,

67
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,920
why A1O is perpendicular to BE,

68
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,640
and A1O is perpendicular
to the plane BCDE,

69
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,360
Ziye?

70
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,320
What are you thinking?

71
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,240
I got it.

72
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,840
I’ll tell you.

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,640
Listen to me.

74
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,240
(Target score: 580)

75
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,060
The Sui Dynasty was unified in
(Target score: 580)

76
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,040
The Sui Dynasty was unified in

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,640
985,

78
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,120
no,

79
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,000
6,

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,400
7,

81
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,200
8.

82
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,760
It’s 589.

83
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,600
Keep it in mind.

84
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,680
I envy you so much.

85
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,640
How I hope I can remember everything

86
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,680
at a glance like you.

87
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,720
Did you recite these knowledge

88
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,600
by rote learning?

89
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,480
Didn’t you have other methods?

90
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,360
The essence of liberal arts

91
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,120
lies in rote learning, doesn’t it?

92
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,760
But I know you can remember

93
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,800
every comic at a glance.

94
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
How could you compare this to comics?

95
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,120
It’s boring,

96
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,520
but comics are interesting.

97
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
My comics!

98
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,240
When can I see you again?!

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,120
Ziye,

100
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,560
Miao!

101
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,160
Rule 8 of Love,

102
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,360
seating rule,

103
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,240
if a boy likes you,

104
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,140
he’ll choose the seat next to you.

105
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,280
Miao is really an

106
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,320
emotionless machine for doing exercises.

107
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,480
Thank you for praising.

108
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,080
What exercise are you doing?

109
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
Rule 9 of Love,

110
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,520
drinks rule,

111
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,560
if he drinks the beverage you drank,

112
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,280
it must be because he likes you.

113
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,280
Gosh!

114
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,280
Does this guy like me?

115
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,760
It tastes good.

116
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,640
Where did you buy it?

117
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,440
I’m going to the tutoring class.

118
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,240
I have to go now.

119
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,960
Let me give you a ride.

120
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,080
Don’t bother.

121
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,040
I can...

122
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,880
Go away!

123
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,960
I’m leaving.

124
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
What’s wrong with Ziye?

125
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,720
Why is she in such a hurry?

126
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,960
Che,

127
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,800
you’re in luck.

128
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,720
Buy some lotteries?

129
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,160
Is it good?

130
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,240
The left is higher.

131
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,660
(God rewards the diligent)

132
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,480
Turn around.

133
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,880
This is the left.

134
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,840
Yes, it is.

135
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,520
It’s my fault.

136
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,320
See, I knew it.

137
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,680
Is it right now?

138
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,040
Is it good?

139
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,440
It’s useless!

140
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,760
God rewards the diligent.

141
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,440
Is it useful?

142
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,160
It’s blessed by a master, you know?

143
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,440
It’s blessed?

144
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,040
The key to Gaokao is

145
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,640
time,

146
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,240
place

147
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,080
and people.

148
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,280
Sorry, master.

149
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,360
I was wrong.

150
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,880
Sorry.

151
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,260
Let’s take some practical actions.

152
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,180
What about

153
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,160
taking Miao out to get some fresh air?

154
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,760
Where to go?

155
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,000
Beijing.

156
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,920
To visit Jiang.

157
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,760
It’s too far.

158
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,360
She may be distracted.

159
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,680
Look, listen to me.

160
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
What’s in my mind is,

161
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,040
we didn’t take Miao out

162
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,600
these years

163
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,160
and they two grew up together.

164
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,880
When there was any problem,

165
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,400
they solved it together.

166
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,480
Maybe when she sees Jiang,

167
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,600
she will study harder.

168
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
She can’t rely on Jiang for a life.

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,160
It’s hard to say.

170
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,880
Hard to say?

171
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,760
What do you mean?

172
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,440
Be gentle!

173
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,080
Here.

174
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,480
Good.

175
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,120
Be gentle!

176
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,480
Your waist needs good treatment.

177
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,080
Be gentle!

178
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,480
Don’t shout for it.

179
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,800
Miao,

180
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,160
well,

181
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,800
this weekend,

182
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,400
let’s go out to get some fresh air, OK?

183
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:53,960
No.

184
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,520
Miao, think it over.

185
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,480
No.

186
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,920
It’ll disturb my study.

187
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,760
What did you say?

188
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,240
I said it’ll disturb my study.

189
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,280
You won’t go, even to visit Jiang?

190
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,560
No.

191
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,880
If there is nothing else,

192
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,080
I’ll go study now.

193
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,880
Look, she resembles me.

194
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,800
Determined.

195
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,040
Won’t be swayed by you.

196
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,920
Hello, delivery.

197
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,480
Coming.

198
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,840
Lu Miao.

199
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,200
Lu Miao’s?

200
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,040
Miao.

201
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,320
Your delivery.

202
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,960
Coming.

203
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,520
OK.

204
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,720
Take this bill, please.

205
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,120
Did you buy comic books again?

206
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,680
No, I didn’t!

207
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,520
Let me see.

208
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,880
It’s from Jiang.

209
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,120
It must be learning stuff.

210
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,680
Take it.

211
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,600
Go to study.

212
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,240
Che.

213
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,960
Which city will you go for university?

214
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,920
Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou or Shenzhen.

215
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,120
Where will you go?

216
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,040
I...

217
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,400
I should stay in the south.

218
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,360
It has a good climate.

219
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,640
What about Ziye and Miao?

220
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,960
Miao

221
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,800
must go to Beijing for Jiang Haoyue.

222
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,440
As for Ziye,

223
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,080
I heard she’ll go to Shanghai.

224
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,640
Shanghai?

225
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,640
Sounds good.

226
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,360
Che,

227
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,280
do you love Ziye?

228
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,680
Why do you say so?

229
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,440
Don’t pretend.

230
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
I can tell it.

231
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,920
You always mention her recently.

232
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,440
Actually,

233
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,680
I don’t know.

234
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,560
You don’t know?

235
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,600
How could it be?

236
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
When you were pursuing Miao,

237
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,520
you were not like this.

238
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,960
Well,

239
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,080
I didn’t think so much then.

240
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
I liked to play with her.

241
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,960
But love should be

242
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,840
more complicated than just playing.

243
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,960
I can’t tell it.

244
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,520
She’s so manly.

245
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,160
I think I’d better

246
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,320
be her friend.

247
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,640
Good, Che,

248
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,840
you can think for others now.

249
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,880
You can argue with me now.

250
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,960
Let’s go!

251
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,080
Waiting for messages?

252
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,360
No.

253
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,640
In the past five minutes,

254
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,800
you watched your phone
at least 10 times.

255
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,960
Lu Miao didn’t send me messages
for a week.

256
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,960
Has her phone been broken?

257
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
As a senior,

258
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,800
she’s too busy to send you a message.

259
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,040
It’s really a normal thing.

260
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,520
Don’t be so nervous.

261
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,200
No matter what,

262
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,440
she should have time for a message.

263
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,440
Why don’t you send her a message first?

264
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,720
No.

265
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,200
What if she’s studying?

266
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,960
I don’t want to disturb her.

267
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,560
How hesitant you are!

268
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,600
Is it

269
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,760
that she doesn’t need me anymore?

270
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,720
Why do you think so?

271
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,200
Since childhood,

272
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,080
except study,

273
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,840
I can’t help her with anything else.

274
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,280
Now she can study by herself.

275
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,640
I shouldn’t have sent her
so many papers.

276
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,354
(Congcong’s mom)

277
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,880
Lu Miao.

278
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,360
Mr. Jiang,

279
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,280
you are amazing!

280
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,440
You combine history knowledge
with comics.

281
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,840
You received it?

282
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,000
I hope it’s useful to you.

283
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,920
It’s really useful!

284
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,080
I never expected

285
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,600
the boring history knowledge

286
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,480
can be turned into comics.

287
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,440
I will definitely succeed this time.

288
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,520
I’m looking forward to your performance.

289
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
Thank you.

290
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,800
(Miao won’t visit you. Take care.)
You must be busy in the university.

291
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,840
I’m sorry to worry you with this.

292
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,640
I heard

293
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,320
you’re afraid I’ll disturb your study,

294
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,560
so you decided not to come here?

295
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,000
It will cost me two days.

296
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,760
I can do four sets of exam papers.

297
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,960
You’re so fond of doing exam papers?

298
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Yeah.

299
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,920
Every time when I do the exercises,

300
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,800
I think

301
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,000
I am fighting with the question setter,

302
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,160
which makes me very excited.

303
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Then I’ll give you a question.

304
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,760
OK. Go ahead.

305
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,720
Any real number plus 52.8,

306
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,040
then multiply 5,

307
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,760
minus 3.4343,

308
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,440
then multiply 2,

309
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,240
and less ten times of this real number,

310
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,040
calculate it.

311
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
You spoke too fast just now.

312
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,800
repeat it again.

313
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,760
No question will be repeated

314
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,160
in the listening exam.

315
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,840
Come on, calculate it.

316
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,720
521.1132.

317
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Never mind.

318
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Study harder.

319
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,040
I’ll stop disturbing you now.

320
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,800
You can give me another question.

321
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,600
Stop here now.

322
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,440
A real number.

323
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,520
Any real number

324
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,720
plus 52.8,

325
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,600
multiply 5,

326
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,680
minus 3.4343, and multiply 2,

327
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,080
and less ten times of this real number

328
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,840
equals

329
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,920
521.1314.

330
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,840
Jiang Haoyue,

331
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,480
you are so tricky!

332
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,000
But with Lu Miao’s calculation ability,

333
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,160
I think she’ll never figure out

334
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,400
what you mean.

335
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,480
Didn’t you listen to music?

336
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,480
Mind your own business.

337
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,760
Che, you’ve made
great progress recently.

338
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,320
Yes.

339
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,240
Skills improved.

340
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,440
I’m a genius.

341
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,400
You are here.

342
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,920
Let’s play.

343
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,600
Come.

344
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,560
I remember nothing.

345
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,400
Everyone.

346
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,040
Only five minutes left.

347
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,360
Please check

348
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,240
your name,

349
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,040
exam number,

350
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,880
and your answer sheet.

351
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,560
How come only five minutes left?

352
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,080
I haven’t started
writing the composition.

353
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
I’m doomed.

354
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,440
Everyone,

355
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,480
put down your pen.

356
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,840
Sweat and shed blood, no tears,

357
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,760
Move forward no matter what.

358
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,480
I have to finish my reading
before sleep.

359
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,520
I want to express my ambition,

360
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,000
with a dog in the left hand,
and an eagle in the right,

361
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,960
generals and soldiers come like a gale.

362
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,240
I want to express my ambition,

363
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,560
with a dog in the left hand,
and an eagle in the right

364
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,800
generals and soldiers...

365
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,640
Thunders...

366
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,360
the wonderful capability.

367
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,760
How long will the full moon appear?
Wine cup in hand, I ask the sky.

368
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,560
I drink alone and get drunk,

369
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,240
a couple comes into my dream.

370
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,760
Mr. Jiang?

371
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,400
Miao?

372
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,640
Why are you here?

373
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,920
I’m reciting my book.

374
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,920
Reciting?

375
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,680
You have to understand the poem

376
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,000
before you recite it.

377
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,280
Mr. Jiang, you’re drunk.

378
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,400
Go home and have a rest.

379
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:45,960
No.

380
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,880
No one is home.

381
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,040
Didn’t you promise Jiang Haoyue
you’ll quit drinking?

382
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,760
I’ll tell him if you continue drinking.

383
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,560
Did he call you these days?

384
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes, the day before yesterday.

385
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,640
The day before yesterday?

386
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,760
He didn’t call you yesterday.

387
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,160
Absurd.

388
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,800
I’ll call him for you.

389
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,120
Don’t, Mr. Jiang.

390
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,640
It’s too late now.

391
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,240
Is it that you miss him,

392
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,200
but you’re too shy to call him,

393
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,600
so you want to call him in my name?

394
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,240
I’m afraid that you miss him,

395
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,960
you know?

396
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,000
I do miss him so much,

397
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,840
but I’m afraid he’ll be disappointed.

398
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,720
How could he be disappointed?

399
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,040
Gaokao.

400
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,080
I’m afraid I can’t perform well,

401
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,760
and I can’t catch up with him.

402
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,720
Every time when I do the exercises,

403
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,600
I’m under great pressure.

404
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,280
I even can’t fall asleep.

405
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,600
Juveniles are not allowed to drink.

406
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,240
Why juveniles are not allowed to drink?

407
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,440
Why only adults

408
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,360
can drink?

409
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,640
We have a lot of exercises,

410
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,080
we have exams,

411
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,760
we have a lot of difficulties,

412
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,440
we can’t make it.

413
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,600
We have a lot of pressure!

414
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,240
When can the wine for juveniles

415
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,480
be developed and launched?

416
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,720
This little jerk,

417
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,040
can’t you give me a call?

418
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,400
Hello, Dad,

419
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,200
what’s up?

420
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,840
Nothing special.

421
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,240
It’s about the girl next door.

422
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,120
Lu Miao?

423
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,920
What’s wrong with her?

424
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,840
She...

425
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,560
She’s under great pressure recently,

426
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,480
and loses a lot of weight.

427
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,080
She even has dark circles now.

428
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,560
Look, Gaokao hasn’t come.

429
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,920
I’m afraid she may

430
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,760
ruin her health before that.

431
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,840
She’s very stubborn

432
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,600
and can’t listen to

433
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,440
others.

434
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,520
So I’m thinking,

435
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,160
if you can spare some time,

436
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,440
you may come back to see her,

437
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,760
and she may become better.

438
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,520
I get it.

439
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,360
I’ll be back in two days.

440
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,000
OK.

441
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,200
OK.

442
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,600
OK.

443
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
Bad performance, minus 2 points.

444
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,000
Like arguing, minus 2 points.

445
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,600
What are you doing?

446
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,720
Review Shi Che’s shortcomings.

447
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,120
Why should you do that?

448
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,320
Ziye,

449
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,800
do you like Che?

450
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,560
I...

451
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
I don’t.

452
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,200
Then there’s a problem.

453
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,480
He asked me to confirm it.

454
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,120
Confirm what?

455
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,840
You can’t deny it now.

456
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,800
I have no idea.

457
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,880
We’d better talk about it after Gaokao.

458
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,460
(7 days countdown to Gaokao)

459
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,040
Why are you here?

460
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,960
You don’t come to me,

461
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,640
so I come to you now.

462
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,040
Do your exercises.

463
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,640
I’ll have another bowl of rice.

464
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,680
She has a bad appetite?

465
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,040
Miao,

466
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,720
you’ve had too much food.

467
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,240
Your face is...

468
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,320
Really?

469
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,080
She loses a lot of weight?

470
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,840
She does have dark circles, doesn’t she?

471
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,800
I don’t think you are fat.

472
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
But I think

473
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,000
Jiang

474
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,160
lost a lot of weights

475
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,360
this semester.

476
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,760
I don’t quite adapt to the life outside,

477
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,200
I like the food here better.

478
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,520
Jiang,

479
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,440
since you are home,

480
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,720
your auntie will make
your favorite dishes for you.

481
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,560
Yes.

482
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,840
I’ll cook you my best dishes,

483
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,600
braise ribs with lucid ganoderma.

484
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,800
How long will you stay this time?

485
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,640
A week.

486
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,800
Just a week?

487
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,340
Hurry up,

488
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,520
ask what you want timely.

489
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,240
No ink.

490
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,960
No ink?

491
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,880
Here it is.

492
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Take these.

493
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,520
(Admission card)

494
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,980
Isn’t it the set of school supplies

495
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,200
Isn’t it the set of school supplies

496
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,440
you used in Gaokao last year?

497
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,320
You give it to me?

498
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,520
Wish you pass all the exams.

499
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,640
This set of school supplies

500
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,720
were used by you, the best student,

501
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,800
I surely can perform well in Gaokao.

502
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,400
Jiang,

503
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,880
I want to ask you a question.

504
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,440
When you arrived in Beijing,

505
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,920
did you have the feeling
of getting lost?

506
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,640
I mean

507
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,280
the feeling of unknowing where to go?

508
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,480
Unknowing where to go?

509
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,520
No.

510
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,120
I know I should go to the university.

511
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,640
You should say yes.

512
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,120
You have.

513
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,680
Well,

514
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,640
yes.

515
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,880
Then what?

516
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,880
Then,

517
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,720
you will

518
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,560
especially miss...

519
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,640
Miss what?

520
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,960
Miss Lu Miao!

521
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,480
Why are you laughing?

522
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,840
No anxiety.

523
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,080
No indolence.

524
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,600
No

525
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,080
Jiang...

526
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,360
No Jiang Haoyue?

527
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,800
Don’t mind these details.

528
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,000
Do the exercises.

529
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,520
Why no Jiang Haoyue?

530
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,800
I’m worried!

531
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Worried?

532
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,400
I’m worried I’m not good enough

533
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,080
to go to your city.

534
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,880
Lu Miao,

535
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,360
did you think about the worst result?

536
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,560
I dare not.

537
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,240
I thought about it.

538
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,600
The worst result is you fail in Gaokao.

539
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,560
Then you choose another university.

540
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,320
Or you choose to repeat grade three.

541
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,400
At that time,

542
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,240
we have to separate.

543
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,120
But it doesn’t matter.

544
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,800
You know,

545
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,720
Beijing has a lot of universities.

546
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,800
If you choose other university,

547
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,640
I can go there to find you.

548
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,760
If

549
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,340
you choose to repeat grade three,

550
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,400
I’ll do what I’m doing now,

551
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,040
come back to accompany you.

552
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
No matter what difficulty you’ll meet,

553
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,760
I’ll stay beside you.

554
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,520
If

555
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,640
this is the worst result,

556
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,560
can you accept it?

557
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,160
What about your study?

558
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,080
I can arrange my study well.

559
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,880
Don’t worry about me.

560
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,880
Will I become your burden?

561
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,280
In my mind,

562
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,880
Lu Miao is the best.

563
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:37,880
Really?

564
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,880
How come I’m so good?

565
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,520
Tell me the reasons.

566
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,880
When I went to a new city,

567
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,360
everything around was strange.

568
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
Strange street,

569
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,760
and strange people.

570
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,440
Since then,

571
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,800
I especially

572
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,960
especially

573
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,080
especially miss Lu Miao.

574
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,960
I thought if Lu Miao were here,

575
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,080
it’ll be great.

576
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,160
Jiang Haoyue,

577
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,120
I won’t let the worst result come.

578
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,560
You’ll fly higher!

579
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,940
Fly higher!

580
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:20,960
Fly higher!

581
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,060
(Pass the examination)

582
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,080
Dance like wild wind,

583
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,800
without any strings.

584
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,480
Dad,

585
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,280
did you wash your car?

586
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,680
It’s so clean!

587
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,320
Come, Miao,

588
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,320
look,

589
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,360
student in car, no honking!

590
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,040
Who dares to honk,

591
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,200
I’ll beat him.

592
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,720
Moreover,

593
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:42,920
come.

594
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,480
Moreover?

595
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,340
See?

596
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,460
Pass the examination.

597
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,280
Thank you, Dad.

598
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,120
What do you think of this car

599
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,480
I specially prepare for you?

600
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,280
Moreover,

601
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,220
I prepare this memo,

602
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,480
pass the examination.

603
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,160
7:00 tomorrow morning,

604
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,720
call Miao to get up.

605
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,600
Have breakfast at 7:30.

606
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,760
The breakfast is standard,

607
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,200
one fried bread stick and two eggs,

608
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
meaning 100 points.

609
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,280
Leave home at 8:00

610
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,800
and arrive at the exam venue at 8:30.

611
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,200
Thank you, Dad.

612
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,520
With all these blessings,

613
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,120
I will surely gain
a decisive victory in Gaokao.

614
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,000
That’s right.

615
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,040
Gosh, I have to go cook now,

616
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,920
or we’ll have to eat
what your mom cooks.

617
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,360
Let’s go, come on.

618
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,240
Come on.

619
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,840
Remember to

620
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,240
check your answer sheet repeatedly.

621
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,720
Don’t make any mistakes, OK?

622
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,960
Got it, Mom.

623
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,000
And

624
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,880
the mobile phone,

625
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,960
never bring it to the exam room.

626
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,080
Last year,

627
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,920
a kid took a phone to the exam room,

628
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,480
and his score became invalid.

629
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
I got it.

630
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,600
We’ll check it
before entering the exam room.

631
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,440
And

632
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,920
2B Pencil.

633
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,320
Is your pencil right?

634
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,480
Some parents said,

635
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,520
some scanners

636
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,120
can’t scan the characters
from other pencils,

637
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,320
- except 2B.
- No worries.

638
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,600
No worries, Mom.

639
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,800
Jiang Haoyue gave me

640
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,000
the school supplies he used in Gaokao.

641
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,320
Everything is good

642
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,840
and blessed by the top Gaokao scorer.

643
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,240
What else?

644
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,920
Stop talking endlessly.

645
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,600
Don’t you want her to eat?

646
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,880
I can’t remember it now.

647
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,600
Miao,

648
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,160
this is specially made for you.

649
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,640
Eat more.

650
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,400
Thank you, Dad.

651
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,520
Here, eat more.

652
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,160
Don’t listen to your mom.

653
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,440
I’m reminding her.

654
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,380
(Gaokao Features)

655
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,900
(10 things to do before Gaokao)

656
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,000
You scared me.

657
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,920
You scared me.

658
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,320
You scared me!

659
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,760
It’s so late.

660
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,880
What are you doing here?

661
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,920
10 things for parents to do
before Gaokao.

662
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,160
Ten?

663
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,520
Let me see.

664
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,520
I thought you’re better than me.

665
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,920
You are nervous too.

666
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
How can I not?

667
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,080
Gaokao is the most important thing
in life.

668
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,080
It says that,

669
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,000
Gaokao

670
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,040
tests mindset,

671
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,800
not only the students’ mindset,

672
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,240
but also the parents’ mindset.

673
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,160
So in front of our kid tomorrow,

674
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,280
we must keep calm.

675
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,800
I think I forget something.

676
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,000
How could there be ten things?

677
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,480
Did I finish them all?

678
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,200
I recorded them all.

679
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,960
Go have a rest now,

680
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,240
will you?

681
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,160
How could I?

682
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,200
I’m awakened by fright.

683
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,280
Ten things!

684
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,960
I didn’t do that much.

685
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,080
Look, I should pay more attention.

686
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,840
She didn’t take
her admission card and pens.

687
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,200
Go have a rest.

688
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,920
You record them all.

689
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,920
I’ll record them all.

690
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,640
Go have a rest now.

691
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,480
Go ahead.

692
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,000
Lu, we’re waiting for you.

693
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,240
Have you finished?

694
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,960
Right away.

695
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,400
Just a second.

696
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,200
I’ll be there soon.

697
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,600
Mom, is Dad alright?

698
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,640
He must have drunk too much
cool milk last night,

699
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,480
and hurt his stomach.

700
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,080
Time is running out. We have to go now.

701
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,880
What to do?

702
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,800
Lu,

703
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,400
how are you?

704
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,240
Done.

705
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,520
Let’s go now. Time is tight.

706
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,840
Can you do it?

707
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,400
It’s fine.

708
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,120
Mom, you send Dad to the hospital,

709
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,200
I can go there by taxi.

710
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,680
How could it be? I...

711
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,480
What to do now?

712
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,040
What about letting my dad drive the car?

713
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,640
OK.

714
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,720
I’ll collect my stuff now.

715
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,520
I’ve packed it for you.

716
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,680
You can take it and go.

717
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,520
Let’s go. Time is tight.

718
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,560
Wait for me!

719
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,000
Lu, we’re leaving now.

720
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,240
You go to the hospital by yourself.

721
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,920
Do you take all the things?

722
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,800
Yes.

723
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,920
Is there enough time?

724
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,040
Yes, I think so.

725
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,440
What’s up?

726
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,320
Gosh,

727
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,520
I left too hurriedly
to turn off the fire.

728
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,600
If we return home now...

729
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,760
It’ll be late.

730
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,200
I’ll go back to do it.

731
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,560
Go for it. Waiting for your good news.

732
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,600
OK.

733
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,800
Take it slow.

734
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,080
Be careful!

735
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:25,800
Let’s go!

736
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,160
Is there still time?

737
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,840
Yes.

738
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,000
Everyone,

739
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,720
after ten years of hard study,
you’ll have the final exam today,

740
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,120
I hope you succeed in the exam.

741
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,000
- Go for it.
- Go for it.

742
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,600
When you are in the exam room,

743
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,680
don’t answer the questions hurriedly.

744
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,200
Take it easy.

745
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,000
Keep calm.

746
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,360
I believe you can do it.

747
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,960
Now, take out your admission cards

748
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,080
and get ready to enter the exam room.

749
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,800
Thank you, teacher.

750
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,600
Go for it.

751
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,640
Let’s go!

752
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,160
Go for it.

753
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,040
It’s fine.

754
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,160
Go for it.

755
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,640
I’ll stew pork for you tonight!

756
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,280
It’s wrong. What to do now?

757
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,320
What shall I do?

758
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,800
What to do?

759
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,080
Make way!

760
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,320
Let’s go!

761
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,260
(Mr. Jiang)

762
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:46,820
Hello.

763
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:47,980
Hello.

764
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
Jiang Haoyue!

765
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,400
I took the wrong admission card.

766
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,960
I took yours.

767
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,280
Don’t get into a flap.

768
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,520
Do you remember where you put it?

769
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,560
I put it in the center of my desk.

770
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,400
My mom has gone back now.

771
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,320
I don’t know
whether she can come back in time.

772
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,200
It’s half an hour left.

773
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,040
I’ll send it to you.

774
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,120
Don’t worry.

775
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,560
OK.

776
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,880
Lu Miao, what’s wrong?

777
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,240
I took the wrong admission card.

778
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
Mr. Lu.

779
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,560
Mr. Lu.

780
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,320
What to do, Mr. Wen?

781
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,400
Don’t worry.

782
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,680
I’ll check it for you.

783
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:26,840
Mr. Lu.

784
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,960
Jiang, how’s everything going?

785
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,160
Have you arrived?

786
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,280
Are you home now?

787
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,000
I’m on the way to the hospital.

788
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,120
Sir, how long will we need?

789
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,360
The road ahead is blocked for the exam.

790
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,520
We can’t get in.

791
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,920
A student doesn’t take
her admission card,

792
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,440
what should we do now?

793
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,680
Sir, please stop
at the next intersection.

794
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,360
OK.

795
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,840
Sir, may I borrow your bike?

796
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,000
Yes. Ride safely.

797
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,880
Thanks.

798
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,320
Why hasn’t that girl entered the room?

799
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,000
She forgets to take her admission card.

800
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,760
What a careless girl!

801
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,560
Even she can enter the room,

802
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,720
she can’t stay calm.

803
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,200
Make way!

804
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,400
