It’s for me?

00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,600
It’s for me?

32
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,560
Mm.

33
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,340
How’s it? Is it delicious?

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,760
Are you really not going to leave?

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,480
Mm.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,760
This?

37
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,880
Just forget it.

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,520
I just said it casually.

39
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,880
It’s good for you to study abroad.

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,240
It’s the same in China.

41
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,480
What’s more,

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,840
it’s my decision.

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,400
Well…

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,560
what about Ms. Chen?

45
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,320
Whether I go abroad or not

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,960
doesn’t really matter

47
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
to her.

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,880
After long escape,

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,080
I have to learn to

50
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,240
face it, right?

51
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,480
Fortunately,

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,440
when that day comes,

53
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,560
I’m strong enough

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,080
to face them.

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,600
Jiang Haoyue.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
No matter where you go

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,120
and what you want to do,

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,120
I will stay with you.

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,040
Then

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,080
keep your words.

61
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,760
Tell me,

62
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,160
if the end of the world is the sea,

63
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,040
where does the sea end?

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,640
The sky.

65
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,120
Where does the sky end?

66
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,600
Maybe the universe.

67
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,360
Where does

68
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,040
the universe end?

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,400
The chocolate.

70
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,520
You can eat as much as you like.

71
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,960
Uncle, let me help you.

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,640
Don’t bother, Jiang.

73
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,320
I can do it myself. It’s okay.

74
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,120
Don’t get your shoes dirty.

75
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,920
Okay.

76
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,160
Come here. You wash this side.

77
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,880
Okay.

78
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,240
Jiang.

79
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,440
Miao told me

80
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,600
that you are not going abroad.

81
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,840
Yes.

82
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,560
If you’re worried about your dad

83
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,640
or about us,

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,880
there’s no need for it.

85
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,080
Just do what you want.

86
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,800
Uncle.

87
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,080
Let bygones

88
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,720
be bygones.

89
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,120
It’s my life.

90
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,680
I should learn to live with it.

91
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,480
In fact,

92
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,000
it’s my choice to stay here.

93
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,800
Follow my heart,

94
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
and I’ll live more comfortably.

95
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,560
Thanks for your kindness.

96
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,780
I’ll repay you in the future.

97
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,320
(Fees of medicine, rehabilitation)
I’ll repay you in the future.

98
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,860
(and others are 2,737 yuan)

99
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,640
Uncle.

100
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,440
Don’t just stand there.

101
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,800
Help me wash the car.

102
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,920
You brat.

103
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay.

104
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,440
Wash it clean.

105
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,640
The soup is ready.

106
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,560
Jiang.

107
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,480
Have a taste of my cooking.

108
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,880
Uncle, it looks delicious.

109
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,320
Come on. Help yourself.

110
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,000
Miao, eat.

111
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,720
If only my mom were here now.

112
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,880
When your grandpa gets better,

113
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,280
your mom will come back.

114
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,960
Let’s eat.

115
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,200
Your mom’s call.

116
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,440
Is she coming back?

117
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,080
Fang.

118
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,840
I know.

119
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
What’s the matter, Dad?

120
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,960
Is she coming back?

121
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,080
Miao.

122
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,920
Let’s pack up after dinner

123
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,760
and go to your grandpa’s home.

124
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,320
Your grandpa...

125
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,680
There are still dishes.

126
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,320
Help yourselves.

127
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,760
Miao.

128
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Help yourselves.

129
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,720
Fang.

130
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,920
Miao, you’re here.

131
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,280
Mom.

132
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,800
Let me introduce you.

133
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,200
This is your uncle.

134
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,640
Hello, uncle.

135
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,880
Here you are.

136
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,600
Miao,

137
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,640
sit over there with your aunt.

138
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,840
Sit here.

139
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,840
Help yourselves.

140
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,120
Let’s sit together.

141
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,240
Help yourselves.

142
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,880
Okay.

143
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,000
Are you alright?

144
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
I’m fine.

145
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,720
Look what your grandpa brought for you.

146
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,360
Let me see.

147
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,640
Your favorite snacks.

148
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,880
Thank you, Grandpa.

149
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,240
Remember,

150
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,920
don’t let your grandma and mom see it.

151
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,120
Got it.

152
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,400
Go. Let’s go home.

153
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,240
Take care.

154
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,840
Don’t bother to see us off.

155
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,920
Take care.

156
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,880
Be careful.

157
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,840
Fang, have a cup of tea.

158
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
Take a rest if you’re tired.

159
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,920
Don’t worry

160
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,160
about work.

161
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,400
As for the money,

162
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,320
let me manage it.

163
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,440
You really think I’m for money?

164
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,680
We’re a family.

165
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,920
A family.

166
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,680
I know.

167
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,280
It’s all my fault.

168
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,040
These years,

169
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,880
you’ve suffered a lot.

170
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,600
You and Miao

171
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,800
have suffered a lot with me.

172
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,800
You’re a yesman.

173
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,440
You’re right.

174
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
I’m a yesman.

175
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,280
I want to take on everything.

176
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,720
But without you,

177
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,400
I can’t do anything.

178
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,400
Sorry.

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,800
It’s the same as before.

180
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,520
Haoyue.

181
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,720
I came back

182
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,680
to take you away this time.

183
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,320
Mom.

184
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,160
I’m not going to leave.

185
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,800
If you go on living with him,

186
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,600
you won’t have a future.

187
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,080
In such an environment,

188
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,440
you can only become

189
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,400
a second Jiang Yi.

190
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,520
Just like this old house,

191
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,560
he won’t change.

192
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,440
Don’t hope for it.

193
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,320
I was incapable.

194
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,960
But now I’m capable

195
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,240
and I can take you away.

196
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,400
Do you want to hold up your life

197
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,200
for such a person?

198
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,560
I had a car accident when I was a kid,

199
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,600
and you never came to see me.

200
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,680
Were you also afraid
that I would hold up your life?

201
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,440
When I was in the hospital,

202
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,600
I hoped you could see me every day,

203
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,240
but you never came.

204
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,640
I thought

205
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,360
he stopped you,

206
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,440
but later I realized.

207
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,240
You are my mother.

208
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,800
If you really wanted to see me,

209
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,120
no one could stop you.

210
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,440
I know,

211
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,600
he shirked his duty as a husband,

212
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,360
and you shirked your duty as a mother.

213
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,400
But now

214
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,840
I don’t want to shirk.

215
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,520
These years,

216
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,840
I’ve had a hard time.

217
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,680
But I never regret

218
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,240
that I left.

219
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
I gave myself

220
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,800
a chance to make a fresh choice.

221
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,280
You should also give yourself

222
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,240
a chance to make a choice.

223
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Haoyue.

224
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,040
As long as you agree to go with me,

225
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,040
I’ll make it up to you.

226
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,720
Trust me, okay?

227
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,280
Remember this?

228
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,920
You left it to me.

229
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,520
All these years it

230
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,800
has stopped at the moment you left me,

231
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,720
the moment I lost everything.

232
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,160
But it doesn’t matter.

233
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,960
Now,

234
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,440
it can work again.

235
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,600
I have prepared

236
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,560
a sum of money for you

237
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,840
over the years.

238
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,000
At least

239
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,480
I gave you a chance to make a choice.

240
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,680
I never forget

241
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,160
the promise I made to you.

242
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,960
You are back.

243
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:41,840
Let go.

244
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,400
Come with me.

245
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,240
Let me go.

246
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,480
Go away with her.

247
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,400
Get away.

248
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,800
Get away.

249
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,560
You can’t help him up.

250
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,040
Even if you help him up this time,

251
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,040
can you help him up
for the rest of his life?

252
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,200
Mom,

253
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,040
is your home abroad?

254
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,760
Of course.

255
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,240
My family is there.

256
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,640
So my home is right there.

257
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,080
But my family is here.

258
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,760
Here is my home.

259
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,760
Stand up.

260
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,440
Good boy.

261
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,880
Good boy.

262
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,720
What are you looking at?

263
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,480
Do you still remember

264
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,960
the dessert shop
at the gate of our school?

265
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,720
After school, many parents

266
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,040
lined up

267
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,440
to buy taro balls for their children.

268
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,920
At that time,

269
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,680
I also hoped every day

270
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,360
that my mother

271
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,240
would pick me up from school

272
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,560
with a big bowl of taro balls.

273
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,480
But she never appeared.

274
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,520
I remember the first time
I ate taro balls.

275
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,160
They’re from your father.

276
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,880
He always gave you

277
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,360
the bowl with the most taro balls.

278
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,160
In my childhood, I was always

279
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,360
angry with him about it.

280
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,680
When my mother left,

281
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,480
I chased her car

282
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,960
for two blocks,

283
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,360
but she didn’t look back.

284
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,960
I should have known at that time

285
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,080
that she would never come back.

286
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,120
She left again today.

287
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,160
I thought

288
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,720
I would get upset

289
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,640
and hate her just like I did

290
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,400
when I was a child,

291
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,120
but I didn’t.

292
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,080
I looked at her

293
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,280
as if she were a stranger.

294
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,720
That’s okay.

295
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,200
I let myself go

296
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,080
and also let her go.

297
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
Mr. Jiang.

298
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,400
You have had a hard day today.

299
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,240
I’m very lucky

300
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,400
to meet you.

301
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,880
You scared me!

302
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,040
I’m sorry.

303
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,400
Why are you sitting here?

304
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,840
It’s cool here.

305
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,960
I see.

306
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,040
You’re afraid to disturb Jiang at home.

307
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,080
I’m sorry

308
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
to hit you last time.

309
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,080
You were also badly hurt.

310
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,680
Don’t mention it.

311
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,760
No.

312
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,280
Come on.

313
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,320
Let’s make it clear.

314
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,280
To be exact,

315
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,560
I beat you up.

316
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,040
Look at you.

317
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,620
What can I say to you?

318
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,140
You’re more nice than wise.

319
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,800
Really!

320
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,380
Ziye.

321
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,100
Ziye.

322
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,160
You came here to give me water.

323
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,440
It’s my…

324
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,120
Ziye, you’ve come at the right time.

325
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,840
Let’s play it together.

326
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,160
No, I can’t.

327
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,640
Don’t go. I can teach you.

328
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Right. Let’s go.

329
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,840
Do you really play basketball?

330
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,440
You didn’t make any shot.

331
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,140
How about this?

332
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
A great shot, right?

333
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,440
There’s no defense.

334
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,800
It’s very normal to shoot a basket.

335
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,800
You talk as if you can.

336
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,720
Come on.

337
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,680
Now you do it.

338
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,440
Yes, Ziye. Take a shot.

339
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,280
Have a try

340
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,440
since you’re here.

341
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,480
Okay, Che.

342
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,240
You teach her.

343
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,840
I’ll have a rest.

344
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,840
Hang your elbows naturally.

345
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,360
Hold the ball before your chest.

346
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,400
Look at the basket.

347
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,760
Aim at the spot on the basket.

348
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,000
Keep your feet apart.

349
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,440
Flex your knees slightly.

350
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,200
Open your hands.

351
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,200
Your palms may not touch the ball.

352
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,720
Position your right forefinger
in the middle of the ball.

353
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,720
Push the ball upward and shoot.

354
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,560
Make your hands in an inverted V-shape,

355
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,080
ensuring your vision is not blocked.

356
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,760
Attention.

357
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,720
Position your elbows, wrists,

358
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,600
and shoulders

359
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,120
so that they’re perpendicular.

360
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Are you listening to me?

361
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,520
I’m listening.

362
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,720
So that they’re perpendicular.

363
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,640
I’m listening.

364
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,040
Aim at the basket.

365
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,600
Get ready to jump.

366
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,120
Position your feet
so they’re in line with the basket.

367
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,080
Relax.

368
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
I’m relaxed.

369
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,480
Your wrists are stiff.

370
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,160
Three, two, one, shoot.

371
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,960
A bad shot.

372
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,680
Uncle.

373
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,920
I finally shot it.

374
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,560
Uncle.

375
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,320
Pass the ball. Thank you.

376
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,520
Uncle?

377
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,440
Little jerk.

378
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,200
I’m not that old.

379
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,000
What do you want?

380
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,680
Do you play basketball?

381
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,360
Of course.

382
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:43,920
What?

383
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,960
Let’s play it.

384
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,760
Mr. Lu.

385
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
Shi.

386
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,640
You know him?

387
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,000
He is Lu Miao’s classmate.

388
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,720
Are you Miao’s father?

389
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
- Hello, Mr. Lu.
- Hello, Mr. Lu.

390
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,000
Hello.

391
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Let me introduce him.

392
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,080
You know Jiang Haoyue, right?

393
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,320
He is Jiang Haoyue’s father.

394
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,960
Scholar-tyrant’s father?

395
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
They don’t look like father and son.

396
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,040
Hey, boy.

397
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,440
Let’s play a game.

398
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,280
Okay?

399
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,640
Respect the old.

400
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,680
So you first.

401
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,640
Be careful.

402
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,080
I’ll show you no mercy.

403
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,640
Come on.

404
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:23,960
Come on.

405
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,120
Here.

406
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,760
Hey you.

407
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,480
Be careful.

408
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,480
Are you serious?

409
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,360
Catch the ball.

410
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,280
Pick and roll.

411
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
So cool.

412
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,040
Switch. Switch.

413
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,920
Good.

414
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,640
Good shot.

415
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,640
Well done.

416
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:00,960
- Che.
- How are you?

417
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,760
Are you alright?

418
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,560
I’m fine.

419
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,160
I’m going to buy some water.

420
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:07,960
Che.

421
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,960
How about your foot?

422
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,640
Nothing. It’s just sprained.

423
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,360
Spray some medicine and it’ll be fine.

424
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,080
Bros.

425
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,760
I underestimated you.

426
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,240
Please accept my apology.

427
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,840
He calls us bro?

428
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,160
Thank you.

429
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,000
You sure you’re alright?

430
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,760
Sure, I’m fine.

431
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,600
Let’s go on if you’re fine.

432
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,920
Uncle, I haven’t finished my homework.

433
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,760
My parents will be worried.

434
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,920
Go back now.

435
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,240
Uncle, bye-bye.

436
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,200
Remember to spray the medicine.

437
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,520
Hey you.

438
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,360
Thank you.

439
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,320
Jiang Yi, sit down.

440
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Have you sprained your ankle?

441
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,920
No.

442
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,400
You have.

443
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,560
I just poked my toes.

444
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
Let’s celebrate.

445
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,720
How about buying some wine to celebrate?

446
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,840
No, I’m on the wagon.

447
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,400
Just drink this.

448
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,800
You’ve changed a lot.

449
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,200
You quit drinking.

450
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,480
I’ve been a jerk

451
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,800
most of my life.

452
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,920
I’ve got used to it

453
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,760
and become numb.

454
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,960
But Haoyue decided not to leave.

455
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,040
He said he wanted to stay with me.

456
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,280
He told his mother

457
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,760
that

458
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,680
I’m not his burden.

459
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,280
I just realized

460
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,720
how much I owed him

461
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,760
over the years.

462
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,120
I’m trying to

463
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,400
be a qualified father.

464
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,160
I closed the mahjong parlor.

465
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,200
I want to do some decent business.

466
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,160
I may not succeed,

467
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,080
but I want to give it a try.

468
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,960
It’s not too late now.

469
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,280
Get your hand off.

470
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,200
No way.

471
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,000
Che, what have you had lately?

472
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,560
Are you gaining weight?

473
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,960
You’re too heavy!

474
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,840
I don’t think so.

475
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,880
Oh, you’re putting
all your weight on me.

476
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,480
Are you a man?

477
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,280
Ziye is as thin

478
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,640
as a stick.

479
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,600
What if I hurt her?

480
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,160
What are you saying?

481
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:11,680
Are you okay?

482
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,400
It hurts.

483
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,320
I just give a kick softly.

484
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,360
It’s OK. I’m just kidding.

485
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,160
Childish!

486
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,960
Ziye.

487
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,680
Do you think

488
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,280
I lost face on the basketball court?

489
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,600
To be honest, I think so.

490
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,400
You lost face indeed,

491
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,240
but you’re cute.

492
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,920
Why are you so happy
after losing the game?

493
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,600
None of your business.

494
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,720
Hos before bros.

495
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,000
Who are you talking about?

496
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,560
You.

497
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,600
Chen Guoguo, come back.

498
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,440
Come back.

499
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
Come on. Come on.

500
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:57,880
Come here.

501
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,440
Now you know how heavy he is.

502
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,200
So heavy.

503
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,240
Enough!

504
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
Haoyue.

505
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,120
Aunt.

506
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,120
You’ve been busy lately, haven’t you?

507
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,040
I’ll take the college
entrance exam next week.

508
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,440
So I’ve been studying
at school in the evening.

509
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,720
It must be very hard.

510
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,120
You…

511
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,480
These are…

512
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,320
Are you going to have these for dinner?

513
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,560
Don’t eat these anymore.

514
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,640
Come home with me for dinner.

515
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,480
It’s convenient.

516
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,560
Thank you, Aunt.

517
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,320
You’re welcome.

518
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,280
Let’s go home for dinner.

519
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,360
Dinner will be ready soon.

520
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,600
The soup is almost done.

521
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,040
Hello, Uncle.

522
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,600
Hello.

523
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,440
You’re back.

524
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,200
We came back just in time.

525
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,800
Jiang Haoyue.

526
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,360
Jiang Haoyue.

527
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,160
Why are you here?

528
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,120
There’s a special guest.

529
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,560
Put it down.

530
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,440
Haoyue.

531
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,000
Sit down.

532
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,240
Try the chicken soup I made.

533
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,120
Here, put it in the middle.

534
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,540
Haoyue.

535
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,440
Put it in the middle.

536
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,200
Come on.

537
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,080
Have a taste.

538
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,080
Jiang.

539
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,760
It will be tastier than your aunt’s.

540
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,600
I met Jiang downstairs.

541
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,240
Look at these.

542
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,680
Instant noodles and snacks.

543
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,880
These are his dinner.

544
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,400
Parents pay high attention to

545
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,240
their children in the third grade.

546
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,200
But look at your family.

547
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,280
It’s quite different.

548
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,680
Stop it.

549
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,320
Mrs. Lu.

550
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,880
You’re right.

551
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,960
I’m…

552
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,360
I am a jerk.

553
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,760
Here.

554
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,960
Eat soup.

555
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,320
Here you are.

556
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,400
Eat this, Haoyue.

557
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,560
Thank you, Aunt.

558
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,840
You need more nutrition.

559
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,560
I want to eat it too.

560
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,720
Look at you.

561
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,240
These are for Haoyue.

562
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,160
He is in the third grade now.

563
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,120
It’s okay. I can’t finish them.
Here you are.

564
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,480
Yes.

565
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,040
I’m afraid he can’t finish them,

566
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,760
so I want to eat.

567
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,120
Look, Haoyue is so sensible.

568
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,480
Have one.

569
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,240
- Thank you.
- Eat.

570
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,920
Thank you.

571
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,360
Take your time.

572
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,820
(No.1 Middle School)

573
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,440
Jiang Haoyue is awesome.

574
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,640
He really is.

575
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,960
He’s the top scorer in the province.

576
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,420
(Congratulations to Jiang Haoyue)

577
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,700
(on being the top scorer in the province
with a total score of 702)

578
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,160
Students and parents,

579
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,320
please go to the computer room

580
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,080
to apply for the college.

581
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,360
(Class 1, Grade 3)

582
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,120
Haoyue.

583
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,760
Sorry.

584
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,920
Why are you here?

585
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,040
Have you applied yet?

586
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,320
What major did you apply for?

587
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,200
Astrophysics.

588
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,640
Astrophysics.

589
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,360
It’s an unpopular major.

590
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,000
Your score is so good

591
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,080
that it’s worthless

592
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,360
to apply for an unpopular major.

593
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,400
As long as I like it.

594
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,280
I also said that when I was young.

595
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,960
But look at me now.

596
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,560
What a loser

597
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,960
I am!

598
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,760
You should be realistic.

599
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,600
You can’t live on your hobby.

600
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,640
The purpose of going to college

601
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,960
is to find a good job in the future,

602
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,000
right?

603
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,680
I just don’t want you to be like me.

604
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,400
I had no decent job.

605
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,280
People around me looked down on me.

606
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,560
Even my wife left with another man.

607
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,200
Dad.

608
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,000
Do you regret

609
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,680
liking my mother?

610
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,680
No, I don’t.

611
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,520
Neither do I.

612
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,880
I don’t regret

613
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,120
all my decisions.

614
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,880
Goodbye.

615
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:11,800
Goodbye.

616
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,440
She came to say goodbye to me.

617
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,920
Seize this opportunity. Come on!

618
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,960
Excuse me,

619
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,160
may I borrow your pen?

620
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,400
Okay.

621
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,280
Senior,

622
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,760
this is my WeChat ID.

623
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,600
We

624
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,760
don’t say goodbye.

625
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,680
What

626
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,640
do you want?

627
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,120
Oh no.

628
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,480
How could I

629
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,640
say such a thing out?

630
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,920
I know.

631
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,160
Gorgeous girls

632
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
are usually proud.

633
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,400
You just

634
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,640
waved goodbye

635
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,880
to me.

636
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,200
I think you misunderstood.

637
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,200
I just said goodbye to our school.

638
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,960
But at the milk tea shop,

639
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,040
you were afraid I’d cut my hand,

640
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,080
so you offered me tissues.

641
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,000
During the sports meeting,

642
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,320
you specially came to cheer me on.

643
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,360
Come on!

644
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,160
Did I do that?

645
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,720
I’m sorry.

646
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,680
I don’t remember.

647
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,360
You’ve been fooled.

648
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,360
Actually it’s a game of truth or dare.

649
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,920
You don’t see it, do you?

650
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,800
Well,

651
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,560
I’m done. I have to go.

652
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,200
Happy graduation.

653
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,360
I’m done. Goodbye.

654
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,360
Don’t bother me.

655
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,280
Why do you pretend you don’t know me?

656
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,760
Just now,

657
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,560
someone told you he likes you?

658
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,840
It’s just a game.

659
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,080
Let’s go.

660
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,440
Just one luggage?

661
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,920
Is it enough?

662
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,480
He carries so few things.

663
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,400
He can buy there
if he’s short of something.

664
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,200
It’s troublesome

665
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,240
to carry too many things.

666
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,320
You’re more prodigal than I am.

667
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,560
Why hasn’t he come down yet?

668
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,920
Jiang Haoyue.

669
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,840
You have so many study materials.

670
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,000
That’s a good note.

671
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,080
It’s sure to sell for a good price.

672
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,240
You want to sell it?

673
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,040
I’m just kidding.

674
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,120
I’ll make good use of such a good thing.

675
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,800
Don’t worry.

676
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,640
I’ll take good care of

677
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,800
your notebook.

678
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,040
I’m really worried about you.

679
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,320
You can leave without worry.

680
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,440
We’ll

681
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,880
be apart for so long for the first time.

682
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,320
Don’t worry.

683
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,560
Just go to college.

684
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,240
I’ll catch up with you soon.

685
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,160
But you

686
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,160
will go to a strange place alone.

687
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,600
I don’t know if you’ll get used to it.

688
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,080
Oh well.

689
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,040
If your new classmates

690
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,080
bully you,

691
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,640
tell me

692
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
and I’ll teach them a lesson.

693
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,480
Alright. I’ll wait for you.

694
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,040
Okay.

695
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,760
Give me your phone.

696
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,360
Phone?

697
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,600
Let’s study hard and meet at the top.

698
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,800
Bye-bye.

699
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,600
Mr. Jiang, bye-bye.

700
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,200
Bye-bye.

701
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,840
Mr. Jiang, bye-bye.

702
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,960
Mom, just one night.

703
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,160
I’ll stay for one night.

704
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,080
I’ll give you a reward, okay?

705
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,240
- No.
- I’ll give a reward to you.

706
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,040
The cartoon I saw just now

707
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,280
is terrible.

708
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,720
I dare not sleep alone.

709
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,680
I’ll sleep with you.

710
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,600
No, you’ll hit me if I move around.

711
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,040
I won’t.

712
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:13,760
Bye-bye.

713
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,320
Say bye-bye to Haoyue.

714
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,400
Let’s go.

715
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,200
Just one night.

716
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,360
If you two stay together,

717
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,640
you won’t sleep tonight.

718
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,120
You’re the best mom.

719
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,840
You’re the most beautiful mom.

720
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,560
I’ll give you a reward.

721
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,480
No, just one night.

722
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,320
Let’s go.

723
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,880
Coming.

724
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,560
Auntie, let me stay with Miao.

725
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,200
