Why?

As a simple-minded person,

87
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,760
you’re making such complex things?

No, you’re not my family.

I tell you. Don’t think about it.

I’ve grown up.

152

I’ll decide what I will do.

You go!

159

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,640
Take it as my debt.

168
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,160
I’ll pay you back.

169
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,200
How ambitious you are!

170
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,480
How will you pay me back?

171
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,560
Use Chen Lu’s money?

172
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,560
I tell you, Jiang Haoyue,

173
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,800
listen,

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,840
You can’t get rid of me this life.

176
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,520
Dad, I’m back.

177
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,600
Miao,

178
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,440
your grandma is sleeping. Be quiet.

179
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,080
Dad, where is my mom?

180
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,040
She’s in the hospital.

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,680
I will

182
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,080
replace her later.

183
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,560
Miao,

184
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,840
what’s up?

185
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,080
You were happy when you went out.

186
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,120
Dad,

187
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,560
bring these two bracelets

188
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,240
to Mom and Grandpa,

189
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,440
to ensure safety.

190
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,120
You made it?

191
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,560
You’re smart.

192
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,040
You take one.

193
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,920
This is for me?

194
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,360
Yes.

195
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,360
I will always wear it.

196
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,440
Miao,

197
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,920
do you think I should do something

198
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,160
to make your mom happy?

199
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,320
I have an idea.

200
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,480
Here.

201
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,680
I’d better pretend not to know it,

202
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,280
and greet him.

203
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,120
What are you listening?

204
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,320
Are you so eager?

205
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,960
What did you say?

206
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,800
Jiang Haoyue will go abroad?

207
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,520
So sudden!

208
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,840
Not at all.

209
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,200
He wears headphone on the bus every day.

210
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,360
He’s listening to TOEFL.

211
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,120
I think he planned it long ago.

212
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,400
Fine. Don’t be angry.

213
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,640
He didn’t tell you,
maybe because he didn’t want you sad.

214
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,040
Ziye,

215
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,520
don’t explain for him.

216
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,640
I think he’s selfish.

217
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,800
He didn’t care Meng’s feeling at all.

218
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,360
What’s good about going abroad?

219
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,360
Why did he decide to do so?

220
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,920
Maybe there is delicious food.

221
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,640
Maybe there is
a better research environment.

222
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,600
Right?

223
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,120
Jiang Haoyue’s mom is there.

224
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,880
Mom,

225
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,720
can you send me your address again?

226
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,760
Hello, Mom, why the address you give me

227
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,800
is different from the previous one?

228
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,720
It’s like this.

229
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,240
Haoyue, I rent

230
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,520
an independent apartment for you.

231
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,400
Independent apartment?

232
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
I thought about it for a long time.

233
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,280
You know, I left China years ago.

234
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,120
I have a new family now.

235
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,040
I’m afraid
you don’t adapt to each other.

236
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,760
The apartment is close to your school.

237
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,440
There is a supermarket nearby.

238
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,880
You can buy everything there.

239
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,320
It’s very convenient.

240
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,280
Why didn’t you discuss it with me?

241
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,040
I’ve arranged everything well.

242
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,720
You know nothing about here.

243
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,840
I don’t want you to worry about it.

244
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,480
So, you didn’t plan

245
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,000
to live with me, right?

246
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,080
It’s not like this.

247
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,960
Haoyue, you wronged me.

248
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,120
Your brother is still young

249
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,000
and needs nursing.

250
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,720
When you come here,

251
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,800
you’ll meet everyone,

252
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,200
and you may not
get along very well, so...

253
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,980
I’ll go to class. That’s it.

254
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,100
Bye.

255
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,400
Slow down.

256
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Be careful!

257
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,400
Hello, Auntie.

258
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,880
Hello.

259
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,400
I haven’t finished my homework.

260
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,520
I’m leaving now. See you, Auntie.

261
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
See you.

262
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,920
Mom.

263
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,640
I won’t get in.

264
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,040
I’ll leave after some words.

265
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,280
Does it hurt?

266
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,500
Yes, it does.

267
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,620
Mom. It hurts a lot!

268
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,680
Remember, put it in a safe place.

269
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
Never let him know it.

270
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
You can buy whatever you want.

271
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,960
You have to learn
to look after yourself.

272
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,600
You know?

273
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,240
Don’t cry. Men don’t cry.

274
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,000
Mom. I miss you.

275
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,240
I want you to come back.

276
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,880
Tell me when you’ll come back,

277
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,240
will you?

278
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,080
Haoyue, don’t wait for me.

279
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,280
I won’t come back to this home anymore.

280
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,160
Your dad is a bastard!

281
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,720
He won’t become a good one this life.

282
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,880
He won’t.

283
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,520
Mom, can you take me with you?

284
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,040
I’ll be good. I’ll be obedient.

285
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,560
I won’t make trouble for you.

286
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,280
Everyone praises me.

287
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,240
Haoyue, I can’t take you away now,

288
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,000
but I promise you

289
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,800
I will take you away from him one day.

290
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,800
Believe me, OK?

291
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,080
Keep it safe. Don’t let him know it.

292
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,000
Why do you cry?

293
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,320
Jiang Haoyue, don’t be sad.

294
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,760
You have me.

295
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,040
Jiang Haoyue!

296
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,200
When I first met you,

297
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,600
I hated you actually.

298
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
I was pretending to sleep.

299
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,800
You gave me chocolate by force.

300
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,920
Then, you moved upstairs,

301
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,600
and forced me to raise chicks with you.

302
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,000
You’re talkative every day,

303
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,400
more like a chick yourself.

304
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,600
In the middle school,

305
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,200
you fought many times for my leg.

306
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,960
You are a girl. How come you’re so rude?

307
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,200
But

308
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,120

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,000
You’ll find the answer at the end.

346
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,080
Where will you stop?

347
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,480
I’ll run around the levee.

348
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,880
Around?

349
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Yeah.

350
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,040
It’s just about five kilometers.

351
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,720
It’s not that short.

352
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,200
I’m leaving now.

353
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,480
Mr. Lu, you really have good taste.

354
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,040
This sofa is sold very well.

355
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,280
Yes. When I take it home,

356
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,080
my wife will surely be happy.

357
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,960
By the way, Mr. Lu,

358
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,080
if you use delivery service,

359
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,640
you have to pay another 200 yuan.

360
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,280
Delivery needs pay?

361
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,600
Yeah. The product is on sale.

362
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,840
It’s still cost-effective
at such a price.

363
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,920
Well, I’ll take it home myself
at weekend.

364
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,720
Mr. Lu, please consider it again.

365
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,880
We have expert delivery men,

366
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,800
and they will put it in place for you.

367
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,040
If you take it yourself,

368
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,360
it’ll be a pity if you damage it.

369
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,400
Slow down.

370
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,880
Slow down.

371
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,760
Don’t bump it.

372
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,800
Don’t bump it.

373
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,160
Backward. Backward.

374
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,400
Backward.

375
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,200
Good.

376
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,100
Come on, Miao,

377
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,180
keep going.

378
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,640
One, two, three!

379
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,160
I can’t do it. I’ll have a rest.

380
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,480
Have a rest.

381
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Dad, don’t save money on this
in the future.

382
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,760
It seems I overestimate myself.

383
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,440
My mom will be home soon.

384
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,560
Don’t turn this surprise into

385
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,520
a scare.

386
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,080
Nonsense! I know your mom well.

387
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,120
She always wanted a sofa.

388
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,000
I’m sure she’ll like it.

389
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,520
This must be a surprise.

390
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,720
Miao,

391
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,200
come on, keep going.

392
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,880
Let me have a rest, Dad.

393
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,000
It’s enough. Come on.

394
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,840
I’ll massage your shoulder later, OK?

395
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,880
Give me a hand.

396
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,440
Come on!

397
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,160
One, two, three!

398
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,840
Did you see an old woman?

399
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,000
She’s in blue T-shirt

400
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,880
and black trousers.

401
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,720
No.

402
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,360
No.

403
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,520
No.

404
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,360
Thank you!

405
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,640
Ms. Fang, what’s up?

406
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,680
Miao’s grandma was lost.

407
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,440
I just answered a call,

408
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,520
she... She was gone.

409
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,160
She doesn’t answer the call, either.

410
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,360
So Grandma took the phone
before she went missing, right?

411
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,520
Yeah. Yes.

412
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,400
But she doesn’t answer my call now.

413
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,520
I’ll check her location for you.

414
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,320
I take you here.

415
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,600
Shouldn’t you pay?

416
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,240
What? Take me here?

417
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,520
You take a wrong way, young guys.

418
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,480
If you weren’t old,

419
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,560
I would beat you.

420
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,640
Dare you!

421
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,440
Who are you?

422
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,840
You dare to extort the elderly.

423
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,000
Look what you did.

424
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,560
You’re not qualified to be a rascal.

425
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,120
You ask for a beat!

426
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,120
Freeze!

427
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,420
Sir, I’m wrong!

428
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,380
Forgive me!

429
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,080
Forgive you?

430
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,440
Wait here!

431
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,960
Get out of here!

432
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,960
Don’t show up before me!

433
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,680
Mom.

434
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,400
Grandma.

435
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,760
Why are you here?

436
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,840
I want to do some exercises.

437
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,440
When I came here,

438
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,680
I met two rascals.

439
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,080
Luckily I met Jiang.

440
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,000
Thanks.

441
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,040
Not at all.

442
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,760
Let’s go back together.

443
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,880
I’m busy now.

444
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,040
I threw your passport away.

445
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,760
Passport?

446
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:05,900
It’s nothing.

447
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,940
Let’s go, Grandma.

448
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,880
OK. Mom, let’s go.

449
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,000
Be careful!

450
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,480
Miao, come on.

451
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,240
I can’t do it.

452
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,160
One, two, three!

453
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,680
I can’t do it.

454
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,800
Keep going.

455
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,120
One, two, three!

456
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,360
I can’t move it.

457
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,880
What are you doing?

458
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,360
Mom,

459
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,840
this... This is a surprise for you.

460
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
I think our sofa is too old.

461
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,160
I bought a new one.

462
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,200
Let me help you.

463
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,880
Go give him a hand.

464
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,440
Come!

465
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,680
One, two, three!

466
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,040
Return it!

467
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,960
But this is

468
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,640
what my dad specially prepared for you.

469
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,720
We don’t have spare money

470
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,120
to buy a sofa.

471
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,120
Well, it’s on sale now.

472
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,920
It’s cheap.

473
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,720
Moreover, I

474
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,920
take it home by myself.

475
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,040
No delivery fee.

476
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,960
Miao’s grandpa needs money
for treatment.

477
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,480
Miao needs money for tutoring class.

478
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,880
Do you think

479
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,720
we have spare money to make romance?

480
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,480
You always said I’m vulgar.

481
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,800
Yes, I am.

482
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,120
If I don’t think about money,

483
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,880
how can we make a living?

484
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,720
And can what happened between us

485
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,880
be solved by money?

486
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,280
Or by a sofa you bought?

487
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,080
Mom, why do you say this?

488
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,480
Dad bought this sofa

489
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,200
to give you a surprise.

490
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,200
Maybe we shouldn’t buy it,

491
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,640
but what’s wrong with Dad?

492
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,320
He just wanted to make you happy.

493
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,440
Why should we connect everything

494
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,880
with money?

495
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,000
Is money really so important?

496
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,480
What we did is just to make you stay.

497
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,560
We don’t want you to leave.

498
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,040
Why can’t you understand us?

499
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,400
Lu Miao,

500
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,760
calm down. Ms. Fang doesn’t mean this.

501
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,280
Don’t drag me.

502
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,920
You’ve decided to leave.

503
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,040
Don’t meddle into our business again.

504
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,480
Jiang,

505
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,080
give me a hand.

506
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,400
Here, Jiang,

507
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,480
have a rest here.

508
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,160
OK.

509
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Is your leg alright?

510
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,960
Yes.

511
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,680
Mr. Lu, have a seat.

512
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,840
Jiang,

513
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
you’re going abroad?

514
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,400
Everything is arranged well.

515
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,240
You didn’t mention it before.

516
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,920
I wasn’t sure.

517
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,000
Jiang, if you can develop well abroad

518
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,960
and stay with your mom,

519
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,960
I support you.

520
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,360
But if you go abroad

521
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,160
because you think you’re a burden,

522
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,040
I don’t agree with you.

523
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,200
Although I didn’t do everything well,

524
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,520
for all these years,

525
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,360
I treated you as my own son.

526
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,720
I don’t think you’re a burden.

527
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,880
Mr. Lu,

528
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,160
frankly, I think

529
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,800
everything is good for me to go abroad.

530
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,760
Time flies.

531
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,560
You’re 18 years old now.

532
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,240
You’re an adult.

533
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,320
You can decide what you do.

534
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,560
I respect your choice.

535
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,760
But if

536
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,880
you don’t adapt to the life there,

537
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,200
welcome back at any time.

538
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,320
Mr. Lu.

539
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,320
For all these years,

540
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,080
thank you.

541
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,560
Miao.

542
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,120
Don’t cry.

543
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,000
You may suffocate.

544
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,000
Where’s Mom?

545
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,000
She stays at the hospital tonight.

546
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,320
She must be angry with me.

547
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,360
She won’t.

548
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,600
She’s just more bark than bite.

549
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,800
Didn’t you see

550
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,480
she wears the bracelet

551
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,440
you sent her?

552
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,440
Dad,

553
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
I want to go to the hospital tomorrow

554
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,440
and apologize to her.

555
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,880
OK. I’ll send you there, OK?

556
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,920
What about Jiang?

557
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,240
What will you do to him?

558
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,160
Nothing.

559
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,120
Miao?

560
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,880
Why are you here alone?

561
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,600
Where’s your dad?

562
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,880
He’s downstairs.

563
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,200
How’s Grandpa?

564
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,120
He’s sleeping.

565
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
Tomorrow morning,

566
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,120
we’ll go back to our hometown.

567
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,560
Is Grandpa recovered?

568
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,480
Mom.

569
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,960
Sorry.

570
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,080
My dad and I were wrong.

571
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,080
You have great pressure.
I still made trouble for you.

572
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,200
No, it’s my fault.

573
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,200
I was wrong, too.

574
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,520
It’s fine.

575
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,960
Will you and Dad get divorced?

576

Let’s talk about it later.

577
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,800
I have to look after your grandpa now.

578
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,440
Will Grandpa get well after going back?

579
