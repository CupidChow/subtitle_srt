We’ll leave as soon as
your father finishes the procedure.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
Where is Jiang Haoyue?

33
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,520
Probably at home.

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,720
He’s so busy with school.

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,080
How can he be with you every day?

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,000
Didn’t he send me here?

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,400
Your fever confused you.

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,360
It was Shi Che from your class.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,120
Shi Che?

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,900
Yes, make sure you thank him later.

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,400
What are you so happy about?

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,560
Didn’t Miao get sick?

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,040
I sent her to the hospital
the day she had a fever.

44
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,480
It was raining.

45
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,040
I carried her like this.

46
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,640
What do you think?

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,960
Am I the hero?

48
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,040
What did Miao say?

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,960
Say what?

50
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,400
What did she say to you afterwards?

51
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,240
I left before she woke up.

52
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,000
She didn’t wake up?

53
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,620
Well…

54
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,520
Do you think it’s possible

55
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,720
that she doesn’t know it was you?

56
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,520
I’m just saying.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,880
I mean.

58
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,620
I think,

59
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,280
in my heart the unsung heroes

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,680
are more worthy of admiration.

61
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,980
Thank you for taking me to the hospital.

62
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,040
Guoguo, she knows!

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,920
She knows it was me!

64
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,800
Guoguo, she knows!

65
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,880
Okay.

66
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,920
Okay, let me reply to the message.

67
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,360
Let me see.

68
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,320
I can’t see it?

69
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,480
Cheapskate.

70
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,840
A piece of cake.

71
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Besides, you didn’t weigh much.

72
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,880
You just almost crushed me.

73
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,880
Get lost!

74
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,080
Did you

75
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,920
see Jiang Haoyue that day?

76
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,040
It’s done. Here.

77
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,800
How is she?

78
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,480
The doctor said she’ll be fine once
the fever goes down after the IV.

79
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
If you’re so worried about her,

80
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,720
why don’t you go in and take a look?

81
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,920
Here are her clothes. Take them back.

82
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,640
No.

83
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,240
Her parents will be here soon.

84
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,640
Don’t tell her I was here.

85
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,780
No, he didn’t.

86
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,680
Okay.

87
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,360
Take your things.

88
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,820
Your dad’s done with the paperwork.

89
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,640
He’ll park the car in front of the door.

90
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,440
We’ll go straight down.

91
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,680
Let’s go.

92
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,760
Nothing is left behind, right?

93
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,600
What’s wrong now?

94
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,640
Why are you suddenly in a bad mood?

95
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
It’s so hard to lie to people.

96
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,560
Lie?

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,560
What? Who are you lying to?

98
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,560
I don’t wanna talk about it.
It’s annoying.

99
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,320
You just got better.

100
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,520
Stay inside.

101
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,200
Now you care about me.

102
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,320
Tell me.

103
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,880
Why didn’t you text me back?

104
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,480
Why have you been avoiding me?

105
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
I have my own business.

106
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,920
That day…

107
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,480
Did you carry me to the hospital?

108
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,800
No.

109
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,960
But...

110
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
I clearly remember that it was you.

111
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,960
You had a fever.

112
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,160
You had a dream.

113
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,600
I can tell if it was a dream or not.

114
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,920
I didn’t take you to the hospital.

115
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,640
This is the real situation.

116
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
What do you mean?

117
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,080
If you have something to say,
you can say it to me.

118
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,120
Don’t be so emotional.

119
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,600
If you keep being like this,
I won’t talk to you again.

120
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,880
Dreams are all lies.

121
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,400
Miao.

122
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,520
Can I watch the game?

123
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,320
OK!

124
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,200
That’s weird.

125
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,120
Why didn’t you fight me
for the TV today?

126
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,800
Miao?

127
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,880
What’s wrong?

128
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,040
Is there something on your mind?

129
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,120
Come on.

130
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,800
Tell Dad.

131
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,880
Dad.

132
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,320
Do you think Jiang Haoyue

133
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,640
is very strange lately?

134
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,880
What’s wrong with him?

135
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,660
He said something I don’t understand.

136
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,400
Do you know anything?

137
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,920
I don’t know what you’re thinking about.

138
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,880
How am I supposed to know

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,840
what’s going on in your heads?

140
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,440
Come on.

141
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,160
But, Miao,

142
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,960
here is the thing.

143
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,280
Haoyue is grown up now.

144
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,440
He has something on his mind.

145
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,320
If he doesn’t want to talk, don’t ask.

146
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,440
Some worries

147
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,160
will pass in time.

148
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,520
But

149
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,440
if he worries about something,

150
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,360
why doesn’t he tell me?

151
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,800
I can take care of it for him.

152
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,000
I know.

153
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,040
You’re a good little girl.

154
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,400
However,

155
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,200
you don’t always

156
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,540
tell everything to

157
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,540
your mom and me, right?

158
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,320
For example,

159
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,080
if you make trouble,

160
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,520
you are afraid
that we will criticize you.

161
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,000
Right?

162
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,240
Or,

163
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
you are afraid that

164
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,200
Mom and Dad will worry about you.

165
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,080
I think

166
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,660
Haoyue doesn’t want to tell you.

167
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,400
Maybe

168
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,120
because he’s afraid
you’ll worry about it.

169
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,280
Maybe one day he’ll be fine.

170
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,840
It’s okay.

171
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,480
Nice shot!

172
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,960
Spiking!

173
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,740
(After Winter Break)

174
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,000
Jiang?

175
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,600
Jiang Haoyue?

176
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,520
That’s weird.

177
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,000
Did he forget that school starts today?

178
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,840
Mr. Jiang.

179
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,280
Are you looking for Jiang Haoyue?

180
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,960
He left early today.

181
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,800
I still can’t do it?

182
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,760
The venue was very big.

183
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,520
I didn’t go anywhere.

184
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,200
I’m told to go every day.

185
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,160
Calligraphy, musical instruments.

186
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,180
I’m exhausted.

187
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,920
Well then, I’m a little better.

188
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,400
I only took one remedial course
in IOMC.

189
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,760
You’re really…

190
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,860
Are you trying to piss me off?

191
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,900
(Nanfeng No. 1 High School)

192
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,240
Good morning.

193
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
Good morning.

194
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,320
We meet again so soon.

195
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,280
Don’t mention it.

196
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,520
Besides writing my winter
vacation homework,

197
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,640
I only had fun for five days.

198
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,960
Why do we need such a long vacation?

199
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,320
I’ve been looking forward to

200
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,120
starting school early.

201
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,240
Why?

202
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,200
Because the beginning of the school year
is the school team tryout day.

203
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,800
I’ve been practicing
for the whole winter break

204
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,200
for this.

205
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,280
I’m sure I can do it this time.

206
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,120
Good luck.

207
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,440
What did she say?

208
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,760
Did she say good luck?

209
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,880
What?

210
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,960
Chlorophyll.

211
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,440
You didn’t even attack me.

212
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,080
Do you have some kind of conspiracy?

213
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,760
What’s wrong with you?

214
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,720
You’ve been practicing all winter break.

215
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,040
So I said good luck.
What’s wrong with that?

216
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,080
Unbelievable.

217
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,800
I’m scared.

218
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,000
I thought she’s possessed.

219
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,220
It’s so funny.

220
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,280
Morning.

221
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,520
Morning.

222
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,080
Miao.

223
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,040
You don’t look so happy.

224
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,840
It’s the first day of school

225
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,440
and it’s normal for Meng
to look like this.

226
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,080
What’s wrong?

227
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,040
What do you think is the reason for

228
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,760
a person’s sudden change of attitude?

229
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,080
Is it because of some kind of shock?

230
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,840
Or maybe something happened to him.

231
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,720
Or maybe he suddenly figured it out

232
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,120
and wanted to try a different state.

233
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,920
Is there anything wrong
with Jiang Haoyue?

234
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,360
How do you know?

235
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,320
I...

236
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,600
I don’t know.

237
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,360
How can I know?

238
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,320
We don’t know each other well.

239
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,640
Right?

240
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,400
Hey, guys.

241
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,600
Quiet, everyone.

242
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,400
The holiday is over.

243
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,640
I want you all to focus.

244
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
This semester, you should

245
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,040
think about whether you want
to study arts or science.

246
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,560
You can discuss it with your parents.

247
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,080
I want everyone to make

248
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,960
the right choice for yourselves.

249
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,440
Okay, let’s continue the lesson.

250
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,720
What’s wrong with Jiang Haoyue?

251
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,140
Let’s open the book.

252
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,200
Suddenly he’s very indifferent to me.

253
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,880
Isn’t indifference his normal behavior?

254
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,880
This time it’s different.

255
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,480
Okay, look at the blackboard.

256
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,760
This time it lasted a lot longer

257
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,400
and he didn’t even go to school
with me anymore.

258
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,480
Jiang Haoyue!

259
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,320
What’s wrong with you?

260
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,000
What?

261
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,360
Why do you keep avoiding me?

262
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,400
Why don’t you wait for me?

263
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,680
I have to prepare
for the national competition.

264
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,040
I can get up early.

265
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,200
Why do we have to go to school together?

266
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,480
We’ve always been together.

267
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,840
Anyway, you must wait for me on the way.

268
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,360
We need to choose our subjects now.

269
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,680
Do you think
I should choose arts or science?

270
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,440
You shouldn’t ask me this kind of thing.

271
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,560
I don’t seem
to have any special talents.

272
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,040
Unlike you and Ziye,

273
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,840
I’m not as good at studying.

274
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,360
And I’m not like Shi Che.

275
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,680
I don’t play basketball.

276
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,520
If I have to say it,

277
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
I seem to be better at reading comics.

278
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,240
Why don’t you choose for me?

279
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,280
You always make the right choice.

280
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,200
You shouldn’t ask me about such things.

281
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,360
What?

282
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,000
You should choose

283
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,040
your own path.

284
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,120
Jiang Haoyue.

285
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,600
Why are you doing this?

286
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,440
Didn’t you always help me before?

287
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,160
You think

288
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,400
that was helping you?

289
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,920
What’s wrong with you lately?

290
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,720
My dad says you’re in a bad mood.

291
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,840
He told me to give you more time.

292
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,280
But you’ve been in a bad mood
for too long.

293
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,960
Do I have to accept it?

294
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,560
Can’t I refuse it?

295
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,720
Lu Miao.

296
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,240
I am also a living human being.

297
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
Why do you all have a choice,

298
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,960
but I don’t?

299
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,680
Mr. Wen said that

300
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,960
Miao has

301
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,200
average grades in all subjects,

302
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,280
so arts or science is the same.

303
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,680
Yes.

304
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,840
She’s in the middle

305
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,280
of the lower class in all subjects.

306
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,560
The middle. Not the middle of the lower.

307
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,440
What’s the difference?

308
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,240
Fine.

309
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Science then.

310
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,840
Is it

311
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,800
too difficult for girls
to study science?

312
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,320
Difficulties can be overcome.

313
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,840
Choose science for a good job
in the future.

314
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,400
Life is not just about finding jobs.

315
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,100
Let’s take physical geography
as an example.

316
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,280
The topography of each country,

317
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,160
the terrain,

318
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,840
the people, the history and culture,

319
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,240
and all that knowledge
are very important.

320
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,640
You’ll think it’s important later.

321
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,400
But the most important thing now
is employment.

322
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,240
You earn a lot of money.

323
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,600
You can go on a study tour.

324
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,280
The most important thing is to build
a good foundation in high school.

325
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,480
All right, stop arguing.

326
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,280
Everything to you is about money.

327
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,600
It’s tacky.

328
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,240
I’m tacky, and you’re noble?

329
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,520
You live on air?

330
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,240
All these years of hard work
have been in vain?

331
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,200
Do I deserve this?

332
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,880
I’ll go wash the dishes.

333
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,760
That’s a terrible thing to say.

334
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,600
Okay.

335
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,920
I said the wrong thing.

336
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,280
Aren’t we talking about
choosing a subject for Miao?

337
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,640
How come it’s about money?

338
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
It’s about the future.

339
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,360
And the future is about money.

340
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,360
Am I wrong?

341
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,240
If you didn’t have...

342
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,320
Fine, I won’t argue with you.

343
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,880
You decide.

344
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,160
Why are you sighing?

345
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,960
Geography, 71.

346
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
Politics, 65.

347
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,960
History, 68.

348
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,280
Biology, 66.

349
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,680
Chemistry, 75.

350
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,640
Physics, 63.

351
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,920
These are not bad.

352
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,040
Why are you sighing?

353
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,400
I scored too evenly on the arts
and science exams this time.

354
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,160
I originally wanted to take
whichever subject I scored higher.

355
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,640
I didn’t expect it to be so even.

356
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,400
How can I choose now?

357
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,200
It’s okay. I’m pretty even too.

358
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,640
So, are you going
to choose arts or science?

359
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,400
I’ll choose science.

360
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,520
My parents want me to study medicine.

361
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,960
I’m more interested in it too.

362
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,760
What about you?

363
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,000
I don’t care about arts and science.

364
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
I want to go
to the professional basketball team.

365
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,680
National Basketball Association.

366
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,600
To be a professional player.

367
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,600
What’s wrong?

368
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,880
Nothing.

369
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,480
What about you, Guoguo?

370
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
I...

371
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,120
I didn’t think about it.

372
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,080
What’s going on with you all lately?

373
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,720
She’s got her business.

374
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,880
I have my own business.

375
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,000
I’m leaving.

376
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,960
Here, have a piece of apple.

377
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,100
Miao didn’t finish it.

378
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,320
Enough.

379
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,920
The whole night,

380
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,800
she’s been eating fruit but

381
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,400
not finishing her homework.

382
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,160
What’s going on with her now?

383
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
And I haven’t seen her
doing her homework

384
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,480
with Haoyue these days.

385
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,600
You’re acting strange too.

386
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,320
Is there anything you two
are hiding from me?

387
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,080
What could I be hiding from you?

388
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,960
Come on.

389
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,480
You don’t want to tell me?

390
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,320
Then I’ll go find Haoyue.

391
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,200
Why are you trying
to make things more complicated?

392
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,760
I’m just worried about it.

393
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,200
Keep your voice down.

394
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,680
Okay, I’ll tell you.

395
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,280
It’s because of the car accident.

396
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,520
What?

397
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,240
Jiang Yi feels
that the money is not enough?

398
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Not Jiang Yi.

399
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,720
It’s Haoyue.

400
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,200
Haoyue…

401
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,080
Why did he suddenly mention
the car accident?

402
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,240
I think

403
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,760
it’s probably because Miao’s illness

404
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,100
was too much of a shock to Haoyue.

405
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,000
Think about it.

406
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,760
Miao’s illness was so urgent.

407
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,440
Haoyue

408
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,680
must also be very anxious.

409
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,680
But he couldn’t help.

410
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,640
So he felt frustrated.

411
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,340
He blamed himself

412
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,800
for all these mistakes.

413
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,480
He must have

414
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,240
remembered the car accident again.

415
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,920
I don’t blame him.

416
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,800
This kid

417
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,340
is suffering a lot.

418
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,080
Haoyue can’t be blamed for this.

419
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,560
When he’s young,

420
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,400
he didn’t know much.

421
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:44,960
Now he’s grown up.

422
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,640
We can’t force him to forgive us.

423
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,100
It’s hard for him.

424
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,320
Don’t mention this

425
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,840
in front of Miao again.

426
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
You think I’m you?

427
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,040
I’m going to take out the garbage.

428
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,280
Haoyue.

429
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:36,880
Mr. Lu.

430
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,440
It’s been a long time
since you came to my place for dinner.

431
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,200
I’ve been busy lately.

432
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,340
Last time in the hospital...

433
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,960
Mr. Lu, I have to take out the garbage.

434
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,640
I have to do my homework
after taking out the trash.

435
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,440
I’m going down there.

436
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,800
I can help you with it.

437
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,080
Get back to do your homework.

438
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,080
Go on.

439
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,560
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

440
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,440
Bye.

441
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Come on, everyone gathers.

442
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,640
Okay.

443
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,080
Now according to your basketball skills

444
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,480
and physical fitness test,

445
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,320
we will give you a position.

446
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,200
Of course this is not
the final selection of our school team.

447
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,240
We’ll do a more

448
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,600
thorough evaluation, OK?

449
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,340
Shi Che, you move to this position.

450
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,200
Seriously?

451
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,480
I can’t be that bad.

452
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,480
All right, everyone.

453
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
I’d like to ask you all
one last question.

454
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,640
Why do you want to play basketball?

455
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,520
I’m a basketball genius!

456
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,240
I like James!

457
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,340
Playing basketball is cool.

458
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,160
Girls like it.

459
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,520
Alright, be serious this time.

460
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,040
I never got good grades,

461
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,720
but my dad was always
pushing me to study.

462
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,680
He said that study was my only way out.

463
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,240
I had no reason to contradict him.

464
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,340
The more he pushed me,
the more I hated studying,

465
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,680
until I met basketball.

466
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,340
The basketball spirit
in me was awakened.

467
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,240
I wanted to prove

468
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,100
that studying was not
the only way to measure value.

469
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,440
Anyway, I wanted to play

470
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,960
with Shi Che on all courts.

471
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
We are the two best players.

472
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay.

473
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,680
Gentlemen.

474
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,440
Thanks again for

475
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,760
trying out for the school team.

476
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,000
No matter what the result is,

477
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,600
I hope it will be a perfect memory

478
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,920
in your high school.

479
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,400
Please continue to love basketball.

480
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,120
- Hear!
- Hear!

481
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:37,880
Meng.

482
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,340
Where are you going?

483
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,800
I’m in a bad mood. I’m just hanging out.

484
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,100
How did your school team tryouts go?

485
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,840
I think my odds are pretty good.

486
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,760
I missed last time
because I wasn’t prepared.

487
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,520
I’ll be fine this time.

488
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,440
I envy you. You have a clear goal.

489
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,720
What’s wrong?

490
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,840
You look so worried.

491
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,680
I still don’t know whether

492
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,360
to choose arts or science.

493
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,480
Shouldn’t you follow your heart

494
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,520
at this time?

495
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,560
How to follow?

496
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,200
I have no direction at all.

497
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:08,840
Look.

498
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,320
I have an idea.

499
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,280
What is it?

500
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,320
But there is no free lunch.

501
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,480
You finish these papers,

502
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,320
and I’ll tell you.

503
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,000
It had better work.

504
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,760
Or…

505
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,720
You’ve already made your choice.

506
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,520
Look.

507
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,960
You chose comprehensive liberal arts.

508
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,200
It’s such a child’s play.

509
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,600
Child’s play?

510
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,760
The subconscious choice
is called the inner choice.

511
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,640
It sounds strange,

512
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,880
but it makes sense.

513
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,480
Of course, I’m a wise man.

514
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,240
You know how to choose now.

515
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,760
Why are you still worried?

516
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,560
Do you think Jiang Haoyue

517
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,440
ignored me because

518
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,920
he followed his heart?

519
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,220
Is it really that hard for him

520
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,300
to get along with me?

521
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,480
Am I that annoying?

522
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,760
Let me tell you the truth.

523
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,440
Jiang Haoyue took you
to the hospital the day you had a fever.

524
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,520
He wouldn’t let me tell you.

525
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,340
Why?

526
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,040
I don’t know.

527
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
But when I left,

528
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,280
I saw him with your dad.

529
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,920
My dad?

530
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,520
I saw the two of them talking

531
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,340
and it didn’t seem to go well.

532
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,600
It must be because of the car accident.

533
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,640
No wonder he didn’t tell me.

534
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,560
No wonder my dad told me

535
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,720
to give him more time.

536
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,480
Because this is something

537
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,000
we can’t help with.

538
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,640
A car accident?

539
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,400
My dad caused Jiang Haoyue’s

540
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,280
leg to become like this.

541
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,320
Your dad?

542
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,320
My dad hit Jiang Haoyue

543
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,720
and Jiang lost half of his leg.

544
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,880
So my dad really

545
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,400
blamed himself and felt guilty

546
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,800
and decided to treat him
like his own child.

547
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,640
He didn’t want him to be traumatized

548
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,600
by the loss of half of his leg.

549
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,560
But it seems

550
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,760
that there is no way to

551
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,840
turn a blind eye to this pain.

552
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,340
In fact, what he said was right.

553
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,400
It was always me who wanted
to be friends with him,

554
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,200
and I never asked him.

555
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,320
Maybe he didn’t want
to be friends with me at all.

556
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,000
That’s it.

557
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,320
That’s why he’s angry.

558
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,340
He feels he has no choice.

559
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,920
I’m just too self-righteous.

560
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,800
Maybe it’s not as complicated
as you think.

561
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,760
I will never force Jiang Haoyue again.

562
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,240
I’ve analyzed your grades
in all subjects.

563
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,340
In addition to Chinese,
Math, and English,

564
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,360
among the other six subjects,

565
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,960
History, Geography, and Biology

566
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,100
have a stable average score
of around 70,

567
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,680
while Politics,
Chemistry have a relatively poor

568
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
performance, with an average score
fluctuating around 65.

569
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,680
Physics is the worst.

570
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,280
And whether you can pass
or not depends on luck.

571
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,440
Overall,

572
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,560
your strengths are all in the arts.

573
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,640
Indeed,

574
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,200
liberal arts are easier.

575
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,440
But

576
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,800
I can teach you science,

577
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,920
and the basic scores are easier to get.

578
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,600
Of course, if you want to choose arts,

579
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,920
I can also teach you arts.

580
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,360
Should I give you some privacy?

581
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
What are you doing here?

582
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,360
I was just picking up a pen.

583
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,040
How much did you hear?

584
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,680
Probably

585
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:20,760
all of them.

586
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,920
Jiang Haoyue.

587
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,480
I didn’t expect you to be like this.

588
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,720
It’s not funny.

589
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,640
About the exponential
and logarithmic functions

590
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,520
that Ms. Lei just talked about,

591
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,440
all I heard was nothing about log.

592
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,800
I was so confused.

593
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,720
Can you teach me?

594
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,320
Make it slow.

595
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,520
Why don’t you ask Jiang Haoyue?

596
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,160
I don’t want to bother him anymore.

597
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,520
You can teach me, too.

598
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,160
You haven’t made up with him yet?

599
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,680
You two have been arguing
too long this time.

600
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,200
I’ve always relied on him before.

601
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,800
This time I want
to make my own decision.

602
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,800
Forget about him.

603
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,040
So,

604
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,960
have you decided on your choice
of arts and science?

605
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,680
I have.

606
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,240
Arts.

607
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,480
Math alone is enough for me.

608
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,320
And I think I am still

609
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,280
more interested in the arts.

610
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,800
It seems

611
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,720
she has already made her choice.

612
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,200
Jiang Haoyue.

613
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,000
What?

614
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,760
I told Lu Miao

615
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
that you were there that night.

616
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,680
Why did you say that to her?

617
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,640
She was worried about you.

618
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,720
It has nothing to do with her,
understand?

619
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,160
I’ve heard your story.

620
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,280
If you’ve already forgiven them,

621
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,520
why are you still so twisted?

622
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,680
Are you done?

623
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,800
Thank you

624
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,400
for taking her to the hospital that day.

625
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,000
If there’s nothing else,

626
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:40,880
see you then.

627
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,240
Hey…

628
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,940
(No. 1 High School School Team
Spring Tryout Results)

629
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,320
No way.

630
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,560
How is this possible?

631
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,080
How come
it doesn’t have your name on it?

632
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,600
Could it be your father?

633
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,840
No, it’s not.

634
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,240
He doesn’t have time for me these days.

635
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,880
Congratulations, Guoguo.

636
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,800
Wait.

637
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,760
Good job, Chen Guoguo.

638
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,480
See you this afternoon.

639
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,200
Try harder next year, Shi Che.

640
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,000
You’re the one who doesn’t see it.

641
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,880
Let’s train together this afternoon.

642
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,360
No, my feet hurt a little.

643
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,960
Go.

644
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Negative Score, are you serious?

645
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,800
(Slam Dunk)

646
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,120
(Slam Dunk)
Serious about what?

647
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,880
You didn’t get in the school team, so?

648
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,880
Guoguo was worried sick about you.

649
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,680
And you came here to read a comic book.

650
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,760
What do you think you know?

651
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,880
I don’t know much.

652
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,840
I really don’t understand

653
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,720
why you’re so obsessed

654
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,560
with something you’re not good at.

655
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,880
Have you ever thought that

656
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,120
you have been practicing for so long,

657
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,880
but the school team did not choose you,

658
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,960
then it may be because

659
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,640
you are not so talented?

660
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,160
Since your innate condition is not good,

661
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,120
then it’s no need to take

662
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,200
the matter of failure too seriously.

663
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,400
Sir, I’d like to return this book.

664
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,440
I also want to rent the 12th volume

665
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,680
of Slum Dunk.

666
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:38,960
Are you OK?

667
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,580
Wait a minute.

668
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,040
Someone

669
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,200
at the front desk wants
to rent this book.

670
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,280
Give me your card.

671
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,400
You...

672
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,240
You’re crying.

673
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,400
I’m fine.

674
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,000
Thanks.

she didn’t wait for me after school.

she couldn’t always rely on me.

Lu Miao!

722
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,680
You are…?

723
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,080
I had the most amazing
experience yesterday.

724
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:53,960
You want to hear it?

725
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,360
No.

726
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,920
All right, go ahead.

727
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,080
I was doing math yesterday.

728
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,400
I couldn’t figure it out
the whole afternoon.

729
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,600
I still thought about it that evening.

730
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,520
And I got the result in my dream.

731
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,440
I woke up and found out I was right.

732
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,200
I’m surprised you’re still doing math
in your dreams.

733
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,160
Do you think I’m smarter
in my dreams?

734
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,880
Dreams can be deceiving.

735
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,680
How do you know that?

736
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,160
Have you ever been deceived by it?

737
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,480
I often dream
that my leg is still there,

738
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,800
but it’s actually gone.

739

742
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,400
I will have another dream that mocks it

743
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,200
