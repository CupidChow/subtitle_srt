1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,300
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,820
what the hell

20
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,720
What the hell

21
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,080
What the hell

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,120
What the hell

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,960
What's happen

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
What am I

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,040
what's happen

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,460
What are you

27
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,840
What are you

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,660
What are you

29
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,980
What are you

30
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,700
Because Scbe throw what Iuff so much

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,480
King of Lianle while preparing to go again

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,620
Just Your compadre

33
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,380
The last fe adjusting

34
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,780
If you don't throw it, let me know

35
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,160
If you're telling me already

36
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,700
What is it

37
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,360
If I just take the risk

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
I'm scared.

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,960
This Bu Lu Village is really going to be called Bu Lu Village.

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,280
Luo Jie and I are carrying the embroidery camp

41
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,600
training the new soldiers from Yuan Zhou.

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,480
The leaders of all tribes

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,920
have joined the teaching team.

44
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,320
It's still a good thing to be here.

45
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
But...

46
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,680
The military is good,

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,480
but the current situation is not good.

48
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,880
There are more soldiers and less food.

49
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm afraid we can't support them for too long.

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Yes.

51
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,400
Now we are guarding Bu Lu Village.

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
Although it's very safe,

53
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,080
the land around us is still controlled by the North.

54
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,200
If we don't hurry and find a way,

55
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
we can't continue the work.

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,240
If you want to die,

57
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,760
why do you keep saying that it's a good thing?

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,480
Can you stop saying the word?

59
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,160
Well...

60
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,320
I can't stand it anymore.

61
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,920
I have a good idea.

62
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,040
Who are you?

63
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,840
Why do you always let him play with you?

64
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,120
Are you bored?

65
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,600
If I'm not bored,

66
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,320
will there be so many strong soldiers and horses

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
to gather here?

68
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,560
I'm familiar with this business.

69
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,280
Recently, the Lord has been making a face.

70
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,440
With the identity of Prince of Light,

71
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,960
he has been looking at people from far away.

72
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,560
Half of them are from me.

73
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm so smart

74
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,600
that I'm using it.

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,440
I'm just a martial arts expert.

76
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Good.

77
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,960
What's the point of you making so many soldiers?

78
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,600
The most important thing is to ensure that

79
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,840
the medicine is saved.

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,440
Then, you can get more food

81
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
to support the whole army of Liang.

82
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,640
Have you forgotten?

83
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Old De Lun.

84
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,400
Introduce the new one

85
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,080
to Bai Chuan.

86
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,960
Since we started the new one,

87
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,840
we have been making a lot of trouble

88
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,560
to gather the big and small business in the far away.

89
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,720
Until now,

90
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,240
our assets have reached

91
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,120
the top five

92
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,040
of the new one.

93
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,640
You used to be a man.

94
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,080
The land near the village of Bu Lu is still occupied by the Beizhu.

95
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,360
The way of business is different.

96
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
How can you go and buy food with Lu Di?

97
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
That's right.

98
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,840
You can't buy food from Beizhu?

99
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,360
I can buy food from Zichuan.

100
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,320
So I decided

101
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,760
that I would return to Zichuan

102
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,280
and take care of the land.

103
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,400
You're not going to die.

104
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,360
You'll be sent to death

105
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,520
if the land is attacked.

106
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
That's right.

107
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
I'm not going to die.

108
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
I'm not going to die.

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes.

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,960
What if you leave us?

111
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,400
If you know that there is no Prince of Light,

112
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,760
Lu Di will definitely come back to trouble.

113
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,160
I...

114
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,600
You don't have to worry.

115
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,280
As for Lu Di...

116
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,000
Can't you just come over?

117
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,280
Prince of Light

118
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,720
will stay in Bu Lu Village forever.

119
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,320
Due to the time of the earthquake,

120
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,240
the investigation of the capital and the poison case

121
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
can't be opened

122
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,680
because of the return of the five people.

123
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,080
The investigation is over.

124
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,680
If we don't deal with

125
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,800
the cases of these people,

126
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,400
we can't open

127
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
the other few works.

128
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,640
My Lord.

129
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,080
What you said is not necessary.

130
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,360
Now, the law firm

131
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,800
is busy with the affairs of the Beizhu.

132
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,920
As for the military affairs,

133
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,280
some of the power of the Beizhu

134
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,880
are also affected by it.

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,600
Why don't you remind me?

136
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,080
The Beizhu is closed now.

137
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,920
I sent a warning letter to the capital.

138
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,280
I sent it to the door.

139
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,600
Half a month later,

140
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,360
the letter was still there.

141
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,960
It's useless to remind me.

142
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,160
I think

143
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,880
we must punish this matter.

144
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,320
Lord and Madam are against the law.

145
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,880
Now, the funeral is hurt.

146
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
We can understand.

147
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,600
But, as Lord Ge said,

148
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,000
the law firm of the Beizhu

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,440
is busy with the affairs of the capital.

150
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,840
It's not easy to relax here.

151
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,560
What do you think?

152
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,400
Chief,

153
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,640
what do you think?

154
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,320
The gate is closed.

155
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,440
Actually,

156
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,280
I'm worried.

157
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,800
What happened?

158
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,440
Lu this is the officers.

159
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,960
What people have become

160
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,760
lie on the Karst Triple?

161
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,920
Right.

162
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,080
Hail Ji.

163
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,200
Your Henri Chi,

164
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,000
吗,

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,560
that you've already paid the price of a dak

166
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,280
I believe that you will come back soon

167
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,960
don't need to get theied along

168
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,040
Minister of Eduardo is close with Diling

169
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,200
and you must at least say

170
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,280
about the previous o'clock

171
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,840
What اeif, applesauce

172
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,760
could contain달버钱

173
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,080
Who will give the legendary citizens'兒

174
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,040
the perfect answer?

175
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
That's not reasonable

176
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,600
It requires some time to repair it

177
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,000
But it's difficult to treat Silvius as his superior

178
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,520
The soul base is in itself

179
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,160
It is difficult to lead an army

180
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,020
Guards

181
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,560

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,760

Bird's¸d

184
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,200
My Lord, what can I do for you?

185
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,520
Tell me.

186
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,400
The soldiers in Soupって

187
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,480
were being ambushed

188
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,560
by the commander of the camp.

189
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,720
It came from these men,

190
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,200
so execution Dance σε't'TPe.

191
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,760
All our soldiers couldn't hold back,

192
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,120
so did Strategic floats Scla Itúd.

193
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,960
They only obeyed how Dbes te outward.

194
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,500
Since Division Chief of the camp,

195
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,440
interior personnel are in danger,

196
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
You will never think that

197
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
such a sharp blade

198
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,440
will recognize the master one day.

199
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
My lord,

200
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
the Lingling's family is not out now.

201
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
It's the best time to control Shulü Si.

202
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
If I miss it,

203
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
I'm afraid

204
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,440
Lingling will really become the next Yang Ming Hua.

205
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
I'm sorry.

206
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Get up.

207
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Shulü Si has become a good person

208
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
with a good word.

209
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
But I will never

210
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
replace him.

211
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
I've already led the Lingbing's division

212
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
and led Shulü's division.

213
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Don't you think that I

214
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
will also become the next Yang Ming Hua?

215
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
The smallest one needs to be stable

216
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
and three legs.

217
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
What's more,

218
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
a family?

219
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
I'm afraid

220
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
Lingling will become the next Yang Ming Hua.

221
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
I will also be the next Yang Ming Hua.

222
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
People of Shulü Si's division

223
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
will not be able to see

224
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Lingling's family.

225
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
I will also be the next Yang Ming Hua.

226
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
I'll take care of him.

227
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
I'll take care of Lingling.

228
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Lingling.

229
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Lingling,

230
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Lingling,

231
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Lingling,

232
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
Lingling,

233
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
Lingling,

234
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Lingling,

235
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Lingling,

236
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
Lingling,

237
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Lingling,

238
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,600
Lord Si Yuling is here.

239
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,080
Second Brother.

240
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,400
Brother.

241
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,720
It's time for you to go out.

242
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,360
I have to stay at Pei Xiu's house.

243
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:45,960
What?

244
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,280
Any news from Ah Xiu?

245
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,440
No.

246
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,760
Then you come here...

247
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,080
That's it.

248
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,560
Today,

249
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,640
I went to take over the law firm of the school.

250
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,960
Did you succeed?

251
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,520
Of course, I was beaten up.

252
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
But they recommended to the military commander

253
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,600
to separate the law firm from the military police.

254
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,360
If the Luo Lumin Sea can do this,

255
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,960
I will be so proud of it.

256
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,240
Xiao Jia.

257
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,160
You're awake.

258
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,800
Si Yuling is here.

259
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,480
I didn't let her disturb you.

260
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,360
I don't know if this season

261
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,440
is still in the past.

262
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,160
As long as you want to eat,

263
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,200
you will get it.

264
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,640
Wait.

265
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,880
I'll go buy it for you.

266
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,280
Madam.

267
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,480
You don't have to care about the wind and rain outside.

268
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,320
I'll go buy it for you.

269
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,120
I'll go buy it for you.

270
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,360
I'll go buy it for you.

271
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,000
I'll go buy it for you.

272
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,680
I'll go buy it for you.

273
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,440
I'll go buy it for you.

274
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,760
Mr. Lumin,

275
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,560
you won't be taken away by the law firm.

276
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,240
No.

277
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,880
I can't let her bear these alone.

278
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,760
Xiao Jia, look.

279
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,600
Where's Madam?

280
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
She went to the store.

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,120
The sea-dried noodles on the signboard.

282
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,320
Please enjoy.

283
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,560
Do you need anything else?

284
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,480
A pound of beef.

285
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,680
A pot of braised beef.

286
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,440
Please wait.

287
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,200
Lu, a pound of beef.

288
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,720
Okay.

289
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,840
Come back.

290
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,880
Thank you.

291
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Xiao Jia.

292
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,720
Thank you.

293
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,080
Thanks for what?

294
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,720
You're afraid of是太大心

295
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
to whom I'll get Lead Power,

296
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,320
even though I got lost here.

297
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,840
And now, you haven't recovered.

298
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,360
The dishes haven't..................

299
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,480
They are just thrós chops

300
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,960
so it's impossible for you to get rid of them.

301
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,120
Seriously.

302
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,280
As your father and I used to live,

303
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,120
I really need your support now.

304
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,120
Why do you think so?

305
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Since you understand my feelings,

306
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
you must know my determination.

307
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,120
You must be patient again.

308
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Why not start over?

309
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
At this moment,

310
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,120
I will play the piano to accompany you.

311
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
I will listen to you.

312
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
If you feel that it's hard,

313
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
don't make yourself difficult.

314
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
You are always a stubborn person.

315
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
If I were like a normal girl,

316
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
I would be afraid of suffering and suffering.

317
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
How can I be your wife?

318
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Of course,

319
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
if I were a normal girl,

320
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
I would make you be as angry as possible.

321
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
I will be very strict with you.

322
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
I have you,

323
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
that's enough.

324
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
I will be very strict with you.

325
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,120
I will be very strict with you.

326
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
I will be very strict with you.

327
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,120
I will be very strict with you.

328
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,120
I will be very strict with you.

329
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,120
I will be very strict with you.

330
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
I will be very strict with you.

331
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,120
I will be very strict with you.

332
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
I will be very strict with you.

333
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
I will be very strict with you.

334
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
I will be very strict with you.

335
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,120
I will be very strict with you.

336
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,120
I will be very strict with you.

337
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,120
I will be very strict with you.

338
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,120
I will be very strict with you.

339
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
I will be very strict with you.

340
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
Minister Jin Zhang,

341
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Lord Luo is here.

342
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Lord Luo.

343
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
Lord Luo.

344
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
Today I am already married.

345
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,320
The Shuryu Temple and the ice tea team should be divided.

346
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,520
I heard that when you went to pick up the ice tea team,

347
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
you also touched a nose.

348
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,720
Indeed.

349
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
The bamboo sword

350
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,720
is located behind the Shuryu Temple and the ice tea team.

351
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,120
However,

352
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,320
the ice tea team should be my Zichuan's.

353
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,320
Not his brother's.

354
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,720
The bamboo sword.

355
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,920
It seems that today is the day of the ice tea team's practice.

356
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Yes.

357
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
Okay.

358
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,720
Take it and go and have a look.

359
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
Yes.

360
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Yes.

361
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
Yes.

362
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Yes.

363
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Yes.

364
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Yes.

365
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
How dare you kill the lord in front of the army commander?

366
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
Stop the training.

367
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,320
My lord, you are welcome. Please punish me.

368
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,720
There is no punishment.

369
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,120
You have the ability to train.

370
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,520
The sword skill of the ice tea team is excellent.

371
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,120
You have given the sword to the shui.

372
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,720
I won't punish you.

373
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,520
You can't punish them even if you go back.

374
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Yes.

375
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,120
Please punish me.

376
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Okay.

377
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,320
Although I have been away for a while,

378
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,720
the training of the ice tea team is not as good as the emperor's.

379
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
Yes.

380
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,120
It's hard to get such a good result.

381
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Ding Ling.

382
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,520
This is all your credit.

383
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,920
I am ashamed.

384
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,520
How is it?

385
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,520
Have you taken care of the family affairs?

386
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Yes.

387
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,920
Before, the ice tea team had a group of soldiers to spread around the room.

388
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,320
It seems that it was just a short process of spreading the word.

389
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,120
The ice tea team has been training so hard.

390
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,920
I believe that the rumor will disappear soon.

391
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
Yes.

392
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,120
But I think that the country of the military is full of military power.

393
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,120
It's hard to get rid of it.

394
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,720
You are right.

395
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,720
Please punish me.

396
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,120
The ice tea team is so strong.

397
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
That's Ding Ling's responsibility.

398
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Of course, Ding Ling can rebuild the capital.

399
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
And Lord Luo has the power.

400
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
I dare not.

401
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:44,320
So, I can rest assured that you are here in my capital.

402
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,720
Only Zichuan can be safe.

403
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,720
As for the punishment, I think it's fine.

404
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
If you insist on the punishment,

405
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,120
then let's have a feast and have a feast together.

406
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Yes.

407
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Yes.

408
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Yes.

409
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Of course.

410
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,520
You are in the south camp today.

411
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,920
The brothers are in the war.

412
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,520
You can come back.

413
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,520
It's good.

414
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,920
You have worked hard during this time.

415
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,920
I should do it.

416
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,920
But when you were not here,

417
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,320
Luo Mi Hai tried to set up a law firm.

418
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,920
Now, he told you to be punished.

419
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
I am sorry.

420
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,720
Luo Mi Hai did not do anything suspicious.

421
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,520
But the court is afraid of the smallest people.

422
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,720
Luo Mi Hai is not a small person.

423
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,320
He just hates me.

424
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,920
Besides, it's been a long time since I came here.

425
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
What's wrong?

426
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
Do you have any idea?

427
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
My lord.

428
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,920
I was thinking that you are trying to kill Luo Mi Hai.

429
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
You are worried that the whole society will be in danger.

430
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
It's actually the will of the military commander.

431
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
It's really the will of the military commander.

432
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,920
He asked me to come back in such a hurry.

433
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
He didn't really let Luo Mi Hai take care of me.

434
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
I am afraid that he will be in danger.

435
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
I am afraid that he will be in danger.

436
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
I am afraid that he will be in danger.

437
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,920
He wants to be a hostage.

438
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Although I have a strong argument with Luo Mi Hai.

439
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
But I am not suspicious of him.

440
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
But Luo Mi Hai is just a person.

441
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,920
His talent is in the service of the court.

442
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,920
And he is not the commander of the military commander.

443
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
According to your statement,

444
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,920
the best arrangement is that you come to the military commander.

445
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Let Luo Mi Hai take care of the law firm.

446
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
That's right.

447
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
But after Yang Ming Hua's death,

448
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,920
the military commander will not let anyone who is strong in his life die.

449
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,920
Even if we can let the people stay in peace.

450
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Let the people stay in peace.

451
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Once the enemy is out of control.

452
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
Then we will face more trouble.

453
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,920
Then why don't you tell the military commander about your idea?

454
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
I believe that for the sake of the great plan of Zichuan.

455
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,920
The military commander will understand your intentions.

456
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
This is not something that we should think about.

457
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Yes.

458
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
I have a fight with Luo Mi Hai.

459
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
And more important thing is waiting for us to do it.

460
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
By the way.

461
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
I am not in these days.

462
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Do you have any news?

463
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Yes.

464
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
About a month ago,

465
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
a light king appeared in Yuanzhou.

466
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Now he leads all the Yuanzhou tribes to fight against the northern army.

467
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
The light king of Yuanzhou?

468
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Yes.

469
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Have you found out his identity?

470
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Not yet.

471
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
Do you know this man in the three provinces?

472
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Not yet.

473
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Since the time of the Yuanzhou military commander.

474
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
Our light king is dead.

475
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,920
Except for some of the greedy people in our Lü Si.

476
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,920
It was the light king you brought from the dragon.

477
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Now it is the seventh time.

478
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
The seventh time is not mature yet.

479
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Yes.

480
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Don't worry about it.

481
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Keep an eye on the light king.

482
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Yes.

483
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Why are you treating me like this?

484
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
It's not a month's work.

485
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,920
I haven't finished reading it.

486
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,920
I mean.

487
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
I will check it after a month.

488
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,920
I hope you won't let me down.

489
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,920
So you want to steal it.

490
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,920
I want to prepare a wedding for Master Si Yiling.

491
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
What?

492
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Nothing.

493
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
I suddenly feel like

494
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
everyone has grown up.

495
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Am I going to grow up?

496
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

497
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

498
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

499
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

500
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

501
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

502
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

503
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

504
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

505
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

506
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

507
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

508
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

509
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,920
I'm going to make a wedding for you.

510
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
I think

511
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,920
I'm the only one who opposes you and Li Qing's marriage.

512
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,920
Your Highness, are you a little late to oppose me now?

513
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Is there something too hasty?

514
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,920
But after thinking about it,

515
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,920
you marry Li Qing and hurt two people.

516
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Don't you love Khadana?

517
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
I love her.

518
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,920
I love her till the end.

519
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
I love her till the end.

520
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
I'll die without you.

521
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
Then why don't you wait for her?

522
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Your Highness,

523
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,920
do you know that

524
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,920
you're lucky that you can wait for us?

525
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,920
I don't think I can see her for the rest of my life.

526
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Yes.

527
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,920
No one can force me to marry someone I don't like.

528
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
At least not now.

529
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Are you sure that

530
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,920
you think I'm naive?

531
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Your Highness,

532
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
in this world,

533
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,920
people can choose based on their heart.

534
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
But there are some things

535
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
that are not too late.

536
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,920
There are some things that are not too late.

537
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,920
Do you have any feelings for Li Qing?

538
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
I've said it before.

539
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,920
There are some things that are not too late.

540
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
After growing up,

541
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
people can only be lazy and lazy.

542
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,920
They don't want to do things themselves.

543
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Li Qing said you didn't want to grow up.

544
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Your sadness at that time

545
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
was mostly because of Khadana.

546
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,920
And also because of A'Xiu.

547
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,920
A'Xiu loves you.

548
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,920
He wants to be with you.

549
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,920
But he doesn't think he can match you.

550
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
This doesn't mean he has the right to.

551
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
It's not the position.

552
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
It's because he thinks he's not able

553
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
to protect you.

554
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Xiaoning,

555
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
it's time

556
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,920
to bear the burden of your own.

557
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
It's time

558
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,920
to bear the burden of your own.

559
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Come back to have a drink

560
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
on the day you were married.

561
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
Everyone

562
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,920
has to bear the burden of their own.

563
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
There's still life.

564
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
It's too late.

565
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
It's a bit too late.

566
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
It's too late.

567
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Black Tiger Gang.

568
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
A woman?

569
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,920
I just got a little bit of a headache.

570
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
But don't fight it.

571
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
Don't fight it.

572
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
You want to fight? Go outside and fight.

573
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,920
I'm not a broadcaster.

574
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
Thank you.

575
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
Go.

576
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
My lord, it's okay.

577
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
I just have to remember something.

578
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
You can just pretend you don't exist.

579
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,920
But I have to say something.

580
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
You men

581
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
are trying to kill a little girl.

582
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
Isn't that inappropriate?

583
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
Look at my mouth.

584
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
Go on. Go on.

585
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
Your martial arts skills are good.

586
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
It seems that you don't need my help.

587
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
This move is dead end.

588
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
It's quite flexible when it's used.

589
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
Go.

590
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Watch out.

591
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,120
You guys,

592
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,520
you have to use this kind of slum

593
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,720
to go too far.

594
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
This is too troublesome.

595
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,520
You're forcing me to do it.

596
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,320
Can you still hold on?

597
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,320
Little brat, no problem.

598
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,720
You're doing well.

599
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,120
You're also a bit pouty.

600
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,320
Let's go.

601
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,720
Brothers, retreat!

602
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,120
Let's go!

603
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,120
That move you just now,

604
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,320
you were so quick to take it.

605
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,520
It was very clever of you.

606
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,320
We can make mistakes in the future.

607
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,720
Who are you again?

608
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,120
I...

609
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,520
I'm the enemy of N-Gang.

610
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,720
Are you okay?

611
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,320
Are you okay?

612
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,520
This is raining.

613
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,120
I don't know if I should take advantage of you.

614
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,720
I only know how to fight.

615
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,920
I'm eliminated.

616
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,520
What I'm expecting is

617
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,620
an exhibition of my temple sword'msaid because you wanted this weapon

618
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,520
to look so nice from the front and back.

619
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,920
Thank you Mother.

620
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,320
Shoot enemy!

621
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,920
Wait, no way.

622
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,720
Be careful.

623
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,320
If you want to repay me in this way,

624
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,400
I won't accept it.

625
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,920
Don't you want to go to the pharmacy?

626
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,840
Hurry up.

627
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
You...

628
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,840
You can praise my skin and trust you,

629
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,160
or say I'm handsome.

630
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,240
But don't tell me how serious I got hurt.

631
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,760
Then...

632
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,120
Then I'll get hurt.

633
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,840
You can bear it.

634
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,400
Okay.

635
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,680
Okay.

636
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Okay.

637
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,520
But I can...

638
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,600
Wrap it up.

639
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,000
You...

640
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,440
You can take it from the left.

641
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,320
Give it to me.

642
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,600
You can take it from the left.

643
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,960
Like this.

644
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,800
Okay.

645
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,840
My darts have messed up.

646
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,120
Should I leave them on you?

647
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,120
Mine?

648
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,120
No.

649
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,120
Wait.

650
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Look.

651
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,120
My clothes are also wet.

652
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Fine.

653
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Fine.

654
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,120
I'll take it as a good job.

655
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Okay.

656
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Okay.

657
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,960
Of course.

658
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,640
But my eyes

659
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,240
suggest you're totally different from your look.

660
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,120
Your eyes Uncle

661
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,440
are similar!

662
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,420
Thank you, Uncle.

663
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,760
Uncle?!

664
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,880
Look how I look around, Uncle!

665
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
Tian She.

666
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,060
Chen He.

667
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,600
de agents.

668
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,140
My grandma like soldiers from south to north.

669
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,000
From the west itMM comes with force,

670
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,360
Clothes so breasts so thighs.

671
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,500
Elsa cooperates.

672
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,160
Uncle.

673
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,720
What is it?

674
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,640
This is the following of you and my father.

675
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,320
If you still have feelings for my daughter,

676
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,440
may I ask you to take care of her?

677
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,760
These days,

678
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,680
he has already taken care of your daughter more.

679
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,720
But he already does not need people to be somewhat blinded.

680
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,800
Do you know?

681
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,920
He is a good person.

682
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,780
Uh,

683
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,320
If you don't take care of her,

684
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,880
I'm so hot.

685
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,760
Miss, wake up.

686
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,920
Wake up.

687
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,960
Don't wake up.

688
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,280
I'm going to sleep.

689
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,280
Drink the medicine first.

690
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,640
Drink it.

691
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,440
Empress Dow couple.

692
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,280
What shall we do?

693
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,840
Good!

694
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,720
Come on.

695
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,400
Hi, First.

696
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,160
Get up!

697
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,240
Go, let's go!

698
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,440
Midi.

699
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,320
You are really lucky.

700
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,920
I got Thorn Yaire Golden正.

701
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,200
I asked him before.

702
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,000
I didn't expect you to be so hardworking.

703
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,080
Fire's coming.

704
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,080
Bullshitting!

705
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,780
з

706
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,100
I Action it for your sake.

707
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,500
When you got up, you stood up,

708
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,140
And parts for your sake.

709
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,140
Zannui's a traitor!

710
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,340
You don't know what I've scandaled昨emniknight?

711
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,100
Hurry up!

712
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,100
Then you can't let me do it.

713
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,100
I want you to do it.

714
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,100
If you didn't see it yesterday,

715
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,100
I would have been so lazy.

716
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,100
You...

717
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,100
Don't come over here.

718
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,100
Are you hurt now?

719
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,100
It seems that the fever is cured.

720
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
The wound in the back is fine, right?

721
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,100
I'm fine.

722
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,100
Are you hungry?

723
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,100
No.

724
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,100
Not bad. You are quite healthy.

725
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,100
Why don't you ask my name?

726
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
My name is Lin Yu.

727
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,100
That's good.

728
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,100
Last night, the rain came.

729
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,100
That's why I called you Lin Yu.

730
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,100
Miss Lin Yu,

731
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,100
how much money do you owe others?

732
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,100
Why so many people?

733
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,100
I only want to catch you.

734
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,100
My father is a businessman in the capital.

735
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,100
Yesterday, the group of people

736
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,100
kidnapped me to earn money.

737
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,100
I'm really asking this question.

738
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,100
This Black Tiger Gang

739
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
cares about this kind of thing.

740
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,100
My father is not a normal businessman.

741
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,100
Miss Lin Yu,

742
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,100
the sun is out.

743
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,100
The rain has stopped.

744
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,100
But,

745
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,100
you should be more careful in the future.

746
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,100
Thank you for your kindness.

747
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,100
You're welcome.

748
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,100
You're welcome.

749
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,100
You know I'm kind.

750
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,100
But I'm so angry.

751
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,100
You're so angry.

752
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,100
Well,

753
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,100
call me back.

754
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,100
It's hard to fight with a woman.

755
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,100
How can a man

756
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,100
help me

757
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,100
to think I'm a bad person?

758
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,100
I, Li A'Wu,

759
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,100
am always bedridden.

760
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,100
I suggest you to go to the private room.

761
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,100
I'm just a life-saving person.

762
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,100
I'm just a life-saving person.

763
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,100
I'm just a life-saving person.

764
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,100
How could I

765
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,100
have any bad intentions?

766
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,100
I'm so stupid.

767
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,100
I'm just a life-saving person.

768
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,100
I'm so stupid.

769
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,100
You're so polite.

770
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,100
Are you satisfied?

771
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,100
Yes.

772
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,100
Yes.

773
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,100
This is the rain

774
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,100
of kindness.

775
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,100
But,

776
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
yesterday,

777
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,100
you called me Zhang A'San.

778
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,100
Today,

779
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,100
you're Li A'Wu.

780
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,100
I'm Li A'Wu.

781
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,100
This morning,

782
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,100
I called you Wang A'Si.

783
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,100
And this night,

784
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,100
you called me Zhang A'San.

785
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,100
It's easy

786
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,100
to enter the world.

787
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,100
You can call me anything.

788
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,100
For example,

789
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,100
you can call me

790
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,100
Zhang A'San.

791
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,100
You can call me Zhang A'Yan.

792
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,100
I'm Sun Tengxing.

793
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,100
With Junliang and Shoupi,

794
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,100
your identity...

795
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,100
My identity

796
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,100
is not a problem for you.

797
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,100
I really called you Li A'Wu this morning.

798
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,100
And this night,

799
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,100
you called me Wang A'Si.

800
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,100
And this night,

801
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,100
you called me Zhang A'San.

802
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,100
I'm not hungry at all.

803
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,100
Shoufu,

804
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,100
how do you eat?

805
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,100
There's a problem.

806
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,100
Miss Fu,

807
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,100
are you also so jealous?

808
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,100
I'm just a random person.

809
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,100
I don't have any jealousy.

810
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,100
Besides,

811
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,100
the taste is not bad.

812
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,100
I saw you

813
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,100
by the wayside of a girl.

814
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,100
That's why I saved you.

815
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,100
I didn't expect

816
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,100
that you, Miss Fu,

817
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,100
would be so jealous.

818
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,100
I didn't expect that

819
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,100
A'San is still a handsome guy.

820
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,100
He's just a little bit

821
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,100
naughty,

822
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,100
rude,

823
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,100
and has no words.

824
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,100
We're like that.

825
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,100
Actually,

826
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,100
I'm a person

827
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,100
who loves to clean up.

828
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,100
I'm very energetic.

829
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,100
I wash my face every day.

830
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,100
But

831
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,100
I ran into a big water yesterday.

832
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,100
I accidentally got into the water.

833
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,100
For now,

834
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,100
I'm a little bit lazy.

835
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,100
You hide first.

836
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,100
Xia Zhi.

837
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,100
Xia Zhi.

838
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,100
Don't be afraid.

839
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,100
You're fighting.

840
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,100
Don't think.

841
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,100
This is a side effect.

842
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,100
Let's put that side effect on.

843
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,100
That's a body.

844
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,100
That's a body.

845
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,100
Then you have a body.

846
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,100
Xia Zhi has forgotten it.

847
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,100
Sorry.

848
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,100
It's a lesson.

849
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,100
Forget it.

850
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,100
I'm teaching everyone

851
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,100
to do some exercises.

852
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,100
It's not for that.

853
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,100
Sorry.

854
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,100
And

855
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,100
I'm going to

856
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,100
attack the opponent.

857
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,100
I'm sorry.

858
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,100
I'll do it from this point.

859
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,100
Wei Wei.

860
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,100
You can learn to be free

861
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,100
from the past.

862
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,100
And be away from the future.

863
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,100
Right?

864
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,100
I'm not a girl.

865
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,100
Be quiet.

866
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,100
I'm just a little bit lazy.

867
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,100
Sorry.

868
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,100
Your Highness,

869
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,100
you've been busy all day.

870
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,100
You've been busy all night.

871
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,100
You've been busy all day.

872
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,100
Sorry.

873
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,100
I'm not that busy.

874
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,100
Wei Wei.

875
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,100
I'm so relaxed.

876
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,100
The winter wall is so fast.

877
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,100
It's cold in the winter.

878
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,100
Let's do it again.

879
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,100
In the cold.

880
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,100
This is

881
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,260
so

882
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,260
so

883
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,260
so

884
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,260
you

885
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,260
are so

886
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,260
so

887
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,260
so

888
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,260
you are so

889
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,260
so

890
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,260
so

891
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,260
sorry.
