Pursue the passion

Episode 16

18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,400
For the past ten years,

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,000
we have been able to fight within our own country,

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,400
fight outside the war,

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
and hold our hearts.

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,200
This wound will heal very quickly.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
And you are a man of great courage.

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,200
Why must you be so worried?

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Moreover...

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Moreover, you will see

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,800
the power of courage in person.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,400
The world

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,400
is a human.

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,640
The kendera

31
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,840
Lord熙組、

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,040
Wouldn't do me in a rightful position.

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,200
Yang Ning Hua is traitors,

34
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,600
Li Hong and its members is traitors,

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,120
Yuan Zhou is traitors,

36
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
The family and the family.

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,120
So many places have been lost.

38
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,320
Zichuan is like this.

39
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,920
I was wrong.

40
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,120
I can't let the Zichuan family

41
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,120
be defeated by me.

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
I can't let Xiao Ning

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
come to be the heir

44
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,120
with empty hands.

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,520
My lord.

46
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,520
Di Ling, you're right.

47
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,120
What does it mean to be cursed by the world?

48
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,320
It means our family will be destroyed.

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Our honor

50
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,320
is not enough.

51
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,320
The phoenix is in the nether world.

52
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,520
The jade is reborn.

53
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,920
Just do as you said.

54
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Go... Go and do it.

55
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,320
Yes.

56
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,920
Shi Sh Video

57
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,520
We can't die.

58
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,980
My places.

59
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,980
My Yuan Zhou.

60
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,980
My Yuan Zhou.

61
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,980
My Yuan Zhou.

62
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,980
My Yuan Zhou.

63
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,980
My Yuan Zhou.

64
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,980
Yuan Zhou.

65
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,980
My Yuan Zhou.

66
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,980
My Yuan Zhou.

67
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,980
My Yuan Zhou.

68
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,980
My Yuan Zhou.

69
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,100
If someone goes to Ruoyang,

70
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,660
I'm ready to sacrifice my own life enough

71
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,380
so that the Sangha can't protect them in charge about CaoECA.

72
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,860
Imperial size has been confirmed.

73
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,780
What are you doing?

74
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,340
But my father arrived quite late.

75
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,980
I still have time.

76
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,620
Michelle has arrangedlagen skiing website.

77
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,620
Yuan Zhou City is gone!

78
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,620
Yuan Zhou City is gone!

79
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,620
My Yuan Zhou City is gone!

80
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,620
Gone!

81
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,540
The

82
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,620
sudden death was too hasty.

83
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,620
I'm sorry.

84
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,620
It's fine.

85
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,620
Let's go.

86
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,620
Wait.

87
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
You, the North Princess,

88
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,620
are in the house of my Princess Zichuan, right?

89
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,620
You can come and go as you please.

90
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,620
I won't allow it.

91
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,620
Your Highness, the overall situation is important.

92
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,620
If you want to get married,

93
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,620
you must go through my three levels.

94
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,620
I'll wait for you outside.

95
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,620
We didn't get drunk and didn't return at the time of the wedding.

96
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,620
We'll be drinking and doing the same thing today.

97
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,620
Your Highness, after drinking, you usually want to eat something.

98
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,620
Xiao Man, don't forget to recite it.

99
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,620
When you first arrived in the capital,

100
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,620
you often thought of the North Tribe's delicacies.

101
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,620
Today, I prepared for you the delicacies of the capital.

102
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,620
You must eat it.

103
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,620
You can't forget it for the rest of your life.

104
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,620
This is delicious. Try it.

105
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,620
I chose it carefully. Of course it's delicious.

106
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:09,620
This handkerchief is the one you used to wipe the ink when you first entered the manor.

107
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,620
Our friendship

108
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,620
came from that misunderstanding.

109
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,620
Today,

110
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,620
we are enemies.

111
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,620
Today, I'm afraid that Duan Yi

112
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,620
and you two are no longer friends.

113
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,620
In my heart,

114
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,620
I'm afraid that you two

115
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,620
will be friends forever.

116
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,620
One day,

117
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,620
the North Tribe and the Purple River will also be friends.

118
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,620
Come.

119
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,620
Come.

120
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,620
Come.

121
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,620
I'll ride the horse to the Purple River to deal with the medicine.

122
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,620
Be careful.

123
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,620
Ding Ling!

124
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,620
Ding Ling!

125
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,620
Xiu Jia!

126
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,620
Xiu Jia!

127
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,620
I came back too hastily.

128
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,620
I thought you were angry.

129
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,620
I was a little cold, but I didn't get thin.

130
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,620
It seems that you are obedient.

131
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,620
I thought I wouldn't be able to see you this time.

132
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,620
Lord Cang Xing treated me very well.

133
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,620
He knew that you were in a hurry this time,

134
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,620
so he hurried to see you.

135
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,620
You don't have to go back to the Commandery Chief's Manor anymore.

136
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,620
Lord Cang Xing, you really think a lot.

137
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,620
Although I don't know the details,

138
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,620
I think you have to take care of everyone.

139
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,620
My flower can't be forgotten.

140
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,620
Remember it.

141
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,620
You must come back alive.

142
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,620
I and the child are watching you ride the horse.

143
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,620
Don't look back.

144
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,620
Let the child see what kind of cause his father is.

145
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,620
Lord Jin is such a girl.

146
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,620
Lord Jin and Xiu Jia have already been separated for anudding parents.

147
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,060
I also think you should

148
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,380
lead our Little Prince to leave.

149
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,540
Handcuff him.

150
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,300
ancian

151
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,260
soon

152
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,620
Why does he come here?

153
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,220
Lang

154
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,380
You come.

155
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,060
No, I'll trust this is what you promised Meiling.

156
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,520
This time, I meant everything.

157
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,080
This time, I'veuzu.

158
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,420
From now on,

159
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,440
what'll happen between both sides,

160
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,300
I've already sent Diling to Pai.

161
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:10,540
Showing the green green opened up this

162
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,940
criteria.

163
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,500
So Eight Dwords,

164
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,900
You don't need to worry about it.

165
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,060
My lord.

166
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,300
This Yuan Zhou is the barrier of Zichuan.

167
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,860
The only hope is to defeat Yuan Zhou.

168
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,700
Zichuan is in danger.

169
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,220
If you take the power of the whole clan,

170
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,820
and fight again,

171
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,860
you will lose your temper and lose your face.

172
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,820
You don't need to worry about it.

173
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,380
My lord.

174
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,820
If you don't fight for your life,

175
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,700
how can you face the people of Qingyuan?

176
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,300
You know the battle situation.

177
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,300
Come and talk to me.

178
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,500
It's too late.

179
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,980
It's too late.

180
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,500
It's too late.

181
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,180
It's too late.

182
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,620
My lord.

183
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,220
My lord.

184
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,420
It's too late.

185
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,380
Dongxue.

186
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,820
Dongxue.

187
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,340
Videos of expectations.

188
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,940
Just nothing.

189
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,740
Just nothing.

190
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,740
They're all fake!

191
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,340
You've got what you want.

192
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,980
bringen to the right path.

193
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,020
But they seem to have been possessed by a demon.

194
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,340
Every time they kill, their eyes are blood red.

195
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,540
Don't talk nonsense.

196
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,340
A Pai Yi City is not enough to attack.

197
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,780
Lord Shen Huang is still watching us from behind.

198
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,580
Pai Yi, we must take it down.

199
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,060
Prepare to attack the city tonight.

200
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,780
Don't ride on the horse.

201
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,340
All of you, march forward.

202
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,620
Don't attack the city.

203
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,860
As long as we save our lives,

204
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,780
we won't attack the city.

205
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,180
We only want Zhu Xin alive.

206
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,180
Yes.

207
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Eat some.

208
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
I'm not eating anymore.

209
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,420
Eating at this time is easy to get sleepy.

210
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,860
This is also the most vulnerable time.

211
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,660
Our opponents also like to attack the city at this time.

212
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,420
You should eat some.

213
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,740
It will boost your stamina.

214
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,820
I'll eat half of it, you eat half.

215
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,980
Okay.

216
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,140
A Ze.

217
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,780
Why don't you tell us about the stories of the girls of Chunfeng Courtyard?

218
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,380
My Lord, we must save the girls' lives.

219
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,980
You're too much.

220
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,060
Soldiers and devils.

221
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,140
Brothers are thinking about their families,

222
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,900
their families and girls.

223
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,380
Then I don't need to tell stories.

224
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,420
I can cure your lovesickness by singing.

225
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,660
The mountains are hard to climb.

226
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,300
The osmanthus flowers are fragrant.

227
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,740
The osmanthus flowers are fragrant.

228
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:47,300
They are in my heart.

229
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,700
Take off the armor in the city.

230
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,540
Take off the mask of Yibei.

231
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,500
Wait for the summer to end.

232
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,100
Play this dream.

233
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,180
Change the wine to the heaven.

234
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,780
Write problems down.

235
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,580
Last night.

236
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,260
Prepare the minds!

237
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,780
Yes...

238
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,540
Mu Ci!

239
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,340
Mu Ci!

240
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,060
Mu Ci!

241
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,060
Attention, everyone!

242
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,540
Keep your guard up!

243
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
Don't fall into the water!

244
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,420
Yes, sir!

245
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,100
Get in!

246
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Hurry!

247
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
Don't move!

248
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,340
Mu Ci!

249
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,380
Mu Ci!

250
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,260
Mu Ci!

251
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,300
Mu Ci!

252
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,140
Mu Ci!

253
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,380
Mu Ci!

254
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,380
It feels so cool to have a group!

255
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,540
Your torch is still burning

256
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,980
Brothers!

257
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,420
Light up the path we took together

258
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,780
Keep singing!

259
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,020
In our memory

260
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,060
I'm going to save her

261
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,780
In our memory

262
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,940
Let me go!

263
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,220
I'm going to save her!

264
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,340
In our memory

265
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,380
Let me go, Zi Chuan Xiu!

266
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,460
Old friends who have disappeared

267
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
I'm going home now

268
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
In our memories

269
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,620
Let me go, Zi Chuan Xiu!

270
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,660
Dad!

271
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,260
I'm waiting for you to open your mouth

272
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
I'm sorry

273
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,140
Mu Ci!

274
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,660
Mu Ci!

275
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Who is it?

276
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,660
Stop!

277
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,620
I'm the son of Zi Chuan

278
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,060
I'm here to see the late emperor!

279
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,740
Stop!

280
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,900
Why don't you fight back?

281
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,300
I'm here to negotiate

282
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,340
Not to fight back

283
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,460
You have some guts

284
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
No wonder you're so brave

285
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
You have some guts

286
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,980
No wonder you're so brave

287
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,020
You're so brave

288
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,060
You're so brave

289
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,100
You're so brave

290
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,140
You're so brave

291
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,180
You're so brave

292
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,860
No wonder you dare to break into the enemy camp

293
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
What's your name?

294
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,940
The family of Zi Chuan

295
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,980
Jinwei Jing Qi Ling

296
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,020
Ge Qing

297
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,060
I'm here to see the late emperor

298
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,100
Please inform me

299
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,140
During the period of the private investigation

300
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,180
I read the history books again

301
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,220
as what my father said

302
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,260
I read the history books again

303
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,300
I read the history books again

304
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,340
I read the history books again

305
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,380
I read the history books again

306
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,420
I read the history books again

307
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,460
I read the history books again

308
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,460
At the same time

309
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
I got some new gain

310
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,940
Tell me

311
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,980
What do you think of the battle situation?

312
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,380
The party has been unable to attack for a long time

313
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,420
We can't control it

314
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,460
But

315
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,220
We can take the land

316
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,020
Father

317
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,860
I was just being careless

318
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,100
This time we will make the right move

319
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,540
We will make the right move

320
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,380
Please give me a second chance

321
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,380
Then in your opinion

322
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,420
How long will it take to capture Wayun?

323
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,740
Three months, your majesty

324
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,780
The Prince of the Wudu Palace

325
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,820
will be captured in three months

326
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,860
in the faraway land of Taiping

327
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,260
Your majesty

328
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,260
The emissary of the family of Zi Chuan sent a negotiator

329
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,260
to send a messenger to kill the emissary

330
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,300
I'm willing to see him

331
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,340
Zi Chuan is going to be dead

332
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,380
It's no use sending another hundred emissaries

333
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,420
Why should the military ambassador inform us?

334
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,460
Just kill him

335
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
It can take three months to capture Wayun

336
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,540
But can't you see the emissary?

337
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,260
Black Shark

338
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,780
I don't think you can send a messenger in person

339
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,820
I don't think you can send a messenger in person

340
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,860
I don't think you can send a messenger in person

341
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Let him in

342
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,260
Let him in

343
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
How dare you!

344
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,340
You should kneel down and bow to the emperor

345
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,340
I'm Ge Qing, the emissary of Zi Chuan

346
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,380
Greetings, your majesty

347
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,420
Ge Qing

348
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,740
It's been a long journey

349
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,220
What brings you here?

350
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,260
I'm here to bring you the greetings of the emperor

351
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,300
and the wish of peace

352
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,340
Peace?

353
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,380
Peace is what the weak need

354
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,420
The Northern Tribe doesn't need it

355
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,460
Your majesty

356
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Now the whole Western Chuan continent

357
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,540
is only separated by the Northern Tribe and the family of Zi Chuan

358
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,580
We should have been friends

359
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,620
But it's a pity

360
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,620
For hundreds of years, the war between the two sides has been constant

361
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,660
Now the war is even more tragic

362
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,700
We are so moved

363
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,740
The innocent people and the orphans are suffering

364
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,780
Your majesty, as the emperor of the foreign tribe

365
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,820
should think of the people and the people

366
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,860
and stop the war between the two tribes soon

367
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,900
Ge Qing, you've been here all the way

368
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,940
Have you seen our Northern Tribe's army?

369
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,980
I'm honored to see it

370
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,740
Then

371
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,460
What do you think?

372
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
The emperor is a great warrior

373
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,540
He's so powerful and mighty

374
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,580
Compared to the army of your family

375
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,620
what's the difference?

376
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,540
The emperor is powerful and the world is invincible

377
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,100
In the history of the Northern Tribe

378
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,140
there are Huang Jin Han and Ka Xi

379
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,180
Their previous military power

380
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,220
is no better than the emperor's

381
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260
How dare you!

382
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,300
Father, you are arrogant and arrogant

383
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,340
Huang Jin Han and Ka Xi are defeated in the city of Wanyun

384
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,380
He's trying to take advantage of your power

385
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,420
Please allow me to kill him

386
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,460
Where is your loyalty?

387
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,460
Where is your loyalty?

388
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,380
It's the same

389
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,420
It's meaningless to talk about it

390
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,460
In the future, your family will see it

391
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Your majesty

392
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,540
You've come here with such a big plan

393
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,580
You want to establish the Invincible State

394
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,620
But Wanyun is the most powerful fortress in the whole west

395
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,660
There are hundreds of thousands of our elite troops in the city

396
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,860
Even though the emperor's army is powerful

397
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,900
I'm afraid it's hard to say we'll win if we want to take Wanyun

398
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,940
I have a shallow suggestion

399
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,980
It can realize the wish of peace between the two sides

400
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:02,020
and the wish of the emperor to expand the territory

401
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,060
I wonder if you are interested

402
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,100
Say it

403
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,140
If you let the emperor go

404
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,180
and let the brothers of the Dishu Army go home

405
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,220
and then maintain the peace between the two tribes

406
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,260
I'll take my family with me

407
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,300
I'll give you the power of the 23-star Yuenzhou

408
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,340
So you don't have to move a single army

409
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,380
The whole Yuenzhou is your new territory

410
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,420
You want to take the Yuenzhou Quanjing

411
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,460
and exchange it for the Dishu Army's private forest

412
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,500
I have something to ask you

413
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,540
Please say it, your majesty

414
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,580
You take my things and give them to me

415
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,940
The whole Yuenzhou Quanjing is now

416
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,980
the burden of our North Tribe

417
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,020
We are using our own power

418
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,060
You killed my daughter, Kadan

419
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
You even sent Diling to the territory of our tribe

420
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,140
and killed him on the spot

421
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,060
Now you are talking about peace with me

422
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,100
You are the first to destroy the peace

423
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,140
You want me to let the Dishu Army go home

424
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,700
What a pity

425
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,740
I'll exchange it for the Dishu Army

426
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,660
Father is right

427
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,700
The emperor is powerful

428
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,740
Please calm down, your majesty

429
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,780
I have prepared another gift for you

430
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,820
besides the Yuenzhou

431
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,140
Father

432
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,180
I miss you so much

433
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,220
It's a gift for you

434
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,260
I'll take it

435
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,300
Thank you

436
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,340
I'll take it

437
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,380
Thank you

438
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,420
Thank you

439
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,460
Thank you

440
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
Thank you

441
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,540
Thank you

442
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,580
Thank you

443
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,620
Thank you

444
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,660
Thank you

445
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Father

446
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,740
I hope you can come back

447
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,780
I promise

448
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,820
As long as you withdraw the army

449
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,860
and return safely

450
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,900
I'll come back soon

451
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,940
Otherwise

452
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,980
I'm afraid I can't return to my homeland

453
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,020
and see you again

454
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,060
What do you want to do?

455
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Surrender to us North Tribe

456
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,140
This is your only way out

457
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,180
You all go out

458
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,780
Yes

459
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,580
The house of Zichuan

460
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,000
What canapan is wrong with us?

461
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,280
Well

462
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,840
Youů

463
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,400
You checked it door to door

464
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,020
Was she really dead?

465
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,900
Stop it.

466
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,700
You're the most excellent person

467
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,100
I've ever seen among the people in this period of time.

468
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,620
I've learned something from you, Di Lin.

469
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,540
You dare lie to me

470
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,700
yet you can be this calm.

471
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,820
IBrien, you're probably the first won.

472
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,420
You hate Lei Hong the most.

473
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,620
He's in my camp now.

474
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,460
I'm afraid it's meaningless

475
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,580
for you to keep going on like this.

476
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,260
Your Majesty is really wise.

477
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,740
I'm really a lowly man.

478
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,140
But a scoundrel like Lei Hong

479
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,620
is not worth mentioning.

480
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,700
You should know

481
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,940
that I'm not a man

482
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,020
who is good at fighting and not good at killing.

483
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,260
You killed so many soldiers of our Northern Tribe.

484
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,380
Why do you still dare to come here?

485
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,740
Since I dare to come here,

486
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,940
I've prepared myself to die.

487
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,420
You can say anything you want to kill.

488
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,540
But I forgot to remind you, Your Majesty.

489
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,260
Your Princess Cardan is still in my hands.

490
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,340
As long as I don't return in twelve hours,

491
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,940
Cardan's head will fall to the ground.

492
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,660
Your Majesty, you want to kill me?

493
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,940
But it's not that easy

494
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,380
to bring Cardan back to life.

495
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,340
You're scaring me!

496
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,540
Your Majesty, forgive me for being straightforward.

497
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,980
If I were to scare you again,

498
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,020
I could have used Cardan as a bargaining chip

499
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,420
and threaten you to retreat.

500
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,980
But I didn't do that.

501
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,340
Because I know

502
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,540
that even if we could get the Emperor back,

503
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,580
once Princess Cardan returns to the Northern Tribe,

504
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,500
we won't have any bargaining chip

505
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,540
to fight against the Northern Tribe.

506
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,380
Now, our family

507
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,420
has shown enough sincerity

508
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,580
to exchange for the survival of our two tribes.

509
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,060
I believe that

510
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,540
with His Majesty's life,

511
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,580
he will definitely make the right choice.

512
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,260
That's why I dare to come here.

513
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,260
You're so good at acting like a fool.

514
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,180
I'll give you a chance

515
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,940
to put Dishu Army and Si Yilin back in their hands.

516
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,100
And you can bring Cardan back to life.

517
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,380
At the intersection of the River of Wasteland,

518
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,140
Yun Qianxue will sign the treaty.

519
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,460
Your Majesty is wise.

520
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,660
It's the good fortune of both tribes.

521
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,620
I'll go back and arrange for retreat.

522
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,260
I'll take my leave.

523
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,700
Yulin,

524
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,220
if you stay in the Zichuan family,

525
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,500
we'll welcome you

526
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,380
at any time.

527
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,700
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

528
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,420
I still have some time.

529
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,740
If you want me to betray my family,

530
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,980
it's hard to do.

531
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,140
Goodbye.

532
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,540
Faizilai.

533
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,700
Is His Majesty reallylus back in the hook again?

534
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,700
Did you ever

535
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,260
look into his eyes?

536
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,860
I saw that he was very ambitious.

537
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,100
Zichuan's family faces such a deadlock,

538
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,100
I once

539
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,100
wanted to start a war

540
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,100
without any hesitation.

541
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,100
Khatun

542
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,100
is a man of his word.

543
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Kalan is a man of his word.

544
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,100
Both of them are useless.

545
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,100
Now,

546
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,100
they dare to do things behind my back.

547
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,100
Once the matter of Paiye is resolved,

548
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,100
I will teach them a good lesson.

549
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,100
The two princes' growth

550
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,100
will be over in ten days.

551
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,100
The time left

552
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,100
is not much.

553
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,100
We have been through

554
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,100
a lot of hardship

555
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,100
and now we are in a state of

556
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,100
struggle.

557
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,100
Once they pass

558
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,100
that wall,

559
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,100
our tribe will have no chance.

560
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,100
Now,

561
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,100
we must take over

562
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,100
the whole of the Western Chuan continent

563
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,100
in my lifetime

564
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,100
and make it peaceful.

565
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,100
Just a mere Paiye

566
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,100
will hurt both of us.

567
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Taking over the land

568
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,100
is beyond my expectation.

569
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,100
Your Majesty, you have the will of the Red Lake.

570
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,100
You don't have to be against the city.

571
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,100
You agreed to the deal with the land

572
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,100
and you got the 23-level

573
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,100
of the Yuan State

574
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,100
in your hands.

575
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,100
The 23-level Yuan State

576
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,100
is a good deal.

577
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,100
It sounds good.

578
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,100
For the past ten years,

579
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,100
the land is controlled

580
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,100
by the Ming family.

581
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,100
Now, it seems that

582
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,100
the land can't be unified.

583
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,100
I agree.

584
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,100
The Zichuan family wants to unify the Yuan State.

585
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,100
Our tribe is different from Zichuan.

586
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,100
Your Majesty,

587
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,100
you are not the same as

588
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,100
the old guy Zichuan Cangxing.

589
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,100
Your Majesty, you are the best.

590
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,100
Conquering the Western Chuan

591
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,100
is just a matter of time.

592
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,100
Huishang,

593
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,100
you have worked hard.

594
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,100
I will do my best

595
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,100
to help you conquer the Western Chuan.

596
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:24,380
Eric Wang,

597
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,180
President of President of W出obile,

598
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,700
President of Hu trade plant,

599
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,980
President of H.A.

600
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:39,980
Childe Yingcheng Square.

601
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,500
Prot karma does not come.

602
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,180
People go away from their relatives

603
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:42,300
Yao Nie!

604
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,380
delicious

605
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:49,380
She never left

606
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:58,380
Silence is just waiting for you to open your mouth

607
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,380
I miss the old times

608
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:12,380
Don't let go of the hands of the past

609
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:21,380
Someone likes to stay in the old place

610
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,380
I'm sorry, I forgot

611
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,380
I'll come again
