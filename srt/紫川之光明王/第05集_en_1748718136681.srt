1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What's going on?

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:52,820
It's

21
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,260
I'd rather die than die and was killed by a Safety Guard.

22
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,340
I don't want my dead сherryrian here.

23
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,860
Three Renak blood precisely on to the capital.

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,600
The name of the witness is Yin Mi.

25
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,860
How dare you lie and her meandering myself?

26
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,860
There's nothing I can do now.

27
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,660
Ice is falling down

28
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,280
Just a bit

29
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,860
Come on, General Yu Ling.

30
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,860
Zichuanxiu!

31
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,860
Princess.

32
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,860
Why did you kill my backup soldiers?

33
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,860
I dare to betray Zichuan.

34
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,860
I dare to betray Zichuan.

35
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,860
I dare to kill him.

36
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,860
Princess, dare to come closer!

37
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,860
I'll drag your princess to the grave.

38
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,860
Let go of him!

39
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,860
Zichuanxiu, you can't escape!

40
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,860
You're going to kill me anyway.

41
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,860
I'd rather drag your northern princess

42
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,860
to be my backup.

43
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,860
You're so bitter.

44
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,860
Let go of me, princess!

45
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,860
Zichuanxiu, what do you want?

46
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,860
You have the conditions.

47
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,860
You can just kick it out.

48
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,860
Let me out.

49
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,860
You can't stop me or follow me.

50
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,860
Until I feel safe,

51
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,860
I'll let go of you immediately.

52
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,860
If I turn anything upside down,

53
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,860
I'll let you fall into the ground immediately.

54
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,860
How do we know

55
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,860
if you'll obey me?

56
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,860
Because you don't have a choice.

57
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,860
You must believe me.

58
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,860
Or you want me to kill

59
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,860
the princess of the noble family now.

60
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,860
No!

61
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,860
Good.

62
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,860
Very good.

63
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,860
From now on,

64
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,860
I'll count five numbers.

65
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,860
If anyone else blocks me,

66
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,860
I'll let him fall into the ground immediately.

67
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,860
One!

68
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,860
Two!

69
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,860
Don't let him go.

70
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,860
If he goes,

71
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,860
the northern family will be in trouble.

72
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,860
Your Highness!

73
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,860
Now the princess is in his hands.

74
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,860
Don't let him go.

75
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
Three!

76
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
Move aside!

77
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,860
Help!

78
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,860
Stop!

79
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
Zi Chuan, you're so ridiculous.

80
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,860
I've agreed to your condition.

81
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,860
But you must take the promise.

82
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,860
Take care of the princess.

83
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,860
I'll take you with me.

84
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,860
Please.

85
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,860
But

86
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,860
if you dare to disobey your promise,

87
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
to hurt the princess,

88
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,860
it's good.

89
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,860
I'll make a move.

90
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,860
Even if I find the world,

91
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,860
I'll find you.

92
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Then I'll use the most cruel way in the world

93
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,860
to kill you.

94
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
I'll kill you.

95
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,860
I'll kill you.

96
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,860
All right.

97
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
I promise you.

98
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,860
After twelve hours,

99
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,860
I'll ask Sun Ling to come to me.

100
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
All soldiers, listen to me.

101
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,860
Don't let Zi Chuan,

102
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,860
the princess and princess

103
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,860
be killed.

104
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,860
I'll kill you.

105
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,860
Are you all right?

106
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,860
Let's go to the office.

107
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,860
Let's go.

108
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,860
You got hit by General Ling.

109
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,860
If you're going to be killed,

110
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,860
you can even die.

111
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,860
Song An.

112
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,860
Song An.

113
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,860
Stop bragging.

114
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,860
Look at me.

115
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,860
I'm doing fine now.

116
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,860
All right.

117
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,860
Take this pill.

118
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,860
It can relieve the pain.

119
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,860
Is it too mysterious?

120
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,860
I can't find it.

121
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,860
Wait for me.

122
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,860
Are you feeling better?

123
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,860
Kata.

124
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,860
Why did you save me?

125
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
Who said I saved you?

126
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Didn't I get expelled by you?

127
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
In the banquet,

128
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
I was out of my hands.

129
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,860
Everyone was trying to escape.

130
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,860
Only you.

131
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,860
You were slowly approaching me.

132
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,860
I knew you were not a force.

133
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,860
And you were shouting for help.

134
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,860
Only to make Yun Qian Xue

135
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,860
unable to do anything.

136
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,860
I'm your friend.

137
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,860
I'm your friend.

138
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,860
I'm your friend.

139
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,860
Now we're fighting.

140
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,860
Friends are too naive.

141
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,860
I used to think

142
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,060
the relationship between Zichuan and the North

143
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,860
is like what they said to their father.

144
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,860
The water is not pretty.

145
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,860
But Zichuan has been here for so long.

146
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,860
You,

147
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
Xiao Ning,

148
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,860
and

149
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,860
Si Yiling.

150
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,860
You made me think

151
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,860
there's another possibility

152
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,860
between the North and Zichuan.

153
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,860
Maybe the West can't have a way to kill them.

154
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
We can't decide

155
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,860
whether we're the same or the same.

156
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,860
But

157
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
I still want to thank you

158
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,860
for saving me.

159
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,860
I will work hard

160
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,860
both for my brother and my brother.

161
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,860
All right.

162
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,860
I should go.

163
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,860
Slow down.

164
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,860
If you can't walk, you can hold me.

165
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,860
I can't hold you.

166
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,860
How can you be so timid?

167
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,860
I want to ask you something.

168
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,860
You intentionally pretended to be the North

169
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,860
to kill Lei Hong?

170
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,860
Is it worth taking such a risk?

171
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,860
You're so smart.

172
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
How could you do such a thing?

173
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,860
Lord Ge was so kind to me in my life.

174
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,860
Lei Hong betrayed Lord Ge

175
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,860
and Zichuan.

176
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,860
If you say

177
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,860
I'm stupid,

178
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,860
I'm willing to be stupid.

179
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,860
Zichuan is a man of his own.

180
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,860
He killed a general and a dozen soldiers

181
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,860
and my daughter.

182
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,860
Your sister.

183
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,860
When all this happened,

184
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,860
you two

185
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,860
were not here?

186
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,860
It was General Yulin who let them go.

187
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,860
It was urgent.

188
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,860
General Yulin decided

189
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
to use the princess as a safety

190
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,860
and a major role.

191
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,860
Father, General Yulin

192
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,860
has tried his best to search for the princess.

193
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,860
As for Zichuan,

194
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,860
even if he finds the treasure,

195
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,860
I think Zichuan

196
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,860
will be dead soon.

197
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,860
If he finds it again,

198
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,860
I'm afraid it's a big deal.

199
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,860
Father,

200
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,860
I suggest you to give Zichuan a little news.

201
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,860
Let him know that

202
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,860
he's a good friend of Zichuan.

203
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,860
Then,

204
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,860
he'll go out.

205
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
Zichuan should have received

206
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,860
the news of Zichuan being killed.

207
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,860
Not only that,

208
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,860
I'll seal him as a empress.

209
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,860
Send the order.

210
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,860
From now on,

211
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,860
Yuanzhou is secretly searching for Zichuan.

212
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,860
The seal is to kill himself.

213
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,860
At the same time,

214
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,860
Zichuan's family will be chosen.

215
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,860
Shen Huang

216
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,860
will seal him as the main leader.

217
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,860
Father,

218
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
why did you

219
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,860
seal Zichuan as the best scapegoat?

220
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Father, you're wise.

221
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,860
I must withdraw the order.

222
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,860
He will be the heir to Zichuan's family.

223
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,860
From the result of interrogating

224
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,860
all the officials,

225
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,860
Zichuan is a traitor.

226
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,860
The evidence is clear now.

227
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,860
But

228
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,860
I consider that he

229
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,860
has been a good fighter for the family.

230
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,860
So, today's meeting

231
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,860
will let you know

232
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,860
how to judge him.

233
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,860
My Lord.

234
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,860
The court of trial of Zichuan

235
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,860
is not a doubt.

236
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,860
I suggest that

237
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,860
we remove Zichuan's family.

238
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,860
My Lord.

239
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,860
All the evidence we've got

240
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,860
is too much.

241
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,860
We can't just

242
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,860
judge the evidence

243
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,860
and know the truth.

244
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
Judge the evidence?

245
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,860
43 soldiers

246
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,860
are the same.

247
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,860
What truth do you have?

248
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,860
If they're lying,

249
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,860
Dilina,

250
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,860
in front of this man,

251
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,860
you shouldn't be

252
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,860
caught by private people.

253
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,860
You said

254
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,860
all the soldiers are lying.

255
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
Is that possible?

256
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,860
Of course.

257
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,860
This might be

258
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,860
the countermeasures of the Beizhu.

259
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,860
They found a person

260
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,860
who is very similar to Zichuan.

261
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,860
They pretended to be him.

262
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,860
They tried to trick us

263
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,860
by using the words of the Talisman Talisman.

264
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,860
They made us destroy the Ming family.

265
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
I don't think it's possible.

266
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
Why didn't the Beizhu

267
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,860
find a person

268
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,860
who is similar to Zichuan?

269
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,860
If they're trying to

270
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
destroy the Ming family,

271
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,860
the one who was framed

272
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,860
should be you

273
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,860
and Lord Siyi Ling.

274
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,860
Not Zichuan Xiu.

275
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,860
Who should we believe

276
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
that the family war

277
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,860
and the family war

278
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,860
that was fought for the safety of the Beizhu?

279
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,860
I think Lord Dilin is right.

280
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,860
At that time,

281
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,860
Zichuan Xiu and our

282
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,860
imperial army

283
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,860
fought together in the Beizhu City.

284
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
He didn't betray the family

285
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,860
in that situation.

286
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
So,

287
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,860
his loyalty was half-baked.

288
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,860
After the war,

289
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Lord Dilin

290
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,860
represented the family

291
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
and handed over the power

292
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,860
of the Beizhu City to the Beizhu City.

293
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,860
When Zichuan Xiu saw the family's power,

294
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,860
he was shocked.

295
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,860
That's impossible.

296
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,860
He was in such a dangerous situation

297
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,860
in the Beizhu City

298
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,860
for so long.

299
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,860
Why?

300
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,860
Because that was

301
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,860
Zichuan's land.

302
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,860
So,

303
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,860
he was loyal to the family.

304
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,860
Zichuan Xiu didn't want to come back from Beizhu City.

305
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,860
Is it because

306
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,860
he was too close to the Beizhu City?

307
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,860
I heard

308
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,860
Zichuan Xiu was in Yuanzhou.

309
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,860
He was defeated by the Beizhu City.

310
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,860
They didn't listen to the family's words.

311
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,860
They only knew Zichuan Xiu.

312
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,860
Is that true?

313
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,860
Isn't that true?

314
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,860
During the war,

315
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,860
Zichuan Xiu was in a pure movement.

316
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,860
He was able to rely on

317
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,860
the Beizhu City.

318
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
That was a long-awaited plan.

319
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
My Lord,

320
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,860
I think the traitor

321
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,860
of Zichuan Xiu

322
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
must wait for him to come back.

323
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,860
We are in the middle of the war.

324
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,860
Enough, Lord Di Lin.

325
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
Stop arguing with him.

326
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,860
I have warned you.

327
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,860
It's not easy to be a traitor.

328
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,860
One day,

329
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
you will realize

330
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,860
what is the pain of bullying.

331
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Long Ming Hai,

332
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,860
you want to report to the private sector, right?

333
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,860
You are using the internal force

334
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,860
to collect the evidence of the rebellion.

335
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,860
The final trial

336
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,860
is also the most important.

337
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Zichuan Xiu is the most loyal traitor.

338
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,860
That's right.

339
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,860
The Su Qing rebels are all loyal to the family.

340
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,860
Enough, enough.

341
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,860
We all need to understand.

342
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,860
Even if Zichuan Xiu

343
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,860
has various reasons,

344
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,860
he has been gone for a while in the Beizhu City.

345
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,860
It's enough to explain

346
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
his suspiciousness.

347
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
He has destroyed

348
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,860
the honor of the family.

349
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,860
It's hard to change.

350
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,860
Even if he comes back to Zichuan now,

351
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,860
tell me,

352
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,860
who can trust him?

353
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,860
My Lord,

354
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,860
I think we need to investigate this matter again.

355
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,860
I guarantee that

356
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,860
Zichuan Xiu will learn...

357
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,860
Report!

358
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,860
My Lord,

359
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,860
all the comrades,

360
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,860
we just received news from Yuan Zhou.

361
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
The north emperor

362
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,860
personally appointed Zichuan Xiu

363
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,860
as the eldest disciple of Yuan Zhou.

364
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,860
He even held a banquet for him

365
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,860
to celebrate the rebellion.

366
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,860
I understand.

367
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
Lili,

368
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,860
do you still want to guarantee it?

369
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,860
This is the truth of the matter.

370
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,860
Zichuan Xiu,

371
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,860
is the disgrace of our Zichuan family.

372
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,860
I now

373
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,860
announce to the seven soldiers

374
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,860
of Zichuan family

375
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,860
that we will remove Zichuan Xiu

376
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
and take away

377
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,860
all the belongings of our family

378
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,860
and take away

379
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,860
Zichuan's honor.

380
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,860
I will tell the people of the family

381
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,860
that Ling He

382
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,860
and his Xiu Ziying

383
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,860
will be the traitor

384
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,860
of our Zichuan family.

385
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,860
Yuan Yuan,

386
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860
Jian Er, Zhu Zhi.

387
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,860
Wen bater B services

388
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,860
Zichuan Family

389
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
I served you

390
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,860
the wounds.

391
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
You should go.

392
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,860
General Ling

393
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,860
should be all right soon.

394
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,860
I'll go now.

395
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,860
Xiu.

396
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,860
When I see...

397
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,860
Xiao Ning,

398
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,860
ask her well.

399
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,860
If I can still see her,

400
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,860
if I can still see her,

401
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,860
take care of her, Katen.

402
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,860
You two go there.

403
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,860
Yes.

404
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,860
My Lord.

405
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,860
My Lord.

406
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,860
We found the princess.

407
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,860
Go.

408
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,860
Princess.

409
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,860
Princess.

410
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,860
Princess.

411
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,860
Princess.

412
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,860
You're shocked.

413
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,860
Did that bastard hurt you?

414
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,860
I'm fine.

415
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,860
Your Highness.

416
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,860
Do you remember

417
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,860
which way she just escaped?

418
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,860
It seems that...

419
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,860
the desert in the east.

420
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,860
Don't worry, Your Highness.

421
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,860
I'll find her.

422
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,860
Go.

423
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,860
Yes.

424
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,860
Report.

425
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,860
A unit was stopped by the gatekeeper.

426
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,860
They're from Xiuzi Camp.

427
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,860
Zichuan Xiu is also here.

428
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,860
Zichuan Xiu didn't show up.

429
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,860
This unit was brought back by three men.

430
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,860
The guards are from Xiuzi Camp.

431
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,860
They're from Xiuzi Camp.

432
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,860
They're from Xiuzi Camp.

433
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
They're from Xiuzi Camp.

434
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,860
The guards are not moved.

435
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,860
I'll ask for your permission.

436
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,860
Bring those three men in.

437
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
Yes.

438
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,860
You're finally home.

439
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,860
Lord Li Bing, come here.

440
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,860
He's not changed.

441
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,860
Where's Zichuan Xiu?

442
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,860
Did he come with you?

443
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,860
Lord Li Bing.

444
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,860
Lord Xiu Chuan is not in our army.

445
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,860
He said he'd do something

446
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,860
to let us go back.

447
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,860
I think he should leave

448
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,860
for a few days.

449
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,860
So I waited for him all the way.

450
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,860
I stayed in the capital for a while.

451
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,860
Yes.

452
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
It's mainly because we're almost done eating.

453
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,860
We haven't found him yet.

454
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,860
So I came back.

455
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,860
You've been in the capital

456
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,860
for a while.

457
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,860
You don't know the news.

458
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,860
What did he say when he left?

459
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,860
Did he have any meaning?

460
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
Did he have any shareholders?

461
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,860
I don't know.

462
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,860
I'm afraid he's going to

463
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,860
take advantage of you and him.

464
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,860
Actually, I promised him

465
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,860
he'd keep it a secret.

466
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,860
He said he'd go back

467
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
to find him

468
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,860
because he was wrongly involved

469
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,860
with the business.

470
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,860
I'm afraid he'd make me tell you.

471
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,860
After all this,

472
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,860
you've been in the trouble

473
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,860
of making money.

474
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,860
Lord Li Bing,

475
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,860
I have something to say.

476
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,860
The people of the Law Firm

477
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,860
have arrived in Wan Yun.

478
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,860
They're here

479
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,860
to arrest you.

480
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,860
Your chief, Zi Chuan Xiu,

481
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,860
has already surrendered to the north.

482
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,860
Lord Li Bing is very angry.

483
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,860
He has already sent

484
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,860
the General of the Xuan Shang Pavilion

485
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,860
and the whole Xiuzi Camp

486
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,860
Lord Li Bing,

487
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,860
I didn't hear it wrong, right?

488
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,860
You just said

489
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,860
Lord Xiu Chuan betrayed him.

490
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,860
That's impossible.

491
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,860
Zi Chuan Xiu has betrayed the enemy.

492
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,860
This is a true news.

493
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,860
Lord Li Bing,

494
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,860
our chief and you

495
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,860
are always the same.

496
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,860
Although he looks like

497
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,860
a greedy man,

498
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,860
he's always greedy.

499
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,860
But in this matter,

500
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,860
I believe that

501
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,860
he must have

502
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,860
the reason for doing so.

503
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
Yes, sir.

504
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,860
There must be some misunderstanding.

505
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,860
I'm willing to think so, too.

506
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,860
But the map has already

507
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,860
made a traitor.

508
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
Zi Chuan Xiu, it's impossible to be betrayed by Zi Chuan.

509
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,860
What if he really betrays us?

510
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,860
Then let's go and catch him.

511
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,860
Gu Lei,

512
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,860
take them down first.

513
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,860
The people of the Law Firm are coming.

514
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,860
What are you doing?

515
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,860
I have something to do.

516
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,860
Take them away.

517
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,860
Yes.

518
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,860
Zi Hua,

519
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,860
let go of me.

520
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,860
Ming Yu.

521
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
Bai Chuan,

522
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,860
I hope you're right.

523
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
Gu Lei,

524
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,860
where did Lord Li Bing take us?

525
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
Shall we

526
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,860
explain to them

527
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,860
if we want to go back to the Law Firm?

528
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,860
You haven't seen it yet.

529
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,860
Lord Li Bing

530
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,860
deliberately let Gu Lei

531
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,860
let us go.

532
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,860
Lord Li Bing believes in Lord Xiu Chuan.

533
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,860
But you're going back to the Law Firm now

534
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,860
and you don't know what to do.

535
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
Then what should we do?

536
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,860
Gu Lei,

537
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,860
I'm tired of you.

538
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
What are you talking about?

539
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,860
I've been following Lord Xiu Chuan.

540
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,860
I believe that

541
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,860
no matter what he does,

542
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,860
he must have his reason.

543
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,860
I don't believe

544
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,860
Lord Xiu Chuan is a traitor.

545
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,860
Although he is usually

546
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,860
a bit arrogant

547
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
and talkative,

548
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,860
he is not a soft-hearted person.

549
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,860
I don't want to believe that either.

550
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
But the family

551
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,860
has reached the Law Firm.

552
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,860
We can't just

553
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,860
go back and die.

554
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,860
No matter Lord Xiu Chuan

555
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,860
is a traitor,

556
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,860
or a victim,

557
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,860
he is in the army now.

558
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,860
I'm afraid he can't change it.

559
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,860
Now the Wanying Army

560
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,860
is a family's soldier.

561
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,860
We have to leave as soon as possible

562
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
as possible.

563
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,860
But where can we go?

564
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,860
Yes, where can we go?

565
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
Do you remember

566
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,860
the old village of De Lun?

567
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,860
It's not the Zichuan family's area anymore.

568
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,860
Even if the family

569
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
sends a search team,

570
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,860
they can't find it.

571
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,860
Moreover,

572
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,860
if Lord Xiu Chuan is really wronged,

573
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
he will definitely

574
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,860
take it after he leaves the capital.

575
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,860
The guy from Old De Lun

576
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,860
should be the leader.

577
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,860
We can talk about it.

578
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,860
I'll win.

579
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
I'll do it.

580
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,860
God of War

581
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,860
You don't know the situation

582
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,860
of Lord Xiu Chuan in this town.

583
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,860
There are only two ways for Xiu Ziyin.

584
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,860
First,

585
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,460
we'll go back to Wanyun to rest

586
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,460
and put down weapons to surrender to the Lü Si.

587
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,460
We'll be examined.

588
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,060
Second,

589
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,060
Xiu Ziying will be dismissed.

590
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,460
Everyone, step out.

591
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,860
Which one do you choose?

592
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,460
Let's make a decision.

593
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,260
If you're willing to return to the Wanying to surrender,

594
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,460
please raise your hand.

595
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,660
Wait.

596
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,660
If we go back now,

597
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,460
how will the Lü Si treat us?

598
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,260
Will he kill us?

599
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,260
The commander did kill us.

600
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,260
But more so, he's against Lord Xiu Chuan.

601
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,660
If you go back now,

602
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,460
there might be another way.

603
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,460
I want to return to Wanying.

604
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,060
Brothers,

605
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,460
we're guilty of the murder.

606
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,860
Don't go back with me.

607
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,260
I...

608
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,060
Go.

609
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,460
Go.

610
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,060
Traitor.

611
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,260
Lin Nong.

612
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,260
Let them go.

613
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,860
There's a way out.

614
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,660
Little rascal.

615
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,460
Where are you going?

616
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,460
Where are you going?

617
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,060
The貿易 has been declared for everyone.

618
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,860
Tell me, you want to leave?

619
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:52,860
Go.

620
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,860
Go back with me.

621
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,060
Go back with me.

622
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,460
Lord Xiu Chuan,

623
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,660
we're in trouble.

624
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,260
We're still being sent to the capital.

625
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,260
Yuan Zhou is already a local of the Beizu people.

626
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,660
But I don't want to fight.

627
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,260
Do I have to go back and take care of my mother?

628
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,860
Who has a mother in the family?

629
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,860
Young Master,

630
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,660
you're the only one.

631
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,660
The貿易 is dead.

632
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,260
No.

633
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,260
The people who killed Xiu Ziyin are dead?

634
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,260
If you want to leave,

635
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,460
you don't want to admit me?

636
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,260
Fine.

637
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,660
Then you just go back quietly.

638
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,260
Let's go.

639
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,660
Brother.

640
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,060
Take care.

641
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,060
Continue.

642
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,760
Since we're like this,

643
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,360
we're the only two of us.

644
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,460
Xiu Ziyin is the Humane extreme.

645
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,060
You guys go whatever you want.

646
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,660
Protect her.

647
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,260
Just hurry up.

648
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,300
It's nonsense to stay.

649
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,860
But don't forget,

650
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,260
Zi Chuan Xiu is still waiting for us.

651
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,820
Master Xiu Chuan never gave up on us.

652
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,140
We must find him.

653
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,820
Yes.

654
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,820
Yes.

655
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,980
Master Xiu Chuan.

656
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,300
Master Xiu Chuan.

657
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,820
Master Xiu Chuan.

658
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,940
Since everyone is willing to find him,

659
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,380
we should still be a group.

660
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,860
We can't be separated.

661
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,060
Why don't we

662
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,100
go back to the old bank

663
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,260
and be a thief?

664
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,700
I think so.

665
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,580
Don't you really want to be a thief?

666
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,700
We are the rightful army of the Zichuan family.

667
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,940
Rightful army?

668
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,180
The Zichuan family

669
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,860
doesn't give us a good idea now, right?

670
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,740
Yes.

671
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,020
Yes.

672
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,100
We can take the side of the north group

673
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,820
to take the rightful side.

674
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,580
Take the rightful side.

675
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
How about we call it the Tiger Tiger?

676
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,740
Where did the Tiger Tiger come from?

677
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,260
I haven't thought about it for so long.

678
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,820
I think Xiu Ziyin is quite good.

679
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,260
What Xiu Ziyin?

680
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,700
It's just a normal thing.

681
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,100
It's not even a little bit of power.

682
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,700
Fei Yang is here.

683
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,700
I'm here.

684
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,700
I'm here.

685
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,700
I'm here.

686
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,700
I'm here.

687
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,700
I'm here.

688
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
I'm here.

689
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,700
I'm here.

690
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,700
I'm here.

691
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,700
I'm here.

692
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,700
I'm here.

693
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,700
I'm here.

694
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,700
I'm here.

695
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,700
Fei Yang is here.

696
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,100
The north group of the north group is here.

697
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,300
The Yunnan is the provisions of our base.

698
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,500
Call the front guard to check it out.

699
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
If they have weapons,

700
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,300
we must find out whether they are soldiers or not.

701
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,300
Yes.

702
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
The Tiger Tiger will open a business today.

703
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,700
It will be a big one.

704
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,100
Brothers.

705
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,700
Let's fight.

706
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Tiger Tiger!

707
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,700
Don't be afraid.

708
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,100
We are the Tiger Tiger.

709
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Brothers, we only want to have a meal.

710
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,100
If you don't listen to us,

711
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,100
we won't kill you.

712
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,300
Stop.

713
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,700
You want to escape?

714
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,700
No.

715
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,500
I'm afraid that I'll be caught by some men.

716
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,300
I'll be caught.

717
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,500
Don't be so impulsive.

718
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,100
I think your carriage is good.

719
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,100
Get out.

720
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
No...

721
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,900
I didn't make a mistake, did I?

722
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,700
Probably not.

723
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,500
Are you out of your mind?

724
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,700
I'm still alive.

725
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,820
I think he's asleep.

726
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,540
I didn't get it right.

727
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,640
Isn't it just a show?

728
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,880
Oh, yeah.

729
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,020
Fire!!!

730
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,620
suspicious

731
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,500
not me

732
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,660
recognize the wrong man

733
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,180
recognized the wrong person

734
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:14,820
not me

735
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,580
not me

736
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,420
Nuong

737
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,820
you wake up

738
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,900
Luo Jie

739
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,340
Luo Jie

740
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,580
In Battle Room

741
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,540
they met you

742
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,540
sings here

743
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,180
What a coincidence

744
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,140
we are all looking for you

745
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,100
I didn't expect that I'm such an excellent commander.

746
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,100
With your so-called loyal subordinates,

747
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,100
I'm really so touched.

748
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,100
Sir, are you blind?

749
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,100
What blind?

750
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,100
I just got a little injury.

751
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,100
I can't see it clearly for a while.

752
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
The moon must be over there.

753
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
I can see it.

754
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,100
Is this guy going to keep on going like this?

755
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Shut up!

756
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,100
When I'm full and full, I'll take a few days off.

757
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,100
I'll be able to see it in a few days.

758
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Let me tell you, if you fall in love with the sword of Yun Qianxue,

759
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
you'll be in a bad mood.

760
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,100
Look at me.

761
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Qianxue?

762
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,100
It's okay.

763
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Where have you been these days?

764
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
What's wrong with Yun Qianxue's sword?

765
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,100
What if you're really blind?

766
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
You've avenged Lord Ge.

767
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,100
You're blind.

768
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,100
What's the point of it?

769
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,100
He's dead.

770
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,100
He's dead.

771
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
You killed Lei Hong?

772
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,100
What?

773
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:25,940
Don't the Zichuan family know my

774
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,100
trace to you in Jianlettла?

775
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Do you think it's True Loki?

776
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,100
Make your way.

777
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,100
Tell me.

778
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
But I have no choice but to tell you.

779
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,100
I think his piece is solla.

780
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
Hide or hide, ahead of you.

781
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,100
My heart is so beating fast.

782
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
I can't see.

783
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,100
Don't want to tell you about me.

784
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,100
You're now aity chicken.

785
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,940
Did you see it?

786
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,700
Why are you here now?

787
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:58,900
Tao,

788
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,060
now Ma Yun and Xiu Zi Ying

789
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,860
can't go back.

790
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,460
Go back.

791
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,900
What's going on?

792
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:09,820
Say it.

793
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,620
Say it.

794
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:13,900
Tao,

795
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,100
don't be anxious.

796
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,260
It's like this.

797
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,580
The capital,

798
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,700
the rumor said you surrendered to the north.

799
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,140
Xiu Zi Ying was also ordered to arrest him.

800
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,020
But it's okay.

801
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,380
Lord Lin Bing is very fond of old love.

802
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,380
He gave all the rumors to Tao.

803
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,180
Although we don't have a place to go now,

804
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,380
we can only keep the rumor for now.

805
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,540
But I believe

806
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,860
we can go back to the capital.

807
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,540
Right?

808
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,100
So,

809
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,820
I'm the traitor of the Zichuan family?

810
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,300
This is t BEGIN,

811
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,100
your dad.

812
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,540
I hadn'tengineer,

813
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,260
he ordered to kill me.

814
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,620
No,

815
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,860
I don't want to credits you again.

816
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,060
What's on your mind?

817
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,820
I can't sleep without your order.

818
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,100
Boss.

819
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:36,820
Zuo.

820
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:41,820
My lord.

821
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,220
Are you okay?

822
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,740
Linong?

823
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,020
Xiu Chuan.

824
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,620
Why are you here, Gu Lin?

825
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,780
Lord Lin Bing asked me to come with you.

826
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,780
It's great to see you again.

827
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,180
Boss.

828
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,740
You can follow us

829
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,740
in the future.

830
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,220
Yes.

831
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,660
We're good at hunting bandits.

832
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,900
Xiu Ziying.

833
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,220
Is he dead?

834
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,220
Lord Xiu Chuan.

835
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,500
We're all dead.

836
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,180
Why?

837
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,740
I can't carry your줄 gifts.

838
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,660
Zichuan Xiao.

839
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,260
Don't be coward.

840
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,580
We'll take you,

841
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,860
if we can't.

842
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,580
I can handle them.

843
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:56,020
It's a perfect example of my good fortune and my good fortune.

844
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,620
Right?

845
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,920
We are mainly afraid that you will die.

846
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,820
We owe our money to someone else.

847
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,420
That's right.

848
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,620
So from now on, we will take you anywhere.

849
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,820
But this time, you can't be too late.

850
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,820
You have to be nice to us.

851
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,420
Otherwise, we will be a burden to you.

852
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,220
You don't even know who did it.

853
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,620
You bastards!

854
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:44,820
My Lord, the Blue Village in DeLun is not far from here.

855
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,220
If we leave now, we will arrive tonight.

856
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,220
Okay.

857
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,420

866
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,380

00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,780
No, no, no.

872
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,580
Tang Er,

873
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,980
we are now called the Alliance.

874
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,740
The Alliance will

875
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,180

876
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,300

878
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:00,500

881
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,780
You can't do that.

882
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,980
You should be more fierce.

883
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,620
Yeah.

884
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,300
Okay.

I've been thinking about it.

956
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,700
You've been thinking about it.

957
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,700
You've been thinking about it.

958
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,700
But now, I'm in the West City.

959
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,700
And you...

960
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,700
I'm sorry.

961
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,700
I'm sorry.

962
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,700
Your Majesty,

963
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,700
I'm sorry.

964
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,700
I'm sorry.

965
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,700
I'm sorry.

966
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,700
I've taken the wrong number of words in my own words.

967
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,700
I'm sorry.

968
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,700
I'm sorry.

969
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,700
I'm sorry.

970
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,700
I'm sorry.

971
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,700
I'm sorry.

972
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,700
I'm sorry.

973
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,700
I'm sorry.

974
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,700
I'm sorry.

975
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,700
Sorry, I forgot to say it.

976
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,700
Wait.
