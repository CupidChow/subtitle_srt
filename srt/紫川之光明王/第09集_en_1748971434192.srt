1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Unexpectedly, the whole world will be dreamed.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's grab thecendo.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Choose model model.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Choose model model.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Choose model model model.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Choose model model.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Choose model model.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Choose model model model.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Pry the model.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,360
Come, let's go.

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,080
The guests are all gone.

29
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
Royal ForbiddenasÄ±nda's Onon also went back to the palace to have some rest.

30
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,960
We've been selection in a day, and you've tired too.

31
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Just sleep without a rest.

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,960
I will be in the study tonight.

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,960
I will protect you as your husband

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,960
for your reputation in the future.

35
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
I am very happy.

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
I am very happy.

37
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
I am very happy.

38
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:00,960
I miss you so much.

39
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,960
I am willing to watch the changes in the years.

40
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
This is a good way to put it.

41
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Be careful.

42
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
Ok, Baozuluo.

43
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Look.

44
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Mr. Xiu.

45
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
Very good.

46
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Qi Luo has already painted the house.

47
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Look.

48
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
It's so beautiful.

49
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
It's so beautiful.

50
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
It's so beautiful.

51
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
I think Qi Luo's painting

52
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,960
is very powerful and powerful.

53
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Who said that

54
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
you Jinglin Tribe and Long Tribe

55
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,960
have never been so close to each other?

56
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
I think this painting...

57
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
Mr. Xiu.

58
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
This combination is good.

59
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Mr. Xiu.

60
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,960
What should we call the next generation

61
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,960
of Jinglin Tribe and Long Tribe

62
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
that has been combined?

63
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,960
Let me think about it.

64
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
I think we can call them Jinglong Tribe

65
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
Longjing Tribe.

66
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Just let me go.

67
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
I haven't agreed to it.

68
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
You are almost done with the painting.

69
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Where is Qi Luo?

70
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
Is Qi Luo's son in the house?

71
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Did he go back to work again?

72
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
No.

73
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
He went to the forest nearby to find wood.

74
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
He said he wanted to find some wood

75
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
to make some housework.

76
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
The house that Mr. Xiu built

77
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
is very good.

78
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
He doesn't need to work all his life.

79
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
All his life?

80
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
If Lu Di keeps on killing people

81
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
and finds this place,

82
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
it will be a long time.

83
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Even if he burned down

84
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
your family

85
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
and killed your family,

86
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
you still won't resist?

87
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
The temple is an ancestral temple.

88
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,960
I have the ability and patience

89
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
to change the happy future.

90
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,960
We have resisted it before,

91
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
but we have changed it

92
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
to a more brutal one.

93
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
I know.

94
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
I know that

95
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
the temple is a spiritual belief

96
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
for your people in Yuanzhou.

97
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,960
But now this belief

98
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
can't protect you.

99
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
We never need

100
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
the protection of the temple.

101
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
We only need it to exist

102
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
in the future.

103
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
To protect it,

104
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
we have to sacrifice our lives.

105
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
It's also important.

106
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
As long as the temple is here,

107
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Yuanzhou will not be forgotten.

108
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
I...

109
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
The temple

110
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
is the spiritual power

111
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
that God gives to Yuanzhou.

112
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Since ancient times,

113
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
only the most excellent people

114
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
have the right to be the leader.

115
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Not only that,

116
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
but also that

117
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
the Great Wall is about to be built.

118
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
There is no need to be forced.

119
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
There is patience.

120
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
This belief is really

121
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
a mischievous person.

122
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
How can Ren'ai be so cruel?

123
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Ren'ai will only kill the king.

124
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
But I think

125
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
it's good now.

126
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
I'm willing to hide here for the rest of my life.

127
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Miss Gu Xun.

128
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Miss Gu Xun.

129
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Lord Qiu.

130
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Something bad happened.

131
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
What's going on?

132
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Lord Qiu.

133
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
Help.

134
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Please.

135
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Save Qi Luo.

136
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Save her.

137
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Tell me.

138
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Qi Luo has been searching

139
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
for a better fish tomb

140
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
and found two mountains.

141
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
She has met the Northern Tribe.

142
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Where are they now?

143
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Gui Xiao.

144
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
General Lu Di said

145
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
that this land in the Far North

146
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
can be kept.

147
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
People must be replaced.

148
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
You people are lucky today.

149
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
You can have a good time

150
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,960
if you take a step ahead.

151
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
Hurry.

152
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Yes, sir.

153
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Everyone.

154
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Don't go ahead.

155
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
Tell me something.

156
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
My lord.

157
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
I'm here to beg you.

158
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Let them go.

159
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
I'll stay here.

160
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
Zi Chuan Xiu.

161
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
You know me?

162
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
You killed the night in Pingjing Palace.

163
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
I'm here, too.

164
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
That's good.

165
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
How about this?

166
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
You give me a face.

167
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
The Northern Tribe

168
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
has been looking for me.

169
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
You let all the people

170
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
who don't know the place

171
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
stay here.

172
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
How about it?

173
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Why are you playing tricks?

174
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
I'm not.

175
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Look.

176
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Fine.

177
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
I'll sell you this face.

178
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Let them go.

179
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
My lord.

180
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Gu Xie.

181
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Take them away.

182
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
But...

183
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Take them away.

184
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
My lord.

185
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Let's go.

186
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
I didn't expect

187
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
the people from the Northern Tribe

188
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
to be so generous

189
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
to the people from the Far North.

190
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
You're a good person, too.

191
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
As for your character,

192
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
I'll be more generous

193
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
when I get my hands on it.

194
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Are you crazy?

195
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
You can't even hit me

196
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
when you're hurt.

197
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
I've talked about it before.

198
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
There are not many people.

199
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
We can do it.

200
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
You dare to take the camp?

201
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Kill them!

202
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
You're not going to kill them?

203
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
One more batch?

204
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Go to the village and kill them.

205
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
You'll be rewarded

206
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
if you take the enemy.

207
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
I'll be rewarded.

208
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Don't move.

209
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Don't move.

210
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Put down the sword.

211
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Xiu'er.

212
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Come here.

213
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Gu Xi, why are you here?

214
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Don't go over there.

215
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Lord Xiu, you said we don't know how to resist.

216
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Yes, we are a dog and a dog.

217
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
We can't help you.

218
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Don't move!

219
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,960
They are from the north.

220
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
They killed our family.

221
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Our loved ones and our benefactors.

222
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
If you are all dead,

223
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
what's the point of us living?

224
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,960
I don't want to take your life and ruin my life.

225
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Xiu'er!

226
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
Lord Xiu, you go first.

227
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Zichuan Xing, go!

228
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
It's meaningless to die.

229
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Go!

230
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
If it's meaningless,

231
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
we can go back to the living hell.

232
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
What is the reason?

233
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Let's go together.

234
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Retreat!

235
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Retreat!

236
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Lord Xiu.

237
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Lord Xiu, if you are all dead,

238
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
what's the point of us living?

239
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
Gu Xichu!

240
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Let me go!

241
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Let me go!

242
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Let me go!

243
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Let me go!

244
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Lord Xiu.

245
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
We have done our best.

246
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
We saved more people from Yuanzhou.

247
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,960
You are not the one who gave Yuanzhou to the north.

248
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
You are not the one who killed Yuanzhou.

249
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
I was wrong.

250
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,960
When I was in Yuanzhou,

251
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
when the rebels were in the army,

252
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I only knew that they were in danger.

253
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
They were blinded by the lightning.

254
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,960
They were all in danger.

255
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
I was wrong.

256
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
When the Yuanzhou people

257
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,960
entered the palace with the rebels,

258
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
I never thought about

259
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
the situation and the situation

260
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,960
that I had in the past.

261
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
I was wrong.

262
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,960
When the Yuanzhou people were in danger,

263
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,960
I only knew that I was wrong.

264
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
But I didn't expect

265
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
so many Yuanzhou people

266
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
to die because of me.

267
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
They pushed me down.

268
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
If I could think about

269
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
the situation at that time,

270
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
everything now

271
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
might not be like this.

272
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Every day,

273
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
there will be a story

274
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,960
about the death of Qi Luozhang.

275
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
And they even...

276
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
They even dare not

277
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,960
beg for a mother's life.

278
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Gu Xi said that

279
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
they would never die

280
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
if you were alive.

281
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Don't let them die.

282
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
Such a big thing

283
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
would fail in nine times.

284
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Do I have to

285
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
let these people

286
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
die with me?

287
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Yes.

288
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
We, Xiu Ziyang,

289
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
are afraid of death.

290
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,960
We are not afraid.

291
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Even if we die,

292
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
we must not hold back.

293
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Right?

294
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Right.

295
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Old Deï¿½ï¿½ê³ an,

296
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:46,960
I'm going to buy theé­

297
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,960
to see the commanderlÄ±Å man.

298
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,200
A man always says that after he finds someone at his place now

299
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,720
He expects Guo witness a thousand years from now

300
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
I'll show you

301
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,640
If I can't, I'll sacrifice myself

302
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,360
Chill

303
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,360
Look.

304
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,080
You look at those villagers again.

305
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,800
They are always good.

306
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,920
Whenever we say we want to go to Sengmyo,

307
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,640
they would boil their plans with us for the home etcetera.

308
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,080
Ancient times have talked about

309
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,360
their faith in Sengmyo.

310
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,360
They mentioned that it is not permanent.

311
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,960
Throughout the years, the war in Wenzhou opened in the Wenzhou countries.

312
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,080
The war has been broken down in Wenzhou in town.

313
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,360
It was because of this

314
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
that they refused to put no leadership.

315
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,600
Because of their high chinese drink,

316
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,240
the Jiuyunms that had not become selling went mainstream in four good places.

317
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,280
Eventually it ended.

318
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,080
Wenzhou was yÃ¼k

319
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,880
in the brink of badly known slavery.

320
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,840
They will not be Believing.

321
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,240
We are all in the same boat.

322
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,560
We can only work with him.

323
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,640
What do you want to do

324
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,080
with the people of Zishuan?

325
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,760
Without the permission of the chief,

326
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,440
no one can go to the temple.

327
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,440
Don't worry.

328
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,880
Lord Xiu,

329
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
I have asked for the permission of the chief.

330
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,840
I have already transferred it to the village chief.

331
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,320
He said that he will go down the mountain today

332
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,560
and take the responsibility.

333
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,880
Coming.

334
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,720
Come.

335
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,040
Village chief,

336
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,880
this is Zichuan Xiu.

337
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,400
He is the general of the villagers.

338
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,080
Brother,

339
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,680
this is the village chief of the Bulu Village.

340
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,000
He is not the eldest son of the chief.

341
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,080
He is not a son.

342
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,680
Village chief.

343
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,080
It's a gift.

344
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,600
De Lun,

345
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,400
what are you laughing at?

346
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,520
The guy who is sick in front of us

347
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,280
is the great man in the legend.

348
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,440
Lord Xiu.

349
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,280
I can lead three of them

350
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,240
to the temple.

351
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,120
How did you talk to our lord?

352
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,080
Do you believe that I throw you on the tree?

353
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,080
What are you talking about?

354
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,760
As your lord says,

355
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,720
village chief,

356
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:48,720
I am Zichuan Xiu.

357
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
I think the left foot is the most important thing.

358
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Once you fight,

359
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
as long as I attack your left foot,

360
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,720
you'll be in the corner if you don't make 20 moves.

361
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
You...

362
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Since the village head has gone down the mountain,

363
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,720
it means that you're not willing to see me.

364
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Stay here.

365
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,720
I'm not willing to see you only to see Zishuan Xiu.

366
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,720
You two, watch this.

367
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Lord Xiu, come with me.

368
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Yes.

369
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
What are you doing?

370
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Such a big stone wall.

371
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
So many.

372
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
If you want to move up the mountain,

373
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,720
it's not a matter of life.

374
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
You're not so strong to move them up.

375
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
What's the reason?

376
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
You won't understand.

377
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
You're not a good person.

378
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
You're not a good person.

379
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
You're not a good person.

380
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
You're not a good person.

381
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
You're not a good person.

382
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
You won't understand.

383
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Come in.

384
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
I'll wait for you inside.

385
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
You said...

386
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Why aren't you leaving?

387
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,720
The temple is the base of the Seven Seasons of the Far East.

388
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
It's hard to describe.

389
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,720
I can't enter the temple without the information.

390
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
And you.

391
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,720
It's been over a thousand years.

392
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
You're the first one to enter the temple.

393
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Please respect me.

394
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
My honor.

395
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
I heard that...

396
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Zichuan will also attack the Seven Seasons of the Far East.

397
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,720
The seven Seasons of the Far East.

398
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,720
You're facing the power of the Far East.

399
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
The power of the Far East.

400
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Why isn't it expensive?

401
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
I respect every one of you.

402
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
But in Zichuan,

403
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,720
the victory is yours.

404
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
You're the one who's going to win.

405
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
You're the one who's going to win.

406
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
You're the one who's going to win.

407
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
You're the one who's going to win.

408
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:25,280
You will be honored to have the

409
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:35,720
true theory of this wow decision again.

410
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
I'll leave it to you.

411
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Please forgive this young man.

412
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,720
He will only be able to guide you to the path of light.

413
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
No.

414
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Yuan Zhou has never...

415
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Never experienced such a thing.

416
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Not only is he so talented,

417
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,720
he's also a famous man.

418
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
He's not only an old man,

419
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,720
he should be 80 years old.

420
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
But you...

421
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,720
You may not know much about the situation outside.

422
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,720
You don't know what the way of the North's killing is like.

423
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
I know.

424
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
The North is fighting for the throne.

425
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
The world is in a mess.

426
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
The evil is changing.

427
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
I know.

428
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
The East and South are in a mess.

429
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
The Great Pigeons are being destroyed.

430
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
They're being controlled.

431
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
They die in the mine every day.

432
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
They don't want to die.

433
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
I know.

434
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
I know.

435
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
When the North was in a mess,

436
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
a brother of the Pigeons

437
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
died in the war.

438
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,720
But he was a landlady.

439
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,720
He was killed by the Pigeons.

440
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
I'm the guardian of Yuan Zhou.

441
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,720
No one will know more about this than me.

442
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
The Pigeons?

443
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
He's going to completely destroy your people.

444
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,720
Yuan Zhou shouldn't be treated like this.

445
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Elder.

446
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
Elder.

447
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Not yet.

448
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
What do you think?

449
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Not yet, Elder.

450
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,720
Please let the people of all tribes gather together

451
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,720
to guard your home and your country

452
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,720
and your people.

453
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,720
Yuan Zhou is a member of Yuan Zhou's tribe.

454
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
He's your landlady.

455
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Yes.

456
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,720
But he was killed by the Pigeons.

457
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
For a hundred years,

458
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,720
we, Yuan Zhou people,

459
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,720
have the right to be chosen.

460
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Elder.

461
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
Not only that,

462
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
I don't deny it.

463
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
That war is indeed a disaster

464
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
for Zichuan and Yuan Zhou.

465
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
But we're still alive in the disaster.

466
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,720
We're still alive in the past.

467
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Why don't we change

468
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
the current evil?

469
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,720
You have a high reputation

470
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,720
in the hearts of millions of people in Yuan Zhou.

471
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
With my power,

472
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,720
we don't have the hope to fight the Pigeons.

473
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
I have three questions.

474
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Please ask them.

475
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Yi Ze.

476
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
The Pigeons are born to be good at war.

477
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
Xiao Yong, Qiang Han.

478
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
For a hundred years,

479
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Yuan Zhou people will only be in the dark

480
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
and will only be afraid of me.

481
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
How can we fight?

482
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
The Pigeons have a strong army.

483
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
But they're not as strong as the war.

484
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,720
Zichuan's imperial army is led by Si Yiling.

485
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
With the power of Wei Bo,

486
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
they're afraid that

487
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
they'll be in trouble.

488
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
The imperial army is in the Pigeons' territory

489
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,720
and they're facing the battle with the Emperor of the Dead.

490
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,720
In the end, they force them to retreat to the river.

491
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,720
There's no power to resist in this world.

492
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,720
The key is to see the determination and will of the opposition.

493
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Qiang must fight and be defeated.

494
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,720
And Yuan Zhou will be in the dark

495
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,720
with Zichuan.

496
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Anyone can easily suppress us.

497
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,720
It's impossible to defend two rooms at the same time.

498
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
If we're all in the dark,

499
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
I'm afraid that we won't be able to

500
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,720
get the whole city out of the dark.

501
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Yuan Zhou is a peaceful country.

502
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
People are well-off.

503
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
I know that.

504
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,720
The vast west-tree road that is wide and empty

505
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,720
is a doorstep for Yuan Zhou.

506
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,720
For Zichuan,

507
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,720
they want this doorstep to be high and strong.

508
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
For the Beizhu,

509
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,720
they won't use the army power

510
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
on Yuan Zhou's doorstep.

511
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
So...

512
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Elder.

513
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,720
Elder.

514
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
You mean that

515
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
both sides are afraid

516
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
that they will fight for Yuan Zhou's life?

517
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Impossible.

518
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Yuan Zhou is only talking about Zichuan.

519
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
It's a traitor.

520
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
It's a enemy.

521
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
Zichuan will never help us.

522
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
So Yuan Zhou people

523
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
have to show their own strength

524
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,720
to fight against the North Crescent together.

525
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,720
The Saerong Emperor is doing this for the imperial palace.

526
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,720
And the Zichuan family's army is doing this to defend the capital.

527
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,720
They will fight against Yuan Zhou.

528
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
To fight for Yan Huan,

529
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
they will definitely

530
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
support us with their strength

531
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
and use our strength.

532
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Even use the army power.

533
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Although we are in the Jia Feng,

534
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
we can at least be in the place where we won't lose.

535
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
In the meantime,

536
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
Yuan Zhou will be strong.

537
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
All the races,

538
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
whether it's Zichuan, Beizhu,

539
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
the Golden Bells, the Dragon Tribe, etc.

540
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
will be equal.

541
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Equal?

542
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
Equal.

543
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Equal?

544
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Equal?

545
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,720
Equal.

546
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,720
The Eagle is fighting for the sky.

547
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,720
The Bear is fighting for the ground.

548
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,720
The Dragon Tribe is unable to escape

549
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,720
and is forced into battle.

550
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Unless they

551
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,720
give up their lives and their families.

552
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,720
But we can use their softness

553
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,720
to fight back.

554
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Maybe there is still one chance.

555
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,720
Yuan Zhou's fate

556
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,720
is not to be protected by his power.

557
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
It's to rely on you

558
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,720
to not be the elder.

559
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,720
You mean

560
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
the Zichuan family's unity?

561
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,720
The Zichuan family's unity

562
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
is equal?

563
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
Yuan Zhou

564
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
is no longer the slave

565
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
but the user.

566
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Yes.

567
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
Is the Zichuan family's unity

568
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
really equal?

569
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
What matters is what matters.

570
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
We must be patient.

571
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Yes.

572
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
It's not possible.

573
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
It's not possible.

574
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
We must be patient.

575
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
We must be patient.

576
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
We must be patient.

577
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
We must be patient.

578
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
We must be patient.

579
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
We must be patient.

580
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
You said

581
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Tao Zheng hasn't come back for a long time.

582
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Will he be killed?

583
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,720
How is it?

584
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Zichuan,

585
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
I really respect your description.

586
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
I also hope

587
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
that you can see

588
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,720
the day Yuan's people were left alone.

589
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,720
But I still can't

590
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,720
agree to your request.

591
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Why?

592
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Because

593
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
you are not the first to talk to Yuan Zhou

594
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
about this.

595
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Two hundred years ago,

596
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
a excellent Zichuan general

597
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Zichuan Yun said

598
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
he would release us from the demon sect in Beizu.

599
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
But

600
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
it turned out to be Zichuan

601
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
who has been fighting for two hundred years.

602
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
He came here alone

603
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
and said

604
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
he would give Yuan Zhou a freedom.

605
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
I didn't believe it.

606
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,720
But the dead brothers of the clan of Chishui

607
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
had thirty-one thousand people.

608
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Lei Hong?

609
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Yes.

610
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
He gave Yuan Zhou

611
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
a double penalty for Beizu.

612
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Elder,

613
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,720
Lei Hong was not only betrayed by Yuan Zhou,

614
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
but also by my master,

615
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Mr. Ge and Zichuan.

616
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
At this point,

617
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
I am the same as you.

618
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
It's different.

619
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
The lives of ten thousand soldiers

620
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
and the efforts of a hundred thousand people

621
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,720
have been looking forward to freedom for more than a thousand years.

622
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,720
You want me to be the leader of the clan

623
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
and tell those who lost their health

624
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
and their brothers

625
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,720
to believe in you again.

626
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
How do you want me to say it?

627
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Elder,

628
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
it's just that I am a Zichuan person.

629
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,720
So I can never convince you, right?

630
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
Even if I believe you,

631
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,720
you are as old as Zichuan

632
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
and as old as Old Ying

633
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
and as Xiong Ji.

634
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
Yuan Zhou is as weak as Lou Yi.

635
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
Lou Yi can never defeat Xiong Ji and Old Ying

636
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,720
and can never completely destroy them.

637
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Zichuan Xiong,

638
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
you are a clever and ungrateful person.

639
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Thank you for what you said today.

640
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
But please forgive

641
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
the weakness and despondency of Lou Yi.

642
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Is the order of Lou Yi

643
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
just waiting for death?

644
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
If Lou Yi is united,

645
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
he might not be able to move the mountain.

646
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
We could save Yuan Zhou's clan

647
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
in the Moon Bay.

648
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
We were just using the wind and boat.

649
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Did we use the power of the Jin people?

650
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
Wind and boat?

651
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
Lou Yi.

652
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
Can you really believe in the wind and boat?

653
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,720
I thought

654
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
we were the same kind of people as Zichuan.

655
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
But among you,

656
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,720
how many people are hiding from the wind and boat?

657
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,720
We can never

658
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,720
be afraid of the people in Yuan Zhou.

659
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
Just a long time ago,

660
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,720
I became the traitor of Zichuan.

661
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,720
Zichuan, don't want me anymore.

662
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,720
It's Yuan Zhou and the tribe of Bu Lu Village

663
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,720
who took me away.

664
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,720
You can now treat me as a Yuan Zhou person

665
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,720
and let me protect Yuan Zhou

666
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,720
with you.

667
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,720
Protect this family.

668
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,720
Thank you for what you said today.

669
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,720
You...

670
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Please go back.

671
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Come on.

672
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
Actually,

673
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
I know how painful it is.

674
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
But I can't be happy.

675
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
A person or tribe

676
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
wants to get freedom.

677
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,720
They need to experience error

678
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,440
Yes.

679
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,520
Although Lei Hong is dead,

680
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,600
he is waiting for me here

681
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,080
to kill me.

682
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,080
It's okay.

683
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,400
We didn't have their help before.

684
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,720
We did a good job.

685
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,640
We will keep doing it.

686
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,720
Until we defeat all the Beizhou people.

687
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
We will take him.

688
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,040
To call him grandpa.

689
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,560
Yes.

690
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,560
Call grandpa.

691
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,240
Call grandpa.

692
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,240
Call grandpa.

693
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,480
I have sent two bags of bubble tea to each customers.

694
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,720
I can tell

695
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,880
not only you watching,

696
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,600
but also Mr. Xi.

697
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,320
Enter my apology.

698
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,640
As long as you are willing.

699
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,280
You can still take them

700
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,320
from the start.

701
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,040
I ask that you

702
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,320
just stay there and live.

703
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,680
Now I have an answer.

704
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,560
Say goodbye.

705
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,760
Let's go.

706
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,260
Guangxic-colored purple wine tastes amazing.

707
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,660
It happens to belong to Yongxi.

708
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,640
But if you have a strong one,

709
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:37,980
it could have just...</

710
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,280
been an xute for the flower of theè³ corp.

711
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,660
And my bowl was the gift of the jade.

712
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,740
I get it.

713
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,140
ììì´.

715
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,060
Use more 1838.

716
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,300
This receiving the k rural danger area.

717
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,180
One of the cost of life is enough.

718
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,460
Sister.

719
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,500
But...

720
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,560
By such a swear wedding.

721
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,840
I still can't prove you're innocent.

722
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,240
Very well.

723
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,060
However, if you want to hit Prophet Lord,

724
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,520
Eighth Army Officials,

725
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,580
Mr. Ma will be sent to me.

726
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,600
Anyways,

727
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:23,520
I really appreciate to you

728
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,360
for Dares Ma mec automatic delivery and order meç¥ï¿½ chainshift

729
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,160
As a member of the Three provinces,

730
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,680
I was born in Shanggu,

731
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,920
and I'm a big seller.

732
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,080
If I can send someone to check in in Yanzhou,

733
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,440
I'll definitely be able to find out more.

734
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,680
Do you want to help me?

735
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,600
First Your Highness,

736
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,400
I'm 600- official.

737
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,960
As long as you tell me

738
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,680
to stay in Yanzhou,

739
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,640
I'll be above anything.

740
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,640
However, ë±ates of His Highness,

741
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,400
if I want Lord Houtian to back here,

742
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,680
I need to move them before Camp Fire

743
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,400
so that they caused havoc.

744
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,320
What is your rank?

745
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,160
I'm a lovesick of yours.

746
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,760
You're the successor to Zichuan.

747
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,480
Does your wings know his position?

748
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,640
Prince Qin's pockets and gaps.

749
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,280
If all three are unqualified,

750
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,660
all he can do is keep the right decisions.

751
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,240
He can't asses them back.

752
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,600
It's better if the wings know the position.

753
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
But...

754
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,320
Wei Min is so resolve,

755
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,680
she doesn't know Yushan's position.

756
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:00,680
I'm worried that you're worried that I'm using your thoughts and thoughts

757
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,680
to take advantage of the situation and to take advantage of the situation.

758
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,680
Exactly.

759
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,680
Although you're a girl, you're a sharp sword and a sharp sword.

760
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,680
You're a sharp sword and a sharp sword.

761
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
You won't lose to any general.

762
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,680
I'm so proud of your friendship with me.

763
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,680
The horse-drawn meal is so common.

764
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:27,680
I'm relieved that you can show your true colors to me.

765
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,680
I'm not sure about my temper since I was pregnant.

766
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,680
If anything goes wrong, you can open the stove.

767
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,680
Madam.

768
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Please keep your eyes open.

769
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,680
I've seen a lot of people in the house.

770
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,680
They're so strong that they're so strong that they're so weak.

771
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,680
Madam, you've been pregnant for more than a month.

772
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,680
I'm afraid that your mother's body will become weaker and weaker.

773
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,680
Then please keep your eyes open and take the medicine for me.

774
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,680
I'll take care of it carefully.

775
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,680
Are you sure that I'll open the stove?

776
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,680
Of course.

777
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,680
Madam, the baby is still in the mother's womb.

778
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,680
It's still in the mother's womb.

779
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
No.

780
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,680
I can't have a baby.

781
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,680
Now I have a mother.

782
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,680
What are you talking about?

783
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,680
You can't have a baby.

784
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
I have a baby.

785
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
I'm not afraid of any child.

786
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
I can't be afraid of any child.

787
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
I can't have a baby.

788
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,880
I have a son.

789
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
Now I have him.

790
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,000
That's the gift from God.

791
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,680
I can't give him up.

792
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,080
If you can't open a better house,

793
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,440
please go back.

794
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,240
Madam.

795
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,680
Madam is sick now.

796
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,880
She's very ill.

797
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,120
It's been a long time.

798
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,920
I'm afraid I can't keep up.

799
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,120
Of course.

800
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,400
Madam.

801
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,920
Xiu Jia.

802
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,840
I'm back.

803
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,960
Why are your eyes red?

804
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,480
I made a dress for the child.

805
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,240
I've been taking a long time.

806
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,200
So I've made my eyes red.

807
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,400
You're not in a good mood.

808
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,640
Did you faint?

809
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,400
I...

810
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,240

811
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,600
I've been taking care of you.

812
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,400
How is it going?

813
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,480
I'll give you some tips.

814
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,240
You can rest assured.

815

Thank you.

816
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,160
What's most important now

817
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,520
is to take care of yourself and the child

818
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,920
with a good heart.

819
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,420

Just grow wild.

I won't be the one give you a headshot

826
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,380
after you leave.

827
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,320
It'll be okay.

828
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,160
I'll get to you in about three years.

829
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,320
Then you don't have to worry about this.

Take it.

00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
The music is played by the people

The house we built

873
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,880
must be the most beautiful house in Yuanzhou

874
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,880
We can turn the house around

875
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,880
The old friend

876
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,880
He is not willing to leave

877
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,880
How about it?

878
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,880
OK, let's do it again

879

I can't bear to wait

884
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,880
It's time

885
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,880
Don't let go of my hand

886
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,880
There is a man

887
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:05,880
Someone likes to stay in the old place

888
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,880
So I dedicate this song to myself

889
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,880
to save my life

890
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:24,000
