31
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,900
Commander Si Yiling, how are you?

32
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,300
Thank you for your concern, General Yu Lin.

33
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,700
I'm fine.

34
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,300
This is...

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,500
I'm...

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,500
I'm the subordinate of Commander Si Yiling.

37
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,500
General, you may begin.

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,300
All right.

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,500
The declaration of ceasefire agreement.

40
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,300
First, the two tribes must ceasefire immediately.

41
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,100
Second,

42
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,700
release the Dishu Army soldiers trapped in the Pai City

43
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,300
and take over the Pai City.

44
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,500
Third, the Zichuan family...

45
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,300
The Zichuan family has already lost 2 million yuan.

46
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,100
All the soldiers who were captured in this battle

47
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,900
will be taken back.

48
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,500
Fourth, the 23-star garrison in Quanjin, Yuanzhou

49
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,300
will be taken back by the Northern Tribe as compensation for the war.

50
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,700
Thank you, Commander Si Yiling.

51
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,300
General Si Yiling,

52
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,900
may I ask how many soldiers and horses are there in Pai City?

53
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,100
I know all.

54
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,900
Get out of the city!

55
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,900
How can a Zichuan soldier be so cowardly?

56
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,500
You're wrong.

57
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,900
They love Zichuan,

58
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,700
more than their lives.

59
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,100
Go.

60
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,300
Give them some of our horses.

61
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,700
Yes.

62
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,500
They are a group that we can never conquer.

63
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,100
Second Brother, I'll take Qiu Ziying to Wayun first.

64
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,900
We don't know what's going on in the capital yet.

65
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,900
You must be very careful.

66
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,300
Wayun is directly connected to the Northern Tribe.

67
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,100
There are still many cities that need to be crossed.

68
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,500
You must be very careful.

69
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,900
I know.

70
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,100
With Commander Lin, everything will be fine.

71
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,300
Come.

72
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,900
Take care of yourself.

73
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,900
Second Brother!

74
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,100
It's fine.

75
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,100
You and Big Brother are in the capital.

76
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,900
I have nothing to worry about.

77
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,100
Don't let me and Big Brother worry.

78
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,700
I know.

79
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,820
After that,

80
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:37,380
you don't act loudly or

81
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,100
make such noise.

82
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,420
Will raise that

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,820

Time's up.

97
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,060
Your Highness.

98
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,060
You must be exhausted from the journey.

99
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,060
Why don't you go to the General Office to rest?

100
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,060
This is really the greatest city in the world.

101
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,060
You must be exhausted from the journey.

102
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,060
Why don't you go to the General Office to rest?

Why don't you go to the General Office to rest?

143
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,240
That night, as I was walking down the river,

144
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,220
I saw a thought figureige.

145
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,220
A��, you have a Dane job.

146
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,220
Do you have a Dane job?

147
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,560
Why didn't you want to go to the place where the Lake Yuan Berg misء was?

148
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,560
You lost?

149
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,160
Then today, we'll pay the super-high rate.

150
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,160
I forget to take a red belt.

151
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,160
Chuan.

152
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,360
What?

153
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
You want us to return home to H針?

154
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,040
Why not go with us to the place?

155
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,640
Where are you climbing the mountain?

156
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
You should stay and stabilize the morale

157
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,240
as the leader of the Embroidered Battalion.

158
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,240
What important things do you have to do now?

159
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,000
Can't we wait for you to leave?

160
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,640
I'm not afraid to tell you.

161
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,160
The Payment Division and the Chamber of Commerce

162
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,800
did a business.

163
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,080
I miscalculated the accounts.

164
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,480
I lost a lot of money.

165
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,760
I have to go to the Chamber of Commerce

166
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,880
and get the money back.

167
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,360
Do you think I'm so easy to fool?

168
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,040
There are things that one more person knows

169
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,240
and one more danger.

170
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,640
Fine. I won't ask anymore.

171
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,600
Take care of yourself.

172
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,760
You must come back early.

173
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,480
Here.

174
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,640
Take this.

175
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,400
You don't have a blood knife?

176
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,920
The place I went to was full of barbarians.

177
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,360
I was afraid they would rob it.

178
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,320
What on earth are you going to do?

179
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,080
Didn't you say you wouldn't ask anymore?

180
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
I don't know how long I have to walk.

181
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,560
When I'm not here,

182
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,680
you are the leader of the Embroidered Battalion.

183
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,280
You must bring them back to the Bay of Aisle safely.

184
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,560
Enough.

185
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,760
Don't talk like you're saying goodbye forever.

186
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,040
I'll go prepare the bandages.

187
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,080
Come back early.

188
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,160
I can't take this team.

189
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,120
I'm so tired.

190
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,360
Go.

191
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,400
You're never going to make it.

192
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,520
You're deliberately buying it.

193
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,000
Go with them.

194
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,920
Wait for me.

195
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,560
You...

196
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,120
There are still rods left?

197
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,640
You...

198
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,240
These are all your walls.

199
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
I'm afraid that the people will blame me.

200
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,240
You lost the rebels.

201
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,160
They beat me and scolded me.

202
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,240
They are all in the group.

203
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,960
I just can't face them.

204
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,280
Wait a minute.

205
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,400
Wait a minute.

206
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,960
I told you.

207
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,880
There must be a team that hasn't returned yet.

208
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,400
You are soldiers, right?

209
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,400
I want to ask you a question.

210
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,320
Does Mao Cai know?

211
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,280
He knows.

212
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,080
He knows.

213
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,880
He knows.

214
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,680
He knows.

215
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,480
He knows.

216
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,280
He knows.

217
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,680
He is from the Embroidered Battalion.

218
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,880
This morning,

219
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,800
I asked around with the children

220
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,320
who returned to the city.

221
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,920
I don't know.

222
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,880
I didn't hear about it.

223
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,760
I don't know.

224
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,280
Do you think

225
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
my child is pretending to be cowardly

226
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,400
on the battlefield?

227
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,640
Why doesn't anyone know him?

228
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,440
I know him.

229
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,120
You know him?

230
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,080
Then,

231
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,760
how is he now?

232
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,480
Uncle.

233
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,120
Mao Cai is still afraid of the Yi.

234
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,880
Still afraid of the Yi?

235
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
Drink a cup.

236
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,080
Here.

237
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,520
He told me to give this to you.

238
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,760
If he has this,

239
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,280
does it mean

240
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,280
that he has a good one?

241
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,560
He has a good one.

242
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,520
Really?

243
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,480
He is a hero.

244
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,000
He even made a record.

245
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'll cook some tea eggs for him.

246
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
He's been eating this since he was little.

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
He loves this.

248
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You think he's a fool?

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Okay.

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Thank you.

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Thank you.

252
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'll go back then.

253
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Thank you.

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Thank you.

255
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Thank you.

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Thank you.

257
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Goodbye.

258
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Thank you.

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Thank you.

260
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Si Yiling.

261
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm ashamed of my family and the thousands of people.

262
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Please punish me, Lord Commander.

263
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You and the Imperial Army don't need to be ashamed and selfish.

264
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You are the good men of your family.

265
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
As for the land of Yuanzhou,

266
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't need to be ashamed.

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm just a man.

268
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If the land of Yuanzhou loses its jurisdiction,

269
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
it's a good chance.

270
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The one who should be ashamed

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
is me, the commander.

272
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Lord Commander.

273
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Si Yiling,

274
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
for many years,

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I've always treated you like my own child.

276
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
How can I let my own child

277
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
die in the hands of the Northern Tribe?

278
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm not going to let you die.

279
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I won't agree even if I can't bear it.

280
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You are the future of your family.

281
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Only when you come back safely,

282
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
will your family have hope.

283
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'll remember your kindness.

284
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
One day,

285
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
we'll take back everything our family lost.

286
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Lord Yishu, be ready.

287
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Your Highness.

288
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Your Highness.

289
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He's gone.

290
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
When he left,

291
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
he asked me to give it to you.

292
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll take it.

293
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Xiu didn't come back.

294
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:28,780
She was sent to guard the

295
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But don't worry.

296
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
She's safe.

297
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's good.

298
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I... I know.

299
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What are you thinking about?

300
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Chuan,

301
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
do you think the Lord is playing tricks on us?

302
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
He went back to the capital by himself.

303
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Did the commander ask you to take us around?

304
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
He ordered us to go back to Wayun.

305
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But I always feel uneasy.

306
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So I'm going to the capital alone.

307
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll go with you.

308
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'll go with you.

309
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll go with you.

310
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'll go with you.

311
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'll go with you.

312
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'll go with you.

313
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'll go with you.

314
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll go with you.

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll go with you.

316
00:18:34,000 --> 00:19:03,960
Why is he

317
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,400
Why don't you go find him?

318
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,640
Did he say it seriously

319
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,640
or was it a joke?

320
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,720
It doesn't matter if he said it or not.

321
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,600
You know him well

322
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,720
after following him for so long.

323
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,400
If he's fine,

324
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,760
he wouldn't say that to us.

325
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,800
Wait and see.

326
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,680
There's a surprise.

327
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,600
Open the door!

328
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,360
An是這樣?

329
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,000
It doesn't seniors like to make trouble.

330
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,080
There are学imon solders who used to be

331
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,680
highly active when the Plain plasma was in Ji Perhaps.

332
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,400
Is there any news about Xiao?

333
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,560
No.

334
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,000
They said the north was on the way

335
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,960
with State of처et.

336
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,360
They've put together so many troops.

337
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,880
How could there be no information about Xiao?

338
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,520
This is word from the forest fuckers

339
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,400
who First Class ofëa intends to smuggle back.

340
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,160
Mud?

341
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,520
Fireuve?

342
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,180
What fox

343
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,320
What will it be

344
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:27,880
Right Magistrate,

345
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,760
why did you come?

346
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,960
Could it beder to ask you to be the one to urgently send me away?

347
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,840
Really?

348
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,840
Your Highness Ning,

349
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,640
knowledge comes from your order.

350
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,720
I invite you to attend a meeting.

351
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
A meeting?

352
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,640
You dean come to me personally.

353
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,800
You know what's the matter?

354
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,340
I know.

355
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,560
Is it really important?

356
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,720
It's very important.

357
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,000
I'll go change first.

358
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Your Highness Ning!

359
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,680
What's wrong with you?

360
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,920
You look like you don't dare to say it.

361
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,360
I've never seen you like this before.

362
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,400
You look like

363
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
the one who's been given the antidote.

364
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
It can't be...

365
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
Brother Xiu...

366
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
He...

367
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,240
I shouldn't have been the one

368
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
who said that.

369
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
But,

370
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,160
I think you should be prepared for it.

371
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,160
Zi Chuan Xiu

372
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,320
has betrayed his clan.

373
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
He's not the one who's going to be the one

374
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,040
who's going to be the one who's going to be the one

375
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
who's going to be the one who's going to be the one

376
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
who's going to be the one who's going to be the one

377
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Then what?

378
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,320
Then he was taken away by that North China General,

379
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,520
Yun Quan Xue.

380
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,000
As for where he went,

381
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I don't know.

382
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
Later,

383
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,200
we were released by the North China.

384
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,680
Think about it again.

385
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,160
Did you recognize the wrong person?

386
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,080
My two masters,

387
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,000
you've asked me hundreds of times.

388
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
He's the one who's protecting his clan.

389
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
I,

390
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,520
the Vice Commander of the Zichuan clan, Zi Chuan Xiu,

391
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,040
will be

392
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,760
the one who's going to be the one

393
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,160
who's going to be the one who's going to be the one

394
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
Everyone,

395
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,240
if you're willing to be loyal to me,

396
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,760
stand here now.

397
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,520
Your future days will be glorious and rich.

398
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
You're not thinking clearly.

399
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
This brother,

400
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,440
we're fighting for our clan.

401
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
We're being beaten to death. We'd rather die than go.

402
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
You,

403
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
Zichuan Xiu,

404
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
traitor!

405
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
You traitor!

406
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,280
You traitor!

407
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,800
Everyone,

408
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
brothers,

409
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,040
do you think you've lost the face of the Zichuan clan?

410
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
But brother,

411
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,040
is the face important

412
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
or the face?

413
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
Not just me.

414
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
You can ask all the war uniforms that came back.

415
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
They're all seen with their own eyes.

416
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
If you ask me again,

417
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
it's still the same result.

418
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Zichuan Xiu betrayed us.

419
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
It's already a matter of the board.

420
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Let's move on to the next one.

421
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
These few days,

422
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
I've been eating and drinking.

423
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
Now they've even sent me

424
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,520
such beautiful new clothes.

425
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
Brother Yulin,

426
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
thank you.

427
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Can I ask you something?

428
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Zichuan Xiu,

429
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
may I ask you something?

430
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Why did you surrender?

431
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
As far as I know,

432
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
the Zichuan family treats you well.

433
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
The Zichuan family is very good.

434
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
But people

435
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
always have to go higher.

436
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
The Zichuan family can't give you more.

437
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Didn't Lei Hong surrender to you?

438
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
I heard that he's already been promoted.

439
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
He's already a bowler.

440
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
But I don't think

441
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,520
you're a kind of person.

442
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,520
You don't seem to be someone

443
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,520
who would abandon faith

444
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
for the sake of glory and wealth.

445
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Don't lie to me.

446
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,520
I'm a genius.

447
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
But I can't get married

448
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
in the Zichuan family now.

449
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
When can I get married

450
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
and get promoted?

451
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
Right?

452
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
It's not better to be afraid

453
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,520
of the time to surrender.

454
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
We should work together

455
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
and make a great contribution.

456
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Your Highness,

457
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
the commander of the Imperial Army,

458
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
Si Yilin,

459
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
once saved my life.

460
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
If I do that,

461
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
I'll kill him.

462
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,520
So you're very close?

463
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
I risked my life

464
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
to defend him for over a month.

465
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
I've paid off my debt.

466
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
I'll be at ease

467
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
when we meet again.

468
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
How about this?

469
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
I promise you

470
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
we'll fight and kill

471
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
when we meet again.

472
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Are you done?

473
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
I'll leave

474
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
after I'm done.

475
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
Thank you.

476
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Where are your men?

477
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
Why didn't they come with you?

478
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
Don't mention it.

479
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
I'll be mad if you mention them.

480
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
These people

481
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,520
who are so arrogant

482
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
don't come with me at all.

483
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Compared to me,

484
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
I have a long view.

485
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
Long view?

486
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
Yes.

487
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
To be honest,

488
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
I used to live in

489
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
the far-off area

490
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
of the northern border

491
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
of our tribe.

492
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
I've been fighting

493
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
on the front line.

494
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
So compared to

495
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
other people,

496
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
I know our tribe

497
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
more than anyone else.

498
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,520
And in this rebellion,

499
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
I've seen

500
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
their strength.

501
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
They've run out of

502
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
their energy.

503
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
The battle is over.

504
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
A good friend leaves when he's in trouble.

505
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
The big tree in Zichuan's house

506
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
has been empty for a long time.

507
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
So

508
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,520
you're looking for another way out.

509
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Yes.

510
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
I'll make a bet with you.

511
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,520
As long as our northern army

512
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,520
appears in the dark clouds,

513
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
the people who come to surrender

514
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
will be thousands of people.

515
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
If I surrender now,

516
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
it's not worth it.

517
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
So

518
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
I'm a little earlier than them.

519
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
I'm just

520
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,520
telling you this.

521
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,520
The emperor is kind.

522
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,520
He knows how to appreciate the talent of the army.

523
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,520
As long as you're loyal to our tribe,

524
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
then the power you can get

525
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,520
is much more than you expected.

526
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
Your Highness,

527
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,520
General Yulin,

528
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,520
please say a few more nice words.

529
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
Uncle, Brother Xiu,

530
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,520
Brother Xiu is not that kind of person.

531
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
He won't betray the tribe.

532
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,520
I don't want to believe it either.

533
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
But

534
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
Furu said

535
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
he saw him

536
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,520
surrender to the northern tribe in public.

537
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Then there's another secret in the middle.

538
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
So we should

539
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
send someone to Yuanzhao

540
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
to investigate it.

541
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
My Lord.

542
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,520
All fifty war uniforms have been interrogated.

543
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Except for the seven people who were not there because of the injury,

544
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,520
the rest of the 43 war uniforms

545
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
are all here.

546
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
Zichuan Xiu

547
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,520
did betray the tribe in public.

548
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
My Lord,

549
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
if Zichuan Xiu really wanted to betray the tribe,

550
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
then he could have done it

551
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
when he was in Paiyi.

552
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
Then why did he

553
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
take the brothers of Xiu Ziying

554
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
to support the imperial army

555
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,520
and live and die with the soldiers of the family?

556
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
What about the people of Xiu Ziying?

557
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,520
They also disappeared?

558
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
All right.

559
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
This matter

560
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520
concerns the honor of the family

561
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
and the life of Xiu.

562
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Shuli Bureau

563
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
sends someone to investigate it first.

564
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
Then we will hold a meeting.

565
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
How will the debate be decided?

566
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,520
It will be decided by the family.

567
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
Yes.

568
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,520
Your Majesty.

569
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,520
I have temporarily placed Zichuan Xiu

570
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,520
in the military camp

571
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
and sent the guards to watch him closely.

572
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

573
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Your Majesty,

574
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,520
do you think

575
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,520
he really came to surrender?

576
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
I dare not say it.

577
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,520
On the day of the withdrawal,

578
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
Zichuan Xiu

579
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,520
secretly sent me a note.

580
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
At that time,

581
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
I suspected him

582
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
more than I trusted him.

583
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
But now

584
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,520
he is willing to

585
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,520
surrender to the family

586
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
in front of many people of the family.

587
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
He really doesn't want to surrender.

588
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,520
Military counselor,

589
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
do you know anything

590
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,520
about this Zichuan Xiu?

591
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
I have investigated him.

592
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,520
Zichuan Xiu is famous for being a peaceful place

593
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,520
and his parents are not from here.

594
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,520
Once, he was killed by the former commander

595
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
of the Zichuan family,

596
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
Zichuan Yuanxing.

597
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
His surname is Zichuan.

598
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
When he was young,

599
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
he entered Wutang, Yuanzhou.

600
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
At the age of thirteen,

601
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Liu Feng's army

602
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
attacked the capital.

603
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
Zichuan Xiu supported him

604
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
and led eight hundred soldiers

605
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
to break through the mountain

606
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
and the capital.

607
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,520
He then went to save the Liu Feng army

608
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
and fought them to the death.

609
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,520
In the end,

610
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Liu Feng Xishan was driven out

611
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
of the Zichuan family's territory.

612
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
He was killed by the army.

613
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
At the age of thirteen,

614
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
he actually defeated Liu Feng Xishan.

615
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
He is indeed a bit stupid.

616
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
But it seems that

617
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
he is loyal to the Zichuan family.

618
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
Why would he betray us?

619
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,520
If we talk about the reason,

620
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
after Zichuan Yuanxing died,

621
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,520
Yang Minghua, the master of the family,

622
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,520
was very worried about Zichuan Xiu

623
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
and sent him to Yuanzhou.

624
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,520
After several years,

625
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,520
he returned to the capital again.

626
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,520
He played a key role

627
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
in the military coup in the capital.

628
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
But after the death,

629
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
he was assigned to the Xufang Clan.

630
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
It seems that

631
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,520
this Zichuan Xiu

632
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,520
is likely to

633
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,520
have a grudge against the Zichuan family.

634
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,520
Loyalty

635
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
will not be easily grieved.

636
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
What is his character like?

637
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,520
General Yulin,

638
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,520
have you heard of Xiu Ziying?

639
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
Xiu Ziying

640
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,520
is the team led by Zichuan Xiu.

641
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,520
During the war,

642
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,520
he opened a shop

643
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
to make money.

644
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,520
It seems that

645
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,520
Zichuan Xiu

646
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
was too busy

647
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,520
to do anything

648
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,520
when his family was dying.

649
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
What the military counselor means is

650
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
that through Xiu Ziying,

651
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,520
we can see that

652
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
Zichuan Xiu

653
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
is not loyal and loyal.

654
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,520
So,

655
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
it's reasonable

656
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
to be a traitor.

657
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,520
This is not easy.

658
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
When I brought Lei Hong back,

659
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
he was being chased

660
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
by Zichuan Xiu.

661
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
Zichuan Xiu seems to hate

662
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
the traitors of the Zichuan family.

663
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
There may be

664
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
other purposes

665
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
for this surrender.

666
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
After all,

667
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,520
no one of us is close to him.

668
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,520
Whether he is reliable

669
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,520
is not decided yet.

670
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
It doesn't matter.

671
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,520
We don't need him to be reliable.

672
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
What do you mean?

673
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,520
Our North is so powerful.

674
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
But for thousands of years,

675
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
we have never conquered

676
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,520
the whole continent.

677
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,520
Do you know

678
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,520
where are the three families

679
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520
in the far west?

680
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,520
What you mean is

681
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,520
the people's hearts.

682
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
We can't conquer

683
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,520
a nation that is full of doubts.

684
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
To conquer,

685
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,520
we must destroy its fighting spirit

686
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,520
and destroy its will to resist.

687
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
In this regard,

688
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
Zichuan Xiu

689
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,520
is still of great use.

690
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,520
Whether Zichuan Xiu

691
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
is here for a purpose or not,

692
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,520
he is the son of the former commander

693
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,520
of the North.

694
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,520
If the North accepts him,

695
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
it will surely

696
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
have a great impact

697
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
on the family.

698
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
By then,

699
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
those who have been

700
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
so hardworking

701
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
will see Zichuan Xiu

702
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,520
being rewarded so much

703
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,520
and will be so disappointed

704
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
that they will come to surrender.

705
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
So,

706
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,520
we must not only accept him,

707
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,520
but also

708
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
give him a great use.

709
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,520
Your Majesty is wise.

710
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,520
Tonight, the celebration of the battle of Paiyi

711
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,520
is the best time.

712
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,520
Come on, brothers.

713
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Cheers.

714
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Cheers.

715
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
Brothers,

716
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,520
come on.

717
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,520
Let's drink together.

718
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,520
Let's drink together.

719
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
Cheers.

720
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
Cheers.

721
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Come on, drink.

722
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
Come on, brothers.

723
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,520
Come on.

724
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
Come on.

725
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
Come on.

726
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,520
Drink more.

727
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
Drink more.

728
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Come on.

729
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
You.

730
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Why don't you go over and sit down?

731
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,520
Tonight,

732
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
besides our celebration,

733
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
we also welcome you

734
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
to join our tribe.

735
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
I'm just

736
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
looking at the girls

737
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
of your tribe.

738
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,520
I thought that

739
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Princess Ka Dan was already very beautiful.

740
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,520
I didn't expect that

741
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
your tribe has so many

742
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,520
beautiful women.

743
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Come on, let's drink.

744
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,520
Zichuan Xiu,

745
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
I advise you

746
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,520
not to use our princess

747
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
as a joke.

748
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,520
Look at you.

749
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
You said it yourself.

750
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,520
I'm just kidding.

751
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
Let's go.

752
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
Let me introduce you

753
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,520
to the warriors of our tribe.

754
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,520
Okay.

755
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,520
Please take care of us.

756
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,520
Please take care of us.

757
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,520
Come on.

758
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
I can't drink anymore.

759
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
But I still have so many

760
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,520
people I haven't seen.

761
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,520
That Princess Ka Dan

762
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,520
and that...

763
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
Pingjing Palace

764
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,520
haven't come yet.

765
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
I still want to drink with them.

766
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
That's Ludi,

767
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
a member of our tribe.

768
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,520
This Zichuan family

769
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,520
is so powerful.

770
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
I'm afraid that

771
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
they will be killed.

772
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
I'm afraid that

773
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
they will be killed.

774
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
They are all

775
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,520
the useless people

776
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
who are afraid of death

777
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,520
and are afraid of death.

778
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
You know?

779
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
I won't believe them.

780
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,520
It's not good to

781
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,520
bring bad people

782
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,520
to Pingjing Palace

783
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
just because you are behind them.

784
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,520
This is the first warrior

785
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
of our tribe.

786
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
He has won the championship every year.

787
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
He is good at using swords.

788
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,520
He looks very brave.

789
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
He looks like a

790
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
master of weapon.

791
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
By the way,

792
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
Zi Chuan Xiu,

793
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
I wonder if there are

794
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
any skilled swordsmen

795
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,520
in the army of Zichuan?

796
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
Among the Zichuan family,

797
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
the best swordsmen

798
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,520
are the best.

799
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Of course.

800
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
There are no such people

801
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
who can compete with

802
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,520
General Yulin.

803
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
I think

804
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,520
there are many skilled swordsmen

805
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,520
in the army of Zichuan.

806
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,520
There must be someone

807
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,520
above me.

808
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
General Yulin,

809
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,520
tonight is the night of the festival.

810
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,520
We will have a fight.

811
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,520
Can we not talk about

812
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,520
these fighting and killing?

813
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,520
Will Pingjing Palace

814
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
come tonight?

815
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,520
You mentioned

816
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
Pingjing Palace many times tonight.

817
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,520
What is the matter

818
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
with you looking for him?

819
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,520
It's like this.

820
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,520
To be honest,

821
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
I'm not afraid of your laughing.

822
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
After all,

823
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,520
I am from the Zichuan family.

824
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,520
I am new to your tribe.

825
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,520
I want to talk to this person

826
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,520
who has the same experience

827
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
as me.

828
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,520
Maybe in the future,

829
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
I can get into the life

830
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,520
of your tribe.

831
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Right?

832
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
Your Highness,

833
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
are you really not going to the banquet?

834
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
I'm not interested.

835
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,520
You can go.

836
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
Yes.

837
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
What's wrong?

838
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
Your Highness,

839
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
do you know the man

840
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,520
who just came from the Zichuan family?

841
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
I heard from other maids

842
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,520
that he is a gentleman

843
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,520
of the Zichuan family.

844
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,520
He is very handsome.

845
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
What is the name

846
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
of this person you mentioned?

847
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,520
Your Highness,

848
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,520
it seems that he is called

849
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,520
Zi Chuan Xiu.

850
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,520
Not only the wine of the Northern Tribe,

851
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
Zi Chuan Xiu,

852
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,520
you are used to drinking it.

853
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
This is much better

854
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,520
than the wine of our Zichuan.

855
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,520
I really...

856
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
I can't drink anymore.

857
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
I...

858
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
I can't drink anymore.

859
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
I...

860
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
I can't drink anymore.

861
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,520
I...

862
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,520
That is Prince Ka Dun.

863
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
Behind him

864
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
is the Pingjing Palace.

865
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,520
This person

866
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,520
is the one who

867
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,520
is going to surrender to

868
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,520
our Zichuan Xiu.

869
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,520
Yes, it is me.

870
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,520
Welcome to surrender to the Northern Tribe.

871
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,520
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

872
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
I will definitely

873
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
do my best

874
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
to do my best

875
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,520
for Your Highness.

876
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
I'll go over there

877
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
and give you a toast.

878
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
The people of the Zichuan family

879
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
are really good at

880
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,520
playing tricks.

881
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,520
Whoever has a strong power

882
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,520
will come to the Chen Manor to save their lives.

883
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
They will be embarrassed

884
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
and come to our place to hide.

885
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,520
I'll give Prince Jin a toast first.

886
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,520
Prince Ka Dun,

887
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
let's go.

888
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,520
Prince,

889
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,520
this person once wanted to

890
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,520
kill me in the Far East.

891
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,520
This person's words

892
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,520
cannot be trusted.

893
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,520
Lord Pingjing,

894
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
after this cup,

895
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
why are you so anxious?

896
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,520
Long time no see.

897
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
Lord Lei,

898
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,520
how have you been?

899
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
Lord Ge Yin Xing,

900
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,520
I greet you.

901
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,520
Lord,

902
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,520
I'm here.

903
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,520
I'm here.

904
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,520
I'm here.

905
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,520
I'm here.

906
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,520
I'm here.

907
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
I'm here.

908
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,520
I'm here.

909
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,520
I'm here.

910
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,520
I'm here.

911
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,520
I'm here.

912
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,520
I'm here.

913
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,520
I'm here.

914
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,520
I'm here.

915
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,520
I'm here.

916
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,520
I'm here.

917
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,520
I'm here.

918
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,520
I'm here.

919
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,520
I'm here.

920
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,520
I'm here.

921
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,520
I'm here.

922
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,520
I'm here.

923
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,520
I'm here.

924
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,520
I'm here.

925
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,520
I'm here.

926
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
I'm here.

927
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
I'm here.

928
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,520
I'm here.

929
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,100
How dare thoseителей who betray us

930
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,520
to sashimi uselessly

931
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,760
Before I know it,

932
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:42,260
I will put some

933
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,520
I'm going to take off my shoes

934
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,080
Your firecracker is still burning

935
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,080
I'm scared to death

936
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,080
I'm also scared to death

937
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,080
The end of the night

938
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,080
Come on, come on, come on

939
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,080
Take a pair of shoes

940
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,080
The bottom of the shoe fell

941
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,080
The bottom

942
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,080
Look how good you did

943
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,080
I'm scared to death

944
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,080
I'm scared to death

945
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,080
I'm scared to death

946
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,080
The end of the night

947
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,080
It's clearly the glory of the world

948
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:11,080
The disappeared old friend

949
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,640
He walked away from my heart

950
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,640
I'm silent

951
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,640
I'm waiting for you

952
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,640
I can see him

953
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,640
He's still there

954
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,640
The disappeared old friend

955
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,640
The disappeared old friend

956
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,640
He walked away from my heart

957
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,640
He walked away from my heart

958
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,640
He walked away from my heart

959
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,200
He walked away from my heart

960
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,200
go

961
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,200
He was still alone

962
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,200
He walked away from my heart

963
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,800
This is the story of a quote

964
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:03,800
The dried persimmon

965
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I don't know

966
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I like to stay in the old place

967
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Sir, please give up the right to be in the coffin of Yuan Zhou 23

968
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm sorry, sir, I'm not a good person

969
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Yuan Zhou is like a woman, Yuan Zhou is like the wall of this mountain

970
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
The pain of breaking the wall is like a soul, the pain is like a sea

971
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm sorry, sir

972
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'm sorry, sir, I'm not a good person

973
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Yuan Zhou is like a woman, Yuan Zhou is like the wall of this mountain

974
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
The pain of breaking the wall is like a soul, the pain is like a sea

975
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I'm sorry, sir, I'm not a good person

976
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yuan Zhou is like a woman, Yuan Zhou is like the wall of this mountain
