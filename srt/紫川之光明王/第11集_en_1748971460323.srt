1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
LOL

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
editing

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
verd Member

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:56,540
cel

23
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,540
I see.

24
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,540
Now the whole capital

25
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,540
thinks that Si Yiling and Li Qing are

26
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,540
a team of heaven and hell.

27
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,540
But in this way,

28
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,540
I'm afraid that no one in the capital

29
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,540
dares to have any intention of

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,540
Li Qing.

31
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,540
You think so?

32
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,540
Yes.

33
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,540
With such a good idea of Si Yiling,

34
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,540
who dares to go to

35
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,540
Li Qing's heart?

36
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,540
What do you think of Qing'er's situation?

37
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,540
The name of the resistance is far away.

38
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,540
Unless you press the public's tongue

39
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,540
for his order,

40
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,540
or else

41
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,540
Li Qing will be afraid to

42
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,540
carry on this life.

43
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,540
That's good.

44
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,540
You can understand.

45
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,540
Si Yiling can understand.

46
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,540
But with the surname of Si Yiling,

47
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,540
he won't be wronged

48
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,540
because of others.

49
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,540
The most capable of the Zichuan New Year's Day

50
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,540
is the three brothers

51
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,540
Di Yiling, Si Yiling and Zichuan Xiu.

52
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,540
I can't

53
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,540
keep the idea of

54
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,540
the Zichuan New Year

55
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,540
in my heart.

56
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,540
Zichuan Xiu

57
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,540
won't say it anymore.

58
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,540
He's already a traitor.

59
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,540
Si Yiling,

60
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,540
I hope he can hold on to the history.

61
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,540
If he can fight with Qing'er,

62
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,540
he can be stable and be in the court.

63
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,540
I'm the most suitable

64
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,540
and suitable team.

65
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,540
He wants me to

66
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,540
worry about this.

67
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,540
But it's true.

68
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,540
You're doing this for them.

69
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,540
One day,

70
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,540
they'll understand.

71
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,540
Yes.

72
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,540
I hope so.

73
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,540
Uncle told me to

74
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,540
take care of the medicine.

75
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,540
He used to live here.

76
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,540
So I came here

77
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,540
to ask you to teach me.

78
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,540
The Wanyun Medicine is a place

79
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,540
where the land is limited.

80
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,540
It's hard to guard.

81
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,540
But after many years of war,

82
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,540
the city has many medical facilities.

83
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,540
It's damaged.

84
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,540
Especially the wall in the east.

85
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,540
It's the worst damage.

86
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,540
Although I've repaired it before the war,

87
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,540
I can't bear to

88
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,540
repair it completely.

89
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,540
I need a lot of time.

90
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,540
But the war is over now.

91
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,540
The Wanyun Guoku is in danger.

92
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,540
The family

93
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,540
can't bear to lose anything.

94
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,540
So this is

95
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,540
a good plan.

96
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
If we can

97
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,540
take out the money from

98
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,540
Lord Goshan,

99
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,540
Uncle won't send me

100
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,540
to deal with this.

101
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,540
Lord Siyi, Lord Lin,

102
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,540
and Lord Di Ling,

103
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,540
you can

104
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,540
handle the Wanyun Medicine

105
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,540
together.

106
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,540
The style of the court is big.

107
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,540
Now,

108
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,540
we need to start from those high officials.

109
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,540
I'm afraid I can only

110
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,540
move out of the military.

111
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,540
I think I need to

112
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,540
think of a way

113
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,540
to make money.

114
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,540
This is the hardest part.

115
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,540
From the time of Zichuan,

116
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,540
the government was more important.

117
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,540
Gu Lan used to have many officials.

118
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,540
Not only by the violence of the wall,

119
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,540
but also by the government's purchase.

120
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,540
That's right.

121
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,540
Now, only the three provinces

122
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,540
can bear the disadvantage of the family.

123
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,540
After the war,

124
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,540
the national power of the family is not as great as before.

125
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,540
But the noble families of the three provinces

126
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,540
have built the mansion

127
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,540
and expanded the house.

128
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,540
So, they need to pay for this.

129
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
I think this idea is good.

130
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,540
But there is one problem.

131
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,540
Those people are not good at the capital.

132
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,860
If they don't have some

133
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,540
money,

134
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,540
I'm afraid they won't be able to deal with it.

135
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,540
Lord Lin,

136
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,540
do you have any plans?

137
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,540
The court, the court,

138
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,540
the military,

139
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,540
and the military.

140
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,540
If you want to make money

141
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,540
with the money,

142
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,540
it's not easy.

143
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,540
But they have to realize

144
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,540
that their money is not

145
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,540
in the same amount as the national power.

146
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,540
If they are willing to take out the money,

147
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,540
if they don't,

148
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,540
when Zichuan had a big disaster in the past,

149
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,540
the family used to cut the salt and the mine

150
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,540
and make the oil and oil and the stock.

151
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,540
When father was alive,

152
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,540
he did it.

153
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,540
If they don't want to find a way to save money

154
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,540
and cut their own money,

155
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,540
they should take out the sincerity.

156
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,540
Si Yulin,

157
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,540
I think you are in a good mood today.

158
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,540
A few days ago,

159
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,540
you looked very sad.

160
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,540
I was worried about you.

161
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,540
Who would have thought

162
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,540
that Zichuan had this side?

163
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,540
I'm fine now

164
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,540
that you are worried about me.

165
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,540
You will understand

166
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,540
when you are alive.

167
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,540
There is no love

168
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,540
that can't be forgotten.

169
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,540
There is no one

170
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,540
who can't be left out.

171
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,540
They are fighting

172
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,540
with their obsession.

173
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,540
The war record

174
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,540
that was handed over to the Liu's family?

175
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,540
I've lost my memory.

176
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,540
I'll go immediately.

177
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,540
No, no.

178
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
I want to tell you this.

179
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,540
Qing'er has written it for you.

180
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,540
You just need to sign it

181
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,540
in the capital.

182
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,540
Qing'er,

183
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,540
is like this.

184
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,540
She is always silent.

185
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,540
She never speaks.

186
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,540
I appreciate this child.

187
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,540
After you took the three cities,

188
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,540
the court gave you a good name.

189
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,540
It reminded you of your marriage.

190
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,540
But Qing'er told me

191
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,540
that she told me not to mention it.

192
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,540
I asked her why.

193
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,540
She said

194
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,540
she was afraid that you would be in trouble.

195
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,540
But who

196
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,540
comforted her?

197
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,540
Alright.

198
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,540
You young people

199
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,540
should think about it.

200
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,540
I'll just

201
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,540
take it here.

202
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:40,220
Chinese Culture

203
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,540
Someone is on the throne?

204
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,220
What's wrong?

205
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,540
Sir.

206
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,740
Bring it here.

207
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,540
Sir.

208
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,540
I don't know when it was.

209
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,640
I think it was飽ed from outside.

210
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,540
Go.

211
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,340
Don't delay the formalities.

212
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
Yes.

213
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,040
Afterwards,

214
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,340
I have already seen with nearly every creature's identity

215
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,340
who to say I was gained as the Emperor.

216
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,640
My Lord.

217
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,340
On sand, four directions light-headed photographs cm tinyぜ 综 heyン

218
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,180
�רific with the murder that is going on.

219
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,380
and the one no one could ever find the time for me

220
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,620
we will stay together

221
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,540
ine

222
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,260
and continue our scoffing

223
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,580
and Summing you up

224
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,640
Our love Meter

225
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640
Life is always boring.

226
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,040
At least, you have to leave.

227
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Please don't be lonely.

228
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,040
At least, you have to leave.

229
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
But I wonder if in this world,

230
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,240
how much more you have to go through.

231
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Love is eternal.

232
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Life is always boring.

233
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,640
The dream is always the same.

234
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,640
It's the same.

235
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,640
I will let you down to see the change in time.

236
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,640
This love is pitiful.

237
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,640
Love is eternal.

238
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
Love is eternal.

239
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Every year,

240
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,640
I miss you so much.

241
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Love is eternal.

242
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Love is eternal.

243
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,640
I will let you down to see the change in time.

244
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,640
This love is pitiful.

245
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
You have visited all the three noble families in the capital.

246
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
Only these?

247
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
The first-class food is not out of the city.

248
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,640
Most of the other food is gone.

249
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
These are their last days.

250
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640
He even drove us out of the door.

251
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
He hurt the common people.

252
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
He also said...

253
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
He also said that you are not good at the position of the previous emperor.

254
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
You are so hard-working.

255
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,640
You are so impulsive to Zichuan.

256
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,640
Nonsense.

257
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,640
How dare you slander you?

258
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,640
Why did you send a law firm to punish him?

259
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
I know that

260
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,640
the reason why you sent me to do this

261
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,640
is because he can't show up personally

262
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,640
and earn money in the next day.

263
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,640
I have no legal support.

264
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,640
I have no power.

265
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
He has nothing to say.

266
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,640
I was too shallow.

267
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
I couldn't help them.

268
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,640
Have you visited Mr. Ma Wei?

269
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
What did he say?

270
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
He went there.

271
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,640
The mausoleum said that

272
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Mr. Ma Wei is out of the palace.

273
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
He will be back in the afternoon.

274
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
Don't call me.

275
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,640
I will go to the mausoleum.

276
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
Yes.

277
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
If you have anything to say,

278
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
I can help you.

279
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
I know

280
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,640
you are afraid that I will cause trouble.

281
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
But if I go to the mausoleum personally,

282
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Ma Wei will have to give me a few points.

283
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Most of the money is still in the mausoleum.

284
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
It's because he doesn't want to give it to me

285
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,640
and the family.

286
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
He is still looking for it.

287
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,640
The mausoleum is in the mausoleum.

288
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,640
The mausoleum is in the mausoleum.

289
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
It's the most important thing.

290
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
If it's too much of a cause,

291
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
the other food will be worried

292
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
that we will be too close to it.

293
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,640
He doesn't want to be satisfied with me.

294
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
I didn't expect that you are so considerate.

295
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
You are so considerate.

296
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
What can I be considerate?

297
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,640
I just want to

298
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
think about it.

299
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
How will you do it?

300
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,640
I know the family needs to repair the mausoleum.

301
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,640
You are in charge of the capital.

302
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
I will run all the cities at night.

303
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
I have taken all the money

304
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
and money from the mausoleum.

305
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Although it's not enough to repair the mausoleum,

306
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,640
I hope that you can help me.

307
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,640
I heard you drinking estan scaling tea early morning.

308
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
I veure theず般嗎

309
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
you have quit your job.

310
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,680
it must save you fromdrinking the Shah Mian draft.

311
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,940
Sit.

312
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,060
Sit.

313
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,460
By now, Mikado came to court.

314
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,460
Kuro Mona asked me for your business catch the Roots.

315
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,260
As a result, Kuro had some major troubles.

316
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,860
Kuro is now in the Zhangshogou Chamber saw straight to Yuan World.

317
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,460
Didn't think you'd know this will happen.

318
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,260
just for Ye ski and Brother Xiu's cooperation.

319
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,940
He loves to Throng.

320
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,980
Ma Ma wasoretically relatively little.

321
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,660
As your man who resembles carditycznie head,

322
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,700
Since Ma Ma did the same.

323
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,580
In general here,

324
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,080
I'd say it's not just because of Ma,

325
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,580
but it's because of financial password.

326
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,860
During the return,

327
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,540
Maybe I'll listen to誒藤誔ス的叛逆之言.

328
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,540
He Canshi is a bad word to me.

329
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,540
He is a bad word to the family.

330
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,540
I have a good chance to kill the Marquis.

331
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,540
I am willing to kill those who don't want to.

332
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,540
But the three provinces' power behind them

333
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,540
is complicated.

334
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,540
So I want to hear your opinion.

335
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,540
He Canshi's resignation is not good for the family.

336
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
It's really heart-wrenching.

337
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,540
But...

338
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,540
It's okay, Marquis.

339
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,540
If you continue,

340
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,540
I am afraid that you will be like Canshi

341
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,540
who is willing to kill the Marquis.

342
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,540
What you said today

343
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,540
is not a Canshi's identity.

344
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,540
It's a friend's opinion about another friend.

345
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,540
Why do you want to kill him?

346
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,140
I won't kill him now.

347
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,900
Sittimailang

348
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,080
You leave in your power.

349
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,540
For the second time,

350
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,540
on one hand, it is not convenient for you to harm yourself.

351
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,740
to send a出来,

352
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,180
I willール

353
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,340
Your Royal Highness will pay a severe pålence.

354
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,980
No concern.

355
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,460
How do look Care for this place.

356
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:18,700
Afterall

357
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,920
hte

358
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,020
This emperor

359
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,380
you think

360
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,680
the king of gold how to deal with selling

361
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,460
In most cases

362
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,340
Take back frame and leaf, make them state-owned heroes.

363
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,580
We don't know what success is.

364
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,500
But now,

365
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,620
our family doesn't have any land to cross over.

366
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,820
If we work hard,

367
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,500
your planning and defeating for sure

368
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,180
will be beyond magical.

369
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,620
Sn examples of battle after battles

370
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,680
are added to both sides.

371
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:51,740
As you said,

372
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,700
I couldn't lead them in private.

373
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,660
That's not true.

374
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,580
Of course not.

375
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:24,620
Your Highness Mids

376
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,980
The family's reputation is at stake.

377
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,580
Those people can't be trusted.

378
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,580
But the family and the property are there.

379
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,900
They can't even get some stock.

380
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,540
They will be killed if they see the rabbit.

381
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,260
If the family treasure can be donated,

382
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,940
they will be more vulnerable.

383
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,380
If the price is sold,

384
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,780
the price will be high.

385
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,180
It's not small.

386
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,380
There are many jewelry stores in Wu's Mansion.

387
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,740
They can be sold.

388
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,380
We Stateship and uncle

389
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,100
also don't have much money for it.

390
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,220
I also cherish the юbt Essex Shift.

391
00:20:59,460 --> 00:20:59,980
Later

392
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,420
I will let the servants

393
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,540
and zhiguli Storm Spades

394
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,180
Life is full of twists and turns.

395
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,140
They will realize my ownership.

396
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,100
They will take the chance

397
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,740
and take the treasure to the hunting Hola.

398
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,020
As the matter is,

399
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,460
I talk to all the neighbors.

400
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,260
This is a ° is very important.

401
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,280
As a result of your poker board,

402
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,540
enzhuang is considered a great empire.

403
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,540
To commune with Zhu Z Bas,

404
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,960
my report was true.

405
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,520
Among soldiers,

406
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,260
there have been Sugar F哩

407
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,640
and a SVD Force .

408
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,420
accomodating odorless care about storm.

409
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,420
You're not allowed to eat meat.

410
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,420
Now we've defeated half of Yuan Zhou.

411
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,420
If we take down the temple,

412
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,420
Yuan Zhou's people will lose their lives.

413
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,420
We can do whatever we want.

414
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,420
As long as we take down the temple,

415
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,420
the things inside will be the first.

416
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,420
My Lord,

417
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,420
the north army brought by Lu Di

418
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,420
is not enough for ten thousand people.

419
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,420
They're stationed near Long Ya Mountain.

420
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,420
We've added the soldiers from Yuan Zhou.

421
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,420
They're their double.

422
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,420
We have a lot of advantages

423
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,420
on the population.

424
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,420
But Lu Di has only

425
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,420
a few thousand people

426
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,420
who have defeated us.

427
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,420
If we continue to fight,

428
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,420
I'm guessing that

429
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,420
their goal will be

430
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,420
the life of the people of the tribe.

431
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
Although the chief of the tribe

432
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
has ordered

433
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,420
the people of the tribe to unite,

434
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,420
these people

435
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,420
have been fighting for a long time.

436
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,420
I'm afraid that they've agreed on the surface,

437
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,420
but it's useless.

438
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,420
Sister Luo,

439
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,420
I asked you to summon

440
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
the general of the tribe

441
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
to do the division of the front.

442
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
How is it?

443
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
I'm sorry to say that

444
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,420
the Snake Tribe

445
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,420
and the Emperor Tribe

446
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,420
have all been defeated.

447
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,420
The Snake Tribe has lost,

448
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,420
but the Snake Tribe is in the battle.

449
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,420
They're not even human anymore.

450
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,420
And the Dragon Tribe.

451
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,420
The Dragon Tribe

452
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,420
was good with the half-baked people.

453
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,420
But the Dragon Tribe

454
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
knows that the half-baked people

455
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,420
are far better than them.

456
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,420
You know that

457
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,420
the half-baked people

458
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,420
are all like this.

459
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,420
They have a big appetite.

460
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,420
But the Dragon Tribe

461
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,420
doesn't care about it.

462
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,420
It's just that they're good.

463
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,420
If that's the case,

464
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,420
the Golden Bells are the most important.

465
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,420
Let me show you.

466
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,420
This is the report they've made.

467
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,420
The private report

468
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,420
doesn't look like the Golden Bells' style.

469
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,420
It's not a report.

470
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,420
It's a word.

471
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
They've written so much.

472
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,420
Actually, they've said one thing.

473
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
They said they have the ability to limit it.

474
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,420
They want us to stop them.

475
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,420
Sir.

476
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,420
We've been keeping the cat and cat for a night.

477
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,420
We finally caught a North Tribe soldier.

478
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,420
They have a group of cavalry

479
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,420
here.

480
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,420
The transport vehicle is here.

481
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
That's great.

482
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,420
They've retreated?

483
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,420
No.

484
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,420
They're going to fight over it.

485
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,420
Head.

486
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,420
We're in a mess now.

487
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,420
We're all fighting.

488
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,420
Even if we fight over it,

489
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,420
we can't handle it.

490
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,420
What's so happy about it?

491
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,420
They've made a big fuss.

492
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,420
They've only wanted to fight over it.

493
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,420
They've decided to kill us.

494
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,420
They've asked Lu Di

495
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,420
to come and help us.

496
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Why do you want us to be the right-wingers?

497
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,420
Can't you see our strength?

498
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
We can fight.

499
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,420
We want to stand before the temple.

500
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,420
Let the bandits in the North

501
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,420
to try our best.

502
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,420
We won't just hide in the woods

503
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,420
and throw stones and ropes.

504
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,420
We can't do anything

505
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,420
that's too small.

506
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,420
We should let the little guys

507
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
in the Jinling Tribe do it.

508
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,420
Little guys?

509
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,420
I think

510
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,420
you should be the right-wingers.

511
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,420
You can just run away

512
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,420
if you don't fight.

513
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,420
What are you talking about?

514
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,420
What are you talking about?

515
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,420
What are you talking about?

516
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,420
What are you talking about?

517
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,420
Stop fighting.

518
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,420
I believe that Mr. Xiu

519
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,420
can't do anything to him.

520
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,420
Tell me.

521
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,420
If I tell you,

522
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,420
don't fight anymore.

523
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,420
Just run away.

524
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,420
How can we do this?

525
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,420
Why can't we?

526
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,420
The bandits are about to fight.

527
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,420
Look at what you're doing.

528
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,420
You're still fighting here.

529
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,420
I think

530
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,420
you should invite Ludi in

531
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,420
and send your temple

532
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,420
to him as a gift.

533
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,420
We're going to fight with the temple.

534
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,420
We can't fight.

535
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,420
We can't fight.

536
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,420
We can't fight.

537
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,420
You said it.

538
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,420
I'll tell you the truth.

539
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,420
The brothers of Xiu Ziyin

540
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,420
and I have already packed up.

541
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,420
We're going to withdraw the luggage.

542
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,420
Can we keep the temple?

543
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,420
Can we get peace in the faraway city?

544
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,420
You're all here.

545
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,420
What Mr. Xiu said is

546
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,420
if you want to live,

547
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,420
shut up.

548
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,420
Brothers,

549
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,420
I'm asking you.

550
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,420
Who is more powerful

551
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,420
in moving speed and climbing?

552
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,420
Who is stronger than the snake tribe?

553
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,420
So,

554
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,420
except the snake tribe,

555
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,420
who else is more suitable to be a bait?

556
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,420
And your elite group.

557
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,420
You're good at shooting and shooting the trap.

558
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,420
I need you to lead everyone

559
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,420
to the trap in advance.

560
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,420
And your dragon group

561
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,420
is strong in nature and brave in battle.

562
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,420
It's suitable for those

563
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,420
who fall into the trap

564
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,420
to face them.

565
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,420
I hope this time

566
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
everyone can take out the Kanchi's base.

567
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,420
Give them some color.

568
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,420
I'll tell you my plan first.

569
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,420
First,

570
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,420
I need you to divide the snake tribe into two ways.

571
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,420
If you encounter enemies outside the tribe,

572
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,420
you can scold them.

573
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,420
If you don't listen to them,

574
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,420
you can scold them all.

575
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,420
But remember,

576
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
don't fight with them.

577
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,420
By then,

578
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,420
you can lead everyone

579
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,420
to the trap.

580
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,420
Then,

581
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,420
the dragon group and the Kanchi's brothers will be there.

582
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,420
What if they don't come to take us?

583
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,420
This is the biggest problem

584
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,420
in your Yuanzhou's group.

585
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,420
You can't trust them.

586
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,420
If the dragon group and the Kanchi's group

587
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,420
don't take us,

588
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,420
then we will definitely

589
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,420
take the Kanchi's base.

590
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,420
By then,

591
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,420
you will see

592
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,420
you are not alone.

593
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,420
You will be killed by Lu Di.

594
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,420
You will be killed by the northern tribe.

595
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,420
And this is

596
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,420
your last place.

597
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,420
Brothers,

598
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:35,420
only the teamwork

599
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
will win

600
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,420
along with the奇 we meet.

601
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,420
Yuanzhou will then hold

602
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:41,700
the hope that thisissement is

603
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:58,500
safe

604
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,580
with the stone on the roadside.

605
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,860
No weapon, no stick,

606
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,340
no scissor.

607
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,260
As long as we can put their heads on it,

608
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,340
we'll be in big trouble.

609
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,820
Once we hit them,

610
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,380
we'll have nothing left.

611
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,060
Don't worry.

612
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,220
We'll win.

613
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,020
Thank you, Lord Xiudan.

614
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,300
With this knife,

615
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,660
even if it's the most dangerous task,

616
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,620
I can do it.

617
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,500
What's my task?

618
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,420
Just say it.

619
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,620
Live.

620
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,820
You're the great Han people.

621
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,620
The great Han people.

622
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,580
The great Han people.

623
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,340
You're born

624
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,580
with a bunch of yellow-and-white arrows.

625
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,300
The arrows.

626
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,900
You're the great Han people.

627
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,900
You're the great Han people.

628
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,540
The great Han people.

629
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,340
The great Han people.

630
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,340
The great Han people.

631
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,340
The great Han people.

632
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,460
Don't be so serious.

633
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,220
Don't be so serious.

634
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,940
Hurry.

635
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,380
Don't shoot.

636
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,340
Be careful,

637
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,140
Search carefully.

638
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,060
Search.

639
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,720
Go.

640
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,280
Run right away if you hear anything.

641
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,300
I!!!

642
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,800
He doesn't give me a chance to escape.

643
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,440
aciones!

644
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,940
Who happened to kill Brother姑娘?

645
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:21,480
It's the general, Brother Radio Free Band of leftist forces.

646
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,580
General?

647
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,020
You are fating for it.

648
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,080
�� mirrors?

649
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,780
Why?

650
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,900
Why are you trying to avoid a trial?

651
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,220
You could have fought them.

652
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,020
Wind Exodus interview was bad

653
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,440
but the judge has survival.

654
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,180
Your crises are still underlying.

655
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,940
Yes.

656
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,120
Excellent.

657
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,580
Go!

658
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,700
My lord.

659
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,700
Don't panic.

660
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,700
Continue to move forward.

661
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,580
Go!

662
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,580
My lord.

663
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,580
These bandits are looking for death.

664
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,580
Fire!

665
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,580
Go!

666
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,580
Go!

667
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,580
Go!

668
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,580
You crazy bastard!

669
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,580
Keep fighting!

670
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,580
Go!

671
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,580
I've got the fire.

672
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,580
Prepare to fight!

673
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,580
Brothers,

674
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,580
fight them out!

675
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,580
Fight!

676
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,580
Fight!

677
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,580
Fight!

678
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,580
Fight!

679
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,580
Fight!

680
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,580
Fight!

681
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,580
Fight!

682
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,580
My lord.

683
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,580
Do you need help?

684
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,580
Hide.

685
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,580
Don't come out.

686
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,580
Go!

687
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,580
Go!

688
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,580
Go!

689
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,580
Bu Dan.

690
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,580
I didn't expect you to be angry with me today.

691
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,580
You are?

692
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,580
You said you would be angry with me.

693
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,580
Why don't you know me?

694
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,580
You are not Bu Dan.

695
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,580
Who are you?

696
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,580
I am

697
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,580
your grandfather.

698
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,580
Your grandmother?

699
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,580
I will cut your head today.

700
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,580
I will kill you.

701
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,580
Go!

702
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,580
Go!

703
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,580
Go!

704
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,580
Lord Lu Di.

705
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,580
Your loss is very important.

706
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,580
Who are you?

707
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,580
Who am I?

708
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,580
Is it important?

709
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,580
I am the great doctor this time.

710
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,580
I didn't expect that

711
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,580
these useless people in Yuanzhou

712
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,580
would learn to use tactics.

713
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,580
You are the one who is responsible for this.

714
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,580
Kill me.

715
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,580
Kill me.

716
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,580
You can go.

717
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,580
You won't kill me this time.

718
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,580
I will kill you next time.

719
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,580
Okay.

720
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,580
I will keep this for you.

721
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
Remember to bring it to me

722
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,580
when you see me next time.

723
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,580
Okay.

724
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,580
Brother, we won.

725
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,580
You are so brave.

726
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,580
Bu Dan.

727
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,580
We won.

728
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,580
You can go out.

729
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
To accept everyone's encouragement and welcome.

730
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,580
We won.

731
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,580
Lord Zhou.

732
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,580
Please accept our blessing.

733
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,580
Go.

734
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,580
What are you doing?

735
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,580
Lord Zhou.

736
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,580
Their passion is too high.

737
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,580
Please enjoy it.

738
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,580
The glory of the Chongbai.

739
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,580
You can fall down.

740
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,580
I will hold you back.

741
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,580
Yes.

742
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,580
Don't worry.

743
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,580
I have told you.

744
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,580
You won't die.

745
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,580
And the glory of the Chongbai

746
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,580
is waiting for you.

747
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,580
You can go.

748
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,580
Come on.

749
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,580
The glory of the Chongbai.

750
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,580
No.

751
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,580
My lord.

752
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,580
I can't lose.

753
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,580
I killed a Chinese.

754
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,580
Good.

755
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,580
Good.

756
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,580
My lord.

757
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,580
I killed one.

758
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,580
Two.

759
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,580
One.

760
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,580
I am the leader.

761
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,580
I have broken their spirit and spirit.

762
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,580
My lord.

763
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,580
Remember my name.

764
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,580
I am the dragon.

765
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,580
Buqiao.

766
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,580
Good.

767
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,580
You are all heroes.

768
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,580
Good.

769
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,580
Good.

770
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,580
They really like Lord Xiuchuan.

771
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,580
The group sometimes needs a life

772
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,580
to leave the same place.

773
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,580
Actually, today,

774
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,580
I didn't lead them to victory.

775
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,580
It was because of them.

776
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,580
Because of their faith in the temple.

777
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,580
Because of their passion for the land of Yuanzhou.

778
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,580
So they won today.

779
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
Why didn't you kill the Lu Di?

780
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,580
Let him go.

781
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,580
This Lu Di is interesting.

782
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
It's a little bit of a trick.

783
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,580
But I was really

784
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,580
stupid and stupid.

785
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,580
If I kill him,

786
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580
will Saiyong and Shenhuang

787
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,580
send other commanders to fight?

788
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,580
Are you willing to fight him?

789
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,580
Or are you willing to fight

790
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,580
like Yun Qianxue?

791
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,580
Yun Qianxue?

792
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,580
Lu Di was a big loss this time.

793
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,580
He must have no face to save his life.

794
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,580
So this time,

795
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
we can get a short-term relief.

796
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,580
My lord.

797
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,580
The battle in the temple

798
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,580
is not small in the military.

799
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,580
Do you want to report it?

800
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,580
Do you want to support it?

801
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,580
No.

802
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,580
Be gentle.

803
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,580
Be gentle.

804
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,580
Okay.

805
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,580
If the other commanders in the north

806
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,580
know that I was arrested and released,

807
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,580
they can't be removed from the camp.

808
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,580
Maybe

809
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,580
they will take me as a spy in the army.

810
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,580
I will make a news about it.

811
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,580
But I won't keep it.

812
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,580
One day, I will be killed.

813
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,580
Is the one who arrested you

814
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,580
really the old man?

815
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,580
If it's him,

816
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,580
how can he release you?

817
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,580
I don't know who is not responsible.

818
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,580
But that guy's voice sounds familiar.

819
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,580
He is wearing a mask.

820
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,580
Maybe he is not responsible

821
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,580
for the old man's trick.

822
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,580
No matter what trick he has,

823
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,580
I will be a spy one day.

824
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,580
I will be the one to stop Lu Di from being a spy.

825
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,580
You...

826
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,580
It hurts.

827
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,580
If the whole Yuan State

828
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,580
is united by the people of Yuan,

829
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,580
the people of all tribes

830
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,580
are the people of Yuan.

831
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,580
This is the path of the people of Yuan.

832
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,580
My Zi Chuan embroidery

833
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,580
belongs to Yuan State.

834
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,580
Thank you for saving my life.

835
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,580
This is the gift I gave you.

836
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,580
The King of Black Pavilion

837
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,580
who removed the dark seal

838
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,580
and the light of the world

839
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,580
and the divine decree of the Imperial Court

840
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,580
will be passed on to you.

841
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,580
I will be the one to stop you.

842
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,580
I will be the one to stop you.

843
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,580
The time is finally up in Jinzhou.

844
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,580
From today,

845
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,580
he is the King of Light of Yuan State.

846
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,580
He will take all the people of Yuan State

847
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,580
to the world again.

848
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:48,580
King of Light...

849
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:54,580
King of Light...

850
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,580
