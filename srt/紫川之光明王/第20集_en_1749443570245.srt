1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not afraid of you.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not afraid of you.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not afraid of you.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not afraid of you.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I think I'm suitable for the task.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You can leave too.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I can drop this hmmmm ...

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Your Highness,

28
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,560
you are in charge of the work of Du Zheng Si.

29
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,920
Thank you for your love

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,280
for Xiao Ning.

31
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,840
I'm too young to

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,920
see you in this way.

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,040
Your Excellency,

34
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,920
why do you have to humble yourself?

35
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,920
As the next excellency,

36
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
it's just that

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
you have

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,880
a chance to break off the chain.

39
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,640
You should be ready

40
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,880
for the future.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,320
To follow the carp's footsteps

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,200
could perhaps simply

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,160
become your own destiny now.

44
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,560
But

45
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,480
with a ben geology

46
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,440
and natural resources,

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,400
the future will grow.

48
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,680
The Sage from the�

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,840
**

50
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,180
abdicated on

51
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,760
the edict.

52
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,320
The fool

53
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,160
from my啟指

54
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,920
and its seclusion become the distance between Africa and the Americas

55
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,580
that will make your acts worse.

56
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,880
That's right.

57
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,160
Thank heavens.

58
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,040
Your word

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,400
is already so vague.

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,040
You?

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,360
These walls were temporarily removed from their이스.

62
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,680
There are no number of piles.

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,440
I'm kidding.

64
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,680
You just stop!

65
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,880
I will go.

66
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,440
Leave.

67
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,440
Lanes 겨 era

68
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,640
It's the foundation of history.

69
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:43,000
I respect an understanding of the

70
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,320
person inside the Hall

71
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,620
and my upcoming

72
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,640
trainingetta

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,000
at the Herr right

74
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:54,520
im not

75
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,620
just a

76
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,560
mistake

77
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,140
0

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,900
people

79
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,500
spoke

80
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,600
What do you mean?

81
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,160
What do I mean?

82
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,480
You should understand.

83
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,000
After all,

84
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
everything that the Three Kingdoms have done

85
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,560
is for the family and the whole Zichuan.

86
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,280
At this point,

87
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,680
you should understand more than Yang Minghua.

88
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,480
That's natural.

89
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,240
Lord.

90
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,560
I think the work of Lord Goshan

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,200
is indeed very complicated.

92
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,320
It's hard to stop the work of each department

93
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,920
to make it more complicated.

94
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,200
I have a suggestion.

95
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,760
I can be happy.

96
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,760
I wonder if Lord Goshan

97
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,960
and Xiao Ping will listen to me.

98
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,080
It's okay to talk about it.

99
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,480
Your Highness, you have not had enough experience.

100
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,360
Lord Goshan is not so popular now.

101
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,240
But the two of you are together.

102
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,960
But you can solve the awkward situation now.

103
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,360
So I suggest that

104
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,840
you should be the one

105
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,600
to be the one to be the head of the division.

106
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,600
Lord Goshan will be the head of the division

107
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,640
to assist you.

108
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,560
What do you think?

109
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,560
Okay.

110
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,480
Then let's make a arrangement.

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,920
All right.

112
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,160
Yes.

113
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,280
Yes.

114
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,300
The third

115
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,880
not only succeeded in eliminating forces,

116
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,040
but also how jobless the outside was.

117
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,080
You know how I know the strong support

118
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,400
of the division.

119
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,440
And you know the power.

120
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,560
Do you have the reason

121
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,560
That's why I'm asking you to do it.

122
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
That's the reason.

123
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,560
First, you're young and have no experience in the court.

124
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,560
You can't handle their fraud.

125
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Second, if something similar happens,

126
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,560
the family members will be in front of you.

127
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,560
The Three-State Tavern can be closed anytime.

128
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Xiao Ping has already cleared the Three-State Tavern.

129
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,560
His ambition has already been revealed.

130
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,560
He was just threatening you in front of everyone.

131
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,560
If you don't control it, the consequences will be unimaginable.

132
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Sir, we can't let him in. Sir.

133
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
Please sit.

134
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
No surprise.

135
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,560
The Goshan has always been a strict rule.

136
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,560
This time, he didn't stop the troops from leaving the capital.

137
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,560
He only pulled out the Three-State Tavern and made a lot of trouble.

138
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,560
The Three-State Tavern has long been his eyes.

139
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
He's already out of this.

140
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,560
They can just take the opportunity to eliminate the obstacles for themselves.

141
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,560
For the people of Anfu, the Goshan must be punished.

142
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Although you can't learn the etiquette,

143
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,560
it's not enough to experience it.

144
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
It's my fault.

145
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
There's no choice.

146
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
I...

147
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,560
I'm just a person who's a coward.

148
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Seeing you study so hard,

149
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
I don't dare to bother you.

150
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
You're here.

151
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,560
I saw some of these books.

152
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,560
I didn't notice you when I saw them.

153
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,560
Reading books can understand one's reason.

154
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,560
But when you encounter problems in real life,

155
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,560
you must experience it yourself to know.

156
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,560
Now, I have a good chance for you.

157
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
What chance?

158
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,560
I and the Three-State Tavern decided to let you be the leader of the Duzheng Temple.

159
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,560
I'm here to be the leader of the Duzheng Temple.

160
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,560
But I don't have any actual work experience.

161
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Duzheng Temple is such an important department.

162
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,560
I'm afraid I can't be promoted.

163
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
This is the recommendation of the Three-State Tavern.

164
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Their intention is to disobey the Goshan's order.

165
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,560
I'm willing to let them be the leader of the Goshan.

166
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,560
Let them assist you in your work.

167
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,560
The Three-State Tavern wants to take advantage of their official position.

168
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,560
But the Three-State Tavern is so important to you.

169
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,560
If you can't take this responsibility,

170
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,560
I'm afraid you can't follow their wishes.

171
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,560
Do you understand?

172
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
I understand, Uncle.

173
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
If I do well,

174
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,560
they will have no words to say or do nothing.

175
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
I'm the Zichuan family.

176
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
I can't be disobeyed by them.

177
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Uncle, don't worry.

178
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,560
I will study hard and do my best to do Duzheng Temple's work.

179
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Okay.

180
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
Take a rest.

181
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,560
I thought you wouldn't come to my house in person after marriage.

182
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
How is Si Yi Ling?

183
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
She's still in the rest room.

184
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
She's still in the rest room.

185
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,560
I heard you're going to Duzheng Temple's office tomorrow.

186
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
I'm here to see you.

187
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,560
I'm just trying to be smart.

188
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,560
I can't embarrass my family.

189
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,560
I've learned so much knowledge to wait for this day.

190
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Actually, I've been only on the ice before.

191
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
I'm really going to be on the ice.

192
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,560
I'm just being modest.

193
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
I'm just being modest.

194
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
I'm just being modest.

195
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
I'm just being modest.

196
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560
I'm just being modest.

197
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
I'm just being modest.

198
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,560
It seems that I'm going to be modest for a long time.

199
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
I'm going to be modest for a long time.

200
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,560
How about you not going out tonight?

201
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
Come with me.

202
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,560
Let's chat.

203
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,560
That's good.

204
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
Hurry up.

205
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Run!

206
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Run!

207
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
Who's that?

208
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Old man.

209
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Old man.

210
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Come on.

211
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
Don't worry.

212
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
His men have fled.

213
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,560
It seems you've also been different from the other besides the textures.

214
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Are they hurt because of this?

215
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
The cockles are the AH111.

216
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,060
Those with special blooduttles

217
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,560
so long ago aren't born yet,

218
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
right after they have been extremes.

219
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,360
Those snakes and snakes last night were actually the wounded.

220
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,320
Thank you for saving me.

221
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,840
I'll come here often.

222
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,040
I'll definitely repay you

223
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,640
if I have a chance in the future.

224
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,080
No need.

225
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,240
You can help me now.

226
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,680
Don't know what this word on the note means.

227
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,360
What does this mean?

228
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,080
I don't know either.

229
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,840
Miss, don't worry.

230
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,200
Why don't you come with me to the Fu Yan?

231
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,240
I'll ask our elder in the Long Clan.

232
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,560
He's got a lot of knowledge.

233
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,040
Maybe he'll know.

234
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Fu Yan?

235
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm here to ask the City Leader and Prince of Guangming

236
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,600
to go to the Fu Yan.

237
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,520
Okay.

238
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,760
I'll take care of it.

239
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay.

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,440
Let's go together.

241
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,880
Follow me.

242
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,120
Follow me,

243
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,600
come on.

244
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,880
Got a try.

245
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,400
So秘习

246
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,720
That鹅水 really is so boring.

247
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,840
Our family couldn't find the water.

248
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,280
Now we have learned the technique of opening the source of the source.

249
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,840
We can find the underground river and dig the water well.

250
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,400
We can also do it ourselves.

251
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,640
Everyone, learning this technique

252
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,880
is really a great thing.

253
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,360
I'm looking forward to

254
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,160
taking this opportunity to promote the source of the source.

255
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,760
Let the people of our Yuan State

256
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,600
drink clean water.

257
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,360
Great!

258
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,760
Come.

259
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,800
Thank you, Princess Xia, for coming to Kang Kai.

260
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,160
To bless Yuan State.

261
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,800
You should really thank the King of Light.

262
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,600
He is the one who really saved Yuan State.

263
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,280
Thank you, King of Light.

264
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,600
Long live the King of Light!

265
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,320
Come.

266
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,720
Be careful.

267
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,920
Sit.

268
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,520
Come.

269
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,960
Sit.

270
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,920
This is the King of Light.

271
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,560
Come.

272
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,480
This is the King of Light.

273
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,880
Come.

274
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,160
Come.

275
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,560
Come.

276
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,040
Miss Lin Yu,

277
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,320
we are late.

278
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,000
The banquet has begun.

279
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,400
I think we should sit down.

280
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,800
I'll take you to her later.

281
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,640
Come.

282
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,080
Come.

283
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,360
I just saw a familiar voice.

284
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,520
Why did you take off your mask?

285
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,480
I...

286
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,000
You...

287
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,560
Zhao Ah San.

288
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,520
Miss Lin Yu, why are you here?

289
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,440
Oh, I came on the way from Yuan State

290
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,080
to save the Long Clan's envoy.

291
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,560
I came here to protect her.

292
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,760
Why are you here?

293
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,920
Oh, I'm the general of the King of Light.

294
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,040
You are the King of Light?

295
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,480
My Lord.

296
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,760
I forgot to introduce you.

297
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,320
This is Mr. Bai Chuan.

298
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,560
I'm the general of the King of Light.

299
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,680
May I ask

300
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,240
where the King of Light is?

301
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,800
Can you help me to see him?

302
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,040
Yes.

303
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,080
Where is the King of Light?

304
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,960
You want to see the King of Light?

305
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,840
Yes.

306
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,280
I've heard a lot of things about the King of Light.

307
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,160
I really want to see him.

308
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,320
What a coincidence.

309
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,720
What a coincidence.

310
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,880
I'm going to send something to the King of Light.

311
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,280
Follow me.

312
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,960
Please wait a moment.

313
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,840
I'll inform the King of Light.

314
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,120
Okay.

315
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,080
How dare you!

316
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,520
How dare you!

317
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
Hurry up.

318
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
This...

319
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Tao.

320
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,160
Didn't you go to the banquet?

321
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Hurry up.

322
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,560
I'm going to the banquet.

323
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm going to the banquet.

324
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,520
Put it on.

325
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Hurry up.

326
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,680
A woman.

327
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,880
She's still a wretch.

328
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,400
Just like you.

329
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,560
I'm Lin Yu.

330
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,960
Greetings, King of Light.

331
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,440
Su Su.

332
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,360
Please.

333
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,800
I'll check for you.

334
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,440
I will detail it.

335
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,040
Sir.

336
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,280
Greetings, King.

337
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,360
It's fine.

338
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,240
I got this probability of reaching out to you as sw dalong.

339
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,080
Response?

340
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,520
You get it.

341
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,200
Sir.

342
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,400
Prince of Light.

343
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,080
What you said just now

344
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,160
was the nicest part of the city.

345
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,840
The answer is to distract you

346
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,520
and you are from the General's order.

347
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,200
Do you have any plan to destroy Zhang An Cic's army?

348
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,120
I don't think it's suitable for the song dance.

349
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,640
I didn't expect that Zhang A-san, who loves to watch the song dance the most,

350
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,040
would be so popular now.

351
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,440
Lord Guangming, I think that Zhang A-san is right.

352
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,920
I'm very moved.

353
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
I have a suggestion.

354
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,120
I should give the Alliance Army some practical advice.

355
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,240
I'll add the army to the song dance.

356
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,840
I'll encourage you.

357
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,160
That's a good suggestion.

358
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,280
I'll decide that I'll add the army to the song dance.

359
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,520
No, no, no.

360
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,440
My lord, the army has its own rules and regulations.

361
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,560
If you insist on doing that,

362
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,760
it will ruin the rule.

363
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,080
Lord Guangming is indeed very angry.

364
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,440
In this way, the army will be more powerful

365
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,120
and will be invincible.

366
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,240
Zhang A-san, hurry and write a report to Zhang Tie.

367
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,960
Zhang A-san, how can you drag Lord Guangming's back leg?

368
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,360
Lord Guangming is a wise man who is good at using his power.

369
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,920
I'm proud of Lord Guangming.

370
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,920
This beautiful lady,

371
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,320
I wonder how she knows us.

372
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,400
It's a long story.

373
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,960
My lord, Miss Lin Yu has something to report.

374
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,720
Why don't you listen to her first?

375
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,040
Okay.

376
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,600
Yes.

377
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,560
This time, I saw the Serpent Clan's merchants

378
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,360
killing the Long Clan's noble clan from afar.

379
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,800
They were so cruel that they only took the Long foot.

380
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,160
I also saved many people from the ambush.

381
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,520
I came here on my way to escort them.

382
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,720
I've known many people from the past.

383
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,920
For many years, the Long Clan has been kidnapped and enslaved by the Serpent Clan.

384
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,400
It's precisely to force the Long Clan's noble clan to leave

385
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,760
and to sell the food to the North Clan to gain profits.

386
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,440
They've always known that the Serpent Clan and the Long Clan are not compatible.

387
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,640
I didn't expect that there would be such a relationship in this place.

388
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,320
They are all from Yuan State.

389
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,040
They are actually so cruel and cruel.

390
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,080
They are so evil and they are so evil.

391
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,520
Lord Guangming, we must dry them up.

392
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,640
Right?

393
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,920
You're right.

394
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,200
Jia Lai is a drug factory in the various forms.

395
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,560
Before Lord Guangming returned to the capital, he was a major business partner.

396
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,360
Now that he's in Jia Lai, there should be many more of the Long Clan's noble clan trapped.

397
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,360
That's true.

398
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,000
When Lai Duo heard it in person,

399
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,200
their purpose was to get into Jia Lai.

400
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,160
It was just that this time, they were so close to Lord Guangming's banquet.

401
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,760
They came to look for the secret.

402
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,240
They couldn't easily enter the city.

403
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,720
So, Dong Hui was unable to enter the city either.

404
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,460
They still couldn'tή

405
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,260
go to stay with the people.

406
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,640
They wouldn't attend either.

407
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,120
The이랑es of the Brotherhood of Senior in Jiangsu

408
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,320
could know them.

409
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,040
But they are decided to go.

410
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,540
The people of Transit are allBthe Who,

411
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,100
and how those who boundary the prefecture toarti

412
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,080
could even put themselves on Retreat.

413
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,640
You don't have to be children of ministry.

414
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,880
I will put transposition over the line of量.

415
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,040
Forget them!

416
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,840
The Emperor Ogeng

417
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,740
Your Highness

418
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,440
Official necessarily

419
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,580
You will see clearly about the requirements to drive out Colin

420
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,600
Hope you should go

421
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,040
I'll see you when I finish the work.

422
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
Work is to be paid in a timely manner.

423
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,040
When will the injured military family

424
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
get the talisman?

425
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,040
We must be very careful.

426
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,040
We must still have to take care of Lord Longminghai.

427
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Okay.

428
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Lord.

429
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Lord.

430
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
My friend.

431
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Mr. Xiao.

432
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Lord.

433
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,040
You know that I came to see you

434
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,040
after I walked down the street.

435
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,040
The members of the three-story platform

436
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,040
have become the old people of the street.

437
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Yes.

438
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,040
The case of the refugees hasn't been released yet.

439
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,040
The case needs time from the beginning to the end.

440
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,040
Mr. Xiao is also in it.

441
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
We shouldn't be so suspicious.

442
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,040
There are some policies that need to be implemented.

443
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
If you have time to fight with me,

444
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,040
why don't you return to the capital and sign the documents?

445
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,040
To appease the people.

446
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,040
This is the real problem for Lord.

447
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Lord is fine.

448
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
I'll be at ease next time.

449
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Goodbye.

450
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
What's going on?

451
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,040
You didn't give the documents in time.

452
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
I also passed the order.

453
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,040
As long as Du Zhengsi gives the documents,

454
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Li Bingzi will immediately sign it.

455
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
But...

456
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
What's this?

457
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
I didn't get the documents after the first morning.

458
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Go and urge him.

459
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Yes.

460
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Your Highness.

461
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Why hasn't the talisman been submitted yet?

462
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
I have to ask for your help.

463
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,040
I think this is not the best solution.

464
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Apart from the refugees,

465
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,040
there are many local residents in the city.

466
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Many military figures of the Dishu Army have been selected.

467
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,040
The soldiers of the royal family need the talisman.

468
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,040
The soldiers of the King of Shang also need money to save them.

469
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Shouldn't we find a way to solve it?

470
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,040
The current situation must be at a high level.

471
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
There can't be a solution to solve it.

472
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
If the talisman can't be released as soon as possible,

473
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
there will be more conflicts.

474
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
And every conflict behind it

475
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
is done by our Du Zhengsi.

476
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
If we send the talisman first,

477
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,040
the soldiers of the King of Shang will have no money to save them.

478
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
We should save the people who have already died.

479
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Shouldn't we save the people who are alive?

480
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Your Highness, this is a matter of calculation.

481
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Do you know how many people need to be accompanied

482
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
by a scar?

483
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,040
One or two people at a time.

484
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
In other words, these companions

485
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
can't join the group of refugees.

486
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
So the most fierce thing is

487
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,040
the military figures of the royal family.

488
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Every soldier has a family behind them.

489
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,040
The men and women are all outside.

490
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Even if the Dishu Army has great abilities,

491
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,040
it can only hold a lifetime.

492
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Your Highness, you are right.

493
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,040
But we can solve the problem first.

494
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,040
You are not a member of the royal family.

495
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
I understand.

496
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
I will sign it immediately.

497
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,040
I will personally send it to Lord Luo.

498
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,040
Your Highness, please understand my way of doing things.

499
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,040
I can understand.

500
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,040
This is the duty of Du Zhengsi.

501
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,040
I am just a little sad.

502
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,040
I saw those who were lying on the bed.

503
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,040
But I can't do anything.

504
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,040
The future is still very long.

505
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Your Excellency, the Dismissed Team of the Dismissed Team

506
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
is much better than the previous time.

507
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
They are coming to the military manor.

508
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Didn't Du Zhengsi already hand over the documents

509
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
to Lingbing Temple?

510
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,040
Why are there still some emergency?

511
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,040
Jin Na's military manor is here.

512
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,040
It's not easy to get rid of it.

513
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,040
的话,

514
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,040
we can wait here.

515
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,040
We will wait for the political events alongside the guards.

516
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Brother, why do you want to go with me?

517
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
Go back and rest.

518
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
I know you so well.

519
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
I know what you want to do.

520
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
I know what you want to say.

521
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Brother, they are not enemies.

522
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Many of them are military men.

523
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
But the case of the West is long gone.

524
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Those people are far away.

525
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
They have a normal life in the Zifan.

526
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Even if they are military men,

527
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
I have to kill them.

528
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Then why do they do this?

529
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,040
No matter if they are themselves or their family,

530
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
they have always protected the country.

531
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
But their days now are better than

532
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
the days of the war.

533
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Is it wrong to say a word for yourself?

534
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,040
Is it right to say a word and kill the whole world?

535
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Fine.

536
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
I will listen to you this time.

537
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
Pass the order.

538
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
Take care of the people.

539
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Don't hurt them.

540
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
Yes.

541
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
My lord.

542
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,040
Now the situation is better than

543
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
the situation.

544
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,040
We can't solve the problem

545
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
because we are under the pressure of the enemy.

546
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Now the people need to make up for it.

547
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
And the position of the new leader.

548
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,040
I have heard about Xu Nobo in the history.

549
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
So you are not the best candidate

550
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
to face this.

551
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
Stop.

552
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
My lord.

553
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
I think it's not right.

554
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,040
These people are refugees from far away.

555
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,040
Old soldiers and injured families

556
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,040
and people who were killed.

557
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,040
They are not punished by the king.

558
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,040
If there is any meaning,

559
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
I will kill them.

560
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
I will kill them.

561
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,040
If there is any accident,

562
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,040
My lord.

563
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
I will accompany you to

564
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
escape the prince's safety.

565
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Besides,

566
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Diling and the lord of the fourth lord are here.

567
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
There will be no accident.

568
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
You are right.

569
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
The so-called judgment

570
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,040
can't be settled.

571
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,040
I have a family to take the justice.

572
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
I am sure

573
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
I will go to comfort him.

574
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
My lord.

575
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
My lord.

576
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Why?

577
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,040
If I am to be killed,

578
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
I will be dead.

579
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
But if the prince is to be killed,

580
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
I will be killed.

581
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
My lord.

582
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,040
I have been a member of Zichuan for many years.

583
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
I am sorry.

584
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,040
I have not done anything to the family for many years.

585
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
But I have to do it.

586
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
I can do it.

587
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
I can do it.

588
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
I can do it.

589
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
I can do it.

590
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
I can do it.

591
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
I can do it because I can have no problem.

592
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
I can do it because of the family's affection.

593
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Now is the time to

594
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
let me do some things for the sake of justice.

595
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
If I don't go out,

596
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
then I don't deserve Zichuan's successor.

597
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
I don't deserve his own surname.

598
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
Please allow Zichuan

599
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,040
to be a good man and calm and clear and clear.

600
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
I can't.

601
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,040
I thought I was capable to protect you.

602
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,040
I won't let you do anything to disturb me before I save you.

603
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,040
I'm just a useless person.

604
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Uncle.

605
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Uncle.

606
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,040
This is Xiao Ning's responsibility.

607
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Ning'er.

608
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Get up.

609
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,040
I'll go.

610
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Ma Wei.

611
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
My lord.

612
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,040
I've given Xiao Ning to you.

613
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Lord, I won't let you suffer.

614
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Wait a minute.

615
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
I know you're nervous.

616
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,040
But don't be afraid.

617
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
I'll take care of it.

618
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
My lord.

619
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,040
I'm afraid you're worried about something.

620
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,040
I've written it down.

621
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
Look.

622
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
Don't worry about it.

623
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
I'm relieved.

624
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Thank you.

625
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,040
How can I let you be so prepared?

626
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Let's see how you'll do.

627
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
My lord.

628
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
I'll do it.

629
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Let them see how you'll do.

630
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,040
Come out.

631
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
My lord, give me a hand.

632
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Come on.

633
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Give me a hand.

634
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Give me a hand.

635
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,040
Come on.

636
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Come on.

637
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Come on.

638
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Everyone, calm down.

639
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
The heir of the Zichuan family.

640
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,040
Zichuan Ning wants to tell you something.

641
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
You're a coward.

642
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
You sent out such a yellow-haired tyrant to fool us.

643
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
Yes.

644
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Everyone, calm down.

645
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,040
I can understand your feelings.

646
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,040
But...

647
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Go on.

648
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
We need to see the commander.

649
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,040
Let him tell us.

650
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
My lord.

651
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
I'm afraid the commander will be afraid tomorrow.

652
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Wait.

653
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Let the people see the sincerity of the family.

654
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Otherwise, it won't be easy to calm down.

655
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
I'm afraid it's hard to get a hold of Ning this time.

656
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
But he must be careful.

657
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,040
But will it be too early for the future?

658
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,040
I'm the heir of the Zichuan family.

659
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
We don't listen.

660
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
We need to see the commander.

661
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
I understand.

662
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,040
Why did you jump off the tree?

663
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
I'm not.

664
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
How do you know how painful it is?

665
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,040
The best way to be with your family is to try it yourself.

666
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
By the way, Ning.

667
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Now I'm with you.

668
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
Do you feel better?

669
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,040
Brother Xiu, you're a fool.

670
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
You've got the title of the Zichuan family.

671
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Who will be my home?

672
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
How about this?

673
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,040
You hurt your left foot.

674
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,040
I hurt my right foot.

675
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
We'll serve each other.

676
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,040
We'll do the same.

677
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
What do you think?

678
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
I know.

679
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
You just don't want to carry me.

680
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,040
That's why you hurt your left foot.

681
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
Don't run!

682
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Don't run!

683
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
Don't run!

684
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Don't run!

685
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Don't run!

686
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Don't run!

687
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Don't run!

688
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Don't run!

689
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,040
Ruin!

690
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,040
Don't run!

691
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Don't run!

692
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,040
You all leave.

693
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,360
Back off!

694
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,520
To my villi,

695
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,280
there's always anatoly and warlords limit,

696
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
and guards of the bows.

697
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,960
I know that you have many family members and friends

698
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,960
who sacrificed their lives to protect Zi Chuan.

699
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,960
And you also left your parents behind.

700
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,960
I deeply understand your feelings.

701
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,960
I also feel deeply ashamed.

702
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,960
This is the order of our family.

703
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,960
We didn't protect everyone.

704
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Hereby, please allow me to use Zi Chuan's future to inherit the status

705
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,960
to apologize to you all.

706
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
I'm sorry.

707
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,960
But please believe that you lost your family member in Yuan Zhou.

708
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
You were killed by Tong Yujue,

709
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,960
and the military commander and I were also killed by the same caravan.

710
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Because you were one of us.

711
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,960
We were easily destroyed.

712
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,960
But Zi Chuan is not only in Yuan Zhou's place,

713
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,960
but also in order to make Zi Chuan's people stand on fire.

714
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,960
In order to make our family's reputation better.

715
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,960
We have to make Yuan Zhou suffer.

716
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,960
We have to make you suffer.

717
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,960
At this moment,

718
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,960
we are all experiencing the most difficult and darkest moments.

719
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,960
But please believe that the pain and pain of this darkness is temporary.

720
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,960
The military commander has promised you all.

721
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,960
I will promise you all again.

722
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,960
I will do my best to make you all pay for it.

723
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,960
I will also do my best to protect Zi Chuan.

724
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,960
I will never let you suffer again.

725
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,960
The people of the family, your enemies are never Zi Chuan.

726
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,960
They are the ones who took our family members away.

727
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,960
They are the rebels on the water and the soldiers.

728
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,960
They are the rebels who took our family members away.

729
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,960
Zi Chuan has only become stronger now.

730
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,960
We can only take back our family members.

731
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,960
We can only live a peaceful and stable life.

732
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,960
We have to make those outsiders see clearly that we are not that easy to bully.

733
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,960
So what we have to do now is to fight against the enemy.

734
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Fight against the enemy.

735
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,960
Fight against the enemy.

736
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,960
Fight against the enemy.

737
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,960
Fight against the enemy.

738
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,960
I didn't expect that Xiao Ning has the power to balance herself.

739
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Xiao Ning has grown up.

740
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
What's the difference?

741
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,960
Xiao Ning is more stable and calm in her little white rabbit.

742
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,960
But her way of doing it is really simple.

743
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,960
She pushed Mao Du to the bottom of her body.

744
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,960
It seems that we have to change our attitude to look after Xiao Ning.

745
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
We are united!

746
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:29,960
We are united!

747
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:36,960
I will definitely help you to ensure that the imperial army is safe and sound.

748
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:44,960
And I will withdraw some military fees to help you to be together.

749
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,960
Everyone, I will also withdraw some military fees to help the family and the whole country.

750
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:59,960
We are united!

751
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Xiao Ning has grown up.

752
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,960
I underestimated you.

753
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,960
I was worried that you would be too much.

754
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Now that we are in your power, you can only face the enemy.

755
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Uncle is very happy.

756
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Thanks to your usual teaching and the support of Lord Ma Wei.

757
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,960
Diling and Si Yilin also announced that they will withdraw the money and pay the price.

758
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,960
That's why they have settled the refugees.

759
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,960
But you are in a state of great relief.

760
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,960
The imperial army is so good at reading and writing.

761
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
There are many things to do.

762
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,960
As long as we really do our best to solve the problem for the family,

763
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
it's not important.

764
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
Yes.

765
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,960
Uncle, if there is nothing else, I will go back first.

766
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
Du Zhengci has a lot of work to do.

767
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Okay.

768
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
I will take my leave then.

769
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Okay.

770
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
Do you want to buy flowers?

771
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
Do you want to buy flowers?

772
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
I want all these.

773
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,960
Thank you.

774
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Your Highness, this is for you.

775
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
Congratulations.

776
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
You have fought against yourself in front of everyone.

777
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
You also proved yourself.

778
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Thank you.

779
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,960
I also think that

780
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,960
you are different from others.

781
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,960
My Lord, according to your instructions,

782
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
the refugees have been settled.

783
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,960
But I still have to fix it.

784
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,960
This is the budget and the deposit I got from Du Zhengci.

785
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
The entry is very big.

786
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,960
I suspect that there must be a corruption.

787
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,960
But we can't find anything on the account, right?

788
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
It's because all those key characters are dead.

789
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,960
We can't find anything.

790
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,960
I want to push this thing to the stage

791
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,960
and push the black hand behind the screen

792
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,960
to solve the problem of the cloud repair.

793
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,960
But the old fox in Sanshengtai

794
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,960
pushed the problem back to us.

795
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,960
It seems that I thought things too simple.

796
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
My Lord, what should we do now?

797
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,960
Connect.

798
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
I never drink with Luo Minghai.

799
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
It's impossible for me to drink with you.

800
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,960
I know.

801
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
But I have a request for you.

802
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,960
This is a gift.

803
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,960
You want me to kill the person who is like a horse.

804
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,960
Do you think I will agree to you?

805
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
The corruption is serious now.

806
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
The people's affairs are in a mess.

807
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,960
No one dares to investigate Sanshengtai.

808
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,960
If I cooperate with Sanshengtai,

809
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,960
you will be in trouble.

810
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,960
My Lord,

811
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,960
I believe that you are the general manager of the military division.

812
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
You will never do that.

813
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,960
If you do this case,

814
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,960
the division will be in a mess.

815
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
We are old friends.

816
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
But we know each other very well.

817
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
That's right.

818
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,960
So you should know that I never get to the top.

819
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,960
As long as you find out who is behind the black hand,

820
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,960
all the creditors are yours.

821
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,960
If you can't do it,

822
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,960
you will be in trouble if you offend Sanshengtai.

823
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,960
If you can't do it,

824
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,960
the division will be in a mess.

825
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,960
Run.

826
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
I agree to cooperate with you.

827
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,960
But all the evidence you found in the division

828
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
must be shared with the commander.

829
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
No problem.

830
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,960
I know that you will never do anything.

831
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,960
I won't take the wine.

832
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,960
Then just stay here.

833
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,960
I believe that one day,

834
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,960
Lord Luo will drink with me.

835
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,820
Airmir watching

836
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,740
Lut 나라

837
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,940
What?

838
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:38,660
Is it the karma that killed me to equator.

839
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,040
yes

840
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,900
A victory

841
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,440
Only nothing

842
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,960
No such thing

843
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,660
That kind of barbecue

844
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,260
It's noisy

845
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,000
Your spiral

846
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,660
It's still a good shot

847
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,660
But

848
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,280
Why so thin

849
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,040
Come on

850
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,240
I say you

851
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,740
The

852
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,620
It's Dziękuję

853
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,160
Just be careful of the cake

854
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,720
Don't make any circles

855
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,320
Fill up your mouth

856
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,880
And my clothes

857
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,260
Add newamız

858
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,840
I always go far away

859
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,840
As the story is waiting for you

860
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,360
When I come ashore

861
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,180
Forget it

862
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,000
Rule

863
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,380
Crazy

864
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,640
Only time

865
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,400
people don't watch

866
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,560
experience

867
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,280
Then, you have something to say.

868
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,780
You've been waiting for me?

869
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,120
Please talk to me.

870
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,540
How much is your optimization for performance in the premier?

871
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,020
Is there a purposely able situation?

872
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,020
You're just looking at the screen.

873
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,560
Amidst this,

874
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,300
When can an antenna be seen?

875
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,100
This question

876
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,780
I understood

877
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,860
I asked

878
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,060
Sorry
