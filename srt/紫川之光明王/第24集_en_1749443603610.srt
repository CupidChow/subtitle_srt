1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,980
Another Left Behind

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,980
Episode 22

3
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,760
The flame burning in the sky

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,080
Night in the dark

5
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,080
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,080
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,080
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,080
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
I'm not afraid of you.

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,080
I'm not afraid of you.

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,080
I'm not afraid of you.

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,080
I'm not afraid of you.

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,080
Are you sure about that?

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,080
I'm not afraid of you.

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,080
I'm not afraid of you.

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,080
I can shake you.

27
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
I'm not afraid of you.

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,080
I'm not afraid of you.

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,080
I'm not afraid of you.

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,080
I'm not afraid of you.

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,080
I'm not afraid of you.

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
The Liyu Clan is not in the right place.

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,080
They must be in a hurry to occupy this place.

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,080
The order is to advance all the way.

35
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Lord Guangming, I know I'm not welcomed.

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
So I must make a clear stand for you.

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,080
I can help you to defeat the Liyu Clan and take the Pai Yi.

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Okay.

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Really?

40
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Let me think about it.

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
What's your plan?

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,080
I used to be afraid of the Liyu Clan.

43
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,080
When I was fighting against you, most of my soldiers fell out.

44
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,080
Now there are only less than 3,000 people in the city.

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Most of them are my subordinates.

46
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
If you send me to the front,

47
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,080
I will definitely convince them to obey my orders.

48
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
Really?

49
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
I will do it myself.

50
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Damn it.

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
I'm tired of entering this door.

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,080
The outside is all people who want to kill Lu Ji.

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,080
The outside is all people who want to kill Lu Ji.

54
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Head, something happened.

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,080
The Russian army has entered the far zone.

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,080
We found that they are moving towards the Pai Yi.

57
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
To the Pai Yi?

58
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Yes.

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,080
Bai Chun, how far is the Pai Yi city from here?

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
230 miles.

61
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
If you have a chance,

62
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
you can arrive at the city at 5 o'clock.

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
I will prepare it right now.

64
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
I will listen to your orders.

65
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Head.

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
3 4.

67
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Go to the army.

68
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Yes.

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Bai Chun.

70
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
I will take the cavalry and the embroidered camp with me.

71
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
We will leave first.

72
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
You go to the Pai Yi city and ask for reinforcements.

73
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,080
Remember, you must return to the Pai Yi city before the Russian army.

74
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Yes.

75
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
My lord.

76
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
Be careful.

77
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
I didn't expect you to care about me so much.

78
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
I'm afraid that you won't pay me back.

79
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
Do you believe me?

80
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
I can only bet on one.

81
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
So, it's all up to you.

82
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,080
If you can't arrive at the city at time,

83
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
what if something happens to me?

84
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
Maybe,

85
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,080
I will be added to the Russian army by my lord.

86
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
Then I can finally go to the hospital.

87
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
I will go to the hospital.

88
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Yes.

89
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
Go.

90
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Pai City.

91
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
I'm back.

92
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
My lord.

93
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
I'm ready.

94
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
The Russian army will arrive at any time.

95
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,080
If you don't come out,

96
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,080
I will be added to the army by you.

97
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,080
I will be gone.

98
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Then I can finally defeat you.

99
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Don't think about yourself so important.

100
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Even if I add the force in the 800,

101
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
and send your head to Shen Hua,

102
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
I will still be the same as you.

103
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
You are right.

104
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Who do you think you are?

105
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Except you,

106
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
who else can you be?

107
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
The king is the king of the world.

108
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
The king is the king of the world.

109
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
The king is the king of the world.

110
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Okay.

111
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
Go.

112
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
Hurry up.

113
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
Hurry up.

114
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
Hurry up.

115
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Hurry up.

116
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
Hurry up.

117
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,080
The king is ready to take the position

118
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,080
but the Russian army is approaching the position.

119
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
They are both in the army.

120
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Please lead them to the district.

121
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
Hulan,

122
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Yes.

123
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
Tell them to prepare to set off.

124
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
Yes.

125
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Let's check the fastest route.

126
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,440
To your right.

127
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,240
Climb to the peak,

128
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,720
and then take off the首先 in the Blood Marking.

129
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,040
Sir, north capital troops are arriving.

130
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,600
How far is it?

131
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,800
To 20 mm more.

132
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,080
How about the Shim什么?

133
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,080
There's at least 100.

134
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,720
I can't give up the Pai Yi.

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Head, don't blame me for being blind.

136
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,200
If this Lu Di is a bastard,

137
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,080
he will kill us here.

138
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,720
Quan Tao?

139
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,840
You want to take over my Quan Tao?

140
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,680
My lord, I'd rather stay here for you.

141
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,720
Even if the army retreats,

142
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,320
I will keep this place.

143
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,680
My lord, the Lu Si army is not strong enough.

144
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,640
I order the army to retreat.

145
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,800
Retreat all the way.

146
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,200
I will keep this place.

147
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,440
My lord.

148
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,600
Don't say anything.

149
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,240
Lu Di.

150
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,080
Wait, we don't have school to see,

151
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,840
how can we travel or not?

152
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,080
Their arrival is so organize.

153
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
I'll ask Lu shit first.

154
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,320
Can you take a group photo with me?

155
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,800
I can't.

156
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,280
Lord Bo is still alive.

157
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,080
How can I die in front of you?

158
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,320
I, Lu Di,

159
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,040
will take the lead of the Pai Yi General.

160
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,680
I will put the Pai Yi

161
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,520
to the King of Guangming.

162
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,800
From now on,

163
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,000
I will set the Pai Yi whole

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,280
and put the King of Guangming

165
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,160
in the Manchu of Guangming

166
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,000
and the Pai Clan.

167
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,720
Lord Bo,

168
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,600
today,

169
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,960
we won't just take the Pai Yi

170
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,600
but also put the Pai Yi

171
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,640
on the whole of Yuan Zhou.

172
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,640
Today,

173
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,680
we will make a match

174
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,040
for the whole Yuan Zhou.

175
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
I want to know

176
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
whether the head of the Pai Yi

177
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,200
or not,

178
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,400
the general of the Pai Yi City...

179
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,600
From today on,

180
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,800
all the general of the Pai Yi City

181
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,400
will be re-arranged.

182
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,000
When Bai Chuan comes back,

183
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,720
we will take the food

184
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,520
of the Pai Yi Army

185
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,280
and eat the food together.

186
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,280
Lord Bo,

187
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,920
I really don't want to break your cold water.

188
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,800
Have you forgotten

189
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,080
that there are tens of thousands of

190
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,920
Luo Si Army groups

191
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,720
in the Pai Yi City?

192
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,240
You...

193
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,920
Do you know why

194
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,760
I don't like

195
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,920
the fact

196
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,960
that I'm the least like you?

197
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,520
No.

198
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,120
Bai Chuan is the least like you.

199
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,560
But he's not here.

200
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,080
I told him about his Pai Ci.

201
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,920
Where is he?

202
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,440
There's no reason.

203
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,800
Lord Bo,

204
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,720
our night is coming.

205
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,920
I'm afraid

206
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,040
we can't eat well.

207
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,680
No.

208
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,640
We can't stop.

209
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,080
Pass the order.

210
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,800
The county people don't have to go first.

211
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,160
We'll take care of the horses.

212
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,080
Yes.

213
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,600
The food in Pai Yi City

214
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,280
will last for long.

215
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,680
I think

216
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,520
Luo Si will not give us a chance.

217
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,080
I'll take care of the rest.

218
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,240
I'll fight for it.

219
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,320
I'll go prepare the kitchen now.

220
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,600
I've thought of a way.

221
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
I want to

222
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
negotiate with them.

223
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,160
How dare you

224
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
steal the new skill of Lord Bo?

225
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,880
You're afraid of Pai Yi?

226
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,200
Lord Bo,

227
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm sorry that I'm a traitor.

228
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,280
I'll take Pai Yi out of here.

229
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
We must take care of him.

230
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,760
Are you ready?

231
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,920
Go.

232
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,080
Lord Bo, wait.

233
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,400
Look at this.

234
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,640
Where did it come from?

235
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,120
There are many old steps in Pai Yi.

236
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,520
They don't want to make a move.

237
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,280
After we sent them,

238
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,520
they went to check the situation

239
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,360
and found out that

240
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,760
they used the order of the north tribe

241
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,720
to set up a sword board

242
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,400
and send the message.

243
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,640
They tied the road

244
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,040
and returned to the north tribe?

245
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,960
Yes.

246
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,080
Send a group of soldiers to harass the north tribe.

247
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,560
Take the message.

248
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,240
Today, at this time,

249
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,600
they leave the city.

250
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,800
I'll take them out of the city.

251
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Is it a trap?

252
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,600
Do you want to be prepared?

253
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,960
What I'm most afraid of

254
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,800
is to face the enemy.

255
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,400
Lord Bo, here you are.

256
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,400
Lord Bo, long time no see.

257
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,240
Brother Lu, you traitor.

258
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,880
You don't deserve to call my name.

259
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,680
You're going to kill me.

260
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,320
Wait.

261
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,040
It's useless to kill me.

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,880
You have more important mission.

263
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,240
What are you talking about?

264
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,960
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

265
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

266
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

267
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

268
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

269
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

270
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

271
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

272
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

273
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

274
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

275
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

276
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

277
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

278
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

279
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

280
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

281
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

282
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Lord Bo, I want to see you.

283
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Lord Bo, I admire your bravery.

284
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,280
But you lost.

285
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
No.

286
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
I lost if you came today.

287
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Well...

288
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,360
How dare you

289
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,520
drink with me?

290
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,520
Let me tell you

291
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,960
how you failed.

292
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,880
Take a break.

293
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,920
80 years ago,

294
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,280
in the Grand Hall of the White Dragon City,

295
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,240
all the soldiers of the Jialin Clan

296
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,720
killed the royal family of the Ye Clan.

297
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,040
Even the children

298
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,360
were shot to death.

299
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,840
Then, in the same place,

300
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,160
the Jialin Clan of the Jialin Clan of the Chou Chu Man Clan

301
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,520
was imprisoned.

302
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,880
They were killed by the living in the dungeon.

303
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,600
The Tear of the Thunder Clan of the Shenbao

304
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,640
was in a terrible state

305
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,120
and was killed in the battle

306
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,760
for three years.

307
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,120
Until the stronger tribe

308
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,920
came out to replace them.

309
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,560
What are you trying to say?

310
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,560
The so-called North Clan

311
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,160
is divided into twelve tribes.

312
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,920
You are the top five.

313
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,720
You are the most brutal and strong.

314
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,920
Shenbao or that Shenbao

315
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,520
is just a change according to the ruler.

316
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,640
It was called the Tear of the Thunder.

317
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,120
Now it's called the Dragon City.

318
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,680
Your Highness,

319
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,800
if you are here to teach me the history of the North Clan,

320
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,960
I know that you don't need to teach me.

321
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,280
The Tear of the Thunder

322
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,360
is the second largest tribe in the North Clan.

323
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,880
The strength can be completely affected by the Tear of the Thunder.

324
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,840
Why don't you

325
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,880
change the Tear of the Thunder

326
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,240
to the Tear of the Thunder

327
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,040
as the Tear of the Tear of the Thunder?

328
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
If you are here to teach me,

329
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
I tell you,

330
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,360
it's impossible.

331
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,560
I am loyal to the Tear of the Tear of the Thunder.

332
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,680
What about you?

333
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,720
He treats me like a brother.

334
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,000
He treats me like a brother?

335
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,400
Then why did he send you

336
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,200
to treat me in Yanzhou?

337
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,920
Because I am his trustee.

338
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,960
OK.

339
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,680
Really?

340
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,320
The Federation Cords in Yanzhou

341
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,560
spent only one year

342
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,400
to obtain the Garden of Yanzhou.

343
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,800
Do you know what approved by Lord Lu?

344
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,800
Even if it's approved by Lord Lu,

345
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,120
now you are very close to me.

346
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,280
Won't you

347
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,680
have a big loss

348
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,640
versus Ta Pza?

349
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,400
If I'm right,

350
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
the one who sent you to Yuan Zhou

351
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
must be Prince Kalan.

352
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,600
Now Prince Kaldun has lost a lot of things because of Ludi.

353
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,440
I'd like to ask you,

354
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,320
who will you betray next

355
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,320
to keep the second position of the Data Clan?

356
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
You're lying!

357
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,920
I didn't expect that

358
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,400
General Luo Si is so determined.

359
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,200
I'm really impressed.

360
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,520
Now you and I are both drinking and talking.

361
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,960
Not only can we soldiers see it,

362
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,640
I believe your north tribe's 100,000 generals

363
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,160
are already very strong.

364
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
You shameless disciple!

365
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,400
You're not a Data Clan.

366
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,360
I think we're

367
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,640
signing the alliance agreement now.

368
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,040
Ludi.

369
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
Then I'll kill you all today.

370
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,760
What are you talking about?

371
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,640
You're not even a Data Clan.

372
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,760
Wait.

373
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Don't be so impulsive.

374
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,640
My Lord.

375
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,440
I'm afraid that

376
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,040
we'll suddenly be able to get to 100,000 generals.

377
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,640
That's good, Prince Guangming.

378
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,080
You came to me today

379
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,280
to see me and the Emperor of the Gods

380
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,440
and to support the Nine Soldiers.

381
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,320
My Lord.

382
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,240
I'm afraid that

383
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,800
100,000 generals won't be able to defeat you.

384
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,520
But no matter if we can get to the agreement or not,

385
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,760
I'll break this rumor.

386
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,160
And this rumor

387
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,720
will soon spread to the Emperor of the Gods.

388
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,800
You're a fool!

389
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,040
Thank you.

390
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,000
But don't worry.

391
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,200
I'm not a person

392
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,200
who doesn't leave a trace to others.

393
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,960
If you insist on fighting with me,

394
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,560
I'll do my best

395
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,320
to fight with you.

396
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,000
Then the Emperor of the Gods will be in charge.

397
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,520
At that time, the Data Clan of the second tribe of the Northern Clan

398
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,600
will probably not exist.

399
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,640
How about you choose?

400
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,720
I'll take the opportunity to accompany you.

401
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,200
Prime Minister of the West,

402
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,120
I respect you as a hero.

403
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,400
So I'll give you two choices.

404
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,560
First, you sign this alliance letter

405
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,120
and make a promise to me.

406
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,720
Then we'll fight against Sai Yong.

407
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,400
Second, you withdraw with the whole army.

408
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,920
I'll represent tens of thousands of people in Yuanzhou

409
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,240
and swear with their lives.

410
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,480
I'll never chase them.

411
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,600
Your Majesty.

412
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,760
It's fine if you just carry them.

413
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,360
Just in case.

414
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,900
I won't remove these weapons.

415
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,100
Master.

416
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,160
лож Metro Project 5

417
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,840
Retreat the whole army!

418
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,560
Don't eat chicken legs.

419
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,040
Can you add it?

420
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,040
Can you stop being so fierce?

421
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,040
You take this thousand-patterned man

422
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,400
to confront the hundred thousand people of Luo Si.

423
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,640
But there are still you and the hundred thousand people of Buse.

424
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,720
But when you go to negotiate,

425
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,040
we haven't arrived yet.

426
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,120
You are already here.

427
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,160
What if we don't arrive?

428
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,480
Then I'll continue to play my role.

429
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,520
You don't think about your soldiers?

430
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,160
The war will always kill people.

431
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,280
Even if it doesn't,

432
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,600
people will die.

433
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,600
People's lives are as bad as grass.

434
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,160
They are just dying first.

435
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,480
Zichuan,

436
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,920
Yuanjun is not here.

437
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,680
Don't you have any doubts about me?

438
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,120
If I can't even trust you,

439
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
then who else

440
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,520
would trust me?

441
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,520
My lord,

442
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,280
my lord,

443
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,960
we have captured many places.

444
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,960
If I'm not mistaken,

445
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,040
their mission is to go to Fengye Danlin and Sai Rong City

446
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,240
to disperse the rumors about me and Prince Guang

447
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,960
signing the agreement.

448
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,600
Yes.

449
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,240
Prince Guang has a reason to divorce me and the emperor.

450
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,360
This is one of the things in the medical treatment.

451
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,840
I admire Prince Guang.

452
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,280
I didn't expect him to do everything.

453
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,720
Even fake news

454
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,520
will look alike true news.

455
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,340
My lord,

456
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,440
Prince Guang can ignore the case.

457
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,640
Even if I'm afraid ofINTERPOSINGation,

458
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,240
willwind of Sai Rong

459
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,640
Prince Guang's secret?

460
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,980
Another reason it's weird

461
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,480
to brag about this is

462
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,080
if they don't

463
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,960
tomorrow they are afraid of different

464
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,580
At that time.

465
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,980
A weak Da Tai Village.

466
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,320
government should be safe

467
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,720
Go

468
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,740
Understood

469
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Lord.

470
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Come, have some too.

471
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
It's really delicious.

472
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,960
The news from the public road in Yanzhou.

473
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,960
A Zichuan Group is on their way.

474
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
Do you remember the Yanzhou?

475
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
People are not talking.

476
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
People are not in a stable position.

477
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
You look at it now.

478
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Look at the Taoist temple.

479
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Look at the Taoist temple.

480
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
It's so heavy.

481
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
It seems that

482
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,960
it's been a long time since the war.

483
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,960
And the people are safe.

484
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,960
The road is not smooth.

485
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
The water is clean.

486
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
It's all clean.

487
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
It's hard to deal with.

488
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,960
So.

489
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Yanzhou is not in a bad position.

490
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
It's a Zichuan Group.

491
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,960
The mixes of wolf wealth and simple growths.

492
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
Your highness.

493
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,960
You are busy with your post-partum background.

494
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Go and don't go out to move there anymore.

495
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
The crystal tower will start to collapse.

496
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
It is no problem.

497
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,000
Just now Bro. Majo Ann sent a message.

498
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,220
I want to ask if you have the time to shoot a note together.

499
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,260
The great news was reported.

500
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:56,280
I know you are

501
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:02,460
going to take the Board of为什么 as your senior one.

502
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,600
This time I don't mind,

503
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,560
Since we have between us,

504
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,480
even if there is a princess wholair for his politically sailor,

505
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,340
there is a lady in both of us.

506
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,100
She is such a bigwoman.

507
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,960
Ever since you came here,

508
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,280
I have fallen for a woman in my heart.

509
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,200
She is a promotee

510
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,360
and her style.

511
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,080
She is self-sm unch Terry Yang.

512
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,440
If you are not willing,

513
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,320
I will go for them by myself.

514
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,240
If you don't want to,

515
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,800
will you use words to express it

516
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,400
or use actions to tell her?

517
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,760
Of course, it's the face to say it.

518
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,640
Cleanly and vigorously

519
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,480
don't give the other person the impression of leaving a comment.

520
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,040
Change my clothes for me.

521
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,040
Yes.

522
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,360
Ling'er, you're here.

523
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,800
Look.

524
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,800
People has made this orange-같ed-shaped sword for you.

525
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,360
With Japanese blades,

526
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,360
and removed the core of the Vute Object,

527
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,800
it's as stately as the body of the Pentagon sword,

528
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,200
and overwhelming a bit of internal energy.

529
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,260
But it's not effective.

530
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,980
It's more in attacking the enemy更容易命中獵物.

531
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,160
Try it.

532
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,280
Son of a bitch.

533
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,860
You try this.

534
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,680
Come on.

535
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
I'll teach you.

536
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
I...

537
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,240
I can do it myself.

538
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,480
Actually, I was too brave last time.

539
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,520
I was afraid I wouldn't have a chance.

540
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,840
But I didn't expect

541
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,520
that Shang Tian Ji Yuan gave me another chance.

542
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,440
From the moment I came out of prison,

543
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,240
I never knew what I wanted.

544
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,640
Ning Er, it's you.

545
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,440
I want you.

546
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,000
I was afraid I wouldn't have a chance to see you again.

547
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
You saved me.

548
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,520
I know you must know what I'm thinking.

549
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,520
I'm willing to do anything for you

550
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,800
other than thanks.

551
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,320
Lord Ma, we're...

552
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,760
We're the best god and goddesses

553
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,800
in the world.

554
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,040
You'll be the leader in the future.

555
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,440
I'll be the leader in the three realms.

556
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,720
The so-called Zichuan Sword will be solved one day.

557
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,760
And I'll be the greatest emperor

558
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,920
in the world.

559
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,120
And Zichuan will be the strongest Zichuan.

560
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,000
Ning Er, I'm serious.

561
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,120
Meng Xing Ji.

562
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,320
Lord Sze,

563
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,080
Prince Guangming has spread the rumors.

564
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,160
Please.

565
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,340
Master Jin.

566
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,820
Guest Shהu.

567
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,000
Through him,

568
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,880
the Emperor's 51 days have passed.

569
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,540
Yiling is the arrival of the 1st Commander.

570
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,100
your size and highiliation

571
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,960
which makes you eles

572
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,940
bloody

573
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,280
bey did today

574
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,920
may wait for you to enter i

575
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,620
thereby

576
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,260
I properly

577
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,860
I came to

578
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,420
You

579
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,320
didn't answer

580
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,540
From

581
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,540
I

582
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,120
mean

583
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,720
big brother

584
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,860
came here

585
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,280
to give high

586
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,260
and low

587
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,360
ynamic

588
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,560
just repeat after me.

589
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,760
Okay then.

590
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,040
I will go with you.

591
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,020
Nice

592
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,660
When are you coming back?

593
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,720
Go home

594
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,060
Here.

595
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,000
I want to go home, too.

596
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,740
Prince of Guang Ming has tested our inducements.

597
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,500
He escaped with his helmet down.

598
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,460
Your Highness.

599
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,700
Soldiers turned Lolong to get us byuking before he was sent here.

600
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,900
Prince of Guang Ming kicks the and mode at us

601
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,520
with his valiant moves.

602
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
Which drew theirstanding out.

603
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,640
At face of luo shi's boots checking

604
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,720
that the ser volunteers retired and took Yuan Zhou off.

605
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,720
No one has ever seen such a real face.

606
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,720
I really can't believe that there is really a person

607
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,720
who can fight against me on the West Chuan Road.

608
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,720
Do you think this is something that makes me happy?

609
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,720
This Prince of Light is indeed not simple.

610
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Have you seen his face on the back?

611
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
I have.

612
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Who is he?

613
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
I don't know.

614
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
But...

615
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
What?

616
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,720
He is very good at fighting.

617
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,720
The whole West Chuan Road

618
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,720
can let you tell the truth about the Dark Lord.

619
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
There are a few people who can tell the truth.

620
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,720
You lost your son to him.

621
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,720
This time, you and I are in a good relationship.

622
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,720
I don't care if he can work with you.

623
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,720
But from now on,

624
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,720
you and I will be in the same boat.

625
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,720
The Data Clan is the second largest tribe of our north.

626
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,720
This means that the disaster of the north will come.

627
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
The disaster will come.

628
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,720
The Luo Si has never been able to recover.

629
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,720
He will definitely recover.

630
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,720
The Prince of Light has only added a fire.

631
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,720
The entire West Chuan Road is about to change.

632
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
This boring life

633
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,720
is finally going to end.

634
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Father is in the top.

635
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,720
I have returned to the south city

636
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,720
to protect Liu Feng and Zichuan's border.

637
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,720
Please rest assured.

638
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
It's just that the land is far away.

639
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,720
Now the Prince of Light is in danger.

640
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
The situation is very bad.

641
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,720
We will have to surpass Zichuan in a few days.

642
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,720
Although Liu Feng is not in a good relationship with Zichuan,

643
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
he is in a conflict.

644
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,720
We will have to get to the border as soon as possible.

645
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,720
We will avoid the danger of Zichuan and Liu Feng.

646
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,720
I will leave you to it.

647
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,720
My Lord, Yuan Zhou Xiaoqi is back.

648
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,720
It seems that Jinchuan is going to send the usefulness.

649
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,720
Do you know the people of the Ice Tribe?

650
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,720
I should have received the news now.

651
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Go to the Prince of Light with me immediately.

652
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,720
Someone is about to die.

653
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
Yes.

654
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,720
My Lord.

655
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,720
You are so busy this morning.

656
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,720
Did you two discuss it well?

657
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,720
Each of you is a drug.

658
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Si Yilin has seen Prince of Light.

659
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,720
Prince of Light is Zichuan Xiu.

660
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,720
Prince of Light is in danger.

661
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,720
This is a good thing.

662
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,720
Is A Xiu alive?

663
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,720
He is not only alive,

664
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,720
but he is also taken all over Yuan Zhou.

665
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,720
Ok.

666
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,720
Congratulations.

667
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,720
Yuan Zhou is connectiallyamamable and will be taken soon.

668
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
It is great.

669
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
A Xiu is back to the family,

670
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,120
My lord, this is the current King of Guangming of Yuanzhou.

671
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,920
I know.

672
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,920
I saw Ah Xiu grow up.

673
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,120
I know him very well.

674
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,720
He will return home in the future.

675
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,920
My lord, I suggest that you send a letter immediately.

676
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,720
Ask Ah Xiu to return home.

677
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,620
Okay.

678
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,820
My lord, do I have to send a letter to summon the King of Guangming?

679
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,720
Don't worry.

680
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,820
Inform Xiao Ning first.

681
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,820
Tell her that Ah Xiu is alive and that he will return home.

682
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,820
Why are you still standing there?

683
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,820
I will go right now.

684
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,320
Wait a minute.

685
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,020
I will ask you to tell Li Qing.

686
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:09,320
I will ask Li Qing to tell Xiao Ning that you are not going.

687
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,320
Yes.

688
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,320
My lord, I will go back and prepare myself.

689
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,520
I will take Ah Xiu home.

690
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,320
Okay.

691
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,320
You must go out of this world.

692
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,320
You must also celebrate well.

693
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,320
This way, you three brothers can fight for the family of Zi Chuan.

694
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,520
Yes.

695
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,320
If you have caught them up,

696
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,520
they shall do the same.

697
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,020
Xiao Ning?

698
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,120
Okay.

699
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,480
The

700
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,660
world needs

701
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,520
you to show me

702
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,480
what tomb

703
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,140
Xia안an

704
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,700
do some issue

705
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,120
GarMB

706
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,280
Shuli

707
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:44,380
Shen ritual

708
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,740
I haven't seen him for a long time.

709
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,220
I don't care if you can see it or not.

710
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,740
I believe that

711
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,740
you must be very careful.

712
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,740
Of course.

713
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,740
Okay. Please remember that.

714
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,980
Your Highness, you get up early every day.

715
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,260
How can you lose weight?

716
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,420
I got a massage from the Magistrate Ma.

717
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,580
I should take care of myself.

718
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,740
I'm going to Duzheng Temple today.

719
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,140
I can't be late.

720
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:22,660
Then...

721
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,660
Let's talk about it another day.

722
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,100
What about the tofu cake?

723
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,980
It's good for health and nutrition.

724
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,220
Where did you get the tofu cake?

725
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,380
Magistrate Ma sent it this morning.

726
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,460
He's afraid that you won't like the massage.

727
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,660
It's too late.

728
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,540
Get changed and get the carriage back.

729
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,220
Yes.

730
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:49,640
The

731
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,060
Ning'er, I've been waiting for you for a long time.

732
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,380
Ning'er.

733
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,380
Ning'er.

734
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,180
What's wrong?

735
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,380
What happened?

736
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,380
It's okay.

737
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,580
But it's okay.

738
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,380
Zichuan Xiu didn't die.

739
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,180
And he didn't betray the family.

740
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,860
To protect Zichuan,

741
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,980
he went to the remote area to attack the army.

742
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,580
He was attacked by the Beizu and protected the border.

743
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,580
He's called Prince Guangming.

744
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,380
You said Prince Guangming is Xiu?

745
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,780
Who brought this news?

746
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,780
Is it accurate?

747
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,980
It's from the 14th Yiling's family.

748
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,580
It's a secret.

749
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,780
Ning'er, I have something to tell you.

750
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,620
I know you from the beginning.

751
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:23,980
Your Highness,

752
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,980
I'm going out.

753
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,260
I know.

754
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,820
You're always a life and death

755
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,500
under

756
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,580
the protection of Zichuan.

757
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,300
I'm the one who protects you.

758
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,900
Are you willing to give me this chance?

759
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,580
Marry me.

760
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,580
Be my wife.

761
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,780
Let me protect you all the time.

762
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,820
Take care of you.

763
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,140
Love you.

764
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,860
Ning'er.

765
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,220
Sorry.

766
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,740
I can't lie to myself.

767
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,920
You mean

768
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,900
the loveless Shi Jun from Sichuan

769
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,900
You mean,

770
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,900
the Shi Zichuan

771
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,900
has seen Prince of Guangming?

772
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Yes.

773
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,900
Prince of Guangming is a Zichuan.

774
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,900
Will he bring Yuanzhou back to Zichuan?

775
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,900
Yuanzhou

776
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,900
will never become

777
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,900
another's unique.

778
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,900
It can't be.

779
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,900
Good.

780
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,900
Good.

781
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,900
This is your best drink.

782
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,900
Thank you.

783
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,900
Thank you.

784
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,900
Thank you for the wine.

785
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,900
Drink it.

786
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,900
Come on. Welcome.

787
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,900
You're so good.

788
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,900
The 16 teams of the Alliance

789
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,900
will be added to the next round.

790
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,900
Next.

791
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,900
I am Yuanzhou,

792
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,900
Prince of Guangming.

793
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,900
Prince of Guangming.

794
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,900
Take off your clothes.

795
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,900
Wait for the sunrise.

796
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,900
Look at the dream.

797
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,900
Look.

798
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,900
The wine is filled with sweet wine.

799
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,900
It's not that Yuanzhou is not good.

800
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,900
It's just that

801
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,900
the fire is still burning.

802
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,900
Yuanzhou is not a place to stay.

803
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,900
It's just that

804
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,900
the road we took together

805
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,540
has always been a dirt

806
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,900
Such a pat primeditude.

807
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,900
You'll find Ordinary people

808
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,900
whom you've been yearning to visit.

809
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,900
He can't drive a flame.

810
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,900
In recent times

811
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,680
people have been

812
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,700
caramelizing the salt and sugar.

813
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,020
place them in the cold causing the heart

814
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:33,020
I'm waiting for you to open your mouth

815
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,020
Take this

816
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,020
The lost friend

817
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,020
Sorry, my face is a little bit wet

818
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,020
You two are close friends

819
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,020
I'm waiting for you to open your mouth

820
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,020
Come

821
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,020
Now the new dress will be from the past

822
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,020
The dress

823
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:04,020
The long-awaited old time

824
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,020
Don't let go of my hand

825
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,020
But you have a dream

826
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,020
The guest is very beautiful

827
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,020
I'm looking for you

828
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,020
I'm looking for you

829
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,020
But I don't know you

830
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,020
I still have one more

831
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,020
Thank you

832
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,020
But now

833
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,020
They are only in one side

834
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,020
Can form a flower

835
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,020
A flower-shaped dress
