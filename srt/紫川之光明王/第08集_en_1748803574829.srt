1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not afraid of you.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not afraid of you.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not afraid of you.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not afraid of you.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I can't take any for the beauty of a fragrance.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can't take any for the beauty of a fragrance.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're crazy, aren't you?

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You keep your mouth shut when I keep my mouth shut.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Even if I break your mouth,

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
he could also open up the front.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm just a dog.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll eat it.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not hungry.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll just call this meal.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I won't be able to eat the broken tea for three days.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They just came out of the camp.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm hungry too.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Qi Luo,

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
why do you eat so much?

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not that strong.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I have to eat it all.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Besides,

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you Xiu Shuang people

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
promised me that

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
they wouldn't tell me.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Eat it.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Eat it.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Eat it.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Eat it, brothers.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You've eaten it all?

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm full.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Kill, kill, kill.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Kill, kill.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Eat your head and head.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't be afraid of your bad luck.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Miss.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If you can eat it like this,

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
if you kill you now,

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
are we too weak?

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He didn't tell you

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
how to punish him.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He's really bad.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The brothers are just

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
a devil.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They're just a devil.

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Xiu Shuang people have orders.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Now we're in Yuan Zhou.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Even if we're half of the people in Yuan Zhou,

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
the whole Yuan Zhou

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
will be our brothers.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We'll be in trouble.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's hard to survive without the martial arts.

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Martial arts?

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You know how to speak.

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That stinky rascal.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He wants us to teach him how to play martial arts.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're not happy?

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What's the point of playing martial arts?

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
There's money in the market.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
There's food in the food.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What's the point of playing martial arts?

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You don't even know

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
how to play martial arts.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No wonder they're facing the North Clan.

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They have no power to fight back.

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What are you talking about?

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Didn't you say

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you wanted to teach me?

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why can't they?

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't like to learn

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
the skills of your descendants.

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Besides,

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
everyone knows

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
our Jinling Clan and the Dragon Clan are not compatible.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
How can we play martial arts together?

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I think

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
it's better for us two

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
to fight together.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're playing martial arts with us.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We're in charge of the food.

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We can eat and drink.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We have meat every day.

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Meat?

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We have meat.

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How about it?

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll learn it.

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You said you didn't want to learn it.

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What are you thinking about?

111
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let go of your hand.

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't you want to teach me?

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Why do you want to teach them?

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let go of me.

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If you want to teach them,

116
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll teach my Dragon Clan brothers.

117
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay.

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Brothers, go.

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't jump.

120
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't jump.

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
One by one.

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
One by one.

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Give me one.

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
All of them.

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Both of them are strong and abilities.

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,080
The actions

127
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:10,120
is determined by head and很好M

128
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,000
free.

129
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,000
Head and radar are at the right

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,200
when elleix concrete.

131
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,120
It has advanced.

132
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Ends the armor.

133
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,200
Excellent!

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,040
He will take my chicken.

135
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,720
We are a group now.

136
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,920
You don't believe in Zichuan people,

137
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,520
I can understand.

138
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,640
You are all from Yuanzhou.

139
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,360
Don't you believe in yourself?

140
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,000
Within half an hour,

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
every person has three chickens.

142
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,480
There is no dinner.

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Why are you hitting me?

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is hitting you?

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is hitting you.

146
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hit me?

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Hit our boss.

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You...

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You are so crazy.

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You hit me.

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What's wrong with you?

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I will beat you.

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Beat him.

154
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Beat him.

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Beat him.

156
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Beat him.

157
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Beat him.

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Xiu Ziyang,

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
13 chickens, 10 honey bees.

160
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Today,

161
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
we will beat the target.

162
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Come on.

163
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Where is Liewu?

164
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He didn't even know.

165
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He hit me.

166
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Today's shooting training,

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Xiu Ziyang is not very good.

168
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The Dragon Tribe and the Golden Bell Tribe are in the top.

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You two,

170
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
take Liewu back.

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Tonight, Xiu Ziyang will take the chicken.

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The Dragon Tribe and the Golden Bell Tribe are all hungry.

173
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I will take the chicken.

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The Dragon Tribe and the Golden Bell Tribe are all hungry.

175
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Starting tomorrow,

176
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
if anyone doesn't take the training seriously,

177
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I will shoot them.

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Please,

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
use your heart.

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Boss,

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
he really makes us feel hungry.

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Didn't he say that

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
he will not feel hungry

184
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
when we learn to dance?

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I am so hungry, boss.

186
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Didn't they say

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
to use their heart?

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Come on.

189
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Come on.

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Come on.

191
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You are so cool.

192
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You are so cool.

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You are so cool.

194
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You are so cool.

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How about this?

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I quit.

197
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What's wrong with you two?

198
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Get down.

199
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What's wrong with you two?

200
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
How could you not use your heart?

201
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I suddenly remembered

202
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
that I have other work to do.

203
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I will leave first.

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You two

205
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
please give me a good rest.

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Stop.

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Stop.

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What kind of soldiers

209
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
are you wearing?

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Two soldiers,

211
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
one of them is reckless and one of them is bold.

212
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
One of them is not a thief,

213
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
but a man.

214
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Now,

215
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I want to help

216
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
the people who can't help you

217
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
to get on the wall.

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What are you doing?

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Exactly.

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Exactly.

221
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Is it funny?

222
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It turns out

223
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
it's the anger of Yuan Zhou.

224
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You know

225
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
they have no martial arts foundation.

226
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't be angry.

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't be angry.

228
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Life is a game.

229
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I finally know

230
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
what kind of character I can't stand.

231
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Why are all the people of Yuan Zhou

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
being bullied all the time?

233
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's because

234
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
they don't want to get on the wall

235
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and can't be united.

236
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I won't call them.

237
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Can't you say

238
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
that so absolutely?

239
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
They are making fun of me.

240
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
They don't dare to do it.

241
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't.

242
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Calm down.

243
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Leave it to me.

244
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Don't play with me.

245
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Stop.

246
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't fight.

247
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't fight.

248
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't fight.

249
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Stop.

250
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Stop.

251
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Listen to me.

252
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If you don't want to learn,

253
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
just tell them.

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If you leave like this,

255
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
if they die,

256
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
we'll be in vain.

257
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't stop me.

258
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You can't

259
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
be our family.

260
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I didn't know that today.

261
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Get out of here.

262
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Get out of here.

263
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Get out of here.

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Get out of here.

265
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't go.

266
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But I...

267
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What?

268
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You can't even pull your hand?

269
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You can't keep

270
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
the one who wants to leave.

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What?

272
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You can't stay here?

273
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I can't stay here.

274
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I heard that

275
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
the Northern Clan let you

276
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
go to the imperial camp to study.

277
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You can't stop for ten hours.

278
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You can't stop while you're moving.

279
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Today, the martial arts

280
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
has been out for three hours.

281
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I see.

282
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's Bai Chuan.

283
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Bai Chuan is waiting for you.

284
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You Zichuan people

285
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
are like the Northern Clan.

286
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You just want to serve us.

287
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You have your purpose.

288
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Why did you force us to attack?

289
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You just want us to fight for you

290
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and serve you.

291
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

292
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's right.

293
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I say,

294
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
A Xiu is really a good man.

295
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He was the one

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
who protected our village long ago.

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Now, we teach you martial arts.

298
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Isn't that good for you?

299
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's so messy.

300
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You...

301
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Daluan.

302
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Forget it.

303
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You'd rather be caught

304
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and be punished.

305
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You'd rather be killed by the Northern Clan.

306
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You don't want to learn martial arts?

307
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No.

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You don't want to?

309
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You don't want to?

310
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Didn't you learn it by heart?

311
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I did.

312
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But I didn't expect

313
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the archery to be more tiring

314
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
than the land.

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't want to learn it.

316
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We, the people of Yuanzhou,

317
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
only hope that the land and the house

318
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
will be rich and prosperous.

319
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We never like to fight and kill.

320
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We've been fighting for years.

321
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Only when Lord Geyi Xing was here,

322
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
we've been living a peaceful life.

323
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Other people,

324
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
we don't believe it.

325
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes.

326
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We don't believe it.

327
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We don't believe it.

328
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Since you all think so,

329
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
well,

330
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
come with me.

331
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
These are the houses

332
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
that the Bulu Village is in.

333
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're a bit unlucky.

334
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you're willing,

335
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
you can take them as your own home.

336
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
After the house is built,

337
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
you can plant the fields.

338
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
We can live here.

339
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The house is good.

340
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And you.

341
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You and your brothers

342
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
can renovate the house.

343
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I remember

344
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
there were some

345
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
good pictures

346
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
left by the rich in the warehouse.

347
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If you're willing,

348
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I can give them to you.

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I can give them to you.

350
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This is not a slave.

351
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's

352
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
a house that you can take as your own home.

353
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes.

354
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The Golden Bells

355
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
are good at buying and collecting food.

356
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The Dragon Clan can help

357
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
build and transport the trees.

358
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If we do this,

359
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
they won't fight for

360
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
the share of the land.

361
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Really?

362
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Of course.

363
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I promised you

364
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
to teach you martial arts.

365
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But since you're unwilling,

366
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can only give you

367
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
the skills of making money

368
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and saving money

369
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
as a reward.

370
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Are you

371
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
willing?

372
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yes.

373
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes.

374
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We're willing.

375
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
We're so willing.

376
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Thank you,

377
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Lord Zichuanxiu.

378
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I didn't know how to speak just now.

379
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't go too far.

380
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm not a braver.

381
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Before the war begins,

382
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm the most famous

383
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
wine-grower

384
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
in the whole Yuan State.

385
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The house we built

386
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
must be the most beautiful house

387
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
in Yuan State.

388
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The Golden Bells

389
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
will be planted in the cotton.

390
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
When the autumn is gone,

391
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
we can take it to make clothes.

392
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We can sell it to other villages.

393
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
There will be a business.

394
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I want one, too.

395
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Why do you want it?

396
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'll change the house for you.

397
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Okay. Mingyu.

398
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And yours.

399
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The key to the warehouse.

400
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Let's go.

401
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Look.

402
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So bad.

403
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I told you.

404
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They only know how to open the house.

405
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You can't pay the price.

406
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
When will it be?

407
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
They don't have any mental needs.

408
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Now, the warm-up is their most important problem.

409
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Let's go.

410
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Khan.

411
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yaogami.

412
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Prince Kalei.

413
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Long time no see.

414
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Long time no see.

415
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Long time no see.

416
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
How can you have the trouble

417
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
to come to see Prince Kalei personally?

418
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Father is in charge of this time.

419
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
He is very powerful.

420
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
All the leaders of the imperial guards

421
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
are very far away.

422
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's hard to say.

423
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So, Father ordered me to give you a welcome.

424
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He also said he was very concerned about you.

425
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Khan and Ya Kun always don't like

426
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
to be too noisy.

427
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But today's equipment is very good.

428
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You two have a new leader.

429
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
General Yun is in the city.

430
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Even the sword has become a threat.

431
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Qiu Che.

432
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Such a small equipment

433
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
can be called a waste of effort.

434
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Then, the Lu and the Luo are going to be very worried.

435
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The Luo is on the tiger's head,

436
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
the wolf's skin,

437
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
the cow's feet,

438
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and the tiger's feet.

439
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The dragon's heart is very strong.

440
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's even more difficult to count.

441
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The spirit of the Ji is used by the strong animal

442
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
as a skill

443
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
to feel the grace of God.

444
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The development of the strong

445
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
can be achieved by the weak.

446
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If the Great Patriarch is hurt,

447
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
it will be a violation of the spirit's intention.

448
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Then, according to you,

449
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
my brother is born to be a martial artist.

450
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Is it because of his character?

451
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The rules of the ancestral sect

452
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
are that the most of the spirit of the Ji

453
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
will get the grace of God

454
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
if every prince and leader

455
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
are like my brother.

456
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Then, just change the spirit

457
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
into a day of rest.

458
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
How is it?

459
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Brother Huang,

460
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm satisfied.

461
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I think

462
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I should be the one to take the revenge.

463
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Have you thought about

464
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
what you want from me?

465
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Just guess.

466
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Am I a military soldier,

467
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
a drunken man,

468
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
or a madman?

469
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What do you mean by that?

470
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What do you mean?

471
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Just let me say.

472
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I beg you,

473
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to take the most beloved general,

474
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yun Da,

475
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and take the most beloved general,

476
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and take the most beloved general,

477
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
to feed me food

478
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and the day and night work.

479
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm so glad in you.

480
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Your personal skills

481
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,680
besides funcion

482
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,680
He was in charge of the whole clan.

483
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,080
With his skills and power, he has already arrived in the Sacred City.

484
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,480
He lives in the Yiguan.

485
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,780
Luo Si and the two princesses of Ludi are too much of a burden.

486
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,980
Prince Caten has summoned them to live in his own house.

487
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,880
Ludi just took over Yuan Zhou.

488
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,180
He has a great merit.

489
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,080
Don't mind him.

490
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,280
But Luo Si is so careful.

491
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,080
Caten is also quite brave.

492
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,580
Luo Si is the leader of the Data Clan.

493
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,880
He has done more than ten times.

494
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,480
He has been in the Sacred City for a long time.

495
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,580
He is very passionate.

496
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:28,080
The spirit of the Old Clan has been so hurtful.

497
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,880
I'm sure he has been very upset with the result.

498
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Your Majesty, I have been in the Sacred City for a long time.

499
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,480
I have been in the Sacred City for a long time.

500
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,880
Although I am in the Sacred City for a long time, I am not very lucky.

501
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,080
You don't have to worry about me.

502
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,680
His Majesty is just trapped by the Qi-Ju.

503
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,880
You can leave the body.

504
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,280
I know what I am doing.

505
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,480
After I finish this, I will be in the Sacred City for His Majesty.

506
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,280
I know that His Majesty has always been a bad person.

507
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,280
This spirit of the Data Clan is just a trick.

508
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,480
It is convenient for you to be in charge of the Sacred City and stabilize the court.

509
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,080
Especially in the Sacred City.

510
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,480
In the history of the Northern Clan, there has never been a god who has lived for fifty years.

511
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,880
I'm afraid that the Sacred City leaders and the two princes

512
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,080
will have new ideas.

513
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,880
They naturally want to be in my position.

514
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,080
As a prince,

515
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,880
there should be such a ambition.

516
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,280
But the Northern Clan's mission is too difficult.

517
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,480
They can't be burdened.

518
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,480
The current situation and the conflict

519
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,080
are only because they don't know what to do.

520
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,480
Princess, this flower is not the one from the Northern Clan.

521
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,680
The one you planted in the Garden of the Flower Garden

522
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,280
is not alive. Do you still want to keep it?

523
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,480
I know.

524
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,480
But I always don't think about it.

525
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,480
I think that if there is someone new in this palace,

526
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,280
what will happen in the future?

527
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,880
Princess, the Luo Si Palace is here to greet you.

528
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,080
Ask her to come in.

529
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,680
Yes.

530
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,480
The Luo Si Palace is a closed-door. Why didn't you inform me earlier?

531
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,480
You can let me prepare for it.

532
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,880
Princess, you finally left Zichuan. You must have suffered a lot.

533
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,080
As the leader of the Data Clan,

534
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,880
I will come to Sai Rong City to ask you.

535
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,280
I will go so that you can save the city.

536
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
I will.

537
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,480
Princess, you really want to find the name of the flower

538
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,680
and give it to His Majesty as a gift?

539
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,280
I just play with it.

540
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,080
You don't need to call me that.

541
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,680
What flower can be compared with the beauty of Princess Rong Yan?

542
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,080
The princess has been tortured by Zichuan and the thief for many years.

543
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Her face is not only dim,

544
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,480
but also her face is a bit pale.

545
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,880
She is beautiful and beautiful.

546
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,880
Since the Northern Tribe has seen her, since the princess likes her,

547
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,480
I will go to the front to search for some flowers that are still alive

548
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,480
and give them to the princess.

549
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,680
No need.

550
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,080
The flowers are going to be sent to the Saerong City. They will surely be in good condition.

551
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,480
Moreover, they will be open in a few days.

552
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
I want to plant them myself.

553
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,080
That's fine.

554
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,880
Princess, the palace is small,

555
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,680
but I am quite generous in leading the Tata Tribe.

556
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,680
I think that the princess loves planting flowers. I also love enjoying flowers.

557
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Why don't you come back to the Tata Tribe with me?

558
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
If this violence is not enough,

559
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,280
if we send the message to the Royal Father,

560
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,680
we will have to endure the pain and suffering

561
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,480
and cause a lot of trouble.

562
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Please leave.

563
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,080
Princess, are you trying to take the Divine Emperor to suppress me?

564
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,680
I, Luo Si, am not allowed to be rude to you.

565
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,680
You disturbed the princess's rest.

566
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,280
You are being rude to the Grand Master.

567
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,680
Have you lost your mind, Luo Si?

568
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,880
Are you still not going to apologize to the princess?

569
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,680
The princess is noble,

570
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,280
but I am not a lowly person.

571
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,480
I am a righteous and righteous person.

572
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,680
What crime do I have?

573
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,280
Princess, you don't have to worry about the Divine Emperor.

574
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
No matter how much the Divine Emperor is reluctant,

575
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,880
when a daughter is older, she will still marry her.

576
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,880
I am not good enough for the princess.

577
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,280
So, I will surely do my best to get the head of the beast hunt.

578
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,880
I will be able to be a great person.

579
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,680
I will marry you.

580
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
I will marry you.

581
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,280
Your Highness,

582
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,280
I was looking for some flowers and seeds that I had forgotten.

583
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
I found some flowers and seeds that I had forgotten.

584
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,080
I didn't expect that Luo Si

585
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,880
would be so kind to you.

586
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,080
I am not afraid of you.

587
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,480
Princess, don't worry.

588
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,080
I will surely report to the Divine Emperor in person.

589
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,680
I promise that this will never happen again.

590
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,080
No need.

591
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,480
Luo Si really won the beast hunt.

592
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
He proposed a proposal to marry her.

593
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,880
How could Father refuse?

594
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,480
He must have broken his promise.

595
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,680
The beast hunt is about the military power,

596
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,080
the seal and the crown prince.

597
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,880
I want to win the big brother.

598
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,680
But you can't be too far away from the seal.

599
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,280
I have a plan.

600
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,480
Send someone to buy a lion and a lion

601
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,080
from the market and the hunting ground.

602
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,080
They will go to the hunting ground.

603
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,280
But the beast hunt is about the seal.

604
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,480
The seal is behind the seal.

605
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,680
There is no doubt about it.

606
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,080
If Father knows, he will be furious.

607
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,080
Besides, such a big battle

608
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,880
can't be disbanded.

609
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,680
You just want him to know.

610
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,680
You also know that he has always been strong.

611
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,880
The more you show your determination, the more he is afraid of the beast.

612
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,280
If he knows you are ready,

613
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,880
he will be more prepared and more energetic than you.

614
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,680
Once he is afraid of the beast,

615
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,280
his men, Lu Di and Luo Si,

616
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,880
will naturally make plans for him.

617
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,080
But in terms of the seven snakes and human power,

618
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,080
I can't beat Luo Si.

619
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,680
Besides, this time,

620
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,280
I have brought so many people to work hard.

621
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,280
You are forcing them to fight for their own money.

622
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,080
You brothers are fighting each other.

623
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,680
Father is not unknowingly.

624
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,680
It's just that he is not good at keeping balance.

625
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,680
But if he hurts me for the sake of taking the enemy,

626
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,280
Father will not allow it.

627
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,280
Father will not allow it.

628
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,480
As for Luo Si,

629
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,080
he is the leader of the Data Clan.

630
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,880
Over the past few years, Data Clan has been expanding rapidly.

631
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
The more he is outstanding,

632
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
the more he doesn't want to let him win.

633
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,480
He will also be more eager to be a big brother.

634
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,080
I have a question.

635
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,080
We brothers have been fighting each other.

636
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,480
You have always been in charge of matters.

637
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,480
Why did you help me this time?

638
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,080
I am not doing this not just to help you,

639
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,480
but also to help myself.

640
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,680
I have a new lover.

641
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,080
I will never marry Luo Si.

642
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,880
Prince, you have just received news.

643
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Prince of Kalan sent people to search nearby.

644
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,680
They have just found a lot of new items.

645
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,880
They are currently in the hunting ground.

646
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,880
Good.

647
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,480
This is the only way to make a move.

648
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,080
Did he take the spirit of the spirit as his prey?

649
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,880
Did he sell it to the merchants?

650
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,480
I will tell Father now.

651
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,080
Don't worry, Your Highness.

652
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,480
Your Highness, Kalan has always been very thoughtful.

653
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,480
I think the hunting ground has already arranged for the people to take the lead.

654
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,580
If the Emperor sent people to search,

655
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,280
and they have broken a hole,

656
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,180
wouldn't it be that they are suspicious of you

657
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,080
and want to harm their own brother?

658
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,680
That's right. There is a problem.

659
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,480
Father has been over half a century.

660
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,680
But he still won't leave the Crown Prince.

661
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,380
The tribes of all the leaders are also very hard to deal with.

662
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,680
Isn't this position just mine?

663
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,280
Yes.

664
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,380
Your Highness,

665
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,880
the battle of the past was a battle for the Emperor.

666
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,480
There is only one victory item in this battle.

667
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,680
That is Princess Kadan.

668
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,780
What do you mean?

669
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,680
Right now, there are two things that are not yet decided.

670
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,680
One, the position of the Crown Prince.

671
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,880
Two, who will Princess Kadan be?

672
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,480
Actually, these two things can be considered as one thing.

673
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,680
Kadan is very important to the Emperor.

674
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,380
It is the Emperor's heart and his illness.

675
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,780
So, who can solve this matter?

676
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,580
Who is the most loyal and loyal member of the Emperor?

677
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,580
I, the assassin, have always been a word in the Emperor's heart.

678
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,580
If you marry Kadan,

679
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:49,180
you will naturally remove the Emperor's heart and illness from your heart.

680
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,380
Okay.

681
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,380
When the hunting is over, I will ask the Emperor to get Kadan for you.

682
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,580
This Kadan has a lot of battles.

683
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,180
How should we win?

684
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,580
I remember that General Lu Di has contributed a lot to the ambush in Yuan Zhou this time.

685
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,580
How is that possible? They can't be a skill?

686
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,980
This time, the ambush in Yuan Zhou was heavily collected.

687
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,180
Some were arranged to go to the hunting ground to manage the horses and horses.

688
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,380
And the hunting ground has a lot of deep ditches.

689
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:31,180
As long as we arrange to take care of the people and throw the meat into the deep ditches,

690
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,180
there will be a lot of hunting.

691
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,580
You are indeed my best friend.

692
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,180
Okay.

693
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,680
When you win Kadan,

694
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,780
when I finish the position of the heir,

695
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,780
we will share the land of the Northern Tribe.

696
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,180
Come!

697
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,980
Your Highness!

698
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,780
Since clapping in the των Chu Palace dzisiaj,

699
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,380
you must change your shoes and give me your number and customs.

700
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:09,980
...

701
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,980
I will give it my all...

702
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,780
Senior Brother!

703
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,780
I beg you, Your Majesty.

704
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,540
Move aside.

705
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,020
I want to see Your Majesty.

706
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,380
Stop him.

707
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,780
I'm in charge of the subordinate's case.

708
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,220
I'm guilty.

709
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,020
Your Majesty, please.

710
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,780
Please, Your Majesty.

711
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,620
The people from your headquarters.

712
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,700
happy to see I've tried hundreds of times.

713
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,340
I want to get the money's hard work.

714
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,720
The old people in the village

715
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,000
find themselves by blood.

716
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:10,580
The army has been

717
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,460
sent to the land by many people.

718
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,940
Please promise me the justice.

719
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,180
You have evidence.

720
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,580
This letter

721
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,300
is the signature of every member of the same group.

722
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:32,020
Among them, 69 people were killed by Lu Di on the way.

723
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,860
Your Majesty.

724
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,020
General Lu Di.

725
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,900
I...

726
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,220
It's true that you're alive.

727
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:57,380
But why didn't you pay the price of the Yuan Zhou in Shangjiao?

728
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,900
Who did you give it to?

729
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,100
Lu Di!

730
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,780
You're still not telling me the truth?

731
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,780
I...

732
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,500
I was thinking of the spirit of the god.

733
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,860
I asked the subordinates to pay the price.

734
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,260
The money I received

735
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,500
was a gift from the god.

736
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,700
How dare you!

737
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,460
Are you pushing your crime to father?

738
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,300
No, no, no.

739
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,300
No.

740
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,060
I'm guilty.

741
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,500
You're guilty.

742
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,380
Someone

743
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,700
take the slave of the dragon clan away.

744
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Kill him.

745
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,580
Why?

746
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,940
It's Lu Di who killed the emperor.

747
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,300
He's your master.

748
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,100
Who's your master?

749
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,820
When the Yuan Zhou people seek protection from the north,

750
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,580
the god is here to make you slaves.

751
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,660
General Lu Di killed Yuan Zhou.

752
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,820
He's also your master.

753
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,660
You don't care about him.

754
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,420
You're here to complain about his misdeeds.

755
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,540
Take him away.

756
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,820
God, please spare my life.

757
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,060
God, please spare my life.

758
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,220
God, please spare my life.

759
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,060
Please spare my life.

760
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,380
Daughter.

761
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,820
What's wrong?

762
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,780
Is there anything wrong?

763
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,700
I think

764
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,140
the god of the jade is here today.

765
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,620
Princess, you're worried that these people are dead.

766
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,500
You're mistaken.

767
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,620
The god of the jade is here today.

768
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,260
It's father's birthday.

769
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,340
I'm here to celebrate.

770
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,820
I want to say congratulations to father.

771
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,820
That's good.

772
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,100
I'll be accompanied by General Yun.

773
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,420
And I'll be accompanied.

774
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,420
As for these slaves,

775
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,620
you'll be in charge of the jade.

776
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,140
Remember, don't bury the forest.

777
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,420
Yes.

778
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,900
Our foundation is not to demand the god's help.

779
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,980
But to tell us

780
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:10,420
that there's no god in this world.

781
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,380
And no other people's clothes.

782
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,340
What we're metric about

783
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,500
is our ancestors

784
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,780
sent by our masters for decades.

785
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,420
You're extensions of our hordes.

786
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,620
My child.

787
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,940
Take the credit for your confusing plan.

788
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,940
Because of this,

789
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,060
you'rebones will tremble.

790
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,940
They have zero father and daughter rights.

791
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,940
You are a good plan.

792
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,540
You called the servants of Yuan State to sue you.

793
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,940
Why didn't I think of that?

794
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,940
But you also saw that

795
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,940
why would Father die because of some servants

796
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,940
and go to punish his son?

797
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,940
This bracelet...

798
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,940
I just started.

799
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,940
Father didn't see the difference.

800
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,940
What's more, Father was angry and didn't act well.

801
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,940
This punishment doesn't mean he won't be angry.

802
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,940
Brother, you were too early to discuss this.

803
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,940
Come on, Brother.

804
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,940
Brother.

805
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,940
Run. Run!

806
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,940
I want to see

807
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,940
if you can buy all the animals in the market

808
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,940
and buy the tiger and tiger.

809
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,940
I'm telling you, without Yun Qianxue

810
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,940
you can't even beat a rabbit.

811
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,940
Your Highness, Lord Yun.

812
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,260
We found the unbreakable

813
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,260
and unbreakable

814
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,460
and unbreakable

815
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,940
and the traces of the mud are all these.

816
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,940
Did you get it wrong?

817
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,940
Since we have evidence

818
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,940
the unbreakable and unbreakable

819
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,940
must be greatly improved.

820
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,940
We can't let them

821
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,940
look for excuses to push us.

822
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,940
If someone with a hunting

823
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,940
falls into the pit and gets hurt

824
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,940
His Majesty will definitely not do anything wrong.

825
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,940
I'll go.

826
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,940
You're too clear on the details.

827
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,940
Father will definitely win.

828
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,940
He thinks that Brother Shao and Brother

829
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,940
are fighting for the crown prince's position

830
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,940
and is in danger.

831
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,940
It's not right.

832
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
Jingqing tea.

833
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,940
The crime of hunting the prince is currently being cut off.

834
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,940
Since you're getting the head of the enemy

835
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,940
what reward do you want?

836
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,940
Tell me.

837
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,940
Father.

838
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,940
I'm the prince's hand.

839
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,940
I'm afraid that I'll be killed

840
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,940
if I consider all of them as my younger brother.

841
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,940
My younger sister, Kadan,

842
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,940
was captured by Zi Chuan.

843
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,940
Now that we're reunited

844
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,940
Kadan is at the age of marriage.

845
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,940
As a brother

846
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,940
I've prepared a best marriage

847
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,940
for her.

848
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,940
Your Majesty.

849
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,940
I've been loyal to Princess Kadan.

850
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,940
I hope that she can be the right wife.

851
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,940
I'd like to give the whole of Data Clan

852
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,940
a high-ranking position.

853
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,940
The whole of Data Clan?

854
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,940
What position?

855
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,940
The second-largest of Data Clan

856
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,940
is rich in land and trade.

857
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,940
There are countless servants in the Niuyang.

858
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,940
You can't be injured.

859
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,940
Where's Kadan?

860
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,940
Where is he?

861
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,940
Princess and General Yun

862
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,940
haven't returned to the capital.

863
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,940
They didn't send any signal.

864
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,940
We've searched for them with our help.

865
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,940
But we found some

866
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,940
deep-rooted traps.

867
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,940
There are

868
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,940
blood-dried duck inside.

869
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,940
We're worried that

870
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,940
Your Highness might be...

871
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,940
Nonsense.

872
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,940
The imperial doctor is here.

873
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
He's out of town.

874
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,940
Where did he get the trap?

875
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,940
I checked the records.

876
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,940
I found that Kadan

877
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,940
sent Yuan Zhou's servants

878
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,940
to the hunting ground.

879
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,940
Brother Lu.

880
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,940
You said you'd use Yuan Zhou's servants

881
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,940
to hunt the hunting ground.

882
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,940
What the hell is going on?

883
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,940
It must be Yuan Zhou's servants.

884
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,940
They're not working hard.

885
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,940
They're trying to harm us.

886
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,940
Your wild tiger-cage

887
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,940
was so hunting.

888
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,940
What did you take the spirit of the emperor

889
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,940
as?

890
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,940
What did you take my daughter as?

891
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,940
Kadan.

892
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,940
I'm going with you.

893
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,940
But you're going to be a gold-gainer.

894
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,940
You mustn't.

895
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,940
You're making a trap.

896
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,940
If you want to lose your life,

897
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,940
you must hurt the emperor

898
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,940
who cares about you the most.

899
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,940
Besides, I believe

900
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,940
General Yun will protect me.

901
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,940
Your Majesty.

902
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,940
Don't worry.

903
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,940
I found their work in the forest.

904
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,940
The princess and General Yun

905
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,940
didn't fall into the cave.

906
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,940
They were hurt.

907
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,940
I'm sorry for your lack of protection.

908
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,940
Please forgive me.

909
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,940
Princess Chen Yu

910
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,940
was trapped in the cave.

911
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,940
She was blood-sucking.

912
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,940
Ru Jin.

913
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,940
I'm sorry.

914
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,940
I'm sorry.

915
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,940
I'm sorry.

916
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,940
I'm sorry.

917
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,940
I'm sorry.

918
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,940
I'm sorry.

919
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,940
I'm sorry.

920
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,940
I'm sorry.

921
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
I'm sorry.

922
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
I'm sorry.

923
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,940
Ru Jin.

924
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,940
I can only train them

925
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,940
as today's training.

926
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,940
I'm afraid they're not like the Qin Shang.

927
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,940
Hei Shang.

928
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,940
You should take the medical exam

929
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,940
and show the princess.

930
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,940
Hurry.

931
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,940
What's wrong, Lord Ma?

932
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,940
The princess is not healthy.

933
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,940
She's pregnant.

934
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,940
The princess just came back from the purple boat.

935
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,940
Is it because the purple boat is prepared

936
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,940
to insult us?

937
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,940
Nonsense.

938
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,940
Please calm down.

939
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,940
It's not that I'm not

940
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,940
a loyal princess.

941
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,940
Shut up.

942
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,940
My daughter

943
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,940
can't be happy with the enemy.

944
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,940
If so,

945
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,940
it's the biggest insult

946
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,940
to the northern clan.

947
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,940
I can't believe

948
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,940
she would do this.

949
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,940
Daughter.

950
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,940
Tell me.

951
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,940
What happened?

952
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,940
No.

953
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,940
Ji Sheng.

954
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
Chen.

955
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,940
I'm sorry.

956
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,940
The princess is my son.

957
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,940
My son.

958
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,940
How dare you!

959
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,940
I escort the princess

960
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,940
back to the city of Saerong

961
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,940
from Yuanzhou.

962
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,940
Because I've been

963
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,940
loving the princess.

964
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,940
I've been

965
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,940
trying to stop myself

966
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,940
from being a princess.

967
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,940
Father.

968
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,940
It's me.

969
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,940
It's all my fault.

970
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,940
It's all my fault.

971
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,940
The princess is innocent.

972
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,940
The son of Qi Fuchong

973
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,940
is innocent.

974
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,940
I

975
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,940
am willing to bear it.

976
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,940
Yun.

977
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,940
Are you crazy?

978
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,940
What a big enemy!

979
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,940
You're a good man.

980
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,940
How can you be so proud?

981
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,940
Father.

982
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,940
If I break his coffin,

983
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,940
I'll kill him.

984
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,940
Come on.

985
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,940
Take him down.

986
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,940
Wait.

987
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,940
Ka Dan.

988
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,940
What do you think?

989
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,940
I made a mistake

990
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,940
when I was young.

991
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,940
I was innocent.

992
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,940
General Yun.

993
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,940
I was innocent.

994
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,940
Okay.

995
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,940
Yun Qianxue.

996
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,940
Are you willing

997
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,940
to be the princess of Ka Dan?

998
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,940
Your Majesty.

999
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,940
This is the thing

1000
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,940
I'm willing to do

1001
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,940
for the rest of my life.

1002
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,940
I want you to swear.

1003
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,940
I'm willing to learn from you.

1004
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,940
I'm willing to live a life

1005
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,940
to protect Ka Dan.

1006
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,940
I'll never be angry

1007
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,940
with the royal family.

1008
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,940
If father takes away

1009
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,940
the enemy's army

1010
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,940
and the horses,

1011
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,940
I'll kill him

1012
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,940
with my own hands.

1013
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,940
Your Majesty.

1014
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,940
You're so careless.

1015
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,940
I'm not.

1016
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,940
The royal family is not.

1017
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,940
The rules in the imperial body.

1018
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,940
If anyone

1019
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,940
wins in the hunting,

1020
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,940
the Khan

1021
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,940
will have the right to kick out

1022
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,940
this gate.

1023
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,940
Father.

1024
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,940
It's obviously my most dangerous thing.

1025
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,940
I was a young hunter.

1026
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,940
I also fell into the trap.

1027
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,940
Thanks to a stranger,

1028
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,940
I got this day.

1029
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,940
That stranger

1030
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,940
is your mother.

1031
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,940
Yun Qian Xu and Ka Dan

1032
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,940
were not only the blood-sucking medicine,

1033
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,940
but also the heart of a warrior.

1034
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,940
Your Majesty.

1035
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,940
But...

1036
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,940
Lord Lusi.

1037
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,940
Are you going to be

1038
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,940
disrespectful to the late immortal?

1039
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,940
Yun Qian Xu.

1040
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,940
Listen.

1041
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,940
I'll give

1042
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,940
my most beloved daughter

1043
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,940
to you.

1044
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,940
General Yun.

1045
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,940
I love her very much.

1046
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,940
I love her very much.

1047
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,940
Maybe I'll fall in love with her forever.

1048
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:54,940
I know.

1049
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,940
She's the son of the Zichuan family.

1050
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,940
You don't have to tell me who she is.

1051
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,940
You've still returned to the north.

1052
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,940
I'm sorry.

1053
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,940
I've never met her in my life.

1054
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,940
But you have a father

1055
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,940
who needs a father.

1056
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:20,940
I didn't lie to the emperor

1057
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,940
on the hall.

1058
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:26,940
I really

1059
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:28,940
want to protect you

1060
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,940
with my life.

1061
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,940
Including your father.

1062
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,940
Get some rest.

1063
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,940
Father.

1064
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,940
The dead is not enough to guard

1065
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,940
your father.

1066
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,940
You're a great master.

1067
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,940
You don't need to hurt your own sister.

1068
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,940
You're not educated and not good at teaching.

1069
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,940
You can't even

1070
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,940
get a little brother.

1071
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,940
Father.

1072
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,940
I just want to be a good emperor.

1073
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,940
I just want to be a good emperor.

1074
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,940
And I don't have any.

1075
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,940
No.

1076
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:44,940
Do you think I really don't know

1077
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,940
that the brotherhood of Yuanzhu

1078
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,940
and the blood of the people

1079
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,940
you think I really believe

1080
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,940
will become a trap?

1081
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,940
How dare you be so incompetent?

1082
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,940
How could I have you as my brother?

1083
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,940
How could I have you as my son?

1084
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,940
Your Majesty, don't be angry.

1085
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,940
Prince Kaden has already known the truth.

1086
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,940
I deserve to die.

1087
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,940
I'm the son of Yuanzhu.

1088
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:16,940
I deserve to die.

1089
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,940
But father,

1090
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,940
don't be angry.

1091
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:19,940
Don't go.

1092
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,940
Go back.

1093
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,940
Be a good prince.

1094
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,940
Tell Ludi

1095
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,940
that I'll leave

1096
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:31,940
the first sword to you two.

1097
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:34,940
Get out of here.

1098
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

1099
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,940
The whole Zhao needs ambition.

1100
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,940
Only with ambition

1101
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,940
can it protect the whole Zhao.

1102
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,940
But I never thought

1103
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,940
that

1104
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:51,940
the whole Zhao

1105
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,940
would be so powerful.

1106
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,940
I don't know

1107
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,940
how to say it.

1108
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:00,940
I don't know.

1109
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:02,940
I don't know.

1110
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,940
I don't know.

1111
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:05,940
I never thought

1112
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,940
he was so stupid

1113
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,940
and could not see

1114
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,940
the greed of Luo Si.

1115
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,940
Are you worried

1116
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,940
that Kaden will not be able to stop

1117
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:20,940
the enemy?

1118
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,940
I'm here.

1119
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,940
He doesn't dare.

1120
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:27,940
But where is Luo Si?

1121
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,940
Luo Si.

1122
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:35,940
Say another word.

1123
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,540
Go.

1124
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:40,940
Go.

1125
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:41,940
Go back.

1126
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:46,940
God.

1127
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,940
You stay as long as possible.

1128
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,940
Find a place to wake up.

1129
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,940
And force your wish to be fulfilled.

1130
00:48:58,940 --> 00:48:59,940
Have a sleep.

1131
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,940
Yes.

1132
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,940
Right.

1133
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,940
Next time,

1134
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,980
This is more interesting than expectations

1135
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,820
Then the expression on your face can be watched

1136
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,580
About my previous mistakes

1137
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,820
Don't think about it

1138
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,940
If your position is higher

1139
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,880
How could I say that?

1140
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,480
When one person passes on

1141
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,680
A multiple way

1142
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,860

1143
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,640
Did Abby у automated?

1144
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,640
I'm here.

1145
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,640
I'm here.

1146
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,640
I'm here.

1147
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,640
I'm here.

1148
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,640
I'm here.

1149
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,640
Look, even though he doesn't look like a man,

1150
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,640
he has a big beard.

1151
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,640
His hair is not curly.

1152
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,640
He's not curly.

1153
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,640
Look,

1154
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,640
even though he's not curly,

1155
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,640
this is the maze.

1156
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,640
Once you cross the road,

1157
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,640
you'll never be lost in this maze.

1158
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,640
Where is the tree?

1159
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,640
I don't know.

1160
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,640
It's a very strange place.

1161
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,640
I'm sorry.

1162
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,640
I was fooled by you.

1163
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,640
I'm sorry.

1164
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,640
This is the Xichuan Road in the South Sea.

1165
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,640
There's a needle.

1166
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,640
What we're talking about is

1167
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,640
waiting for us to go out.

1168
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,640
Let's see what we can do.

1169
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,640
Let's see what we can do.

1170
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,640
We should hurry and get out.

1171
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,640
Don't get hurt.

1172
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,640
Sorry.

1173
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,640
Sorry.

1174
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,640
The left-hand man's maze is a maze.

1175
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,640
But the whole of the road is the first one.

1176
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,640
This is the end of his maze.

1177
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,640
I don't understand.

1178
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,640
Sorry.

1179
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,640
This is the end of his maze.

1180
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,640
I don't understand.

1181
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,640
The left-hand man's maze is a maze.

1182
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,640
But the whole of the road is the first one.

1183
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,640
Sorry.

1184
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,640
Don't be shy.

1185
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,640
This is the end of his maze.
