00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,120
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,120
I'm not afraid of you.

00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,160
I'm not afraid of you.

20
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm not afraid of you.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,520
I'm not afraid of you.

22
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,000
Is that correct?

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,960
Yes.

24
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,600
indicates a single shot.

25
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,680
In the future,

for thatudo's joint shootingこん�andy?

28
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,280
Next time,

29
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,960
if you can come up with something,

30
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,520
and there's trouble,

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,680
put your standards down,

32
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,480
I'm going to die.

33
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,440
Is it worth your risk

34
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,640
to be a Lei Hong?

35
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,280
Yes.

36
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,240
Even if I can't go back to Zichuan,

37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,280
I can't go back to the capital.

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,160
What's wrong?

39
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Do you think you've been wronged

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,800
following me?

41
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,520
I'm not wronged.

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,640
I like to be a robber.

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,680
Don't worry.

44
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,920
I won't let you be a robber.

45
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,440
I won't.

46
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,760
I won't.

47
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,000
Attentionaps!

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,160
I'm selling you.

49
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,200
Very spicy without spicy left.

50
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,960
Teacher Liu.

51
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,580
People have too many ways.

52
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
We must tell them first.

53
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,100
You're making too much now.

54
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,880
Wait and see.

55
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,280
I guessed it correctly.

56
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,480
What is it?

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,160
They're coming in.

58
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
What are you waiting for?

59
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,660
jóvenes!)

Purple magazine!

00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,760
Little Th carries.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,360
What?

63
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,800
You left without stopping yourself?

64
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,680
Are you really going to end this?

65
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,520
Only then, can we go home.

66
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,080
Bai Chuan.

67
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,340
Bring me here,

68
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,940

69
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,060
Get in touch.

70
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,640
Miss Lv, we have our trade bags...

71
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,720
Okay.

72
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,860
All nurses will be skilled here.

73
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,340
Princess competent lady Copy Des kardeşim

75
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,380
Okay....

76
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,360
But we have to work harder this time.

77
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,360
and the people of Zichuan

78
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,360
who are the leaders of the family

79
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,360
and his Xiu Ziyin

80
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,360
will be the traitor of our family

81
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,360
and will live on as one.

82
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Everyone,

83
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
can't you go back to Wan Yun?

84
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
Yes.

85
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,360
We are taking Zichuan's traitor.

86
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
We can't even go to Changzhou.

87
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
Unless

88
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,360
we take your head back.

89
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
I don't want to go back to Changzhou.

90
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
I don't want to go back to Changzhou.

91
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Calm down.

92
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Calm down.

93
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
How can you say that?

94
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,360
How can you say that?

95
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
You are so kind, little boy.

96
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
Because I am willing to.

97
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
I don't want to either.

98
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
But after so many people died,

99
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
I finally came to life.

100
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
I want to live.

101
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Is it wrong to go back to Zichuan?

102
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
I am afraid that I will be in the capital now.

103
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Who doesn't want to go back to home?

104
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,360
Who doesn't want to go back to home?

105
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Lord Xiu Chuan,

106
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,360
I am the patient you brought out.

107
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,360
I am wrong to kill you.

108
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
But this is the only chance I can get back home.

109
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
I have to try once.

110
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Now

111
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
I can't go back to home.

112
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Are you going to kill me?

113
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
I will kill you now.

114
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
You are a child.

115
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Let them go.

116
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Go.

117
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
I said

118
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
let them go.

119
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Go away.

120
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Zichuan Xiu.

121
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
They are here to kill you today.

122
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Tomorrow

123
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
there will be a thousand

124
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
and ten thousand people to kill you.

125
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
I will take care of it.

126
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
Go away.

127
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Go away.

128
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Bai Chuan.

129
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Send the treasure.

130
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Little Chau.

131
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
You three

132
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
take care of me.

133
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
I...

134
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
I...

135
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
You are a child.

136
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
You are still standing in the pond.

137
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
Aren't you afraid that the tribe will fall down?

138
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
I will fall down.

139
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
I will be a good person.

140
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
At first

141
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
I thought I could explain it clearly.

142
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
But now

143
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
I can't explain it clearly.

144
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
I can't explain it clearly.

145
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
It's not because I am a traitor.

146
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
It's because

147
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
they don't want to kill me.

148
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Your Highness.

149
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
You can't go in if you have any work to do.

150
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
My Lord.

151
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Sit down.

152
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Lord Ding.

153
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
They said that the chief of the Lü Temple

154
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
will walk the whole Xichuan Road.

155
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
If I were you

156
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
I would definitely

157
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
transfer all the power

158
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
to the Chaminate.

159
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
But I can't.

160
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
I can't.

161
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
I can't.

162
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
I can't.

163
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
I can't.

164
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
I will transfer all the power

165
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
to the Chaminate.

166
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Now Yuan Zhou

167
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
is not the Chaminate.

168
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
It's easy to find out the truth.

169
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
It's easy to find out the truth.

170
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
You are a good person.

171
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
You know that

172
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Brother Xiu and Si Yiling are trapped in the forest.

173
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
I am also you

174
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
when I was in Yuan Zhou.

175
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
I know that

176
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
you are in Yuan Zhou.

177
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
I know that you are in Yuan Zhou.

178
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
I know that you are in Yuan Zhou.

179
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
I know that you are in Yuan Zhou.

180
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
The news that the spy sent back

181
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
is meaningless to the government.

182
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
They all said that

183
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Xiu betrayed the Chaminate.

184
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
But they didn't find out the truth.

185
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
You control the Chaminate.

186
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
All Yuan's fake cases in the Chaminate

187
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
are in the Chaminate.

188
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
If I were you,

189
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
I would definitely

190
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
transfer the power to Brother Xiu.

191
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
The Chaminate's case

192
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
is a real case.

193
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
You can see it.

194
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
You can also find out

195
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
the whole Chaminate.

196
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
The law of Chaminate

197
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
is not a single case.

198
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
It can be decided

199
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
by trusting it.

200
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
That's not a big deal.

201
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
The law of Chaminate is a good thing.

202
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Any unfair judgment

203
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
will not affect the country.

204
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
It will be a good thing.

205
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Lord Yiling

206
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
is loyal to Chaminate.

207
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
You won't forget this, right?

208
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Thank you for your reminder.

209
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
I won't forget it.

210
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
But the law of Chaminate

211
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
is a good thing.

212
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
It's not a personal matter.

213
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
It's a personal matter.

214
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
So whether you investigate it or not

215
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,360
is my personal matter.

216
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
Don't kill me.

217
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Your Highness.

218
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Lord Yiling

219
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
means we can find the clue.

220
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
You are also

221
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
related to them.

222
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
This matter

223
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
doesn't matter

224
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
whether you believe it or not.

225
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
What matters is

226
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
you have to believe it.

227
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Do you think

228
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
you can have the idea of

229
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Lord Yiling?

230
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
There must be someone

231
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
to do this.

232
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
If you don't come,

233
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
I will do it.

234
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
My Lord.

235
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Lord Yiling.

236
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
My Lord.

237
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
Your Highness

238
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
is not unreasonable.

239
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
The report that Lord Xiulü sent

240
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
has been passed for several days.

241
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
There is no new report recently.

242
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
We are in a difficult situation

243
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
to find the report secretly.

244
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
If we can use

245
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
the power of Wanyun...

246
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Do you think I don't want to know the truth?

247
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
But Shuli Si is from Zichuan family.

248
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
He is not from Zichuan's family.

249
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
We will investigate it.

250
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
We will keep an eye on him.

251
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,360
Shuli Si came to investigate

252
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
and found out that

253
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
he didn't say anything.

254
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
He will use our party to

255
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
stop the investigation.

256
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
He won't do anything to make it clear.

257
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
My Lord.

258
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,360
The report that Lord Yiling sent

259
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
has been passed to Wanyun.

260
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
Is this

261
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
a pretext

262
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
that we can't go back?

263
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
Now

264
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
I have to tell you

265
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
that I am back.

266
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
My Lord.

267
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Lord Xiulü.

268
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Will he really betray us?

269
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,360
If this happens to me

270
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
and not to Xiulü,

271
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
do you think I will betray him?

272
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Definitely not.

273
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
But he won't.

274
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
My Lord.

275
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
My Lord.

276
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
You are looking for me?

277
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Who is Li Qing?

278
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
I thought about it

279
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,360
when we got married last time.

280
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
I made you feel wronged.

281
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
You don't need to apologize.

282
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Come.

283
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Come here.

284
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Come up.

285
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
I

286
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
want to give you some time.

287
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Let you rest well.

288
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
This is not

289
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
affected by these rumors.

290
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Who thinks that

291
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
you go there

292
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
to organize the Black Knight Army.

293
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
And you

294
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
have made a big contribution

295
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
to organize an old department.

296
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
My Lord, you have said it.

297
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Although the peace talks are over,

298
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
the situation in Yuanzhou

299
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,360
is still uncertain.

300
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Help to organize the southwest border

301
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
is my internal matter.

302
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
But please rest assured.

303
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
I won't be disturbed by the rumors.

304
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Okay.

305
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
This is the place

306
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
I admire the most.

307
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
You can always

308
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
do everything you want.

309
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Today I have something

310
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
for you.

311
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
You need to help me.

312
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,360
You can organize the Black Knight Army.

313
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
I believe

314
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,360
you can help me

315
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
to take care of this person.

316
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
My Lady.

317
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
Those from Yuanzhou

318
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
come back from the Zichuan Talisman

319
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
are not sent to the Hechu Qu.

320
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
The people sent out

321
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,360
can't find the person to reply.

322
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
I will go find them myself.

323
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
My Lady.

324
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
Your Highness, you want to go find them.

325
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
You just want to know

326
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
the situation and location of Zichuan.

327
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
If you really want to go find them,

328
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
I can take you away.

329
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Don't worry.

330
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
I know my uncle

331
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
asked you to supervise me.

332
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
Yes.

333
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
The Lord sent me here.

334
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
But what I told you

335
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
is not a word of concern.

336
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
If you really think it over,

337
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
we can leave now.

338
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
Of course I think it over.

339
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Why do you want to go to Zichuan?

340
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
Are you worried

341
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
which camp he is in

342
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
or where he is now?

343
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
Brother Xiu, he will never betray Zichuan.

344
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
It's obvious.

345
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
You are worried

346
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
is not the first question.

347
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Let's talk about the second one.

348
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
Where is he?

349
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
There are so many spies in the Academy of Law.

350
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
They are all here.

351
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
You and I

352
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
can really find Zichuan?

353
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
I will go back.

354
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Even if we find him,

355
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
as long as today

356
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
you dare to take out the door

357
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
and step forward,

358
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
the hatred of Lord Zichuan

359
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
will increase.

360
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
This is the situation.

361
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
You are willing to see him.

362
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
I will stay in the mansion for a while.

363
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
If you really think it over,

364
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,360
I can leave with you anytime.

365
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,860
Master47

366
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,360
Why are you following me?

367
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Move aside.

368
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Bring me thegas.

369
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,960
Brother Xiu, leave me alone.

370
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,760
All right.

371
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,160
Let me go.

372
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,360
Drop yourself.

373
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,260
Release the animal.

374
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,360
Let the animatronics out.

375
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
Let them out.

376
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
Release it.

377
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
What used is sin?

378
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Slowly, -" tabletended animal"?

379
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,160
Put away the animal.

380
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,880
Let's go.

381
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,720
Let's go.

382
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,600
Let's go.

383
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,240
Let's go.

384
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,840
Something happened.

385
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,040
Azirah burned the flag.

386
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,000
Li Nonggong

387
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,040
and the two of them got together.

388
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,560
Let's go.

389
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,280
Burn him.

390
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,280
Don't kill him.

391
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
The Chuan family is here.

392
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Lord Xiu Chuan.

393
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,600
Azirah almost burned the flag.

394
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
Boss.

395
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,960
The Zichuan family sent someone to assassinate you.

396
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,160
Now you tell us

397
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,560
we are still the Zichuan family?

398
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:07,960
Yes.

399
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,720
Qi Na.

400
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,200
Stop.

401
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,880
Don't be anxious.

402
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,520
Brothers.

403
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,960
Brothers.

404
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,400
I was the one who did this before.

405
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
I implicated everyone.

406
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,200
Please allow me

407
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,200
to tell you

408
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,520
sorry.

409
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,320
Boss.

410
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,320
We are not blaming you.

411
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,400
It's him who didn't want us.

412
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,720
But Zichuan

413
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,360
is always our family.

414
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,160
On this flag,

415
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,240
this silk thread

416
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,480
is a small town in the south of Zichuan.

417
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,720
It's the special city of Jingchuan.

418
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,760
Mingyu.

419
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,560
I remember

420
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,080
your old family is Jingchuan.

421
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,480
Yes.

422
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,440
It's my family.

423
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,120
And the gold wave on the flag.

424
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,800
Only the ancient tower can be built.

425
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,800
Luo Jian.

426
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,440
I remember

427
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,680
you were born in the ancient tower.

428
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,240
I was born in the ancient tower.

429
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,760
In our body,

430
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,800
the blood of Zichuan is always on the ground.

431
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,360
So we must go back to our family.

432
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,320
But sir.

433
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,840
How can we go back?

434
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,200
I want to ask you a question first.

435
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,600
Brothers.

436
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,400
What do you want to get the most?

437
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,560
Mingyu.

438
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,880
Answer me first.

439
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,840
I hope

440
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,040
we can defeat the north and Zichuan family

441
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,640
as soon as possible.

442
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,880
Our commander,

443
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,200
Wujang,

444
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,240
will be released.

445
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,320
Luo Jian.

446
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,880
Tell me the truth.

447
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
I hope

448
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,280
the world will be peaceful.

449
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,400
Do you believe

450
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,360
I can kill you

451
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,320
even if I blind you?

452
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,160
Ze.

453
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,520
Tell me.

454
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,400
I want to marry A'Hua.

455
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,600
Why don't you marry her?

456
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,600
Because I'm poor.

457
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,840
Her father

458
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,920
married her to the Zichuan family.

459
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,320
Why are you laughing?

460
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,880
Aren't you poor?

461
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,680
I'm telling you.

462
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,200
A'Hua likes old people.

463
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,640
Linong.

464
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,640
Tell me.

465
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,640
I want to have money for flower.

466
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,040
I want to buy anything.

467
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,920
I want to buy wine.

468
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,600
I want to buy wine.

469
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,880
I want to drink and pour wine.

470
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,920
I want to have money too.

471
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:38,880
Wait.

472
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,520
I have an idea.

473
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,920
I want to marry a beauty.

474
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,640
A beauty who is gentle and gentle.

475
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,960
Good idea.

476
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,360
Bai Chuan.

477
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,360
Bai Chuan.

478
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,160
I hope you can shut up.

479
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,680
That's right.

480
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,840
You are all right.

481
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,240
You are sincere.

482
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,040
But now,

483
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,520
I can promise you

484
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,840
that with your current conditions,

485
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,400
what you want to get

486
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,960
will not be realized.

487
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
But now,

488
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,120
the truth

489
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,840
is the most precious thing for you.

490
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,560
That is

491
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,160
the chance.

492
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,720
Yes.

493
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,000
It's the chance.

494
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,840
You are right.

495
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,880
But

496
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,160
you are familiar with it.

497
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,520
You are right.

498
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,800
Last time, Mr. Xiu Chuan made a call.

499
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,640
We just joined the Xiu Ziyang.

500
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,080
Yes.

501
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,680
Yes.

502
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,440
Yes.

503
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,320
A'Hua.

504
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,120
Bad news.

505
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:34,800
Come.

506
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,480
Get out of here.

507
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,720
Let me get out of here.

508
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,760
Hurry.

509
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,920
Come on.

510
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,480
This way.

511
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,360
OK.

512
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,760
practising.

513
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,160
Leader Zi.

514
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,400
Listen.

515
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,000
Zichuan.

516
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,040
Someone come up!

517
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,820
You two.

518
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,320
Come on!

519
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,620
Go.

520
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,860
Come on, let's go.

521
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,460
Let's go.

522
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,300
Come on.

523
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,420
What happened?

524
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,560
I have already felt your determination.

525
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,760
I just asked Li Nong well.

526
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,560
The question is, when can we go home?

527
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,960
In fact, this question should be asked by you.

528
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Do you want to be rich or not?

529
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,160
Yes!

530
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
Do you want to return the favor?

531
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,360
Yes!

532
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,760
Do you want to be respected?

533
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,960
Yes!

534
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,360
Good. Then we will rely on our own strength

535
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,160
to return to our home.

536
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,360
Because of my wish,

537
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,360
Zi Chuan doesn't want us anymore.

538
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
But we can't forget that

539
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
we will return from Zi Chuan.

540
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,160
One day, we will return.

541
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,960
We will not only return,

542
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
we will also bring victory back.

543
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,360
We will bring glory back.

544
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
We will bring dignity back.

545
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Boss, we will follow you.

546
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,760
We will live on.

547
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,160
Follow your master and die without returning to the city.

548
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,360
Follow your master and die without returning to the city.

549
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,360
Follow your master and die without returning to the city.

550
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,760
Come.

551
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,560
I, Bai Chuan.

552
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,160
I, Luo Jie.

553
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,160
I, Ming Yu.

554
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,560
I, Xuan Shi.

555
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
I, Zhong Sheng Zhen.

556
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,360
I, Zui Xiao Zhong.

557
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,960
I, Zi Chuan Xiu.

558
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,160
I, Xie Cheng Hui.

559
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,560
I, Zi Bu Yu.

560
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Yes.

561
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,960
Yes.

562
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,160
Yes.

563
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,560
Yes.

564
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,960
Yes.

565
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,560
Yes.

566
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,160
Taijian.

567
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Sir.

568
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,560
Didn't you say that Xiuziyin had returned from Zi Chuan?

569
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,560
How come you just duped Chen Liang?

570
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,960
It's...it's nothing like that.

571
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,160
I can just leave it to Luo Jie and Ming Yu.

572
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,960
But why did you take me to the valley of the past?

573
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,560
It's a way of course.

574
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,560
Do you think I can climb the mountain on my own?

575
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,560
I'm saying why did you come to the valley of the past?

576
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,160
What do you think?

577
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,560
The valley of the past is a harmless day-in and a day-off.

578
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,760
It has separated the domestic and internal states.

579
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,320
He separated the internal and external parts of the family.

580
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,160
The only missing part of the mountain range is the mountain range.

581
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Now the mountain range is not clear.

582
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,280
Don't you really want to turn this ancient mountain range back to Zichuan?

583
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,320
Now that I'm back, there's no point in it.

584
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,520
Bai Chuan, you're my most trusted subordinate.

585
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,120
So, no matter what you see today,

586
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,120
don't be curious. Especially...

587
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,600
You can't tell Luo Jie and Ming Yu. Do you hear me?

588
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
You're so innocent.

589
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,280
Ever since I followed you, I've never felt anything strange.

590
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,080
Then don't you feel strange?

591
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,600
Why is there such an empty cave in this ancient mountain range?

592
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,600
You're so mean.

593
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,000
That's not right. You're blind.

594
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,520
How did you find this path?

595
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,400
I'm familiar with this place.

596
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,800
This way.

597
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,800
You won't understand.

598
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,960
Don't...

599
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,320
Somebody has guessed that it's land.

600
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,000
Bai Block?

601
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,120
Don't go.

602
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,080
IfJeippe is secretly visiting,

603
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,120
go and come to see him.

604
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,480
Go.

605
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,260
Wow.

606
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,100
You can hardly see clearly.

607
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,760
How can the road on the front ambassador be dead?

608
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,840
Bai Chuan, come over here.

609
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,000
You know what's here, right?

610
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,820
Yeah, it is.

611
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,780
There will be many things.

612
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,480
What is this place?

613
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,980
My master's residence.

614
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
Your master?

615
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Who is it?

616
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,480
The left-hand man.

617
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Left-hand man?

618
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
I don't know.

619
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
I don't know.

620
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
I don't know.

621
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
I don't know.

622
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
I don't know.

623
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
I don't know.

624
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
Yes.

625
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Is it a cliff down there?

626
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
Yes.

627
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
You're lying to me again.

628
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
The left-hand man is guarding the Lin family.

629
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
How could he be here?

630
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
My master's old house is in a strange place.

631
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
He's guarding the Lin family everywhere.

632
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
This place is where I studied.

633
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Moreover,

634
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
with our master's tacit understanding,

635
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
when I want to find him,

636
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
he will definitely appear in the world.

637
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
I'm not sure.

638
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
I don't know.

639
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
I don't know.

640
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
When I want to find him,

641
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
he will definitely appear here.

642
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
You're really the disciple of the left-hand man.

643
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Why didn't you say that before?

644
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
It's all my fault.

645
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
I'm too humorous.

646
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
I can't just laugh at my master.

647
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
Moreover,

648
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,480
I can't see it now.

649
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,480
I really can't do anything.

650
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,480
So I can only ask his old house to help me.

651
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
The left-hand man who is always free.

652
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
How could you be such a disciple?

653
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
What's wrong with me?

654
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
My master likes me a lot.

655
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,480
I'm especially young.

656
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Dazhu,

657
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
do you think you can destroy these lies

658
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,480
in my heart?

659
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
What's wrong?

660
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,480
Now, on your left-hand side and right-hand side,

661
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
the left-hand side and the right-hand side,

662
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
and your back,

663
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
are you still alive?

664
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Yes.

665
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Look carefully.

666
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Did you light it?

667
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
No.

668
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
This time, I will definitely light it.

669
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
Did you light it?

670
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,480
No.

671
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Okay, okay, okay.

672
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
Master, master.

673
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
I kneeled down for you.

674
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Please light the lantern.

675
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
I beg you.

676
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Did you light it?

677
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Yes.

678
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
No.

679
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
You...

680
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Are you in front of me now?

681
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
When I kneel down,

682
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
how could you be in front of me?

683
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
Bai Chuan, you...

684
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
Forget it.

685
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Do you think this place

686
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
makes you very surprised?

687
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Don't pretend to be a ghost.

688
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
What's going on with this torch?

689
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
It shows that we're on the right path.

690
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
If you don't talk to me,

691
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
I'll keep you here.

692
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
No, no, no.

693
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Although this cave is familiar,

694
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,480
but the way out and back

695
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
still depends on you.

696
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
It's good to know.

697
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
What is this place?

698
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
Didn't you notice that

699
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,480
we didn't go straight

700
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
when we just came in?

701
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
But we went around various places.

702
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
My master's old man is very clever.

703
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
Otherwise,

704
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
we wouldn't have found

705
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
any small fish or shrimp.

706
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
You mean

707
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
this cave is a maze?

708
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
It's still a maze

709
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
that I've been following for a long time.

710
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
That's right.

711
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
This is the maze.

712
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Once you go wrong,

713
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,480
you will always be lost in this maze.

714
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Where can you go?

715
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Zichuan.

716
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
Zichuan?

717
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
Yes.

718
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
This maze is under the ancient mountain.

719
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
It actually has the entire ancient mountain.

720
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
Didn't I tell you?

721
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
My master is very clever.

722
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
How can you be so easy?

723
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Do you know what this means?

724
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,480
If the name of the night is different,

725
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,480
this is the only way

726
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
to go through Zichuan.

727
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,480
If the future embroidery is different,

728
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,480
then this passage

729
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
can not only transport soldiers,

730
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,480
but also can trigger the flag of Yuanzhou

731
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
and can be a key to breaking Yuanzhou.

732
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
By the way,

733
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,480
do you have anything else to ask?

734
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Why do you want me to know

735
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
the existence of this passage?

736
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Because you

737
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
are my most loyal idol,

738
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
and also my favorite brother.

739
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
How is it?

740
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
I'm not sure.

741
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
I'm just a little bit worried.

742
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,480
I'm just a little bit worried.

743
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
But you are my most beloved brother.

744
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
How is it?

745
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Do you feel touched by this?

746
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Here.

747
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
If you're touched,

748
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
then hold it.

749
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
I'm a woman.

750
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Okay.

751
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
I'm sorry.

752
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,480
You are my best sister.

753
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
All right?

754
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Here.

755
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Hold it.

756
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Hold it.

757
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
This way.

758
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
Okay.

759
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Slowly.

760
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
Slowly.

761
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
There is no treasure here.

762
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Are you ready?

763
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
What are you going to do?

764
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
Sir.

765
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Mr. Xiu.

766
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
Zi Chuan Xiu.

767
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Mr. Xiu.

768
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Sir.

769
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,480
Zi Chuan Xiu.

770
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Where are you, Zi Chuan Xiu?

771
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
I'm here.

772
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
What is this place?

773
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Did you say it?

774
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
This is the residence of my master.

775
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
Why did you suddenly disappear?

776
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
I went to see my master.

777
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Where did you go?

778
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,480
Why didn't I see anything?

779
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
You didn't see anything, right?

780
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
That means you don't have enough power.

781
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
I usually tell you

782
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
to learn from me.

783
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
You won't listen.

784
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Now you know my difference.

785
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,480
If you really see Zuo Jiaming,

786
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,480
why are your eyes still blind?

787
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Well,

788
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
my master is a good doctor.

789
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,480
He is a professional doctor.

790
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
He doesn't even care about my little things.

791
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
You came to see my eyes, didn't you?

792
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,480
It doesn't matter.

793
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,480
My master saw it too.

794
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
We should go now.

795
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
Tell me clearly

796
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
why did you suddenly disappear?

797
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
Why did you suddenly appear?

798
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,480
I'll tell you later.

799
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
Let's go now.

800
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Wait.

801
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
Be careful.

802
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
Be careful.

803
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
You are still here?

804
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
Your Majesty.

805
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
We have sent

806
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
a few teams

807
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,480
to find Zichuan Xiu.

808
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
But there is no way out.

809
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Zichuan Xiu is indeed a crime.

810
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
But now,

811
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,480
this person's death

812
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
is not a single cause.

813
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
As long as he can't return to Zichuan,

814
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
this person's life

815
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
will be divided into two.

816
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,480
So

817
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,480
you don't have to worry about it.

818
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,480
When the former commander of Zichuan family

819
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Zichuan Yuanxing was in position,

820
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,480
Zichuan settled down and conquered the people.

821
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
Ge Yingxing, the commander of Yuanzhou,

822
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
was a member of the army in the north.

823
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
Now,

824
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,480
the two armies have returned to the heaven.

825
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Now,

826
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
this is the time

827
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
when the Zichuan family

828
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
is in a bad state.

829
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
We should use this

830
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
difficult time.

831
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,480
Your Majesty.

832
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Zichuan family has a land,

833
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
a private forest,

834
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
and a military base

835
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,480
that Zichuan Xiu has built.

836
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
And my north tribe

837
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
has a general like General Yu Lin,

838
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
a very good man

839
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
who is very good at fighting.

840
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
This is

841
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
the new skill.

842
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
We still need to progress.

843
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480
General Mo, please.

844
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
These are the reports

845
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
from Yuanzhou

846
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
that I sent

847
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
to the border.

848
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
But the content is the same as before.

849
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
Xiu

850
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,480
was sealed by Sai Rong God,

851
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Yuanzhou's great master.

852
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
He was completely betrayed.

853
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,480
It's useless news again.

854
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
How about this?

855
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
He told you

856
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
that it's the same news.

857
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
It's a good news.

858
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Sai Rong God's fire

859
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
is the main focus this time.

860
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
To Zichuan,

861
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,480
it's indeed the first time.

862
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,480
But there is one thing that's good.

863
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,480
At least Xiu is innocent.

864
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,480
It's actually simple.

865
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,480
If we take care of it in the capital,

866
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Xiu and I

867
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
will go to the capital.

868
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
We can help him

869
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,480
to clear his mind.

870
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,480
It's not that simple.

871
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
Now that the war is over,

872
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
we need to make a decision.

873
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
People don't care about the truth.

874
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
What they need

875
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
is to make a declaration.

876
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,480
When the war was over,

877
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
the army of Linbin

878
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
left the Wanyun.

879
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,480
They went to look for

880
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,480
the whereabouts of the Zichuan Xiu.

881
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
But in the map,

882
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
they were surrounded by the northern army.

883
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
They were killed by the attack.

884
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
Thank you, the army of Linbin.

885
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
But Yuanzhou,

886
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
he doesn't belong to us.

887
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,480
If he goes out to look for something,

888
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,480
I think he will be killed.

889
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
If he is a traitor,

890
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
how can he be killed?

891
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Xiao Ning,

892
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
why are you here?

893
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
Didn't you ask me

894
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
to attend the meeting?

895
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
Do you want to learn from everyone?

896
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
I just heard

897
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,480
the report of Lord Luo Minghai.

898
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,480
I think we can't let it go.

899
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Okay, okay.

900
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,480
Uncle asked you to sit here.

901
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,480
Come.

902
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
Come, come.

903
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
Sit here and talk.

904
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
The big fire is still on.

905
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Everyone, please sit.

906
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,480
You all said that

907
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
the Zichuan Xiu is a traitor.

908
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,480
It's the biggest insult

909
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,480
from the Zichuan family for 100 years.

910
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
It's a shame.

911
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
How can you let him

912
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
be killed by a traitor like this?

913
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,480
You think so, Lord Luo?

914
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Yes.

915
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,480
I'm willing to take a army

916
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,480
to go to Yuanzhou

917
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,480
and kill the Zichuan Xiu.

918
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,480
Everyone,

919
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
please don't be afraid.

920
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
Please.

921
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480
I won't be afraid.

922
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,480
Xiao Ning,

923
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
I will teach you

924
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,480
how to take care of him.

925
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,480
What do you want?

926
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,480
I've said so many things.

927
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,480
You should have a reply.

928
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,480
Lord Ning,

929
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
let's go first.

930
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,480
Didn't you say that he is a traitor?

931
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,480
Then why didn't you

932
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,480
catch him and kill him?

933
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,480
Lord Ning,

934
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,480
isn't there a better way?

935
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
The bastard.

936
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,440
I can only

937
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,480
criticize the child.

938
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:41,980
Come on.

939
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,480
It's time to end the game here.

940
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,480
Let's go.

941
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,320
Yっと,

942
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,520
OK.

943
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,360
I know you want to sell me out.

944
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,560
Just say it.

945
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
No.

946
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,480
You're brave today in the court.

947
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,480
Brave?

948
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,480
But it's useless.

949
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,480
Indeed.

950
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
But you're more powerful than you're shouting at me.

951
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,480
It's different now.

952
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,480
I was in a mess with my uncle.

953
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,480
He was always soft-hearted.

954
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,480
He wouldn't even care about me.

955
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
I know I'm stupid and stupid.

956
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,480
But I just can't think of a better way.

957
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,480
I just don't want to do anything.

958
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,480
Your Highness.

959
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,480
You can do a lot.

960
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,480
Have you prepared for him?

961
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,480
Yes.

962
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,480
One more.

963
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,480
I'm the leader of the Chuan family.

964
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,480
The people's laughter is so good in front of the god.

965
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,480
Pan Qing, you're so good at this.

966
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,480
You're so smart.

967
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,480
Let's go.

968
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,480
Move.

969
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,480
Don't be angry.

970
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,480
I'm sorry.

971
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
Come on.

972
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,480
Come on.

973
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,480
Kill him.

974
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,480
How did he get away?

975
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,480
I've warned you.

976
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,480
You can't do much.

977
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,480
One day, you'll regret it.

978
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,480
Sorry.

979
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,480
Sorry.

980
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,480
Your Excellency.

981
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,480
I'm sorry.

982
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,480
One more.

983
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,480
Your Excellency.

984
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,480
Your Excellency.

985
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,480
I'm sorry.

986
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,480
You can't do much in front of the god.

987
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,480
You can't do much.

988
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,480
No.

989
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,480
No.

990
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,480
Your Excellency.

991
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,480
Your Excellency.

992
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,480
Your Excellency.

993
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,480
I'm sorry.

994
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,480
You can't do much.

995
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,480
Your Excellency.

996
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,480
I'm sorry.

997
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,480
Your Excellency.

998
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,480
The future is determined by the heart.

999
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,480
The future is determined by the common.

1000
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,480
I haven't been here for a hundred years.

1001
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,480
I haven't been here for a hundred years.

1002
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,480
I'm sorry.

1003
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,480
I've been here for a hundred years.

1004
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,480
At the same time,

1005
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,480
I'm like a village head.

1006
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,480
I'm sorry.

1007
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,480
He didn't even come back then.

1008
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,480
I'm sorry.

1009
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,480
All the evidence is too simple and simple.

1010
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,480
We can't use a few sentences to make a decision.

1011
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,480
I'm sorry.
