coma

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The most beautiful night in the world

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The most beautiful night in the world

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The most beautiful night in the world

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The most beautiful night in the world

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The most beautiful night in the world

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The most beautiful night in the world

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The most beautiful night in the world

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The most beautiful night in the world

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The most beautiful night in the world

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The most beautiful night in the world

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The most beautiful night in the world

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The most beautiful night in the world

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The most beautiful night in the world

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The most beautiful night in the world

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For a thousand years

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Together, we stand as one

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Fighting with all odds

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Fighting with all odds

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Fighting with all odds

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
On this vast land of West Chuan

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
On this vast land of West Chuan

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,920
The power of the family was broken.

24
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,760
In the battle,

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,800
Zichuan and the Northern clan fought for years.

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,400
They were enemies.

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,000
As an orphan,

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,080
he was adopted by the chief of the Zichuan family,

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,000
Yuan Xing.

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
He married the heir of the family, Zichuan Ning.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
They married.

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,200
He married the chief of the Shulü Bureau, Di Lin.

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,440
The leader of the Di Shu Army, Si Yi Lin.

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,800
They became brothers.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
They wanted to protect the peace of Zichuan.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,000
They were sent to the front line of Yuanzhou.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,200
Zichuan Xiu, who had been waiting for years,

38
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,120
returned to the capital after the battle.

39
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,400
But they found that their family was in danger.

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,720
There were Yang Minghua, who was ambitious and had no plans.

41
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,200
There were Northern clans who were causing trouble.

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,000
They were all in a hurry.

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Zichuan Xiu and Di Lin and Si Yi Lin

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,600
solved Yang Minghua's rebellion together

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,200
and successfully guarded the capital.

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,200
But it was hard to stop the smoke from rising.

47
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,000
Yang Minghua's subordinate, General Lei Hong,

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,800
colluded with the Northern clan

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,600
to officially issue a fierce attack on Zichuan.

50
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,200
He had taken the last barrier of Zichuan.

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,000
He was defeated.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,400
Zichuan Xiu and Si Yi Lin ran to Paiyi

53
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,200
to capture the city and seriously injured the enemy general.

54
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,600
The Northern clan suffered heavy casualties.

55
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,200
However, the Northern clan sent Lei Hong again

56
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,800
to lead the army to attack Paiyi.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,600
The food was short and the casualties were heavy.

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,200
Zichuan Xiu and Si Yi Lin

59
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,000
could only lead the soldiers to fight the enemy.

60
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,400
At this time, Di Lin who was guarding the capital

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,400
was ordered to lead the army to Paiyi.

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,800
The three brothers finally joined hands

63
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,600
and decided to fight together to protect Zichuan.

64
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
You're going to surrender?

65
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Didn't you just say that their actions were very stupid?

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,400
That's right. The two of them are the most stupid idiots.

67
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,600
I'm the third idiot.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,600
The End

69
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,600
Miss, an officer wants to see you.

70
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
I don't think I've seen him before. He's a little strange.

71
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,000
Could it be that some new officer wants to flatter you?

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,400
It seems to be called Ma Wei.

73
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll go ask him to leave.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What new officer?

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He's the youngest

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I sent many people to Yuanzhou to search for Xiu.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He wasn't there before.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But yesterday, my men have already found Xiu Ziying's camp.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
When we arrived at the camp, there was no one.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We didn't find Xiu.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But after the inspection, the whole camp was not attacked.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's obvious that the soldiers have a good reason to leave.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I think that when Xiu leaves, people will be safe.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Since Xiu has left the camp safely,

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
he might have been on his way back with his men.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Your Highness, this is good news.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That guy seems to run faster than anyone.

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But he definitely won't leave Si Yiling alone.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He must have heard about it.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So he left the camp to support him.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Then...

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If Si Yiling gets Xiu's help,

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
he will definitely help him.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But this time, the Northern Army has a lot of troops.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm afraid that they won't be able to fight against each other.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But if they are really together,

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
they can support each other.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The front line is a small battle.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The news will definitely reach the capital.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But there is no news yet.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It means that they are safe for now.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I will continue to search for Xiu and Si Yiling's whereabouts.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If there is news, I will report it to you.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Thank you, Sir.

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It seems that you are worried too much.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What's wrong?

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You are worried that this news will make you more worried.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I just promised you before.

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can't lie.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I can only tell the truth.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I didn't expect that you didn't mess up the truth.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This was all because of that guy Zi Chuan Xiu.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He went to Yuan Zhou for seven years.

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He didn't get lost in the desert for three days.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He was trapped in the battle.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I feel relieved that Si Yiling is with him.

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You really love Xiu.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What's wrong?

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I was worried that you were worried.

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So I arranged a place to relax.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But now I am worried.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Forget it.

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I will invite you to come again.

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I will leave now.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If there is any news, I will tell you immediately.

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Sir, please wait.

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't know what you have done.

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I have a few horses.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I wanted to ask you to ride with me.

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But if you don't want to.

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I used to have a horse.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I used to have a pair of horses.

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But I lost them.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's go.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Please.

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why do I feel like I have been here before?

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Your highness.

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We met each other when we were kids.

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Right here.

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
When you came with the commander.

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This road is beautiful.

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But it's too dark.

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's painful.

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If there is a road with cold, it will be comfortable.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Then I asked my father to take the trees.

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's comfortable to ride in the sun.

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I didn't expect that I would have the chance to invite you here.

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I was young and I didn't mean it.

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I didn't expect you would remember it.

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I remember I rolled down from the rock.

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
A boy helped me.

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
He is also a girl of the horse.

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We are the same age.

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You don't have to be so polite.

156
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Just call me horse.

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Your highness.

158
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
How about riding the horse?

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What about you?

160
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I will be your father.

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Come.

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Come.

163
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I remember we loved to ride horses when we were kids.

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I asked him to teach me.

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But he didn't want to.

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I competed with him and I won.

167
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Lord Xiu is so considerate.

168
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He told you on purpose to make you happy.

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes.

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I thought I could win because I was better than him.

171
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But I found he was the one who let me win.

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I will compete with him when he comes back.

173
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What's wrong?

174
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You know what?

175
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The food of Xiu's camp and the army of the earth army is less than ten days.

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
If we are trapped here, we will starve to death.

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't believe it.

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The soldiers of the north can't get out of the water.

179
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes.

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We can escape if we find the exit.

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes.

182
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You want to escape?

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Who wants to escape?

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Think about it.

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The adults are busy with the group.

186
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If we can find the exit first and get some food,

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
it will be a great achievement.

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We will not only get the reward,

189
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
but also get a father's bell.

190
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Are you sure?

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I have asked the brothers of Fang Shao.

192
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The construction outside the east gate has been damaged.

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It must be the soldiers of the north who have been working on the construction.

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And they haven't found the north's action recently.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's a good time.

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The most important thing is that

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
there are many mountains and forests outside the east gate.

198
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's like a fire station at this time.

199
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's all over the place.

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Sir, bad news.

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The escapee soldiers of the east gate of Pa Yi City

202
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
have been hit by the brothers of Fang Shao.

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
They have escaped out of the city.

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Which army?

205
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The people from the sleeve camp.

206
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The smell of nature.

207
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Lower your voice and bring the lantern.

208
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I didn't expect it to come out like this.

209
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Not only is there no one chasing,

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
there is no one from the north.

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Just say it.

212
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
How can the soldiers of the north

213
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
make such a big Pa Yi City's water line different?

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Even if it's the north's army,

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
it's still the same.

216
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Wait.

217
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Be alert.

218
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Boss.

219
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Don't talk nonsense.

220
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Hurry up and go back.

221
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Be careful of ambush.

222
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Boss, listen to me.

223
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
There are no soldiers from the north on this road.

224
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We have already found the way out.

225
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You went out of the city without permission.

226
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And you were treated as escapee soldiers by the Dishu Army.

227
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Lord Xiuchuan risked his life to find you.

228
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If you are not careful,

229
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
everyone will be killed.

230
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You are not the only one who is in danger.

231
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You are the only one who is in danger.

232
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You are the only one who is in danger.

233
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You are the only one who is in danger.

234
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You are the only one who is in danger.

235
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You are the only one who is in danger.

236
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I came to find you without permission.

237
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If you are not careful,

238
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
everyone will be killed.

239
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Hurry up and go.

240
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We are not escaping.

241
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You are trapped in the city and waiting for death.

242
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You'd better come out and find a way out.

243
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Do you think the north people are fools?

244
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Can't they see such a big hole?

245
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
General, the enemy is high.

246
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The forest at this time

247
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
is almost unreachable for them.

248
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's too tempting.

249
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Believe me.

250
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We will definitely go out of the city.

251
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
We are not only going out of the city,

252
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
but also for our dead brothers.

253
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We will get back the blood debt

254
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and drive the north people back to their hometown.

255
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Boss, can you do it?

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Don't forget.

257
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Who brought you to make a fortune?

258
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Who made you from poor to rich?

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I guarantee my personality.

260
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Do you believe me?

261
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Boss,

262
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
when did you have a personality?

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You...

264
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There is an ambush.

265
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Hurry up and go to the gate.

266
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Go.

267
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Okay.

268
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Stop.

269
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Go.

270
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Boss, I caught this rabbit in the middle of the chaos.

271
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Go back.

272
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Just get married to the brothers.

273
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Bai Chun, cover me.

274
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Get up.

275
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Go.

276
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Go.

277
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Go.

278
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Go.

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Go.

280
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Go.

281
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Go.

282
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Go.

283
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Go.

284
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Go.

285
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Go.

286
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Go.

287
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Go.

288
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Go.

289
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Go.

290
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Get up.

291
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Boss, I'm sorry.

292
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Shut up.

293
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Chase.

294
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Hurry up.

295
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Stop.

296
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Hold on.

297
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Luo Jin is right in front of us.

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I have no chance to fight.

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Please punish me.

300
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The trap outside the east gate

301
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
is not only to catch fish,

302
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
but also to release fish.

303
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So that they know that it is difficult to break out of the city,

304
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and thus destroy their mental power.

305
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
This way,

306
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
they will make a mess.

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm afraid that the food in the city is limited.

308
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They won't last for a few days.

309
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But the soldiers in Zichuan

311
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
are not only skilled,

312
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
but also well-prepared.

313
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
They react quickly.

314
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Unless Zichuan gives up on them,

315
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
otherwise,

316
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
this battle will be difficult.

317
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I will tell them to block the news.

318
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Send more troops to search the road.

319
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
If they see Zichuan's soldiers,

320
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
they will be killed immediately.

321
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
We will be on guard.

322
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes, sir.

323
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Here, drink some water.

324
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Brother,

325
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
brother,

326
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
you are lucky.

327
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Otherwise,

328
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I would burn paper money for you.

329
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I hope that

330
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I can hurt you more.

331
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Maybe,

332
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Lord Xiu will not punish me anymore.

333
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
My wild smell,

334
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
my fire room.

335
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Brother,

336
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Lord Xiu Chuang is here.

337
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Hurry up.

338
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Brother,

339
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm counting on you.

340
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Zi'er,

341
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
my good brother.

342
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Mocai,

343
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
is he awake?

344
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I think he is dead.

345
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Dead?

346
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's a pity that he can't wake up.

347
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I will go to find him.

348
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It seems that

349
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
he can't eat my wild smell.

350
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I can only share it with Si Yilin.

351
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Sir,

352
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
where am I?

353
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
A Ze,

354
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
why are you awake?

355
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
This wild smell,

356
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
it's not suitable for him.

357
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I will send someone

358
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
to make porridge for him.

359
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Sir,

360
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I need to go to the toilet.

361
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I need to take a bath.

362
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yes, yes, yes.

363
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Take a bath.

364
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Xiu Ziying, Mocai,

365
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Xiu Ziying, A Ze,

366
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm here.

367
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You just forget it.

368
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You two

369
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
haven't improved at all.

370
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I haven't

371
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
found you two to settle the score.

372
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You two

373
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
almost fell into other people's trap

374
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and became other people's prey.

375
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Just like this.

376
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You have been with me for so long.

377
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Haven't you improved at all?

378
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That

379
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
is clearly the trap

380
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
that others set for you.

381
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Sir,

382
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
it's all our fault.

383
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
We were too short-sighted

384
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
and almost got you into trouble.

385
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Please punish us.

386
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Fine.

387
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Then I will

388
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
punish you three

389
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
for not eating.

390
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Don't do that.

391
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You'd better shoot us

392
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
with one arrow.

393
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's easy.

394
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's cheaper for you.

395
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Sir,

396
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
my A Ze is not a hypocritical person.

397
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
From now on,

398
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
we are brothers

399
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
who have been born to this world,

400
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
and we will live in a whole far away land.

401
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
No.

402
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We will live in the whole Xichuan Continent.

403
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You are the only boss that I will acknowledge.

404
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Have you been in this room

405
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
for too long?

406
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I am.

407
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I've been there for seven years

408
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and I have never been in this situation.

409
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I've been there for seven years

410
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and I have never been in this situation.

411
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I've been there for seven years

412
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
I only recognize you as the boss.

413
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,080
My lord.

414
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,880
My lord.

415
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,720
The brothers are having a bad marriage again.

416
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,280
And everyone heard that Mao Cai and A Ze

417
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,800
failed to attack from the east gate.

418
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,200
Now they think this Paiye

419
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,400
is more hopeless.

420
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
And their emotions are a little out of control.

421
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,760
Especially the people.

422
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,600
A Ze.

423
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,000
Mao Cai.

424
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,640
You can stop talking nonsense.

425
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,680
But you have to help me

426
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,200
with something.

427
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,560
Boss.

428
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,280
What's the matter?

429
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,120
Other world.

430
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,240
Everyone knows

431
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,760
that we have sapaxi

432
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:28,880
but not so much.

433
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
The bees

434
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,360
are here to allt βo t our food

435
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,800
in the Paiye city.

436
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,280
We can't let them succeed.

437
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,680
But we can't let them succeed.

438
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,080
Yes.

439
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
We can't let them succeed.

440
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,720
That's right.

441
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,600
Yes.

442
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,280
We can't let them succeed.

443
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,520
Well said.

444
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
So now,

445
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,760
I'm going to teach you

446
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,680
a secret martial art

447
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,280
that I've learned all my life.

448
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,480
Secret martial art?

449
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,280
Secret martial art?

450
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:02,960
Really?

451
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,680
Really?

452
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,160
Really?

453
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,680
It's called the Ten-Qi-Metal Technique.

454
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's not only able to

455
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,720
kill enemies and enemies

456
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,280
without feeling hungry in three days.

457
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,080
It's like a mirror.

458
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,680
Sir,

459
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,600
why didn't you teach us

460
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,040
such a powerful martial art earlier?

461
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,240
It's a price to pay

462
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,120
to learn this martial art.

463
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,840
I won't teach you

464
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,400
until I have to.

465
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
If you get hungry for seven days and seven nights,

466
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,120
would you like to do it?

467
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,920
We would.

468
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,280
Right, brothers?

469
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,000
Yes.

470
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,880
Sir,

471
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,520
please give us a lesson.

472
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,840
Okay.

473
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,840
Breathe.

474
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,760
Breathe.

475
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,000
Breathe again.

476
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,520
Breathe again.

477
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,880
Sir, isn't it just a breath?

478
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,040
What breath?

479
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
Sir, it's called deep breathing.

480
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,080
It's called the Ten-Qi-Metal Technique.

481
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,200
It absorbs the essence of the world

482
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,640
and the spirit of everything.

483
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,160
This way,

484
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,400
you can replenish your energy.

485
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,920
You won't feel hungry

486
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,200
even if you don't eat for a few days.

487
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,080
Tao,

488
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,320
you're a good student.

489
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,160
Luo Jie,

490
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,720
come up and try it.

491
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,000
Follow me.

492
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Breathe.

493
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,440
Breathe.

494
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,880
It's like mutton.

495
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,720
You haven't taken a bath for days.

496
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,320
Isn't it interesting?

497
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,600
Luo Jie,

498
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,040
go on with your training.

499
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,720
Me?

500
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,640
Everyone, go away.

501
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,680
Go on with your training.

502
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,920
Go on with your training.

503
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,800
Yun Qian Xue

504
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,280
did it on purpose.

505
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,920
He disturbed the morale of the army

506
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,040
and made us panic.

507
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,720
Although I made this Ten-Qi-Metal Technique

508
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,160
up to the limit,

509
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,000
at least

510
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,160
I can give them

511
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,400
hope to hold on.

512
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,200
We've been starving

513
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,240
to death.

514
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,680
The people in the city

515
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,720
are dying.

516
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,240
Some of them have escaped.

517
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,680
I plan to open a warehouse and release food.

518
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,240
I support you.

519
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,120
At this time,

520
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,640
we should hold on to the army.

521
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,200
I'm afraid we can't hold on for long.

522
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,880
I hope

523
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,160
it can help

524
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,200
our people.

525
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,920
Well,

526
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,240
let's enter the Imperial Palace first.

527
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,200
Lord,

528
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,880
we've already took control of

529
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,600
Northern backyard bodge,

530
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,120
military traveling forces and some patrol force.

531
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,120
According to what the residents came out,

532
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
I'll use their blood

533
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,120
to sacrifice tens of thousands of soldiers of the Purple Mountain

534
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
to cut their heads off

535
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
and throw them into the Wastewater River.

536
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
Yes.

537
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Let them know that the Lord is here.

538
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
Speed up and keep moving.

539
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Yes.

540
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
Let's go!

541
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Let's go.

542
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
Come on.

543
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Tonight is the best time

544
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
to seal off the fire.

545
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Send my order.

546
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Prepare for the attack.

547
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Yes.

548
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
Report!

549
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Report!

550
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
What happened?

551
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Why are you so panicked?

552
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
Your Highness,

553
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
I have a team of soldiers

554
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
and a team of patrols

555
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
all killed.

556
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
The death is cruel.

557
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
All the heads

558
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
were cut off

559
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
and thrown into the Wastewater River.

560
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
How could the death be...

561
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
The imperial spirit is here.

562
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
How could the imperial spirit

563
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
appear suddenly?

564
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Why didn't you tell us

565
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
when we arrived at the Paiye?

566
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
Why didn't you tell us

567
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
when we arrived at the Paiye?

568
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
The imperial spirit was everywhere.

569
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
They killed people,

570
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
and they raided villages.

571
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
There were no soldiers

572
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
who survived

573
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
and told us in advance.

574
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,120
This is a difficult task.

575
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
It's hard to threaten

576
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
the rear of my camp.

577
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Such a weak support,

578
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
what strategy is it?

579
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,120
Don't worry about the strategy.

580
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
This imperial spirit

581
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
is our enemy.

582
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
If it's here to support Si Yilin,

583
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,120
it's very unfavorable to us.

584
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,120
And the opportunity it has this time

585
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
is not worth it.

586
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,120
Send my order.

587
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
Return to the city.

588
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
Yes.

589
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
Yes.

590
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
The imperial spirit

591
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
is here.

592
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Yes.

593
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
This battle

594
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,120
is getting more and more interesting.

595
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
No matter what,

596
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
we can't let him

597
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
get in touch with the city

598
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
and find a chance.

599
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
My lord,

600
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
this is the plan

601
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
that the general of the Northern tribe,

602
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,120
Yun Qianxue,

603
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
has brought to the army of the forest.

604
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,120
And this is

605
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,120
the Paiyi City

606
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
where Si Yilin is.

607
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
Most of the northern generals are crazy.

608
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Without Yun Qianxue,

609
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
Yan Jing,

610
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,120
a simple task

611
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,120
can be seen by him.

612
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
He can even

613
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
install fire-resistant devices at any time.

614
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Now Paiyi

615
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
is surrounded like a steel barrel.

616
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,120
It's hard for the people inside to get out.

617
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
Yan Jing.

618
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,120
There will be a big storm today.

619
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
The storm is the best time

620
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
to block the fire.

621
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
If we come an hour later,

622
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
it's hard for Paiyi

623
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
to come back to the sky.

624
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
My lord,

625
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
should we attack the enemy camp

626
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
or attack Paiyi

627
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
together?

628
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
The gap is too big.

629
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
If we attack them,

630
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
we can't take the risk.

631
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
We can't take the risk.

632
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
What if they attack us

633
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
in the future?

634
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
We can't...

635
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
I know Yun Qianxue.

636
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
His advantage is Yan Jing.

637
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
But his disadvantage

638
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,120
is that he is too strict.

639
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
I hope

640
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
he can hesitate for a little longer.

641
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
We need time, too.

642
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Is this an old horse?

643
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
They are waiting for the dead.

644
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
War is a rare thing.

645
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
The dead are very lucky.

646
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
This time,

647
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
the two tribes have met.

648
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Many people have lost their lives.

649
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
The dead are not alive.

650
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,120
They are not buried

651
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,120
in the battlefield.

652
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
In the troubled world,

653
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
they are the only ones

654
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
who are witnessing and commemorating.

655
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Is your mind

656
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
kind?

657
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
I'm not kind.

658
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,120
I'm just a commoner.

659
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
I have peace to be happy.

660
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
I'm happy to be with you.

661
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,400
The war

662
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
is coming.

663
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
When the war is over,

664
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
it will be another bad battle.

665
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
At that time,

666
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
more Northern tribes

667
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
and the soldiers of the Purple River will die.

668
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
The people will not be cut off

669
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
and the war will not end.

670
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
When will the consumption

671
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
of the two tribes be over?

672
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
Brothers,

673
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
our Dishu Army

674
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
and the Xiuzi Camp

675
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,000
have been

676
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
suffering from family illness.

677
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
We have experienced

678
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
too much on this journey.

679
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Now outside the Paiyi City,

680
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
there are only Northern tribes and tiger tribes.

681
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
In the Paiyi City,

682
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
we have insufficient food and clothing.

683
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
I know that

684
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
everyone is having a hard time.

685
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,120
I also know that

686
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
everyone is hungry.

687
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
I hope that

688
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
everyone can hold on.

689
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,120
I hope that

690
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
everyone can hold on.

691
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
Everyone,

692
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,120
the famous strategist,

693
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
the famous king of the Zuo family

694
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
once said that

695
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
the most important factor

696
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
in war

697
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
is to hold on.

698
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
Hold on.

699
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Still hold on.

700
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
In order to

701
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
hold on better,

702
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
we have prepared

703
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
food that can strengthen the body,

704
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
replenish the body,

705
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,120
and make it sweet

706
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
and delicious.

707
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Good.

708
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
Good.

709
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
Good.

710
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Go.

711
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Come, come, come.

712
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
The people behind.

713
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120
It smells so good.

714
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Don't rush.

715
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,120
Come one by one.

716
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,120
Sir,

717
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,120
give me a bowl.

718
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Give me a bowl first.

719
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Hurry up.

720
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,120
Come, come, come.

721
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,120
Next one.

722
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
It's almost done.

723
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,120
Take a bite.

724
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
I don't want to eat.

725
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,120
Sir.

726
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Sir,

727
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
I know you don't want to eat.

728
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Do you think I want to?

729
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
All the brothers are here.

730
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
You have to be a leader.

731
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,120
It's salty.

732
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
It's the taste of salt.

733
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
It's delicious.

734
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,140
Since I entered the

735
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,140
Fatty's House,

736
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,140
this is the first time

737
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,140
I've eaten salt.

738
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,140
Come, come, come.

739
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
Brothers,

740
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
eat and drink it.

741
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,140
Good.

742
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
Good.

743
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,140
There's salt and meat.

744
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,140
They are all things that

745
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,140
replenish your physical strength.

746
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,140
Everyone, eat some.

747
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
Good.

748
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,140
Good.

749
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,140
Second Brother,

750
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,140
don't be so depressed.

751
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,140
This is not what you should have

752
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
in the Purple-Square Tiger.

753
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
If I were really the Purple-Square Tiger,

754
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,140
I would rather cut down on my bones

755
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,140
and share it with them.

756
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,140
When I was in Hengchuan,

757
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,140
I was the most important person

758
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,140
in the whole world.

759
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,160
When I was in Hengchuan,

760
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,160
I also killed a group of people

761
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,160
and followed my five-year war horse.

762
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
We are incompetent.

763
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Second Brother,

764
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,160
let's say

765
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
the horse is our master,

766
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
and they are in the Fatty's House,

767
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
it's hard to guard the city.

768
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,160
What would you do?

769
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Do you remember what you said?

770
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Cut down on my bones and share it with them.

771
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
I underestimated our war horse.

772
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
They are all heroes.

773
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
I have an idea.

774
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Second Brother,

775
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,160
in this situation,

776
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,160
I'm afraid that the only way

777
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
to break the situation is to kill each other.

778
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,180
I promise you,

779
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,180
you can't think of a better plan.

780
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,180
That's right.

781
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,180
It's not a good idea.

782
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,180
I'll lead five thousand cavalry

783
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,180
to fight against Yun Qianxuan.

784
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,180
At this time, we will split a crack.

785
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,180
You and your Xiuzi Camp

786
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,180
will take the people away.

787
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,180
Second Brother,

788
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,180
you and those five thousand soldiers

789
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,180
will die.

790
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,180
This is the best way I can think of.

791
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,180
It's not the best.

792
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,180
That's right.

793
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,180
If he's here,

794
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,180
he will definitely come.

795
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,180
He will definitely not abandon us.

796
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,180
Brothers,

797
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,180
I'll show you today

798
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,200
how powerful I am.

799
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Boss.

800
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Boss.

801
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Big Brother,

802
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
you're a little late today.

803
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
We've been bullied for a long time.

804
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Big Brother,

805
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
how do you know we're here?

806
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
What's so strange about that?

807
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
Big Brother always appears in time.

808
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
When do you have the heart to say that?

809
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,200
Can you two

810
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
choose to fight against me?

811
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,220
Can you two

812
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,220
stop bothering me with these things?

813
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,220
You and Xiu.

814
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,220
You're not stupid enough

815
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,220
to find me at once.

816
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,220
You're a fool too.

817
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,220
You'll get hurt if he comes.

818
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,220
What about you?

819
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,220
Knowing you two,

820
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,220
I'm the biggest fool.

821
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,220
If Big Brother knows

822
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,240
that we're in the city of Paiyi,

823
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,240
he will definitely come.

824
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,240
But outside of Paiyi,

825
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,240
there are all the Northern soldiers.

826
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,240
How can he come in?

827
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
This is not far away.

828
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
For him,

829
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
it's all very simple.

830
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
Sir,

831
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,240
I received a report from the soldiers.

832
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
There are a large number of Northern soldiers in the Northern camp.

833
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
All troops, be alert!

834
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
Yes!

835
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,240
Second Brother,

836
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,240
do you still remember

837
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,240
that we took a few

838
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,240
Northern soldiers' uniforms?

839
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,260
Go!

840
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
Give all the Northern soldiers' uniforms

841
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
to Xiu.

842
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,260
Yes!

843
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,260
Entering the enemy camp

844
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,260
is the most important thing.

845
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,260
Don't worry, Second Brother.

846
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,260
Stealing things

847
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,260
or running away

848
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,260
is what I care about the most.

849
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
I miss you so much.

850
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
I'll take you home, okay?

851
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
Okay.

852
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
I'll take you home.

853
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
Okay.

854
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,280
I'll take you home.

855
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
Why are you still here?

856
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Hurry up and go!

857
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
I didn't hear that

858
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
the Emperor of the Deceased was coming.

859
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
Why is it so sudden?

860
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
I think the Emperor of the Deceased

861
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
wants to take the battle himself

862
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
and take out Zichuan.

863
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
I'm not saying that.

864
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
General Yun is too conservative.

865
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,280
If he had given me so many soldiers,

866
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
then Commander Xiu would have got in trouble.

867
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,300
That's why,

868
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,300
since my father went,

869
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,400
I don't need to drag his armed soldiers

870
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
into our trap.

871
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
I just can just trust you.

872
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,300
ST CSV

873
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,760
Yunqing,

874
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
I know we're not doing well in the battle.

875
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,760
But I think you still have some hope.

876
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,920
Your Highness,

877
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,320
the reason why we formed a general with the Zichuan Army

878
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,320
is because of the land's control

879
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,880
and the waste of our troops.

880
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,680
Now that Lord Shen Huang is here,

881
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,200
the general can be defeated.

882
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,240
How can I not have hope?

883
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,680
You only care about the war.

884
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,240
You don't know the evidence.

885
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,480
Now that father is here,

886
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,360
how can you keep our credit?

887
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,720
Lord Shen Huang is here!

888
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,400
When are you going to

889
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,360
take over the city of Pa Yi?

890
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,680
Do you know the significance of the city of Pa Yi

891
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,840
to our northern tribe?

892
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,000
I know.

893
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,040
How is the war going?

894
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,680
Pa Yi has been trapped for days.

895
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,240
He's already lost his mind.

896
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,800
We should have taken him down three days ago.

897
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,480
But the ground forest suddenly appeared.

898
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,680
We had to fight back.

899
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,280
So we delayed the time of the general's attack.

900
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,560
The ground forest?

901
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,440
Is it that scary?

902
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,400
It's not that scary.

903
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,800
But the army of Yunqing is always cautious.

904
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,360
They don't want the soldiers to be a dangerous sacrifice.

905
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,280
Yes.

906
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,920
But I've fought with him before.

907
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,880
He's very skilled.

908
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
He's very good at fighting.

909
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,600
He's not a small-minded man.

910
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,320
Yunqing.

911
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,200
You're starting to look like someone else.

912
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,600
Forgive me for being rude.

913
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,280
But from the layout of the ground forest

914
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,360
and the patrol arrangement,

915
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,400
it's clear that

916
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,360
he's very good at fighting.

917
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,080
He's well-thought out.

918
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,160
We're lucky to have Yunqing.

919
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
It seems that

920
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,160
it's also your good fortune.

921
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,040
You may all leave.

922
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,520
Yes.

923
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,240
Yunqing, stay.

924
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,000
Yunqing.

925
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,480
You're here, right?

926
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,800
We're in the 800 meters dude.

927
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,480
Give us a last word so that we're sure.

928
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,040
Yunqing.

929
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,560
Yunqingge...

930
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,520
I'm here to save you andBlue Madam.

931
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,680
We have the data of the Deep-Sea Church.

932
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,280
Yuan Bing only brought me 100,000 Jin soldiers.

933
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,280
That's enough.

934
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,480
Then I also have a small question.

935
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,920
When can I take Paiyi down?

936
00:43:59,120 --> 00:43:59,880
Tomorrow.

937
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,240
Tomorrow, I will take Paiyi down with all my might.

938
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,760
Take the head of Si Yiling.

939
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:06,520
Xiling

940
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:11,720
T Historic goods

941
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:12,520
Brother.

942
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,800
V Dist꺩

943
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,600
Did you go to the enemy camp?

944
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,320
Can you only bring back food to the enemy?

945
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,360
Willing

946
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,900
The war is coming.

947
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,480
When?

948
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,000
Tomorrow.

949
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,280
Then, as I said before,

950
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,760
I will go to Tuwei.

951
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,840
You take him with you.

952
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,840
If it's a normal northern general,

953
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,400
there's still hope.

954
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,360
But the enemy's camp,

955
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,360
besides General Yun Qianxue,

956
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,160
also has Sai Rongsheng,

957
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,760
who personally suppressed the camp.

958
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,680
Close contact

959
00:44:49,680 --> 00:45:13,720
Hi hello, the

960
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,720
But there is no light

961
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,720
The old friend who disappeared

962
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,720
He never left

963
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:06,720
Silence is just waiting for you to open your mouth

964
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,720
The old friend who disappeared

965
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,720
He never left

966
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:23,720
Silence is just waiting for you to open your mouth

967
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,720
I don't want to leave

968
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:38,720
Silence is just waiting for you to open your mouth

969
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,720
Don't let go of the hands of the past

970
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:52,720
There is a person who likes to stay in the old place

971
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:07,720
The old friend who disappeared

972
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,720
Do you want to ride it?

973
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,720
No, ride it

974
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,720
It's too old

975
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,720
I went up and then I went down
