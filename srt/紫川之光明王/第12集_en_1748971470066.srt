1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,680
Coconut 240

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,000
trabaj combining

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,280
and

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,920
L他是

21
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,900
Brind Hause

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,340
Plain god

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,520
Plain god

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,240
I only helped old people win.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,200
Your Highness, you saved Sheng Miao at the most critical moment.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,800
I represent all the people of Yuan State and express my gratitude to you.

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,200
From now on, if you have any need,

28
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,200
all the people of Yuan State will be burned to death by the fire of the fire.

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,400
I will repay your kindness.

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,600
Elder, you are seriously injured.

31
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,000
The first one to enter the Qing Dynasty was our mission.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,200
Now, the Beizhu Tribe has retreated.

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,200
They also saw that our people in Yuan State are strong.

35
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,000
So, in a short time, they won't enter the Qing Dynasty anymore.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,600
I'll leave first.

37
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,600
Everything has just started.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,000
Just as you said, we have a army.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,600
We have weapons.

40
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
We have our people.

41
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,200
We will not kill them.

42
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,400
We are just a commander.

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
It's like today.

44
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,200
You, such a commander.

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,800
But you are the leader of the people of Yuan State.

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,000
They respect you and believe you.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,800
You can be their commander.

48
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
I'm old.

49
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,600
My body cannot lead them to war.

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Nor can it lead them to resist the tragedy of the Beizhu Tribe.

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,200
Can you find a suitable military officer in the army of Yuan State?

52
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,800
We don't lack the hero who will take the flag.

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,000
Nor do we lack the general who will be the commander of the army.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We lack the commander who will be trained by the government.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
We can calm down the situation and be firm.

56
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,000
We can be brave and brave.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Zichuan, I hope you can help me.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,800
I will call all the soldiers of Yuan State to join forces.

59
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,400
I will be the commander of the army of Yuan State.

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
But we will be together forever.

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,200
We are the people of Yuan State.

62
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,800
We have the freedom to be the people of the country.

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,000
The holy temple is so beautiful.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,200
We are suffering and suffering.

65
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,200
One day, a bright king appeared.

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,800
He opened the darkness for us.

67
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,000
I will never ask for the honor of the holy temple.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,200
You are so weak.

69
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,200
You are the bright king of Yu Yan.

70
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,600
Only you can lead Yuan State to be free.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,800
Elder, I am very grateful to you.

72
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,000
But I am not from Yuan State.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It is not appropriate to be the commander of the army of Yuan State.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,400
And I am the commander of the army of the north.

75
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,600
They want to kill me.

76
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,000
Once I become the commander, they will definitely kill me.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
At that time, it is not good for Yuan State to be the people of Yuan State.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,200
What you said, I have already considered.

79
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Your threats are mine.

80
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,800
I will give you the holy temple's nine holy things.

81
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,400
It will remove your doubts.

82
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:43,400
We will be the king of Yuan State

83
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,800
who will never be the people of Yuan State.

84
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Don't take it out.

85
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Don't take it out.

86
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,600
What are you looking at?

87
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,800
Your Majesty, you are doing this for the holy things?

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,200
I am doing this for the peace of Yuan State.

89
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,800
When they have the ability to protect themselves,

90
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,200
I will take this position out.

91
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,200
As for this gift, I will not return it.

92
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
There must be many treasures in this box.

93
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
You are so mean.

94
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,800
This is the holy thing Elder gave to Elder.

95
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,800
It is the symbol of the King of Light.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Look at this box.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,600
Elder, the things inside are yours.

98
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,800
How about the box is mine?

99
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,200
It is not a little bit of a surprise.

100
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,800
Did I bring you here before?

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,400
Look at you.

102
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
You haven't seen the face of the corpse.

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,600
Isn't it just a broken box?

104
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Exactly.

105
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,400
With our Lord Xi's aura and style,

106
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,200
how can we see this broken box?

107
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,600
Come, come, come, take it away.

108
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,200
Hurry, let go, let go, let go, let go.

109
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,800
This is not Elder's gift.

110
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,400
Can I not give him the face?

111
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,600
Brothers, brothers.

112
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,200
Tong Er, just open it and let the brothers open their eyes.

113
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Exactly.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,600
Jiuhui.

115
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,600
Look carefully.

116
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,800
This...

117
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,600
This...

118
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,800
This is not...

119
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,400
What is this?

120
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,000
It is a body of a monk.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,600
It is also said to be a sacred item.

122
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,800
Elder is so petty.

123
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Just give him this.

124
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,400
I regret it.

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,400
Lord Xiuchuan is also for the peace of the people of Yuan.

126
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,800
The broken shoes of the Lord Xiuchuan

127
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,400
are just right to show Lord Xiuchuan's high-pitched skill.

128
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,800
That makes sense.

129
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,000
The Wanyun Cultivation is in progress.

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You are doing your best this time.

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The Wanyun Sect is always in my heart.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,800
I heard that this boy Ma Wei has helped a lot.

133
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Yes.

134
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,200
The food and food are originally a matter of concern.

135
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,400
The food and food are not good at first sight.

136
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,600
This is the first time you have been so impetuous.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,200
You can't even eat it.

138
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,000
It is really hard to eat.

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,600
The impetuous person is just too angry.

140
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,400
The evil spirit is the main reason.

141
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,800
And then, you are being so impetuous.

142
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,400
I know the way.

143
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,200
Xiao Ning, you really have changed your temper this time.

144
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,600
Those food and food are all different.

145
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
They are all very old-fashioned.

146
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,000
Do you want to make the soldiers to eat and drink?

147
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,000
In this way, you can make the money better.

148
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,400
The Wanyun Cultivation is very beautiful.

149
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,600
Don't you think it is a bit too much?

150
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
It is not too much.

151
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Yes.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,200
How did He Tanshi and Xiao Ning deal with it?

153
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,200
It was just a crime to hurt the Princess's family.

154
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,400
They were arrested by several servants of the He family.

155
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,600
But the damage in the re-assisting of the soil

156
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,000
is going to be extremely serious in the East.

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The land that they are going to collect

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,600
is exactly the farm of the He family.

159
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,600
According to the law of Zi Chuan, if it is for the country,

160
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
it can take the lowest price

161
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,800
and take back the land and farm that the merchants have.

162
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
No matter how dissatisfied He Tanshi is,

163
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,400
he must eat this impetuous person.

164
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,000
In recent years, the power of the He family has increased.

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,200
The people of Qiya are not in a good mood.

166
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,600
We can suppress this.

167
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,400
It's just that he's afraid that He Tanshi will come out and make a move.

168
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,600
Prince Ning will be in a bad mood.

169
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,800
In the future, he will be the king of Zi Chuan.

170
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,200
He will be in a bad mood and laugh at the punishment.

171
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,200
With He Tanshi, I think it is a good thing.

172
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,800
Because of the Three provinces' rule,

173
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,400
he will send another camp.

174
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,600
Whoever is not loyal to the He family

175
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,000
will be punished for their sins.

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,400
By then,

177
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,000
it will be a terrible time.

178
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,800
This girl is so good.

179
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,400
It's even more pitiful.

180
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,200
She even invited me to participate in a dinner party.

181
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,400
She is trying to steal my family's money.

182
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Prince Ning is still worried about He Tanshi's reputation.

183
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,000
If you say such a big thing,

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,400
wouldn't she dare to ask you directly for punishment?

185
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,400
What? She even asked me to kill her?

186
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
She is here!

187
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,000
Her father and her uncle.

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,800
Which one of them is not loyal to the He family and Li Yu?

189
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,800
She hasn't even become the military commander yet.

190
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,200
Everyone,

191
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,000
now, you are fighting for my own land.

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Can't she just take your family's property?

193
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,800
The people of the He family and Li Yu

194
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,600
have their own land and property in the faraway area.

195
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,800
But after the peace talks,

196
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
they are now in the north.

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,000
They are all in a terrible situation.

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,200
The fake family

199
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,600
has not achieved any compensation.

200
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,000
Now, they are fighting for the money

201
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,000
and taking us as their bank account.

202
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,200
Prince Ning,

203
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,000
what do you think?

204
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
What's so good about me?

205
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,800
The world is big, but not the capital.

206
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,400
The family has the right to take over the land and property of the military.

207
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,000
Moreover, this dinner

208
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,600
is also a wish for all of you to join the family.

209
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,200
You are both powerful and strong.

210
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,600
Lord Wang Ge,

211
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,200
you are all in the capital.

212
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,000
If you really want to fight for your land,

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,200
you won't be able to win.

214
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,400
I heard that

215
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,800
Ma Canshi just sent the concubines to the Princess's mansion.

216
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Wang Ge Canshi

217
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,400
sent a lot of family members.

218
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,200
Be careful.

219
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,000
Don't be a little rabbit

220
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,400
in the old age of your life.

221
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Everyone, please be quiet.

222
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Drink some tea and be careful.

223
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,200
The dinner tonight

224
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
is all about the dishes.

225
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,800
More importantly,

226
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,600
Prince Ning will also donate a lot of family treasure.

227
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,400
He will also prepare a reward

228
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,800
for the honor of the family's reputation.

229
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,600
To be honest,

230
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,800
this is another way to empty our past.

231
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,800
In recent years, the family has been secretly suppressing

232
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,200
the power of the Three Kingdoms.

233
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,800
If we have a battle

234
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
in the form of a different form,

235
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,600
it will be very easy.

236
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,400
It's also a good idea to be a good person.

237
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,600
You are a good person.

238
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,400
Now that you have pushed Prince Ning to the stage,

239
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,200
you have shown your support.

240
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,000
The future of Prince Ning will be more.

241
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,800
Now that you have given him some respect,

242
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,800
he will have his own time to return it.

243
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,800
If we really don't take it seriously,

244
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm afraid that he will make the right decision.

245
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,600
It's really a big deal.

246
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Everyone, I think that you will be able to take it.

247
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,400
Ma Wei.

248
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If you have been in the Three Kingdoms for years,

249
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,800
how dare you disturb the Crown Prince here?

250
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,600
You are so stubborn.

251
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,400
How dare you?

252
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,800
You are also from the Three Kingdoms.

253
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,800
How could you not know the reason for your loss?

254
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,200
Sometimes, you can't keep your right.

255
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
I finally understand.

256
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,400
Now, you just want to see the identity of that yellow-haired girl.

257
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,000
You should be the one to take it.

258
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,800
Let me tell you. You are too stubborn.

259
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,200
How could you be so stubborn? I can't care about that.

260
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,400
If you hit the算盤 on my head,

261
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,600
you are wrong.

262
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Dr. Ma.

263
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Ma Canshi.

264
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Do you really think that I am too stubborn?

265
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,400
I am your companion.

266
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,000
I have always respected you.

267
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If you don't know, how could you tell me?

268
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I have a lower status.

269
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,600
I have no ability to move or move.

270
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,000
It's just that you are the one who is the most obedient.

271
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What you mean is that

272
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
you are the one who is the most obedient.

273
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What you mean is that you are the one who is the most obedient.

274
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,400
As far as I know,

275
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,000
the chief is still in the past.

276
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,600
He is not in the position to do anything.

277
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,000
It's been two years since I chose the new chief.

278
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Ma Canshi.

279
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Can you give me a chance

280
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,800
to get that blackmail?

281
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,000
How much money do I have to pay

282
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:49,560
for the

283
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,000
all the food and drinks?

284
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
How could I accept it?

285
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,200
You have given a lot of money.

286
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
I am grateful to you.

287
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
I am glad to remember your kindness.

288
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,000
You are really a good man.

289
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,500
What do you want me to do?

290
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,200
I don't want to be a straight-up.

291
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,600
This dinner is the best quality.

292
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,000
To complete the rest of the medicine

293
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,400
I need at least 50,000 gold coins.

294
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,800
You don't want to be cold-hearted.

295
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
I understand.

296
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,800
I am afraid that no one will buy the medicine.

297
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
I am embarrassed.

298
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,200
Now, someone is already forcing me to do that.

299
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,800
If anything happens,

300
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,600
I will not let you buy the medicine.

301
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,600
If that is the case,

302
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,200
you actually trust me.

303
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,600
Then I will do my best to cooperate.

304
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,200
Wang Ge Canshi is the most reliable person to help.

305
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,000
No matter if you are a prince or a ma,

306
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,600
I will be grateful to you.

307
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,800
From now on, the rest of the city walls

308
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,600
will be covered with wood and material.

309
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,200
I will meet Wang Ge Canshi and Ma Shi

310
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
on the street.

311
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,200
I will be very happy to help you.

312
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,200
Ma Canshi, you are welcome.

313
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,000
You are the youngest Canshi.

314
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
Now you are promoted to the crown prince.

315
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,200
You will be successful sooner or later.

316
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,000
Where is the biggest advantage?

317
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I can see it.

318
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,200
This is...

319
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Why is Canshi so stubborn?

320
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,600
I am afraid...

321
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,200
Don't worry, Canshi.

322
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
What Canshi is afraid of

323
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,200
is the fact that you are worried.

324
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,600
I will not let this happen.

325
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
General Ling, you are here to attend the banquet.

326
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yes.

327
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,600
This is Wang Ge Canshi.

328
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Your Highness.

329
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Wang Ge Canshi.

330
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,000
This is Fang Canshi.

331
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Your Highness.

332
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Fang Canshi.

333
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Your Highness.

334
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Your Highness.

335
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Your Highness.

336
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There is also this Liu Canshi.

337
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Your Highness.

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Ma Canshi.

339
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Brother.

340
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Your Highness.

341
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Your Highness.

342
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Your Highness.

343
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You are still worried about the door to the court to calm down.

344
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You called us here to make a scene.

345
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It seems that he is too much.

346
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You are the one who took the troops with you.

347
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You even made a little noise.

348
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What did you do this time?

349
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Ma Canshi.

350
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's not good.

351
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What is not good?

352
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Can you eat it?

353
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What are you eating?

354
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's for the one that is useful.

355
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's the one that Lord Yuan Xing gave to the champion of the martial arts competition in the Yuan Zhou Martial Arts Hall.

356
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Ma Bian.

357
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You are too generous.

358
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You just said such a meaningful thing.

359
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But look at these people.

360
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
They must not be the goods.

361
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I came to the street.

362
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I saw the carriage of these things.

363
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I was thinking at that time.

364
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Ma Wei is also great.

365
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He can gather all these people here.

366
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He can buy these things willingly.

367
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
These swords are just a toy for these food.

368
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Although the change of General Siyi Ling is not valuable,

369
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
it is meaningful and extraordinary.

370
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
In terms of the new meaning,

371
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
no one is more reliable than General Siyi Ling.

372
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But Ma Wei is not simple.

373
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
If the wealth is the sword and rain,

374
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
the power is the palace.

375
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Ma Wei used to have a sword and rain.

376
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But look at now.

377
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That is the sword on the sword.

378
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

379
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You finally took the sword with a price of 5,000 gold coins.

380
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You took the sword that Lord Ding Ling donated.

381
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Mr. Liu has been in the house for many times.

382
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The family will remember your contribution.

383
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

384
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
These people are not buying things with sincerity.

385
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
They are not really concerned about the money.

386
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They are all looking at the money.

387
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It is just a temporary account of the money.

388
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That is why they will do this to help you.

389
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's right.

390
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
These accounts are useless to us officials.

391
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But to them, it is a very important thing.

392
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Mr. Liu has shown his talent in various matters.

393
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
He is also the top assistant in the cultivation ceremony tonight.

394
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
He has taken this money to help Mr. Liu.

395
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I hope Mr. Liu will continue to work for the family.

396
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

397
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Besides, I also hope that everyone can be responsible

398
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
for using the money to cultivate the love of Wan Yun.

399
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
We think Ma Canshi is young and delicate.

400
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
She is also very thoughtful.

401
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Why don't we let her take full responsibility?

402
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You are right, Mr. Wang Ge.

403
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Ma Wei Canshi.

404
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Do you want to be responsible for cultivating the love of Wan Yun?

405
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I am willing to do everything for you.

406
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The money that His Highness has collected this time

407
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
is enough to keep the family and the family safe and sound.

408
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
He doesn't regret cheering on Wan Yun.

409
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
He is such a、、,

410
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:41,400
he

411
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,800
I'll give the whole Nanghai Pearl to Wang Ge.

412
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,600
It's a must-have item.

413
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,200
Nanghai Pearl is worth a thousand gold.

414
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,400
How can I owe you such a big favor?

415
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,000
The one who pays for it is the one who will pay for it.

416
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
What's the problem?

417
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,600
If you don't want to owe me,

418
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,400
I'll be more than happy tonight.

419
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,200
I'd like to have you drink a cup of wine.

420
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Is that okay?

421
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,400
Your Highness, I have something to ask you.

422
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Your Highness.

423
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,200
Is Lord Diling happy tonight?

424
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Very happy.

425
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,000
I've seen so many rich people in the capital.

426
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,600
I've also seen the social order of the three provinces.

427
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,600
I really like the knife you just saw.

428
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
If it weren't for the food, you'd have told me earlier.

429
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,200
You wouldn't have thought I'd be more expensive.

430
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,600
This knife is better. Do you want it?

431
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,000
If Lord Diling likes it, I'll give you a thousand gold.

432
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,800
But...

433
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Deal.

434
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I forgot to tell you.

435
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,000
This knife is made by Yang Minghua.

436
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
But it's okay.

437
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,600
You just need to use the knife.

438
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
I don't care.

439
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,800
I hope you can like it.

440
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
Give me the money.

441
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,600
Forgive me princess.

442
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
There are so many of you.

443
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
'll add up after me.

444
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,520
In my clinic

445
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,720
she has made roll다를(?)

446
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,840
she made spring danger

447
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,680
Yes

448
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:53,400
Mr. Ye

449
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,200
Come out

450
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,320
Where are you trying to go?

451
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,520
Come to talk with me

452
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,560
Are you Han Shang Chinese News Team?

453
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,720
It should be Ma Wei.

454
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
What a coincidence.

455
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,720
He can't just get the water from the well

456
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,640
and even do the personal work for the Ma family.

457
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,280
More importantly,

458
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,960
he can't stop Your Highness from being relieved.

459
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,720
But he can't

460
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,400
stop His Highness from being relieved.

461
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,840
We all know that Your Highness

462
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,480
is the heir to the family.

463
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
This is why

464
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,560
Ma Wei is not going to be a part of the court.

465
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,160
Where is Your Highness?

466
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,640
You're going to havevert to get so many blessings.

467
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,280
Dream of Luridog,

468
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,840
in order to Survive on the Mountains of Fire,

469
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,080
day after day,

470
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,200
I'll call you back.

471
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,120
Your Highness.

472
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
I remember it all.

473
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
But I can't return to you

474
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,120
other than gratitude.

475
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
Do you understand what I mean?

476
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,120
I'm a close friend of the one I love.

477
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
I'm not a coward.

478
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,120
I just want you to have less worries.

479
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Why do you say that you can forget about the past?

480
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Maybe it's because people don't want to forget.

481
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
That's why I left the wine.

482
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Ma Canshi is wrong.

483
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
The wine won't make people worry.

484
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
It will only make people lose their minds.

485
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
So it's better to keep it a secret.

486
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Your Highness, the night is dark.

487
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
The wine is hot.

488
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
I'll send you back to your mansion.

489
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Your Highness has been busy for so many days.

490
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
It's finally the big day tonight.

491
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Why are you worried?

492
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
My duty is to protect you.

493
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
If you think I'm worried,

494
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
please let me know.

495
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
Your Highness.

496
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
Ma Canshi and Prince Ning are drinking here.

497
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
What can I worry about?

498
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Lord Li is too upset.

499
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
No wonder he's being punished.

500
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:54,120
Mar acc Presents

501
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,480
for Feiz hunting.

502
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,560
For her cousin,

503
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,960
I can't say that

504
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,640
now you'll have trouble learning this.

505
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,680
Damn it!

506
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,160
What are you doing?

507
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,720
Don't go!

508
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,100
I'm not going to let you go.

509
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,940
All right.

510
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
I'm leaving.

511
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,820
I'll take care of it.

512
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,620
Okay.

513
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,720
I'll be right back.

514
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
I'll see you later.

515
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
See you later.

516
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
I'll see you later.

517
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
Okay.

518
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
Bye.

519
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
See you later.

520
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
Bye.

521
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
Bye.

522
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
Bye.

523
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
Bye.

524
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
Bye.

525
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
Bye.

526
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Bye.

527
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Bye.

528
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720

I'm sorry for my sword.

538
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
Your Highness.

539
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
I'll send you back with Lord Li Qing.

540
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,720
Lord Li Qing.

541
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
I'm sorry for my sword.

542
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,720
I'll send you back with Lord Li Qing.

543
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,720
I'll send you back with Lord Li Qing.

I'll send you back with Lord Li Qing.

546
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,720

I'll send you back with Lord Li Qing.

549
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
I'll send you back with Lord Li Qing.

550
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
I'll send you back with Lord Li Qing.

551
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
I'll send you back with Lord Li Qing.

552
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
I'll send you back with Lord Li Qing.

553
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
I'll send you back with Lord Li Qing.

554
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
Lord Li Qing.

555
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
What you said just now

556
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
is a clear and protective word.

557
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
It's true.

558
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,720
I've never changed my mind about you.

559
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
But I still want to know

560
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
your thoughts.

561
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
That year,

562
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
when you took over the crown,

563
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
I stood by Lord Yuanxin's side.

564
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
I saw it.

565
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,720
Lord Yuanxin said it in a loud voice.

566
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Maybe he's your future husband.

567
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
Before the auction,

568
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,720
I secretly bought this horse.

569
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
Actually, I know

570
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
that our marriage

571
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
was what Lord Junzhang hoped for.

572
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
It was what Zichuan hoped for.

573
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
It was even what I hoped for.

574
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
But it wasn't what you hoped for.

575
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,720
Lord Junzhang had done many things for me

576
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
to take care of this marriage.

577
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
I said that if you don't want to,

578
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,720
I won't.

579
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
That's right.

580
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
It wasn't what I hoped for.

581
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
I hoped that

582
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
I didn't want you to be with me.

583
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
But not just this marriage,

584
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
I don't want anything else

585
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
around me.

586
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,720
Because I lost Yuanzhou.

587
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
Because I killed so many brothers.

588
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,720
Because I fell in love with them.

589
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
I'm sorry.

590
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
I shouldn't have told you this.

591
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
But no matter what,

592
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
I will marry you.

593
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,720
I will live like everyone else.

594
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
Lord.

595
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
Lady.

596
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,720
Lady Spear.

597
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,800
Do you want to drink water?

598
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,100
Yes.

599
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,140
Yes.

600
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,460
Finish breakfast first.

601
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,040
Sister Yu,

602
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,480
can I help you finish it?

603
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,000
This time,

604
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,200
it's fine but

605
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,760
I must see certain tricks.

606
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,220
abort your dad and make N strife.

607
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,080
I will affects you this time.

608
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,440
That's all OK.

609
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,140
Brother,

610
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,120
I want to make you a room today.

611
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,960
Time thinking about him is always so good.

612
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,620
He has told many people

613
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,780
to leave home because it's tiring.

614
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,900
But you have to play outside.

615
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,820
Learn from the beginning.

616
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,620
It's hard to find a concert with me.

617
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,040
Me?

618
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,420
Me?

619
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,860
Me?

620
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,980
of your wedding.

621
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,340
Is he my grandson?

622
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,680
Of course.

623
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,580
He's your grandson?

624
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,740
Didn't he have a opioid disease?

625
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,360
I mean,

626
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,540
the idea is

627
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,720
to go to a hospital

628
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,820
and fully retrieve the body.

629
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,040
That guy doesn't need to worry.

630
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,020
Nastong...

631
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,540
What are you saying?

632
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,540
It's nothing.

633
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,540
But we will...

634
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,540
We will...

635
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,540
We will be the same.

636
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,540
Xiu Jia.

637
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,540
You are the luckiest thing in my life.

638
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,540
I will be able to be with you for my whole life.

639
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,540
I will be satisfied with my life.

640
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,540
No matter if we have children,

641
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,540
I will love you for my whole life.

642
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,540
Xiu Jia.

643
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,540
Trust me.

644
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,540
Why did you come to me?

645
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,540
Do you have any treasure to give me?

646
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,540
I knew it.

647
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,540
You gave me the cloth and mask last time.

648
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,540
It's just a gift.

649
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,540
Right?

650
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,540
We are all so familiar.

651
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,540
Do you have anything more powerful?

652
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,540
You are hiding it?

653
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,540
I heard that

654
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,540
in this temple,

655
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,540
there is a secret weapon.

656
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,540
It can help you to know the future.

657
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,540
Are you going to give me this secret weapon?

658
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,540
Don't sell the coffin.

659
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,540
Take it out and give it to me.

660
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,540
Take off your clothes.

661
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,540
Take off your clothes?

662
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,540
It's just a gift.

663
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,540
It's just a gift.

664
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,540
You still have money to make a good man.

665
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,540
Don't worry.

666
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,540
I just want to help you heal.

667
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,540
You can tell that you are a man of martial arts.

668
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,540
But now you are in great pain with the weapon.

669
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,540
Don't look down on the holy water in the pond.

670
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,540
It can help you to recover the weapon and re-replace the life.

671
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,540
Why don't you take a look at the holy water?

672
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,540
Only the king's dignity in the garden

673
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,540
can be qualified to guard the holy water.

674
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
Your Highness,

675
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,540
are you going to fight the enemy with the gun?

676
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
Elder.

677
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,540
Not only Elder.

678
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
Brother.

679
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,540
Brother.

680
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,540
Stop fighting.

681
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,540
Brother.

682
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,540
Brother.

683
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,540
Brother.

684
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,540
Brother,

685
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,540
I am the third brother.

686
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,540
Brother,

687
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,540
I am the third brother.

688
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,540
Xiao Ning?

689
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,540
Xiao Beide.

690
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,540
Third Brother.

691
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,540
Take care of yourself.

692
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,540
Please take care of the family.

693
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,540
Third Brother.

694
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,540
Elder.

695
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,540
What are you looking at?

696
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,540
I just...

697
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,540
I think I fell asleep.

698
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,540
I even had a dream.

699
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,540
The two brothers I dreamed of...

700
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,540
and...

701
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,540
They still look the same.

702
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,540
But they seem to be...

703
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,540
like they've changed.

704
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,540
To say something strange...

705
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,540
is also a bit vague.

706
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,540
What's going on?

707
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,540
You'll know eventually.

708
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,540
Didn't you say that...

709
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,540
the Holy Temple's power...

710
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,540
can meet the future?

711
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,540
Why didn't I meet the future?

712
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,540
Will my future...

713
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,540
be a fortune?

714
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,540
I'm afraid...

715
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,540
you've already seen the future.

716
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,540
But you still can't clear it.

717
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,540
Don't worry.

718
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,540
This is just a matter of time.

719
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,540
I...

720
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,540
I really am the Holy King.

721
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,540
You are the Holy King of Light in the Holy Temple.

722
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,540
You will bring light to the people of Yuan...

723
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,540
and bring back the people of Yuan...

724
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,540
to free yourself from darkness.

725
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,540
Now, I've already ordered...

726
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,540
the entire Yuan's Literature Division...

727
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,540
to form the alliance of the people of Yuan...

728
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,540
and the people of Yuan...

729
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,540
to form the alliance of the people of Yuan.

730
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,540
They are coming...

731
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,540
to the Holy Temple...

732
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,540
to gather together.

733
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,540
They are the most powerful forces in Yuan.

734
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,540
You will bring them together...

735
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,540
to unite them...

736
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,540
and to encourage them.

737
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,540
I hope you can bear the responsibility of the King of Light...

738
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,540
to bring Yuan...

739
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,540
to free yourself from darkness.

740
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,540
King of Light...

741
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,540
The Black Cloud in the East...

742
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,540
is the blue sky...

743
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,540
and the red fox in the East...

744
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,540
is the black fox in the red and red...

745
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,540
and the black fox in the red and red...

746
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,540
are the kings...

747
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,540
who are the kings of the Black Clouds.

748
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,540
The King of Light...

749
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,540
will lead the people of Yuan...

750
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,540
to the Holy Temple.

751
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,540
The power of the Black Clouds...

752
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,540
is not enough for the people of Yuan...

753
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,540
to get rid of the family.

754
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,540
The light of the Black Clouds...

755
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,540
will be gone by the day.

756
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,540
Episode 1

757
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,540
Hurry up!

758
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,540
Who's that?

759
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,540
I'm not pressing the button.

760
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,540
Don't push it!

761
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,540
Don't push it!

762
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,540
Don't push it!

763
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,540
Don't push it!

764
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,540
Don't push it!

765
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,540
The firecrackers are burning.

766
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,540
The light of the Black Clouds...

767
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,540
is the one that we're going to take.

768
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,540
What's wrong?

769
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,540
I'm going to take a look.

770
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,540
This is the gift for the people of Yuan.

771
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,540
I don't think I've ever seen it.

772
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,540
I'll take care of it.

773
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,540
Come.

774
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,540
The lost old friend...

775
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,540
is the one...

776
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,540
who never left.

777
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,540
The one who never left.

778
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,540
The one who never left.

779
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,540
The one who never left.

780
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,540
Come.

781
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,540
The one who never left.

782
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,540
Sixth Sister.

783
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,540
The lost old friend...

784
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,540
is the one...

785
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,540
who never left.

786
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,540
I've been a good student before.

787
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,540
What do you know?

788
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,540
I'm a professional academician.

789
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,540
A professional academician.

790
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,540
I'm a professional academician.

791
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,540
I'm a professional academician.

792
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,540
I have to be independent.

793
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,540
What's the word?

794
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,540
We're still the same age.

795
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,540
We're still the same age.

796
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,540
I'm a murderous police officer.

797
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,540
I don't want to be a simple...

798
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,540
Come on, come on.

799
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,540
I'm a murderous police officer.

800
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,540
I don't want to be a simple...

801
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,540
I'm sorry.

802
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,540
I'll be a business man.

803
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,540
I can't be a simple...

804
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,540
I can't be a simple...

805
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,540
I can't be a simple...

806
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,540
I can't be a simple...

807
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,540
I can't be a simple...

808
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,540
I can't be a simple...
