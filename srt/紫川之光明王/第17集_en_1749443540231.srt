1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Go Go Squid

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Episode 18

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sir, we've taken away all of the grain.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
More importantly.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes. We don't even know where the enemy's power is.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,600
My Lord, we must apologize to His Majesty.

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,800
We have already hidden the failure of the Imperial Palace.

26
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
The Yuan State and the Alliance Army have been in chaos.

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,000
Even though the light is on, we still have three cities to go.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,400
Why haven't we mentioned these to His Majesty, My Lord?

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Once the report is done,

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,400
do you know what we are waiting for?

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The Moon Sect has already fought.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,600
It's me! The enemy is helpless!

33
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,000
Only then can we have the position of today!

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,400
If we admit defeat now,

35
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,400
then all our efforts will be wasted.

36
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,800
So we must continue fighting!

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Until we win!

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,600
My Lord, the team of the Yongzhi Tribe is coming.

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Which direction are we going to?

40
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,200
The southwest direction.

41
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
The southwest direction?

42
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,400
The southwest direction shouldn't be a bit...

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,400
It's not the enemy.

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Then...

45
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Tao Er, the news we just received.

46
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,600
The Northern Tribe's Ling Bu Xu is leading the army to the Lu Di Camp.

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,200
Ling Bu Xu has been stationed in the southwest of the Wanyun East.

48
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,000
He and Lu Di are far away.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,400
Once the two of them are together,

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,200
I'm afraid that we won't be able to find a way out.

51
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,400
Then let's fight first!

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,200
No.

53
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,300
Since Ling Bu Xu is here,

54
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,400
I feel a bit sad for Lu Di.

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Tao Er, you're fighting with a war.

56
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
How can you have a reason to be the enemy?

57
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,800
The grain of the southwest camp has always been in two parts.

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,400
First, it's not too late to enter the inner circle of the north.

59
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,000
But the route is long and it's quite troublesome.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,300
So, the other main source is that Lu Di is fighting in different places in the far region.

61
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,600
Everyone knows that Lu Di doesn't have the time to feed the southwest camp.

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:49,080
A few days ago, we were near the forest and got a

63
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,680
such a waste of your ability to be beaten by the people of the far region.

64
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,280
You even lost your camp.

65
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,680
The Lord of Light's army is really not good at strategy.

66
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,480
It's not an excuse.

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,880
The people of the north and the people of the far region are not worthy of being the army.

68
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,080
It's not a matter of whether you're worth it or not.

69
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,680
General, how are you going to explain to the God Emperor?

70
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,980
What is this?

71
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,280
A defeat.

72
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,380
I'm not going to defeat him?

73
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,480
That's not it!

74
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,880
Nonsense!

75
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,480
The people of the far region are trying to defeat me!

76
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,080
They are just a bunch of loyal servants and dogs!

77
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Is that so?

78
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Then it seems that you are being bitten by this dog.

79
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,780
Please, two of you.

80
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,880
We should fight together now.

81
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,580
We can't let the outsiders get the advantage.

82
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,280
My Lord.

83
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,280
My Lord, please.

84
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,680
My Lord.

85
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
My Lord.

86
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,080
I'm just a big doctor.

87
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,480
I killed their party.

88
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,080
I'll re-establish the Qi Valley.

89
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,080
I'll definitely bring down the Lord of Light's head and become a Ninth Lake.

90
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,680
Okay.

91
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,280
Then I'll wait for the news of General's surrender.

92
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,880
The situation of the war is clear.

93
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,280
I'll report to the God Emperor in time.

94
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,880
General.

95
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,080
Good luck.

96
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
I'll take my leave.

97
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,080
Next gen.

98
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,280
Why don't you talk to me?

99
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,280
The news that General Lin left is in our camp.

100
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,280
If we don't defeat them, we'll be sent back to Sai Rong City.

101
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,280
If the late Emperor finds out that we have no more chance,

102
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,280
we'll be more miserable than dead.

103
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Where is your Liang Tao?

104
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,280
Speak.

105
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
My Lord.

106
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
Go down.

107
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,280
My Lord, General Lin ordered me to come to the Palace of Light.

108
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
The Palace of Light is in a state of emergency.

109
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
The situation is very serious.

110
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,280
Please tell me what to do.

111
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,280
How are you going to explain to the Emperor?

112
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Of course, I'll tell you the truth.

113
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
My Lord.

114
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
My Lord.

115
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Look at General Lin.

116
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,280
Kill all the people who sent the treasure.

117
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Yes.

118
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
If we say it again,

119
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,280
there will be no more place for me in the tribe.

120
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,280
So the King of Light must die.

121
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
Changhu Road.

122
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
Miss, come here.

123
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,280
My Lord, what did you use to make this Tang Hu Road?

124
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Miss, you're joking.

125
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Tang Hu Road is made of sand and wheat.

126
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
I know.

127
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,280
It's like you who can sell the sugar.

128
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Then your business is good.

129
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
No, don't bother others to do business.

130
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
You're making me embarrassed.

131
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
It's okay.

132
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
Tang Hu Road is selling well these days.

133
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
I'm going to ask someone to help me.

134
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Really?

135
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,280
You'll be happy to hear this.

136
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
See you.

137
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
See you.

138
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
When did A Xiu eat Tang Hu Road's skin?

139
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,280
How long have you not seen the shop selling Tang Hu Road in Yuan Zhou?

140
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Let's see now.

141
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Yuan Zhou used to be poor in life.

142
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
He was a waste of money.

143
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,280
People can't even eat.

144
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
He just needs to collect more food.

145
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,280
But now, after the business is re-established,

146
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,280
except for life, there are still sugar.

147
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
It means that the life of the people of Yuan Zhou

148
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
is getting richer and richer.

149
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
It means that people's life in Yuan Zhou is getting richer and richer.

150
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
It means that people's life in Yuan Zhou is getting richer and richer.

151
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
It's all a great merit.

152
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
Do you know what Yuan Zhou is missing now?

153
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
What?

154
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
The Spring Palace.

155
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
You...

156
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Stop.

157
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
I'm back.

158
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
What's this?

159
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
It looks pretty heavy.

160
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Did you collect enough?

161
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
No.

162
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
These are all sent by the people of Yuan Zhou.

163
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,280
They say it's for the people of the half palace.

164
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
It seems that the business in the Bu Lu Village is well-received.

165
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Not only Bu Lu Village,

166
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
the other several forms of business

167
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
are also gradually recovering and increasing.

168
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
According to the head policy,

169
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
it's a good time to rest.

170
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
So our tax base

171
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
is very low.

172
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
The people now are very aggressive

173
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
about the increase in the tax.

174
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
What about our military expenses?

175
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
We don't need military expenses.

176
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,280
We only need food, weapons,

177
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,280
army, and transportation.

178
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
We need to change the place and so on.

179
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
According to the current tax,

180
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
we have enough.

181
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
And we will have some income.

182
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
I didn't expect

183
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
you can be a talented cook.

184
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Luo Jie,

185
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
let the North Poison Army in Bu Lu

186
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
help us to open the mine.

187
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,280
Before the Lu's people start the negotiation,

188
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
they are also idle.

189
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Deal.

190
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Will Lu Di and us negotiate?

191
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
It's too early.

192
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
And now the mine

193
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
is very suspicious of us.

194
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
Actually, after I asked Xiu Ziying to eat,

195
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
I went to the Wanyun West.

196
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
I contacted the trade.

197
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
You contacted the trade?

198
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Tong,

199
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
are you trying to

200
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
trade with Zichuan?

201
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,320
The material distribution of the Zichuan

202
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,280
is very difficult

203
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
to make the material distribution of the Zichuan

204
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
very difficult.

205
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
At the same time,

206
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
the mineralization of Yuan Zhou is very rich.

207
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Some mineralization types

208
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,280
are very rare in Zichuan.

209
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
So this is our advantage.

210
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
But we can only trade with gold coins.

211
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,280
But we don't need anything now.

212
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Why do you have to do this?

213
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,280
If we really want the people of Yuan Zhou

214
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
to live a better life,

215
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
what we do now

216
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,280
is not enough.

217
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
With Lu Di and me,

218
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,280
we dare not face the truth.

219
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
The real reason is

220
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,280
because the foundation construction of Yuan Zhou

221
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
is not as good as the North.

222
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Moreover,

223
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
it's more than the Zichuan family

224
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
and the Liu Feng family.

225
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
The technology of agriculture, construction,

226
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
school, military and military factories

227
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
and the medical institute

228
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
are all related to

229
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
the development of Yuan Zhou.

230
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,280
We all have to go back to Zichuan

231
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
and learn about the history

232
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
and the history of Yuan Zhou.

233
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
This is the real purpose and mission.

234
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Tao Er,

235
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
you mean this?

236
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Then who is more suitable?

237
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
My stomach hurts.

238
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
My stomach hurts.

239
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Tao Er,

240
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
although I know that the land is delicious,

241
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
the bed is comfortable, the wine is delicious,

242
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
and the spring is...

243
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
Tao Er,

244
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
you can't even say anything this time.

245
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
At least you have to solve Lu Di's problem first.

246
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
You...

247
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Fine.

248
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Fine.

249
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Then at least

250
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
we can solve the problem of lunch first.

251
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Fine.

252
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Here you are.

253
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Thank you, boss.

254
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Boss,

255
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
we didn't order this.

256
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
It's a gift.

257
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Enjoy it.

258
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Thank you.

259
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Tao Er,

260
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
you have a part with this.

261
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Why is the noodle so familiar?

262
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
It's the taste of the land.

263
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,280
The recipe that my family made

264
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,280
and the boss gave it to me,

265
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,280
is exactly the same as the taste of the noodle

266
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
at the gate of the city.

267
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
I suddenly found out

268
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
that I was in the cooking field,

269
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
and it was so dirty.

270
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
No wonder

271
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
the land noodle boss

272
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
never comes to my house.

273
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
Eat it.

274
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Who?

275
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,280
Who's coming for me?

276
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
How many dishes?

277
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Drink it all.

278
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Go.

279
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,280
Tao Er must be very happy today.

280
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
When did he drink so much?

281
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Today,

282
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
we can still eat the noodle of Zichuan.

283
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Yes.

284
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
Who would have thought

285
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
that Yuan Zhou could develop into this?

286
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
No way.

287
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
When we were rolling from the map,

288
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
we didn't expect that

289
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
he would develop into this.

290
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
He said that he found his value here.

291
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
I'm sorry.

292
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
I'm sorry.

293
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
I'm sorry.

294
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
I'm sorry.

295
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
I'm sorry.

297
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
I'm sorry.

298
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
I'm sorry.

299
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,280
I'm sorry.

300
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
I'm sorry.

301
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
I'm sorry.

303
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
I'm sorry.

304
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
I'm sorry.

305
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
I'm sorry.

307
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
I'm sorry.

309
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
I'm sorry.

311
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
I'm sorry.

314
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
I'm sorry.

316
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
I'm sorry.

317
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
I'm sorry.

318
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
I'm sorry.

319
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
I'm sorry.

320
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
I'm sorry.

321
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
You can listen to me.

322
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Be confident.

323
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:49,400
I'll

324
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,480
help you to get back to the village.

325
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,300
I'm really thankful for that.

326
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
I'll appreciate this.

327
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,280
Thank you very much.

328
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
You are very considerate.

329
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,200
People like Yuan Zhe can go

330
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,400
to the city.

331
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,200
Go to a community problème department.

332
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,280
We're built with the heavyitet.

333
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:19,800
The

334
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,800
Baoshan

335
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,480
is about to materialize!

336
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,320
You need to feel at ease.

337
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,640
It is easy to recognise

338
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,920
when you are really in the camp.

339
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,800
Today You should come to Liantian

340
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,720
to guard the buena month.

341
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,640
Master,

342
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
I came to ask for your permission.

343
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,640
This time, I brought some of my friends.

344
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,640
I'm very sorry for your request.

345
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,640
I'm willing to let them come with me.

346
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
Okay.

347
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Then please let them come in.

348
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
No need, Your Excellency.

349
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,640
They are already here.

350
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Your Excellency, you're also a military official.

351
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,640
I think the rules of military officials

352
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,640
are not the rules of military officials.

353
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
You know what I mean.

354
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,640
In the battlefield, soldiers

355
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,640
have to write their names on their waistband.

356
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,640
In this way, even if they lose their heads

357
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,640
and their faces are broken,

358
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,640
they can find the way home

359
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,640
with this waistband.

360
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,640
They will know who's the child of their family.

361
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,640
This is Lu Jia.

362
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,640
He's more white than a female.

363
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,640
He's often in this way.

364
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,640
But he's more cruel than anyone else.

365
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Before he died, he even used his sword

366
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
to stab his chest with a hammer.

367
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,640
He killed the enemy.

368
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,640
This is my old buddy.

369
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,640
He's also been in Yuan Zhou for over 20 years.

370
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,640
We two were still in the rear of the camp

371
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,640
and sold a ball.

372
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
It's better to drink a glass of water

373
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,640
when we're back.

374
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,640
But now, they can't come.

375
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,640
I just have to bring them here

376
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
in this way.

377
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,640
As your second son, you should protect your family.

378
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
Wei.

379
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,640
We've prepared for the Ma Ge Guoshi

380
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,640
since the moment we left the camp.

381
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
For so many years,

382
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
I've seen the soldiers in the camp

383
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,640
fall down and come in with a lot of energy.

384
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Wanyun City is also changing its appearance

385
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,640
in the war.

386
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,640
But I've never been moved

387
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,640
by my heart.

388
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Now, Wanyun's cultivation and work is going well.

389
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,640
The commander also sent a letter to the soldiers

390
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
to the family.

391
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
The family won't be in trouble for every war.

392
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,640
Whether it's alive or dead.

393
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
Yes.

394
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,640
When I heard this news,

395
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,640
my heart was happy

396
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
like a holiday.

397
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,640
But later,

398
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,640
I started to worry

399
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,640
and was afraid.

400
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
What are you afraid of?

401
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,640
I'm afraid that Wanyun hasn't been well-behaved.

402
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,640
I'm afraid that he'll be the one to be worried.

403
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
My lord.

404
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,640
I'm representing the soldiers who lost their lives

405
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
for Wanyun City

406
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,640
and the people who still live in the city.

407
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,640
Please take a look.

408
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Take a look at Wanyun City.

409
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,640
What has changed?

410
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,640
My lord.

411
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,640
My lord.

412
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,640
I'm willing to go to Wanyun to investigate.

413
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,640
Please take a look.

414
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,640
Don't worry, my lord.

415
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,640
The meeting will be held in the capital.

416
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
We'll solve Wanyun's problem

417
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,640
and the problem of the people.

418
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,640
Commander Lin Bin.

419
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
How is Wanyun now?

420
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
In front of Wanyun,

421
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,640
the Western South camp is very calm.

422
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
Because of the rebellion in the far-away city,

423
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
it's getting worse.

424
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
The leader of the far-away city,

425
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
Lord Guangming,

426
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
led the people of the far-away city

427
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
to resist the rule of the north.

428
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
So the army of the north

429
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,640
was taken back and the rebellion was over.

430
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,640
Do you know which tribe

431
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,640
Lord Guangming is in?

432
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,640
There is no news yet.

433
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Since the rebellion in Yuanzhou,

434
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
we've been the most worried about the north.

435
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,640
But the Lord Guangming

436
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,640
has been very suspicious of us.

437
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
We need to investigate it as soon as possible

438
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
and find out the real situation.

439
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,640
Yes.

440
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Minghui.

441
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Yes.

442
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
How is the western side now?

443
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
In the northern border,

444
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,640
the battle of the Liu Feng family

445
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,640
has stopped the usual provocation.

446
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
There is such a close contact

447
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
with the internal chaos in the Liu Feng family.

448
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
My Lord.

449
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
I think the guess of the leader of the Minghui family

450
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
is correct.

451
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,640
According to the report of the Liu Feng family,

452
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,640
after Liu Feng's name was judged,

453
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Liu Feng's west mountain

454
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
soon took over the power of the Liu Feng family.

455
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
However,

456
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
it took more than ten days to take over the three states.

457
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
The Liu Feng family

458
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,640
is still in a state of disarray.

459
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,640
The evidence is not stable.

460
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Minghui.

461
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,640
What should we do?

462
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,640
I think

463
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,640
we should use this rare opportunity

464
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,640
to urge the Liu Feng family

465
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,640
to promote the land of the Xichuan

466
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
in the Zichuan family.

467
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
To eliminate the Liu Feng family?

468
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
What do you think?

469
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
My Lord.

470
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
Now is the time to attack

471
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,640
the Liu Feng family.

472
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,640
But we need to think about it more.

473
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,640
We need to do

474
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,640
long-term planning and preparation

475
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
in terms of military and post-mortem.

476
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
Si Yi Lin.

477
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Yes.

478
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Do you have confidence

479
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
in the battle of the Liu Feng family?

480
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
From the military aspect,

481
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
we need to see how the Liu Feng family

482
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
will handle the military power

483
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
and how our army will recover.

484
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
From the current situation,

485
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
the two armies are almost the same.

486
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
But...

487
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
I will fight against it.

488
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
Si Yi Lin.

489
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,640
The number of troops lost in the family

490
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
should be a good example.

491
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
I have never done it.

492
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
If you need it, I can...

493
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
No need.

494
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
I can give you the number now.

495
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
The year of 781

496
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
is the year of the Zichuan family's

497
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,640
first war.

498
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,640
Although the Liu Feng family lost in the west,

499
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
the victory was won in the far away city.

500
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
The number of soldiers lost

501
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
in the war is 30,000.

502
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
It can be called a normal number.

503
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,640
The year of 783

504
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,640
was the year of the Diling family's first war.

505
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,640
The war was over.

506
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,640
But I think

507
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,640
the casualties of the 5 or 6 million

508
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
must be there.

509
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Next,

510
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,640
we will decide the level of the war

511
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,640
in Yang Ming Hua's rebellion.

512
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,640
The number of soldiers lost in the war

513
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
is at least 10,000.

514
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Lord Diling,

515
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
you have no opinion, right?

516
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,640
In the rebellion in Yuanzhou,

517
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
the Red Thunder and the Red Sea

518
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
were all injured by the army.

519
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
The water was polluted and the water was destroyed.

520
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
In addition,

521
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,640
there were 23,000 soldiers injured.

522
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Then the northern tribes were attacked.

523
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
The casualties of the period

524
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
were very chaotic.

525
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
But the total casualties

526
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,640
were empty.

527
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
The total casualties were over 400,000.

528
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Lord Diling,

529
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
this is not my...

530
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
Lord Diling,

531
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
I am afraid that the northern tribes will be in danger.

532
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
The army lost nearly 11,000 before the war.

533
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,640
It will be 50,000 in the evening.

534
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
The data is basically full.

535
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
In short,

536
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,640
I will explain to you.

537
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,640
This is the most conservative data statistics.

538
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
There are many things I didn't notice.

539
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
It may be leaked.

540
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
70,000.

541
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,640
Lord Diling,

542
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
70,000.

543
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
For you,

544
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
soldiers and troops,

545
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
it may be just a number.

546
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
But the soldiers and troops

547
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
are not born empty.

548
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Every soldier is raised by his parents.

549
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
He is raised by a man

550
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
who is a good boy.

551
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
At least he needs 20 years of light.

552
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,640
It is hard to remember the time and material.

553
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
As the man who produced the main force,

554
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
he was taken to the army.

555
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
He was sold to the battlefield

556
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,640
and suppressed the production capacity of other departments.

557
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,640
It caused the material shortage of life.

558
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
The price of the goods was high.

559
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
The black market was in a mess.

560
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,640
The economy was in a mess.

561
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
If we are in a crisis for the sake of the government,

562
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,640
we will be in a mess in a short time.

563
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
I believe the people can bear it.

564
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
But if we are doing this for the sake of the people,

565
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
without any purpose,

566
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
and force the soldiers to sleep and sleep,

567
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
and live in a nation that is not suitable for the people,

568
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,640
I believe that if the military and the people

569
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
are strong enough to support Zichuan,

570
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
the people will definitely support him.

571
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
That is because you are deceiving the people.

572
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,640
You said that everything is caused by the foreign clans.

573
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,640
Once the war begins,

574
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,640
the soldiers are in a mess,

575
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,640
and the king is in a mess.

576
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,640
We will all be sinners.

577
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,640
By then,

578
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,640
how can we explain to the people

579
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,640
how many families and seventy-seven thousand young people

580
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,640
will be left to be killed?

581
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,640
Lord.

582
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,640
They are all our blood and flesh.

583
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,640
Are you done?

584
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Hui Yi,

585
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
let's start here.

586
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
Everyone, rest for a while.

587
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,640
It's been a long time.

588
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,640
Hui Yi hasn't started yet.

589
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Brother,

590
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,640
I think

591
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,640
what Lord Geshan said is not reasonable.

592
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
Even if he has ten thousand reasons,

593
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
he shouldn't say that.

594
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,640
After all, the one who wants to fight this battle

595
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
is Lord Geng.

596
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
Because after the Yuan Zhou army,

597
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,640
he hopes that the later generations will be recorded.

598
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,640
After the military and the people

599
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,640
are in a mess in the Yuan Zhou,

600
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,640
the whole army is annihilated.

601
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,640
The enemy of the people is in a mess.

602
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,640
What kind of situation is this?

603
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,640
So he is so eager to

604
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
take back Minghui and Lin Bing.

605
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,640
That means he has made up his mind.

606
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,640
But Geshan is not going to lose.

607
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,640
What about you?

608
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Do you want to fight?

609
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
I...

610
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
I will fight if you let me.

611
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,640
But according to Lord Geshan,

612
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,640
it's true.

613
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
If we attack,

614
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
when the two major battles between the Liu Feng family

615
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,640
and the north tribe come again,

616
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,640
won't we lose?

617
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
What about you, brother?

618
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
To be honest,

619
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
what Geshan thinks is the people's voice.

620
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,640
I think it's the long-term development of Zichuan.

621
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,640
Within five years,

622
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
if we don't destroy the Liu Feng family,

623
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Zichuan will be dead.

624
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
What do you mean?

625
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
Is it strange?

626
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
Before the war in Yuan Zhou,

627
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
we were very close to the Liu Feng family.

628
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
But after we lost Yuan Zhou,

629
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
with the time's delay,

630
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
we will gradually become less like the Liu Feng family.

631
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
We don't need to waste five years.

632
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
They will throw us behind.

633
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
We are not defeated yet.

634
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
We have a lot of troops.

635
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,640
If you worry about the troops,

636
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,640
I have a way.

637
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,640
Before the meeting,

638
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,640
I want to announce one thing.

639
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,640
Zichuan Ning will participate in the family affairs.

640
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
Today is her first time

641
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,640
to attend the family's official meeting.

642
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
She has grown up.

643
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,640
She can participate in the family affairs

644
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,640
and share the burden for the family.

645
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
I don't want her to be in the army first.

646
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,640
I want to go to the capital to think about it.

647
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
Luo Minghai, Goshan.

648
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,640
Yes.

649
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,640
I will work for you.

650
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
You can criticize her

651
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,640
for any wrong she has done.

652
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Yes.

653
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
General Minister, Goshan.

654
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
Please give me your order.

655
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,640
Your Highness is smart.

656
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,640
We have a lot of talent in the army.

657
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,640
Sit down.

658
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
Okay.

659
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
We will continue to do it.

660
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,640
General Minister, I have two questions.

661
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
First,

662
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,640
we can put the next war point

663
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
on the refugees in Yanzhou.

664
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
That's a good question.

665
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
After Yanzhou returns to the north,

666
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
the population of Yanzhou has increased

667
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
by tens of millions.

668
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,640
This has caused a huge change in the local society.

669
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,640
Moreover, we have to spend a lot of money

670
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
to send them supplies and food every month.

671
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
That's right.

672
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
If we fight the refugees

673
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
for the sake of the country,

674
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,640
we can have a three-in-one army.

675
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,640
Even if we have 40,000 people

676
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,640
in the millions,

677
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,640
we can have 120,000 people.

678
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,640
And based on my experience,

679
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
these refugees lost their family members.

680
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,640
They only have hatred for the north.

681
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
If they train a little,

682
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,640
they can become a team of brave and invincible.

683
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,640
The C-1 is very thorough in considering the overall situation.

684
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,640
But it's actually a new idea.

685
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,640
Goshan, what's your opinion?

686
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
It's a good idea.

687
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,640
But the refugees' army is a big deal.

688
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,640
We need to train for at least a year and a half.

689
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,640
If we continue to fight the Liu Feng family in a year and a half,

690
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
I won't stop.

691
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
My second opinion is

692
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,640
to eliminate the doubts about you.

693
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,640
Our Zichuan family doesn't have a army.

694
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,640
Instead, the army is not in our hands.

695
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Then tell me who has the army.

696
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
According to the investigation,

697
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,640
23 of the three provinces

698
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,640
have a army of 300,000.

699
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,640
The total number is 300,000.

700
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,640
Is this news true?

701
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,640
It's basically true.

702
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,640
If we turn these refugees into the army,

703
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
we can fight with the Liu Feng family.

704
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
My lord,

705
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
according to my knowledge,

706
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
the family and the three provinces' agreement is clearly determined.

707
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
The noble family is a private army.

708
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
They can't exceed 300,000.

709
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,640
I have no doubt that the officials have already violated the law.

710
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,640
If the situation is true,

711
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
according to the family's agreement,

712
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,640
we can be punished with a murderous crime.

713
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
Wait, uncle.

714
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
My lord,

715
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
my lord, I'm sorry to interrupt you.

716
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,640
Before you make the decision,

717
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,640
can I say something?

718
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,640
Sure.

719
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
As you said,

720
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
these meals have already violated the law.

721
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,640
But the noble family can't exceed 3,000.

722
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,640
The total is over 200 years.

723
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
If it's not for the Lord of the Emperor,

724
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,640
I even forgot about it.

725
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,640
These meals are not necessarily impolite.

726
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,640
So I ask you to give these meals a chance.

727
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
As long as they are willing to hand over the military power,

728
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
they can't pursue it.

729
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,640
This can also show the humiliation of the family.

730
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,640
What if they don't hand over the military power?

731
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
If they refuse,

732
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
then they will hand over the three provinces to the three provinces.

733
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,640
The 23 noble families are only a few of them.

734
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,640
I believe that it won't affect the three provinces to make public policies.

735
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
And we can also

736
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,640
make some appropriate compensation for the three provinces.

737
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,640
Or we can change the law of the army

738
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,640
to be enough to change the army.

739
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,640
This will make it easier for people to accept it.

740
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,640
I think that the people of the three provinces

741
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
will be able to accept it.

742
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,640
I admire your decision.

743
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
My Lord,

744
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
this matter is not related to the law of the army.

745
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
Please hand over this matter to me.

746
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
I'm afraid that the public will not be able to handle it.

747
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
It's a matter of reason.

748
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,640
It's not a matter of fate.

749
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,640
You are so thoughtful.

750
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
In this situation,

751
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
we decided to

752
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,640
recruit the army in the south.

753
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,640
The land can be investigated

754
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
by the three provinces to see

755
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
the army.

756
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,640
After the army training,

757
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,640
we will go to the Liu Feng family

758
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
to fight.

759
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Brother,

760
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,640
if you don't have two ways,

761
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,640
I don't know when this meeting will be held.

762
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,640
But if you already have an idea,

763
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
why don't you tell me yourself?

764
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,640
If I have the suggestion of the army,

765
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,640
the commander will surely remember

766
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,640
that the Luo Ming Sea will also have more troubles.

767
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,640
But if you mention it,

768
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,640
it's a matter of orderly process.

769
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,640
No one has said anything.

770
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,640
What about the Yi Ze?

771
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,640
We can investigate the situation.

772
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,640
Yi Ze can investigate the army

773
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,640
and attack the Liu Feng family.

774
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,640
Second, I can take the power

775
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,640
to investigate the three provinces.

776
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
So you already want to investigate the three provinces?

777
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
After the meeting is over,

778
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,640
I will send Ge Qing to investigate the Wanyun.

779
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,640
What does this have to do with Wanyun?

780
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,640
Because there was a Wanyun old man

781
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,640
who came to find me.

782
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Yes.

783
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,640
Tuo Er knows.

784
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,640
The situation he said is also familiar.

785
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,640
Then why don't you report it?

786
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
Although Wanyun's drug addiction is slow,

787
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
it's not obvious.

788
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
The three provinces are following this.

789
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,640
Although I live in the whole Yuan State,

790
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,640
I have no right to ask.

791
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,640
So before the meeting,

792
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
you want to investigate the three provinces?

793
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,640
Yes.

794
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
The commander used the power of the three provinces

795
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,640
because of Yang Ming Hua.

796
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,640
After that, the three provinces

797
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
were once again in the capital.

798
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
When the Yuan State was under the control of the government,

799
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,640
the three provinces were severely damaged.

800
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,640
They were not satisfied with the commander.

801
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Now that the meeting is over,

802
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
they will take the order of the Wanyun

803
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
to gather the power.

804
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,640
Then use all kinds of special powers

805
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
to make the effort.

806
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
The commander doesn't have to say anything.

807
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
So the three provinces

808
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,640
are also the commander's idea.

809
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,640
I just do it

810
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,640
by order.

811
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

812
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

813
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

814
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

815
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

816
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

817
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

818
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

819
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

820
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

821
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

822
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

823
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

824
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

825
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,640
I want to get the investigation power back.

826
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
Then what's the matter?

827
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,640
Wow, this is wrong.

828
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
But I'll replace...

829
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,740
To replace what's back.

830
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,840
Then I can use the power to kill every grain.

831
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,140
Then I can use the power to prevent us from cutting up Emma so we have the crop back.

832
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,040
So I can use the power to kill all the spicsters

833
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,840
so I can use the leftover corn to cure五 fortress.

834
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
And you must have stayed up late.

835
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840
But the whole thing have been어를 I'm anxious this morning.

836
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,240
to make me feel uncomfortable.

837
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:15,960
Yes.

838
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,000
No wonder I feel uncomfortable.

839
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,080
It's been too long since we've fought against Lu Di.

840
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,080
Lu Di is in a critical state.

841
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,880
He's not strong enough to defeat us.

842
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,800
We can't fight against him.

843
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,760
And the single-armor force

844
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,320
is far from them.

845
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,880
We can't take the initiative.

846
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,720
We have to think of a way

847
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,960
to let them take the initiative to defeat us.

848
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,120
Lu Di didn't attack the Bulu Village during this time.

849
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,120
But the other cities

850
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,560
can't be disturbed by him.

851
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,640
Lu Di, take him out.

852
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
Hurry up.

853
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,040
Yes.

854
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,280
G carefully mannered.

855
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,920
I should have marked

856
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,440
the situation we've targetted before.

857
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,000
That's a good idea.

858
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,240
But our capacity is improving

859
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,240
thanks to the chill.

860
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,840
Were we able to consume it and cultivate it?

861
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,040
People said

862
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
They're going to be gone soon.

863
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
I know what to do.

864
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,040
Go and get Aze and Linong.

865
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Okay.

866
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
Don't move.

867
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
Get out.

868
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,040
Thank you.

869
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
I mean,

870
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,040
we're not playing the game of the land.

871
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,040
Why did the old master ask us to run here and fight the land?

872
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,040
Is this a game of the land?

873
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Pui.

874
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
Isn't this used to cover up?

875
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
What does it have to do with playing the land?

876
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
Don't ask.

877
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
How can we do it?

878
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
How dare you push me?

879
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
Da Hu.

880
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
My lord.

881
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,040
The King of Light sent people to attack the capital.

882
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,040
Attack the capital?

883
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,040
Show me.

884
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
Hurry up.

885
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,040
This place.

886
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,040
This place.

887
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,040
And this place.

888
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,040
This is to cover up the farm development.

889
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,040
We have to kill the root.

890
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,040
This is a good idea.

891
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
This King of Light.

892
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,040
The tree is full of light.

893
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,040
When I'm in a fight,

894
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,040
I'll take it with me.

895
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
The road to the village is small.

896
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
There are dozens of roads.

897
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
And this is our farm.

898
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,040
So how can we avoid the land?

899
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,040
We can transport the food from our farm.

900
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,040
You two talk about your plan.

901
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,040
My lord.

902
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
You're the commander.

903
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,040
Commander, you're the first in the country to hear my report.

904
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,040
Now we're not in the village.

905
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
We'll definitely not meet the land's demand.

906
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,040
We can't bear to see how many roads we have.

907
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,040
We have ten roads and ten transports.

908
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
Who can tell who's who?

909
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,040
I think it's okay.

910
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
But the land is always suspicious.

911
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,040
This smoke bomb needs to be made beautifully.

912
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
Let's do it like this.

913
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
The food is our destiny.

914
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
So you must be careful.

915
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
Don't let the land find out.

916
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
Got it?

917
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
This is the report I've received.

918
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,040
Please take a look.

919
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,040
My lord.

920
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,040
There are dozens of transports sent by the other party.

921
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,040
The directions are different.

922
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,040
It must be to disturb our vision.

923
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,040
We can't tell which one is the road to the farm.

924
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,040
I think we should send more than ten people.

925
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,040
We can't miss the chance.

926
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,040
No hurry.

927
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
Send someone to investigate.

928
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
If you have any news, please report it.

929
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,040
My lord, you are really amazing.

930
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,040
The ten transports sent by the other party

931
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,040
must be the smoke bomb sent by them.

932
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
The night is full of smoke.

933
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,040
That's the real vehicle.

934
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,040
I thought that the light king was still fighting in the police station a few days ago.

935
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,040
But he's still in the police station.

936
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,040
He's still in the police station.

937
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,040
I don't know why.

938
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,040
He's a man.

939
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
He's a man.

940
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,040
I don't know why.

941
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,040
I don't know why.

942
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
He's still in the police station a few days ago.

943
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
I didn't expect that today

944
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
we will have a fire in the backyard.

945
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,040
My lord, what should we do next?

946
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,040
Yes.

947
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,040
My lord.

948
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
My lord.

949
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
My lord.

950
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,040
My lord.

951
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,040
Bai Chuan, what are you doing?

952
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Why are you doing this?

953
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,040
I thought you were hanging up.

954
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,040
This Yuan Zhou is so dry and dirty.

955
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,040
It's like a desert after a few days.

956
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,040
This is the natural water-free method I created.

957
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,040
Why don't you try it?

958
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
The news from the front line said that

959
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,040
the Lu Di has already led the soldiers to the cold warehouse.

960
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,040
My lord, set out as soon as possible.

961
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,040
It's not urgent.

962
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,040
It's not urgent.

963
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
Bai Chuan, I'm telling you.

964
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,040
You're from a girl's family.

965
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,040
You don't know how to take care of yourself.

966
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,040
If you lack water, you can easily grow wrinkles.

967
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
And you can get old.

968
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,040
Luckily, we've made a warning.

969
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,040
Now there's a sufficient water supply.

970
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,040
Zi Chuanxiu, the military machine is not serious.

971
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,040
If you continue like this,

972
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,040
don't blame me for being a fool.

973
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,040
Don't, don't, don't.

974
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,040
Don't be anxious.

975
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,040
Look, this lack of water

976
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,040
can easily cause skin problems.

977
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,040
Look at Lu Di's skin.

978
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,040
He's got a lot of water.

979
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,040
He's on a long and dry road.

980
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,040
Many soldiers may not even wash their faces.

981
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,040
They're so good at cooking.

982
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,040
Since we've made a warning,

983
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,040
we should take care of Ling Bao.

984
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,040
The emperor is the only one, right?

985
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,040
Now Lu Di has occupied the territory.

986
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,040
He's leaving for the east.

987
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,040
He's leaving.

988
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,040
Sorry.

989
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,040
Two, three, fight.

990
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,040
One, two, three, fight.

991
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,040
One, two, three, fight.

992
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,040
Master, master.

993
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,040
I'm going.

994
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,040
I'm going.

995
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,040
I'm going.

996
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,040
I'm going.

997
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,040
I'm going.

998
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,040
I'm going.

999
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,040
I'm going.

1000
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,040
I'm going.

1001
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,040
The front line is set.

1002
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,040
I'm going to go.

1003
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,040
The front line is set.

1004
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,040
Lu Di, wait.

1005
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,040
I'm sorry.

1006
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,040
I'm going.

1007
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,040
What are you doing?

1008
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,040
Why are you saying that

1009
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,040
I'm not the one who's going to fight?

1010
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
I'm going.

1011
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,040
I'm sorry.

1012
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,040
Stop.

1013
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,040
Come on.

1014
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,040
I forgot the lyrics.

1015
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,040
I'm not going to play with you.

1016
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,040
The gift is sent.

1017
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,040
It's a gift.

1018
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,040
It's a gift.

1019
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,040
I'm sorry.

1020
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,040
What's that?

1021
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,040
I'm sorry.

1022
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,040
I'm sorry.

1023
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,040
I'm sorry.

1024
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:10,760
You messed with me.

1025
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,040
I kept messing around.

1026
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,040
I mess with his thoughts

1027
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,040
from the last time we met.

1028
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,040
Each of us

1029
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,040
thinks this way,

1030
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,040
but if we play this Gaza,

1031
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,040
we're going to win a lot.

1032
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,040
Let's enjoy it.

1033
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,040
It's okay.

1034
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,040
Let's have a look.
