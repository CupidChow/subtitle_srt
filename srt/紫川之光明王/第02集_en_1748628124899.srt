1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,200
The flame of silence

2
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,200
The flame that burns the flames of confusion

3
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,400
Pursue the passion

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,400
The flame that burns the mountains and the plains

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,400
Will be free

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,700
English subsidies provided by Chinaawa

7
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,200
rampage

8
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,120
Wander in the night

9
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,800
The flames ofTime

10
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,000
�� A vitality is waiting for glimmer of light

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Fire

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,720
Burning, leaping present

13
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,320
The Надurats

14
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:36,320
My Amazing Boyfriend II

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,320
Episode 16

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
Then let's do as we agreed.

17
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
I'll go to Tuwei.

18
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
You take everyone away.

19
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
I'm just a general of the Northern Tribe.

20
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
There's still hope.

21
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
But the enemy's camp,

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
besides General Yun Qianxue,

23
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,320
also has the Emperor of the Dragon God,

24
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
to personally suppress me.

25
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Emperor of the Dragon God?

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
Forget it.

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
To live in the battlefield with you,

28
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,320
even if it's a little difficult,

29
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
it's worth it.

30
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
No, no, no, no, no, no.

31
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
It's too unlucky.

32
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
I'm still 99 years old.

33
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Second Brother,

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,320
the war is coming.

35
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Are you thinking about

36
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
the Northern Tribe's Khatana?

37
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
Yes.

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Yes.

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
But

40
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
I'm in the battlefield now.

41
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Tomorrow, his father will be the one to fight.

42
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Don't worry.

43
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
Now,

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
you can't hurt the Emperor of the Dragon God,

45
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
nor can he hurt you.

46
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
You'll still have a chance to meet again.

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Will I still owe you?

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
Yes.

49
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
What about you?

50
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Who are you thinking about?

51
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Me?

52
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
There are so many people I'm thinking about.

53
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Like

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Xiao Hua,

55
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Xiao Duo,

56
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Xiao Li,

57
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
and Xiao Fang.

58
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Anyway, there are so many people I'm thinking about.

59
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
I'm afraid

60
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
you'll die without any serious things.

61
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
The Emperor of the Dragon God has 100,000 soldiers.

62
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
The Pai City

63
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
is in a state of chaos.

64
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
How many cities are left?

65
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Eight.

66
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Only eight?

67
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
The Emperor of the Dragon God is coming.

68
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
The army is in a big battle.

69
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
The morale is the lowest at this time.

70
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
It's indeed the best time to attack the city.

71
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
Then why are there only eight cities?

72
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
The territory.

73
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
This territory

74
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,320
always makes me feel uneasy.

75
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
This small territory

76
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
has less than tens of thousands of soldiers.

77
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
I think what you're thinking about

78
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
is my brother

79
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
and Brother Lu.

80
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Brother Lu

81
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
is indeed the confidant of Yun Qian Xue.

82
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Now,

83
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Prince Khatun and Brother Lu

84
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
have been watching the fire in the secret place.

85
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
I can only win this battle.

86
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
I can't lose.

87
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
Only by taking down the Pai Camp

88
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
are they no longer

89
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
a threat to you.

90
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
But this territory...

91
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Can it fly?

92
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
The Pai Camp at this time

93
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
is really hard to escape.

94
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
I hope so.

95
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
Are the skin and water ready?

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Yes.

97
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
It's ready.

98
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
According to the time

99
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
when Si Yiling and the others

100
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
entered the Pai Camp,

101
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
the food was exhausted

102
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
a few days ago.

103
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
Now,

104
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
not to mention Yun Qian Xue,

105
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
even a stupid person

106
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
can take them down.

107
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Sir,

108
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
we are at a great distance

109
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,320
from the Pai Camp.

110
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Moreover,

111
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
hundreds of thousands of soldiers

112
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
are still in the middle.

113
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
If we want to

114
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
transport the information

115
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
and food,

116
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
I'm afraid it will be difficult to get to the sky.

117
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,320
Is it difficult to get to the sky?

118
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
You mean

119
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
to transport food with war bamboo?

120
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
But one war bamboo

121
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
can't transport much food.

122
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
One or two is not enough.

123
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
One or a hundred is not enough.

124
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
We have to

125
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
transport all the war bamboo.

126
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Sir,

127
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
the one who was surrounded

128
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
in the Pai Camp

129
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
is my brother.

130
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
The Northern Su Army

132
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
has begun to gather.

133
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Today,

134
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
is the time

135
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
for you to make achievements.

136
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
The Shenhuang Night

137
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
is here.

138
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
The Shenhuang Night

139
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
is here.

140
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
The Shenhuang Night

141
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
is here.

142
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
The Shenhuang Night

143
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
is here.

144
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Look at the Northern Army.

145
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
What's up there?

146
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Is it Wuyun?

147
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
It's my brother.

148
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,320
Each war bamboo

149
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
is equipped with a cloth.

150
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
It's considered

151
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
my brother's most valuable treasure.

152
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
Sir,

153
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
all war bamboo

154
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
are equipped with a cloth.

155
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
They are ready to run.

156
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
The Ministry of Works, prepare.

157
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Shoot.

158
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Look.

159
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
My brother didn't leave

160
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
a note for us.

161
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
It's probably because

162
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
we're afraid of death.

163
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
It means

164
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
it's Wuyun.

165
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
The Northern Army

166
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
is here.

167
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
The Shenhuang Night

168
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
is here.

169
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
The Shenhuang Night

170
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
is here.

171
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
The Shenhuang Night

172
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
is here.

173
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
The Shenhuang Night

174
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
is here.

175
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
The Shenhuang Night

176
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
is here.

177
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
The Shenhuang Night

178
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
is here.

179
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
The Shenhuang Night

180
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
is here.

181
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
The Shenhuang Night

182
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
is here.

183
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
The Shenhuang Night

184
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
is here.

185
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
The Shenhuang Night

186
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
is here.

187
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
The Shenhuang Night

188
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
is here.

189
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
The Shenhuang Night

190
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
is here.

191
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
The Shenhuang Night

192
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
is here.

193
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
The Shenhuang Night

194
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
is here.

195
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
The Shenhuang Night

196
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
is here.

197
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320

is here.

201
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
The Shenhuang Night

202
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
is here.

203
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
The Shenhuang Night

204
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
is here.

205
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
The Shenhuang Night

206
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
is here.

207
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
The Shenhuang Night

208
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
is here.

209
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
The Shenhuang Night

210
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
is here.

211
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,320
The Shenhuang Night

212
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
is here.

213
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
The Shenhuang Night

214
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
is here.

215
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
The Shenhuang Night

216
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
is here.

217
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
The Shenhuang Night

218
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
is here.

219
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,300
What did you say?

220
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,400
Your Excellency.

221
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a close call.

222
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,120
Shall we hit the enemy

223
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,920
and prepare to fight?

224
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,400
We don't have time.

225
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,440
There's no time.

226
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,760
It's just clockwise observation.

227
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,480
What we're doing now

228
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,200
is a matter of life and death.

229
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,840
The whole army will be killed

230
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,020
if we don't stayCamell gracias

231
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,900
will be killed.

232
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,420
Is it really time

233
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,700
to turn your heads

234
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,160
and join forces for two days?

235
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,340
It's too early to listen.

236
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,340
can make both of you parents...

237
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
Could it be...

238
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,700
He's here.

239
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,500
Get out of the way!

240
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,300
Be careful.

241
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,100
You're flying too slowly.

242
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,980
Brother.

243
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,660
You idiot.

244
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,620
Why are you injured?

245
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,620
It's nothing.

246
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,540
You two are idiots.

247
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,860
You've been surrounded for so long.

248
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,700
You're surrounded and you're still together.

249
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,660
You're obviously three idiots.

250
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,900
Xiao Yan.

251
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,740
Is it bhata or what?

252
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,020
Hindu arts perfektion.

253
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,380
Perhaps,

254
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,900
if you're not skillful enough.

255
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,500
Then he got stiffness in his feet.

256
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,980
And he fell down.

257
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,180
We missed the best chance.

258
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,780
Listen to me.

259
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,620
You want to attack?

260
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,380
Now, they are showing good怨.

261
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,340
Heard my consumption.

262
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,520
All troops.

263
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,300
Today, three of us broght drink thevadity.

264
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,300
It's worth it.

265
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,940
That's the only way.

266
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,740
D during war

267
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,320
Don't back off.

268
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't back off.

269
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,800
Attack the enemy!

270
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,920
Horror series

271
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,680
Serves you right!

272
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,780
teaspoon

273
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,000
Select!

274
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,640
哪裡是

275
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,460
what

276
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,540
Order

277
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,800
I will

278
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,520
make it

279
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,380
find

280
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,780
it

281
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,340
��

282
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,540
Eldest Brother, make use of this chance if it is so,

283
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,480
then Imperial Physician Guo will not be able to spare your life,

284
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,260
or else, you will only make later use of it.

285
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,940
Do you know how you two look in a man's opinion?

286
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,380
Sohes.

287
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,940
Are there any matters I should be confined to?

288
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,540
Why are you not ready yet?

289
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,980
I know that now that Young Master in the prison is dead,

290
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,980
if you are not eternally preparing to test me,

291
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,980
The night of the mountain

292
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,980
The night of the mountain

293
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980
The night of the mountain

294
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,980
The night of the mountain

295
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,980
The night of the mountain

296
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,980
The Night of the Mountain

297
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,980
Big brother

298
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,980
You spent so much money to save us

299
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,980
This Shuli Si

300
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Spend tens of thousands of silk coins a year

301
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,980
To raise hundreds of war wounds

302
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,980
After this, the damage is heavy

303
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,980
Over half the damage

304
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,980
I know

305
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,980
Big brother, you are the best to me

306
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,980
Big brother loves me so much

307
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,980
Don't be so hard on yourself

308
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,980
I'm fine

309
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,980
By the way, big brother

310
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,980
That

311
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,980
Your wings are so cool

312
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,980
Although it's broken

313
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,980
But I think it can be used to repair

314
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,980
How about you give it to me

315
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,980
I want to fly in the sky

316
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,980
I said you are not a cashier

317
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,980
You want to pull my skin

318
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,980
Didn't you get some rich people

319
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,980
You made a lot of money

320
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,980
Hurry up and give me the money

321
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,980
No problem

322
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,980
As long as you send me the wings

323
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,980
I'll give you the money as soon as I go out

324
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,980
As far as I know you

325
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,980
You can say that there is no money

326
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,980
I

327
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,980
What are you, you have money

328
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,980
I have money

329
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,980
Big brother, I have no money anyway

330
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,980
Dishu Army has been in a good mood

331
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,980
I don't know you yet

332
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,980
I never have money

333
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,980
But

334
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,980
Can let the brothers of Dishu Army

335
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,980
Give me a favor

336
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,980
Enough

337
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
Second brother

338
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,980
Now our three brothers are all together

339
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,980
The provisions are also enough for the time being

340
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,980
But

341
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,980
Northern army is strong

342
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,980
I'm afraid it's a bit difficult to break through

343
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,980
And this snow in front of the clouds

344
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,980
According to our understanding of it

345
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,980
It will continue to attack the city

346
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,980
Keep consuming us

347
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,980
The provisions I brought today

348
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,980
Can only reduce the need for food and clothing

349
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,980
Can't turn the situation around

350
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980
If the northern tribe is now strong

351
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,980
Even if the three of us work together

352
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,980
There may not be a base for a battle

353
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,980
Now rely on ourselves

354
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,980
Even if there is a battle

355
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,980
Maybe there is some survival

356
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,980
But this game

357
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,980
Will let a large number of soldiers die

358
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,980
Even involve innocent people

359
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,980
Such victory

360
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,980
No doubt defeat

361
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,980
Big brother, we pulled you into the mud

362
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,980
Why do our three brothers say this

363
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,980
But what I'm most worried about now

364
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,980
300,000 army officers outside the city

365
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,980
And behind the treasure

366
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,980
The army is on the line

367
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,980
Such a state of the Juzhu

368
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:10,320
Even if they take the

369
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
The whole Yuanzhou

370
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
This sacred wildness is big enough

371
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
This sacred old man

372
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
It's too arrogant

373
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,980
But

374
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,980
If I don't fight

375
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,980
I'll let them retreat

376
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,980
Big brother

377
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
You mean the peace talks

378
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
Only peace talks can reduce family losses

379
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,980
To protect the lives of the warriors

380
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,980
But not to mention the capital

381
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,980
Do you agree with us doing this

382
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,980
It's not the best time for peace talks now

383
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,980
According to the current military strategy

384
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,980
The Juzhu

385
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,980
It seems that peace talks and surrender

386
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,980
There is no difference

387
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,980
That's because we have too few horses

388
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,980
Unless

389
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,980
The army food in the ground

390
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,980
Has been transported into the city of Pai

391
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,980
I was born in the first year of the first year

392
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,980
I wanted to be fearless

393
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,980
But I didn't expect

394
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,980
The enemy still has a back move

395
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,980
With ten fingers of water

396
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,980
Burn the fire

397
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,980
The dust

398
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,980
The loss of the soldiers is the punishment

399
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,980
The sin is unforgivable

400
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,980
Please punish me

401
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,980
When I was young

402
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,980
I also fought a defeat

403
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,980
But I'm different from you

404
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,980
I never

405
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,980
Admit my mistakes

406
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,980
Because I know

407
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,980
On the battlefield

408
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,980
Every decision I make

409
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,980
Is correct

410
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,980
If it were me

411
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,980
Today's retreat

412
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,980
Will also be the same

413
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,980
I

414
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,980
Dare not compare with the emperor

415
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980
Please, emperor

416
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
I will not compare with you

417
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Please punish me

418
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,740
There are three people

419
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,680
TuWho

420
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:45,980
Art's

421
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,980
Episode 16

422
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,140
I remember something strange

423
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,220
from what you said just now.

424
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,020
Last night, when I went to the Beizhuo Camp

425
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,380
to investigate the military situation,

426
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,380
I found that

427
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,580
the flags on their camp tents

428
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,740
were black.

429
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,540
They were all the symbols of those

430
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,860
who were used to commemorate the imperial family.

431
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,020
Kalan and Khatun

432
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,700
were still alive.

433
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,060
Could it be that the memorial was made by Khatun?

434
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,660
You mean

435
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,900
they thought that Khatun died in the capital?

436
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,500
The assassination that Khatun

437
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,740
committed in the capital

438
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,300
was done by the Beizhuo clan.

439
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,300
However,

440
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,740
the plan failed.

441
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,140
But they still released the news

442
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,020
that Khatun was dead.

443
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,020
Mr. Ge sent people to the Beizhuo clan many times

444
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,980
to explain the misunderstanding.

445
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,260
It seems that the news

446
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,980
was not sent to the late Emperor of the Saerong.

447
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,340
I came to the far away state

448
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,700
because the late Emperor thought that Khatun was dead.

449
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,900
So he was angry and got sick.

450
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,940
They all said that the late Emperor

451
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,100
was suspicious of Khatun.

452
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,220
It seems that this is not a lie.

453
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,300
There is another possibility

454
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,420
that is not eliminated.

455
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,500
The late Emperor of the Saerong

456
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,940
knew that Khatun was still alive.

457
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,860
But he still needs this excuse.

458
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,140
Otherwise,

459
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,260
why didn't he send people

460
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,540
to the capital to verify Khatun's life and death?

461
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,580
Brother,

462
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,500
the risk of the peace talks is too great.

463
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,140
How can you know if you don't try?

464
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,700
And this time,

465
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,140
I will personally meet the late Emperor.

466
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,060
You will personally meet the late Emperor?

467
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,660
Alone?

468
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,780
Brother, are you gambling?

469
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,540
Do you have any other ways?

470
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,180
Don't worry.

471
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,740
I will ask Khatun for a letter of his handwriting.

472
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,420
Otherwise, it will be useless even if I go.

473
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,940
As long as the late Emperor cares about Khatun's life and death,

474
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,260
he will definitely meet me

475
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,940
with this letter.

476
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,460
But even if we let Khatun go,

477
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,460
he will not stop the battle,

478
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,780
right?

479
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,380
Khatun's brother

480
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,300
has always wanted to kill him.

481
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,820
So he will definitely make a mistake.

482
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,740
In this situation,

483
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,220
we can only do this.

484
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,220
And the more cards we have, the better.

485
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,500
Khatun will only be the most important step.

486
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,780
But don't worry.

487
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,380
I will try to master the arrangements of the negotiation

488
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,780
and make the least concessions.

489
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,460
It's getting late.

490
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,060
Go and see your brother.

491
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,900
Brother.

492
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,660
Brother.

493
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,820
I just got a bottle of good wine

494
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,380
from the pub in Pa Yi City.

495
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,780
That boss of mine is so stingy.

496
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,660
He used half a bag of food to exchange it.

497
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,340
How about

498
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,740
we find a place to drink it?

499
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,060
We haven't drunk for a long time.

500
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,920
fi Ly

501
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Seems like

502
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,940
this strategy is the best for the present situation.

503
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,700
But you are my brother.

504
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,700
Why did you kill these people,

505
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,200
Ayovar

506
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,780
the commissar and the convict?

507
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,780
But you're my brother.

508
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,060
If you want to fight against the King of the Gods,

509
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,860
we three

510
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,380
might not be able to defeat you.

511
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,260
Brother,

512
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,940
I'm not afraid of death.

513
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,220
I'll listen to you.

514
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,380
Look,

515
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,700
the три

516
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:09,400
renewable energy

517
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:09,880
is coming.

518
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,820
Gui He,

519
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,660
please aren't people under your Power in the building

520
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,300
pushing passed by you.

521
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:17,920
No!

522
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:18,940
Don't get me wrong!

523
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:20,860
It's been this pase-passe

524
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,660
These three Lynn Eamon

525
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,660
they were a couple before.

526
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:49,160
I better stopいや

527
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,460
They want me to be worried.

528
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,460
I have my daughter to protect.

529
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:07,780
T핢

530
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,180
Brother.

531
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,060
Go to pack effects to us.

532
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,080
Jump.

533
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,720
Quick.

534
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,560
Halt.

535
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,400
Come.

536
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:25,840
Come.

537
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,400
Jump rush.

538
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,880
Come.

539
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:28,920
Jump.

540
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,560
Come.

541
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,520
Yes.

542
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
You got scared.

543
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,640
анитовhakidab Cannon of Nahas 추 için

544
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,820
We will be after you once we get there.

545
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,960
What about

546
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,380
Luo Ming Hai

547
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,340
Do you know that

548
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,840
You have to be shot

549
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,560
Redo

550
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,540
Redo

551
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,760
I Gonzalo

552
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,240
YouTube

553
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:25,000
No one should位 while none of them is in charge of

554
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,640
If you choose to stay here

555
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
order Fengqing to withdraw

556
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,320
All military affairs must be reported to the commanding office

557
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,480
You are not only idle but abused

558
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,680
Go to the Commander's Mansion to meet him.

559
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,800
Let them go.

560
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,760
Retreat!

561
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,120
Thank you for helping me out, Lord Li Xing.

562
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,960
You're welcome.

563
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,920
It's my duty to deliver my order.

564
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,600
I just returned to the capital.

565
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,320
You knew it?

566
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,320
My Lord,

567
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
didn't Luo Minghai know that you just returned?

568
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,800
You seem to like this painting.

569
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,320
What's its name?

570
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,760
It's...

571
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,320
Wan Wu.

572
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,120
I came to the capital to know

573
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,080
that there's a painting like this.

574
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,880
I've never seen it before when I was in the Northern Tribe.

575
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,640
I guess

576
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,840
only the water painting of Zichuan can support it.

577
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,320
Wan Wu.

578
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,960
Your Highness,

579
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,480
Lord Di Ling is here to see you.

580
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,440
Lord Di Ling is here?

581
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,960
Isn't he in the far away state?

582
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
He said

583
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,320
he came to see Princess Khatan.

584
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,320
So I came here to ask you for a favor.

585
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,840
I didn't know that

586
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,120
you were still alive.

587
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,200
So please write a letter

588
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
to prove your identity.

589
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,200
I see.

590
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,720
I'll write it

591
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,400
and give it to you later.

592
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

593
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,400
Your Highness,

594
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
I have something to do.

595
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,920
I'll leave now.

596
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Are they all right?

597
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,320
They're all fine.

598
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,240
They're all in Paiyi now.

599
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,200
It's hard to defend them.

600
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,640
Besides,

601
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,240
there are plenty of food and clothing in the city.

602
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

603
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,600
I'll leave now.

604
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,720
Li Cheng.

605
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,520
You haven't eaten anything for one day.

606
00:30:48,040 --> 00:31:13,000
congressional water

607
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
We could return within 10 days.

608
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,360
Then our grain

609
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,880
will overcome 10 more days.

610
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:36,500
A

611
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,280
T

612
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,480
They were the stone of the palace

613
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,440
for 5 days.

614
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,280
It seems like we need to attack Har picked up

615
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,200
Xiaoxiao's passion.

616
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,160
The Beis have already devalued their army.

617
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,240
They've also used?

618
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,900
The superiority in their armament

619
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,480
is already stronれた.

620
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,080
I think they should be anxious now.

621
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,420
Thesi going forward

622
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,360
will be

623
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,200
Believe

624
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,400
After a day,

625
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,800
Rest for a while. I'll go and help you.

626
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,400
I heard that Di Lin treats his wife very well.

627
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,400
He feeds her every day.

628
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Seeing this craft today,

629
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,400
it seems that the rumors in the room are true.

630
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Sir, I thought you were resting.

631
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
I didn't disturb you.

632
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,400
I was just resting.

633
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
I was just resting.

634
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
I was just resting.

635
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
I was just resting. I didn't disturb you.

636
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,400
I was just waiting for you.

637
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
You've worked hard day and night.

638
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
You've worked hard day and night.

639
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
When I left the capital,

640
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,400
I haven't seen so many white hair.

641
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,400
A city with a white hair.

642
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,400
I love it.

643
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,400
I'm old. I should be like this.

644
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,400
If I have a lot of hair,

645
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,400
I'll become a monster.

646
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Okay, let's not talk about hair.

647
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Come. I want to hear about the situation of the rebel.

648
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Now the rebel

649
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,400
has died.

650
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,400
I'm sorry.

651
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Do you have food for the rebel?

652
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
I brought the food for the rebel.

653
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
I'll feed him for ten days.

654
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Do you have soldiers for the rebel?

655
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
The army of the rebel and the embroidery battalion

656
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
have lost more than half of their forces.

657
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
How's the army of the Northern tribe?

658
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,400
The emperor has already led the battle.

659
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
The Xiong clan is a million.

660
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
It's not easy to defeat them.

661
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Sir,

662
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
The Northern tribe's forces are powerful and powerful.

663
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
They are powerful and powerful.

664
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
They are powerful and powerful.

665
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,400
The imperial mausoleum was once a place of self-destruction.

666
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
But now I'm at the end of the rebellion.

667
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,400
I see the Northern tribe's coming.

668
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,400
I only feel despair.

669
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
If you say so,

670
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,400
it's not just the rebellion.

671
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,400
It's also the case in Sichuan.

672
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
The Black Banner Army of Fangjing,

673
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
the border army of the Northern tribe,

674
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
the imperial mausoleum of Si Yiling,

675
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
have all been badly damaged.

676
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
The foundation of Sichuan has been damaged.

677
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,400
In the next ten years,

678
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,400
the war will not end.

679
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
The army of the rebel is no longer strong.

680
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,400
The ground is also in ruins.

681
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,400
The people are not alive.

682
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Sichuan

683
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
is in a bad shape.

684
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,400
So I'm here to ask you

685
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,400
to allow me to negotiate with the Northern tribe.

686
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,400
The Northern tribe and I have great power.

687
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
They can completely

688
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,400
dominate the capital with no pressure.

689
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,400
What is the reason for the negotiation?

690
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
So I beg you

691
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
to agree to two conditions.

692
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Please.

693
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,400
The Northern tribe is in a bad shape.

694
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Please.

695
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
First,

696
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
return the card.

697
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
We only found out

698
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
when we fought with the Northern tribe.

699
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
The late emperor thought the card was dead.

700
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
First, he was trying to make a fool of Yang Minghua.

701
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Second, he was hiding the news

702
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
because of Prince Ka Dun.

703
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
The late emperor loves you so much.

704
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
If we return the card,

705
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
you will be in a bad shape.

706
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
There is hope.

707
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Yes.

708
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
So

709
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
what is the reason

710
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
for the negotiation?

711
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Qi Er...

712
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Please

713
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
give up Yuan Zhou's

714
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
twenty-three-step management power.

715
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,400
This is the only way.

716
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Father, do you know

717
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
what you are saying?

718
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
I understand.

719
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
Since the early days of Yuan Zhou,

720
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Yuan Zhou has been like a purple boat.

721
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
It is like a dead boat's arm.

722
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
It is like a broken arm.

723
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
It is like a dead body.

724
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
It is like a dead boat's skin.

725
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
It is hard to support yourself if you lose your skin.

726
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
If we give up Yuan Zhou,

727
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
you will be the ruler of the Song Dynasty.

728
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
The land will be the subject of the State of Ru.

729
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
You will be the ancestor of the Holy Spirit Hall.

730
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
You will be the best of all the people.

731
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
You will be the leader of the whole country.

732
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
You will be the leader of the whole country.

733
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,400
Do you still want to give up Yuan Zhou?

734
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Please allow me

735
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
to give you three solutions.

736
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
First,

737
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
the chaos in the West Chuan Continent

738
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
is the only key

739
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
to the military and army.

740
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,400
As long as we have the army,

741
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
we can get everything we lost back.

742
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,400
And the Imperial Army

743
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
is the only elite army

744
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
in the whole country.

745
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,400
We must protect it no matter what.

746
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Second,

747
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
the entire country has been

748
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
in a lot of disasters.

749
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
The Northern tribe has been invaded.

750
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
The Shishui Pool,

751
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
the Moon Bay,

752
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
and all the other places have been destroyed.

753
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
We have lost millions of troops.

754
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
The whole country has been in a lot of disasters.

755
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
The Northern tribe is now in a fierce battle.

756
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
The battle between the Yuchi Tribe

757
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
and the Liu Feng family is still on the line.

758
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
If we start a war,

759
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
we will not win.

760
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
We will lose the whole country in three years.

761
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
By then,

762
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
how will we face the ancestors of our family?

763
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
The Third,

764
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
the family needs to take care of themselves.

765
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
The mother needs to

766
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
have her child again.

767
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
The national treasury needs to

768
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
have more food.

769
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
The Lord,

770
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
ten years,

771
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
ten years is enough

772
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,400
for us to have our children again.

773
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
The last ten years,

774
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
we will have our children again.

775
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
The last ten years,

776
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,400
we will have our children again.

777
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
Ten years is enough for us to have

778
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
two million troops again.

779
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Si Yiling, Ah Xiu,

780
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
we will help you get everything you lost

781
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
back for you.

782
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
Ten years,

783
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
I don't know if I can live.

784
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Time and patience

785
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
are our only weapon.

786
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,400
These ten years,

787
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,400
we can strengthen our country,

788
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,400
and fight our enemies.

789
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
Zichuan will be strong soon.

790
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
And you are the winner of the Spring and Autumn.

791
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Why are you so worried?

792
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,400
Besides,

793
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
besides,

794
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
you will see

795
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
the victory of the prosperity.

796
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
I won.

797
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:40,400
We won.

798
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Great.

799
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Miss Jiu,

800
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
this is an不同 way.

801
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Three,

802
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
The clothes are too beautiful

803
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Your torch is still burning

804
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,400
Light up the road you took

805
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,400
In the place we walked together

806
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,400
There is no glory in the dark

807
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,400
The old friend who disappeared

808
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,400
He never left

809
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:29,400
Silence is just waiting for you to open your mouth

810
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,400
The old friend who disappeared

811
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,400
He never left

812
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Silence is just waiting for you to open your mouth

813
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,400
I can't bear to leave the old time

814
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,400
Don't let go of the hands of the past

815
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
One, two, three

816
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:14,400
There is a person who likes to stay in the past

817
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Good good good

818
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Turn around

819
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,400
Stop stop stop

820
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
One, two, three

821
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
This time it is different

822
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,880
This one feels I have been squeezed

823
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:53,220
Zhezhu
