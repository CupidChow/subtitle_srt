1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's not appropriate to obey a empress's order.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
However!

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If I could say no more,

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
my Eliан繆 has to kill him.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My father told me that

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
all the Legendary gurus

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
should regard mother as their Pe honey第二,

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,880
the tomb is the one that's varieties hermit.

24
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,940
You take care of the daughter.

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,940
She should take good care of me again.

26
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,140
He's just a child.

27
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,220
He's not as good as you.

28
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,740
Sir, the fridge is right ahead.

29
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,500
Go!

30
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,780
Sir,

31
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,260
why did Prince Guang get the fridge

32
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,300
to the basement?

33
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,940
Prince Guang

34
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,620
Open the fridge outside.

35
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,520
Go toAnn

36
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,100
I will find a place for Prince Guang

37
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,660
There is no guy here

38
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,740
There is no one here

39
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,260
It's super distant

40
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,340
I think I can find something here

41
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,780
Silly

42
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,700
Are you essere strong?

43
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,220
I can take care of it myself.

44
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,180
But it's温

45
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,660
I have to stand man and ship.

46
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,940
It's only these courses.

47
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,180
Otherwise,

48
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,580
I'm stuck.

49
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,020
You're overpraise me.

50
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,980
You'll have to bring it up.

51
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,780
But I need to 없습니다 anything.

52
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,220
Really can't help.

53
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,100
I dare not fight with you.

54
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,380
Then why are you holding me?

55
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,980
So you did all the digging

56
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,580
not for the sake of the landlady's good fortune,

57
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,260
but for the sake of the waterlady's good fortune.

58
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,220
Lord Lu Di is really smart.

59
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,940
I really admire him.

60
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,900
Why don't you take a bath first

61
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,420
and then talk to you later?

62
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,540
Let's go.

63
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,100
Lu De.

64
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,660
Lu De, come back.

65
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,620
My lord.

66
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,380
I'm not a good man.

67
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,860
Catch the rat.

68
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,180
Hurry up.

69
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,060
Lord Lu Di.

70
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,540
The water source is short.

71
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,500
Especially the army is out.

72
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,380
Maybe he can't wash the landlady's good fortune for several days.

73
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,420
I wonder if Lord Lu Di

74
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,060
has the same feelings for me.

75
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,700
I'm not a good man.

76
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,700
You think you're a good man?

77
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,740
I promised you this time.

78
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,460
But as long as I burn the house,

79
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,820
be careful.

80
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,460
You're not my opponent.

81
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,380
Lord Lu Di.

82
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,980
Get up.

83
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,380
Go.

84
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,380
What are you selling in the lake?

85
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,380
I'm not good at anything else.

86
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,860
I'm just a good man.

87
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,020
Since Lord Lu Di is not good at it,

88
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,500
we'll fight here the day after tomorrow

89
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,660
and take your position.

90
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,820
But I can't fight in vain.

91
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,700
You have to take the position.

92
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,500
You have to pay me the military salary.

93
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,020
This is a good example.

94
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,620
When we meet you again,

95
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,020
we'll be together.

96
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,100
Great.

97
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,340
You've let me down this time.

98
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,180
When I kill your army,

99
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,100
I'll take the landlady's land.

100
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,100
I'll let you go.

101
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,980
Good.

102
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,660
I'll take your courage.

103
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,300
When I meet you again,

104
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,660
I'll let you go

105
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,140
when I ask for your help.

106
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,940
Run.

107
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,980
Why are you playing the game again?

108
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,900
Because Lord Lu Di is a good man.

109
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,100
He's a good man.

110
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,340
Tao Er,

111
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,780
you want this?

112
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,940
Yes.

113
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,540
We, the Lian Meng Army,

114
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,180
need a strong and strong opponent

115
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,620
to be our training partner.

116
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,620
It's a great deal

117
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,540
to have a training partner like you.

118
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,740
How can I not like him?

119
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,580
All right.

120
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,420
Soldiers,

121
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,420
back to the camp.

122
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,180
No one wants to kill me anyway.

123
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,940
We'll be by my side!

124
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,220
My Lord.

125
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,020
I heard that

126
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,540
these men are important cases.

127
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:06,580
Besides,

128
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,420
just as you�

129
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,420
have my orders

130
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,340
I've got some wild men andbreakers.

131
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,660
I'm gonna put them

132
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,300
in aepsire halls outside the city.

133
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,420
Let's go

134
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,180
and see our merchants.

135
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,660
I don't know if my wife can handle it.

136
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,660
You still want to be a greedy man?

137
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,660
You've been thinking about it all along.

138
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,660
What do you mean?

139
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,660
Does that minister really care about things?

140
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,660
Do you know who this is?

141
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,660
I don't know.

142
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,660
The Guizi Hand of Yuan Zhou.

143
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,660
You haven't heard of it?

144
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,660
It's him!

145
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,660
What are you afraid of?

146
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,660
You're soldiers, of course.

147
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,660
Like our people,

148
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,660
he's in our hearts.

149
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,660
It's like he's a man of the people.

150
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,660
What's the point of a man of the people?

151
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,660
He's innocent and fair at the same time.

152
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,660
Those living people of the new generation

153
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,660
are more terrible than the dead.

154
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,660
These are the reports from the Wanyun?

155
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,660
Yes, sir.

156
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,660
They're the ones who ate the chestnut buns.

157
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,660
They're the ones who ate the chestnut buns.

158
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,660
They're the ones who ate the chestnut buns.

159
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,660
They're the ones who want to go to the capital

160
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,660
to report to the three provinces.

161
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,660
You...

162
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,660
You're not here to make any justice.

163
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,660
You're here to kill us!

164
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,660
It's a trap.

165
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,660
If you give up the three provinces,

166
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,660
and go back to persuade other officials and refugees,

167
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,660
I'll let you go back alive.

168
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,660
We didn't expect you to go back alive.

169
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,660
You can block our mouths,

170
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,660
but you can't block the entrance.

171
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,660
You can't calm down the anger.

172
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,660
As the representative of the Immortal Clan,

173
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,660
we're not enough to die.

174
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,660
But there are still so many people in Wanyun

175
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,660
who are bullied by the people.

176
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,660
They won't be able to do anything.

177
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,660
Yes, Wanyun won't be easily arrested.

178
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
Even if we die here,

179
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,660
we'll be locked up.

180
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
Come on!

181
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,660
Kill them if you want to!

182
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,660
My wife knows I'm dead.

183
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,660
She'll be very upset,

184
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,660
but she'll know that I'm using another way

185
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,660
to protect her!

186
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,660
Come on!

187
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,660
If we really get to the capital,

188
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,660
we might have to face death for a long time.

189
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
Are you willing to go with me?

190
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,660
For Wanyun,

191
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
we'll die long ago.

192
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,660
Really?

193
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Since the old man who came to the capital

194
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,660
was tortured,

195
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,660
the Immortal Clan has been investigating this matter.

196
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,660
Is there any problem?

197
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,660
Not yet.

198
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
Don't worry.

199
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,660
He can't find any evidence.

200
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,660
Maybe now,

201
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,660
I'm in a very poor state.

202
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,660
Master Xiao.

203
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
This is...

204
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,660
After the cleaning,

205
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,660
it's still not as beautiful as before.

206
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,660
Take it.

207
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,660
Throw it away for me.

208
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,660
If you have nothing else to do,

209
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
you can go back now.

210
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,660
Yes.

211
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,660
Master.

212
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
This is the list of the four troops

213
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
under the Three-Shen Taekwondo.

214
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,660
Please take a look.

215
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,660
Now,

216
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,660
don't let the movements get out.

217
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,660
Actually,

218
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,660
I'm not sure

219
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
if I can go back to the capital.

220
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,660
Actually,

221
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
this matter is a matter of the cleaning.

222
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
You don't have to worry too much.

223
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,660
The so-called

224
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
military force is the national force.

225
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,660
If the soldiers under the Three-Shen Taekwondo

226
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,660
are willing to participate in the recruitment,

227
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,660
in the future,

228
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
we'll have a lot of soldiers.

229
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
But...

230
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,660
When I was investigating the four troops,

231
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,660
I found another thing.

232
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,660
I was very satisfied

233
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,660
with the progress

234
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,660
of the repair of the Wanyin.

235
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,660
I should have gotten the people of Anzhi

236
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,660
and kept the city locked up.

237
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,660
No one was in charge.

238
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
As for the treatment of the soldiers,

239
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,660
it was even more difficult.

240
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,660
It caused the Wanyin Army to be very confused.

241
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,660
The repair of the Wanyin is

242
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,660
always under the Three-Shen Taekwondo.

243
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,660
This matter is about the Three-Shen Taekwondo.

244
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,660
It's a big relationship.

245
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,660
It's a big issue.

246
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,660
It's a big issue.

247
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,660
Did you find out?

248
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,660
The situation was too chaotic.

249
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,660
I found out that there was a problem.

250
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
But I brought back a lot of witnesses.

251
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
Now,

252
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,660
no matter what happens in this situation,

253
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660
the Three-Shen Taekwondo

254
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,660
needs to come out

255
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,660
and give a reasonable explanation.

256
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660
What about the Three-Shen Taekwondo?

257
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,660
The best explanation is

258
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,660
the explanation.

259
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Now, the Wanyin Army is in the south.

260
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,660
If we only rely on the Three-Shen Taekwondo

261
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,660
to get a few bites,

262
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,660
if we really have the ability to do so,

263
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,660
we will be lucky.

264
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660
Since you brought your witnesses,

265
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
we will go to the Wanyin Army

266
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,660
and find the Three-Shen Taekwondo.

267
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,660
Yes.

268
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,660
Let's go.

269
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,660
Introduce yourself to the people.

270
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,660
My name is Chuan Nan.

271
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,660
I'm the ordinary noodle boss

272
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,660
of Wanyin Army.

273
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,660
Your noodles.

274
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,660
Five jin.

275
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,660
Five jin for a bowl of noodles.

276
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,660
Yes.

277
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,660
Eight jin for the meat.

278
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
What are you doing?

279
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,660
I'm going to smash your black shop.

280
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,660
Smash who?

281
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,660
Who is the black shop?

282
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,660
A bowl of noodles.

283
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,660
Five jin for a bowl of noodles.

284
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,660
We are all calm.

285
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,660
Listen to me explain.

286
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,660
Now, this is the time.

287
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,660
We have to pay ten jin.

288
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,660
We have to pay eight jin of water.

289
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,660
Two jin left.

290
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,660
And a small family.

291
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,660
You go and ask around.

292
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
How dare you take the risk of opening a shop?

293
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,660
Who is not this family?

294
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,660
What risk?

295
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,660
They are coming.

296
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,660
I'm not selling.

297
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,660
My lord.

298
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,660
I'm doing business.

299
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,660
I didn't do anything illegal.

300
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,660
Don't touch me.

301
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,660
Don't touch me.

302
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,660
We are the experts in the cultivation of the mountain.

303
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,660
The cultivation of the mountain is great.

304
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,660
There are many people in need.

305
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,660
As the people of Wanyin,

306
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,660
you should be able to do it.

307
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,660
Take them away.

308
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
Go.

309
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
Don't touch me.

310
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,660
Don't touch me.

311
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,660
My lord.

312
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,660
My lord.

313
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,660
If it weren't for my usual behavior,

314
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,660
I would have been caught by them.

315
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,660
The cultivation of the mountain

316
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,660
should be the most urgent thing.

317
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,660
If we catch the enemy,

318
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,660
it will be a problem for the management.

319
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,660
Keep it down.

320
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,660
Who are you?

321
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
My name is Chang Li.

322
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,660
I'm a craftsman from Chongjiang.

323
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,660
I've been in the field of martial arts.

324
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660
I've been in the field of martial arts for more than twenty years.

325
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,660
Our craftsman

326
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
never takes on the bad.

327
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
He can take care of it.

328
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,660
But

329
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,660
we're here to sell strength.

330
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
We're not here to sell our lives.

331
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,660
The safety is not good.

332
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,660
The bones of the people are broken.

333
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,660
When the devil

334
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,660
sent the medicine to the clinic,

335
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,660
people were hurt several times.

336
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,660
The compensation is not enough

337
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,660
for the whole family

338
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,660
to eat three days of rice.

339
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,660
Isn't this forcing the people to death?

340
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,660
My lord.

341
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,660
You must do it for me, my lord.

342
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,660
All right.

343
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,660
You can leave and stand on the side.

344
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
You two

345
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,660
were also caught.

346
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,660
My lord.

347
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,660
I'm the representative of

348
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,660
the 15th team of Yuan Pai City,

349
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,660
the 12th team of Yuan Pai City.

350
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,660
After the war,

351
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
we returned to Wanyun.

352
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
Because we were injured before,

353
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,660
we couldn't do heavy work.

354
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,660
So we became the guards of the city.

355
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,660
However, we didn't expect

356
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
that the day after the war

357
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,660
would be really terrible.

358
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
What do you mean?

359
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,660
When we fought,

360
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,660
we could at least

361
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
make up for our family.

362
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,660
We were afraid that

363
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,660
the enemy would be killed.

364
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,660
So we could at least make up for our family.

365
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,660
But all of this

366
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,660
ended up in the hands of our family.

367
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,660
But our family...

368
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,660
Impossible.

369
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,660
According to the injured patients,

370
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,660
the compensation for the injury

371
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,660
was completely enough

372
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,660
for the two families.

373
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,660
But in the end,

374
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,660
we only received

375
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,660
the part that left the city.

376
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,660
After the war,

377
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,660
we were living in the south camp.

378
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,660
All the refugees

379
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,660
never got the compensation

380
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,660
for their injuries.

381
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,660
All right.

382
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,660
Thank you for your testimony.

383
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,660
You may leave.

384
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,800
Your Majesty'socarse,

385
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,720
give him the blood pump and each item

386
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,200
needs to be closed for an mesmo

387
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:04,420
before taking

388
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,160
children with disability.

389
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,500
I can give you time.

390
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,320
All right.

391
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,660
What's wrong with him?

392
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,600
He微笑

393
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,800
I've thought about what you said.

394
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,920
So I asked Ge Qing to bring back many witnesses.

395
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,640
Including the wounded,

396
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,200
the wounded,

397
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,160
and the old woman who was arrested by her husband and son.

398
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,200
Maybe two or three people will be buried.

399
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,720
But the people who are in the top 100 said the same thing.

400
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,320
Do you still want to argue?

401
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,800
Shouldn't the police

402
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,920
protect her husband and daughter?

403
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,800
On behalf of three provinces,

404
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,680
I'd like to thank boss and your colleagues for their mains directed crime.

405
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
Not very promising.

406
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,600
You know the work of Watchtower Governor,

407
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,340
Thirty-iment прибene has been

408
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,560
applied only for the night

409
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,360
This year, ourribbable

410
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,560
Law plays such an ia

411
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,520
What advantages and disadvantages

412
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,640
Is, I went to the office

413
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,540
At Gouchian

414
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,760
This.....

415
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,840
Did it hurt you on the wana?

416
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,520
How?'

417
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Then please respect the opinion of the Three Kingdoms.

418
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,520
The Three Kingdoms of Chongzu are already closed.

419
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Even if the Three Kingdoms are not in control,

420
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
there is a point of loss.

421
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,520
The Three Kingdoms of Chongzu are not too serious.

422
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
If it's not just the Three Kingdoms,

423
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
what do you mean?

424
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
Before, the horse-riding warriors and Prince Ning

425
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
had a charity dinner.

426
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
In order to repair the horse-riding clouds,

427
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
they collected a lot of money.

428
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Now that the money is in trouble,

429
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,520
some people can't afford to serve.

430
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
You have made it clear.

431
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Who do you think you are?

432
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,520
The horse-riding warriors who are responsible for the sale of the horse-riding goods

433
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,520
are the brothers of the horse-riding warriors.

434
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
Right?

435
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,520
The official wine of the army

436
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
and his wife

437
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,520
are the girls of the foreign country who are your subordinates.

438
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Am I right?

439
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
You!

440
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
Your cousin,

441
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,520
you have been doing a good job of finding the wood-dry work recently.

442
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Lord Dylan,

443
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,520
you are indeed a great man.

444
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
It seems that

445
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,520
you really can't hide anything from me.

446
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
Everyone,

447
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
the money is in a lot of numbers.

448
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,520
The horse-riding clouds are far away from the capital.

449
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
We are worried about the day and night.

450
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,520
There will be people who will be planning to kill us

451
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
and keep us safe.

452
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
So, in the business,

453
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,520
we decided to use or contact the relatives secretly

454
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,520
to make the capital more comfortable.

455
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,520
This is the account book of the past three months.

456
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Please take a look at it, Lord.

457
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,520
The people of the three provinces are still very thoughtful.

458
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,520
It's just that

459
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
according to the records of the accounts,

460
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,520
the horse-riding clouds will be restored to the slowest.

461
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,520
Among all the slow-moving operations,

462
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
there are some movements,

463
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,520
but they are not as serious as Lord Dylan said.

464
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,520
The three provinces have been supporting the family for many years.

465
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,520
They have been working hard and working hard.

466
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Everyone is watching together.

467
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,520
How could they be so ambitious?

468
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Now Lord Dylan is so concerned about the three provinces.

469
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,520
It's obvious that this is what the three provinces are doing.

470
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Lord Dylan, you can't say that.

471
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,520
If you can't, you can just change the person.

472
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,520
I don't care about this position.

473
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,520
But we must make a contribution to the officials of the day and night.

474
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,520
We must not be so innocent and stand in the way.

475
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
Lord Xiaoping.

476
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
It's actually quite a coincidence.

477
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,520
The current situation in Wan Yun is

478
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,520
the Yuan State's army and the family tree.

479
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Since Zichun gave up Yuan State,

480
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,520
the position of the Yuan State is much worse than the past.

481
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,520
If they want to give themselves some personal power,

482
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
they shouldn't be so insensitive.

483
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
What do you mean?

484
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,520
Those people have left blood for Yuan State?

485
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,520
All of them have the sense of honor and family order.

486
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,520
They will never use personal power to harm the family.

487
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,520
They were also the subordinates of General Si Yi Lin.

488
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,520
I forgot to say that I am really sorry.

489
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
Everyone.

490
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
This matter is important.

491
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,520
It's not that you can't make it clear.

492
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
My lord.

493
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,520
I suggest that after the people are investigated,

494
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,520
we can discuss how to deal with it.

495
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
I've been listening to you for a long time.

496
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,520
I'm getting a headache.

497
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
How about this?

498
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,520
You all know that there is no conclusion.

499
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,520
I think that's all for today.

500
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
It seems that they are prepared.

501
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,520
This time, you have touched their interests.

502
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
They won't let you off.

503
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Brother, be careful.

504
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
I love you.

505
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
What should we do next?

506
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,520
Are we going to put the refugees into the city?

507
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Not only that, but also the capital.

508
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,520
In this way, we can solve their basic difficulties.

509
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
We can get more people.

510
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
We can do whatever it takes.

511
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Okay.

512
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,520
This is our leader this year.

513
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Yes.

514
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
So much money.

515
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
We've made it.

516
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
This is the money from Yuanzhou, not ours.

517
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,520
I heard that they will take the money.

518
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,520
I want to...

519
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,520
Close the door first.

520
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,520
I'll get some jade and zhegu to buy them.

521
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Tao, what did you just say?

522
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
Come here first.

523
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
It's raining.

524
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Now that the situation is settled,

525
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,520
I think it's time to return Yuanzhou to the leader.

526
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,520
We can ask him about the share.

527
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,520
I think it's 28 points.

528
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,520
Actually, it's enough for two cities.

529
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
Enough?

530
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Wait for them.

531
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
After I settle the accounts with the minister,

532
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
I'll settle them with you.

533
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
I think it's enough.

534
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
We have so much money.

535
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
Even if we're two,

536
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
we don't need to worry about the rest of our lives.

537
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
You're the second one.

538
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
We can't leave now.

539
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Why?

540
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Ludi is not stable now.

541
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
Yuanzhou is not stable.

542
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
It's the time to make money.

543
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
The area of Wanyun is the territory of Lingbu.

544
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
And the rest of the areas,

545
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
we and Ludi are half of the battle.

546
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,520
If we leave now,

547
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,520
Ludi will definitely lead the army to expand.

548
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
At that time,

549
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Yuanzhou will be in the hot water again.

550
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
It seems that we can't leave

551
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
without being stable.

552
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
Indeed.

553
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
Ludi is now in the opposite direction with us.

554
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,520
He can't move us.

555
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,520
We can't move either.

556
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
He?

557
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
Why can't he move?

558
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
He has no eggs.

559
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
Where is he?

560
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
Don't look at it.

561
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
You're just a little bit useful.

562
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
I can still hit the bell.

563
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
What you mean is,

564
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,520
although many places in Yuanzhou are controlled by Ludi,

565
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,520
some of the formations are self-manipulated.

566
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,520
If we can support these formations,

567
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,520
we can be greatly suppressed in Yuanzhou.

568
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
That's good.

569
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
Tao.

570
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Let's send some people

571
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,520
to take turns in each formation.

572
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
Sure.

573
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
Bai Chuan,

574
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,520
I'll leave this matter to you.

575
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,520
Prepare some special and polite items.

576
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,520
We have money now.

577
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
The light king is famous for his appearance.

578
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Those people

579
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,520
have long been waiting for you to invest in your treasure.

580
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Give me some.

581
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,520
You didn't even go in?

582
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
No.

583
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
You didn't respond to the front?

584
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
Yes.

585
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
You didn't even give me a face?

586
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
No.

587
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
Sorry.

588
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
I'll think of a way.

589
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Get out.

590
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,520
Wait for him.

591
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
Wait for him.

592
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,520
I told you more than 100 times.

593
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
We'll wait for news when we come back.

594
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
I don't know when we'll get news.

595
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,520
We sent a knife from the horse.

596
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
We came here to take the credit.

597
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
We've come here now.

598
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,520
You didn't give us any arrangement.

599
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
We can't go out now.

600
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
Yes.

601
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,520
What can we do?

602
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
We should go to the military base

603
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
and take care of the three provinces.

604
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Listen to me.

605
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
The people outside are talking.

606
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
What are they talking about?

607
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
What are they talking about?

608
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
They're talking about the three provinces

609
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
with the full production of the horse.

610
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
Now the children are pushing each other.

611
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
I'm so worried that

612
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
the map is not in the right place.

613
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
What are you doing?

614
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,520
Don't care.

615
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,520
What are you doing?

616
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
I'm going to find those officials.

617
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Let them give us all a lesson.

618
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
Yes.

619
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Do you have any idea?

620
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,520
This may be the first step of the emperor.

621
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
Now under huge pressure,

622
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,520
the three provinces will definitely fall.

623
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
What we can do now

624
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
is to wait for news.

625
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,520
If we get bigger now,

626
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
we'll only be punished.

627
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
What should we do?

628
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
What should we do?

629
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
What should we do now?

630
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Use our own way

631
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
to add some oil to this fire.

632
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
Boss.

633
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
Miss, sorry.

634
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
The business is closed today.

635
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
I'm not doing business.

636
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Why?

637
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
Didn't we do well just now?

638
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
Why are we closed when we came here?

639
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Look, our miss

640
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
came out once.

641
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
We'll go there soon.

642
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
It's because...

643
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
I'm not coming.

644
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
I'm not coming.

645
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Three provinces, Tanwu and Fuxu Street.

646
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Three provinces, Tanwu and Fuxu Street.

647
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
What's going on?

648
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
They are the citizens of Wanwu.

649
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
They're the three provinces

650
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
who asked them to give them the three provinces.

651
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
Three provinces, Tanwu and Fuxu Street.

652
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Three provinces, Tanwu and Fuxu Street.

653
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
They want them to give them the three provinces.

654
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Three provinces, Tanwu and Fuxu Street.

655
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,520
You're not admitting it.

656
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
You can't call theださい.

657
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
You should go back home.

658
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
I think the government's coming.

659
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Give the three provinces.

660
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,520
Give the three provinces.

661
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
Give the three provinces.

662
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,520
Give the three provinces.

663
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,520
Give the three provinces.

664
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,520
Give the three provinces.

665
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Give the three trout.

666
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,520
Give the three provinces.

667
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,520
Give the three provinces.

668
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
May I go back home?

669
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,520
Give the three provinces.

670
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,520
Give the three provinces.

671
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
Give the three provinces.

672
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Give the three provinces.

673
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
I ask you,

674
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,520
does Wang Yun's matter have anything to do with you?

675
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
Yes.

676
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
Not only does it have anything to do with me,

677
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
but it also has a great deal of connection.

678
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,520
Among the officials on this complications,

679
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,520
the Yun family hall of Right Pham Gymnasium is Ella's article.

680
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,520
The court will have fewer employees than expected.

681
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,520
Be vegetables and meals are important.

682
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
It requires your vote,

683
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,960
And with vast number of砥ary families.

684
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,160
Then what about the money?

685
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:28,860
Why didn't the money be in

686
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,200
Nagging hand?

687
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,280
You have never seen it clearly how serious you Tucker could be for

688
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,880
a egenter into a city..?

689
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,400
The harm is checked by this, right?

690
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,020
You will never get it back.

691
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,440
If Benually is like a角-s systemic den,

692
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,900
I am pe

693
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,100
I am pe

694
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,240
I am pe

695
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,960
I'm pe

696
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,320
Your highness

697
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,260
I am sorry

698
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,540
is the same as yours.

699
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,020
You must know that

700
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,220
many things, except for wealth,

701
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,820
and human resources,

702
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,740
need to be healed in a long time.

703
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,060
But later,

704
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,620
I will work harder

705
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,100
to complete

706
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,500
and protect

707
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,580
our common wish.

708
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,940
Deputy Chief Officer Xu.

709
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,100
Your Highness, you must be very tired today.

710
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,900
I'll be home first.

711
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
Have a good rest.

712
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,880
Ming power.

713
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,260
You cannot forget the power of his Majesty.

714
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,740
Sir,

715
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,440
he will return you the bloodhurt.

716
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,720
The mud is coming from the wolves.

717
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,800
A close competition.

718
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,500
Maybe we need some maidservants.

719
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,480
I think we need them.

720
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,880
So what should we do?

721
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,840
Have three years to participate.

722
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,040
see the problem?

723
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,240
Last time, we had all thought that

724
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,080
Zilu was being»

725
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,640
official.

726
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,480
JiangYuanzhou's battle

727
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,920
equals good sign

728
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,720
by old name Speed鼻 technique.

729
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,600
How will

730
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,720
they handle it this time?

731
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,680
Well,

732
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,760
surely…

733
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,760
I will use the Taoism of the Qi people to heal the body of the Qi people.

734
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,760
But will this hurt you?

735
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,760
After all, this matter is done by you.

736
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,760
I have already thought about it.

737
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,760
I have my own way to make Xiao Ning leave.

738
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,600
I'll when I am slow.

739
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,600
I feel like it's burning up my mouth.

740
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,600
If another and like this, what if God-s fan meet later this morning?

741
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,740
This whole thing of weird etiquette between Master Diling and Envoy of Qi

742
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,380
but brought great pressure to the Three Kingdoms.

743
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,500
You still have the heart to praise him?

744
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,820
Hurry and think of a way to solve it.

745
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,860
I don't know if you have heard of it.

746
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,620
With the Taoism of the Seven Realms,

747
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,020
the body of the Seven Realms.

748
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,100
I have many friends in the South Silver.

749
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,900
I believe they won't be discouraged.

750
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,940
We are so popular that we can't even drink water.

751
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,340
We've been busy for so long. No one even cares about us.

752
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,020
Now that we are in the land, there is nothing.

753
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,580
What should we do next?

754
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,540
You still don't realize that you are just a sacrifice?

755
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,020
Who are you talking about?

756
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,420
Brother.

757
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,380
Why did the landmen bring you here from Wan Yun?

758
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,020
The Three Kingdoms and the Three Kingdoms have been not together.

759
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,980
They were supposed to take you as their guns.

760
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,020
To be honest, we are just a small army.

761
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,820
Who would care about our lives?

762
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,300
If we just rush into the Three Kingdoms and defeat the Shuli Temple,

763
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,620
we will be given a justice.

764
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,860
Right!

765
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,860
We will have justice!

766
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,860
Right?

767
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,860
We will have justice!

768
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:19,540
Do you really think that the landmen and the Three Kingdoms

769
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,460
are the criminal?

770
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,460
Everyone,

771
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,300
the real criminal

772
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,460
is Du Zheng Si's Ge Shan.

773
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,060
The whole Yuan State has been divided.

774
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,500
Even the 23 form of the army

775
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,220
is because of the existence of a person like Ge Shan.

776
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,460
He is timid and timid.

777
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,260
He stopped the family from building the army.

778
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,180
He stopped the whole heart of the people

779
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,100
who were trying to make fun of him.

780
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,740
He let us

781
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,140
only watch our landmen take away

782
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,300
and kill our people.

783
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,700
We are soldiers.

784
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,340
We have been sent to our family, but we didn't get our own land.

785
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,220
It's all because of these anti-war people.

786
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,900
They are not our deputy.

787
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,500
They don't recognize our sacrifice.

788
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,460
Besides Ge Shan and the landmen,

789
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,900
Si Yiling,

790
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,900
we are afraid of dying with Si Yiling.

791
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,100
Such a big defeat,

792
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,060
he is not only not guilty,

793
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,260
but he can also be involved in the fight.

794
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,340
What about us?

795
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,100
Would you dare to die?

796
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,260
Yes!

797
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,140
Do you think it's fair?

798
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,700
No!

799
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,020
Replace Si Yiling.

800
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,820
Yes!

801
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,980
You are going to get the land!

802
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,100
We want the Land of Talisman!

803
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,340
We want the Land of Talisman!

804
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,780
We want the glory of Zi Chun!

805
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,500
We want the glory of Zi Chun!

806
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,460
We want the Land of Talisman!

807
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,220
We want the Land of Talisman!

808
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,580
I am sorry, Lord Yiling,

809
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,180
for making you go back to the mansion in a flash.

810
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,980
I don't know what happened.

811
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,940
Waking up at night,

812
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,100
I couldn't stop thinking.

813
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,660
All my troubles

814
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,300
are on you and Lord Ge Shan.

815
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,620
We want the glory of Zi Chun!

816
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,340
We want the glory of Zi Chun!

817
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,900
Let's go to the city to get the medicine!

818
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,940
Long live the emperor!

819
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,700
The medicine is the best medicine!

820
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,140
The medicine is the medicine for the soldiers!

821
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,220
Stop the front door.

822
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,140
Go around the back door.

823
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,100
The medicine is the best medicine!

824
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,620
Bastard!

825
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,700
We must kill him.

826
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,500
Let's go.

827
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,220
Follow him.

828
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,340
Long live the emperor!

829
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,420
Who's there?

830
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,180
You!

831
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,140
Take him away!

832
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,060
Get in the car.

833
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,700
Where is the assassin?

834
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,860
He's chasing after the enemy!

835
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,220
Everyone, get in the car!

836
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:45,900
Yes!

837
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,100
Let me in!

838
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,860
Let's go!

839
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,700
Chief, I'll send you back first.

840
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,500
Let's go!

841
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,300
Let's go!

842
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,780
Let's go!

843
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,180
Let's go!

844
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,220
This time, it's thanks to Si Yiling

845
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,460
that we got to the city in time.

846
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,900
Did you catch the assassin?

847
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,660
No.

848
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,700
The assassin has been protected by Yan Mi.

849
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,660
But Si Yiling is still a poison.

850
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,780
It's fine.

851
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,340
Even if he's in the army,

852
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,140
there are few people

853
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,260
who dare to face him.

854
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,180
Of course, Si Yiling

855
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,620
won't harm a common man.

856
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,980
He's a soldier.

857
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,460
What's the duty of a soldier?

858
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,820
It's protecting the people.

859
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,580
Yes.

860
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,260
The Three Kingdoms

861
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,980
are really like the wild cats.

862
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,420
The scenery of the capital

863
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,020
is going to change.

864
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,100
When the wind is strong,

865
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,900
there will be a break.

866
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,220
We can just watch the change.

867
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,780
You've been coughing a lot lately.

868
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,220
Please take care of your cold.

869
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,100
Thank you for measured my distance.

870
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,100
Do you remember

871
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,420
the panch ambiance now,

872
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,020
asking me to pay the price?

873
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,460
I didn't.

874
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,700
It's good that you didn't.

875
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,260
But Qi Ling did something.

876
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,020
You can go back

877
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,060
even if it's like a drain ahotation.

878
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,940
So it's alright".

879
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,900
I agree.

880
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,900
Yes, yes, yes.

881
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
Let's celebrate it with our own hands.

882
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,900
This three-story building is really a big deal.

883
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,900
Anything else?

884
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,900
Lord Goshan, it's a disaster.

885
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
A disaster?

886
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,900
Where is Si Lin?

887
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:23,900
The

888
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,900
You can't beat me.

889
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,900
Hurry up.

890
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,900
Are you okay?

891
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,900
At the battlefield,

892
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,900
we believe that you will lead us to victory.

893
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
After we defeat them,

894
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,900
we believe that you will give us a good repair.

895
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,900
We will make sure that the wounded soldiers

896
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,900
are even the last ones.

897
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,900
We all believe that the enemy will give us a justice.

898
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,900
I know that we can't beat you,

899
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,900
but we are not afraid of dying.

900
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,900
We are willing to follow the fate of our people.

901
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,900
We will do our best.

902
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
Even if we die here,

903
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
we will die without regret.

904
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,900
I'm sorry.

905
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,900
Lord.

906
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,900
Lord Si Lin.

907
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,900
Hurry up and leave.

908
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Ding Cheng will come soon.

909
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Let's go.

910
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,900
Okay.

911
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
Lord.

912
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,900
Do you remember me?

913
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,900
I remember that

914
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,900
I was afraid that

915
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,900
Ding Cheng of the 12th team

916
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,900
and Xiang Yu of the 15th team

917
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,900
and Ming Fei of the 17th team

918
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,900
would be killed.

919
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,900
Lord.

920
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,900
Seven thousand soldiers

921
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,900
were afraid of dying together with me.

922
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,900
The last hundred people were not there.

923
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,900
Lord.

924
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,900
You are all soldiers.

925
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,900
You are the ones who killed the country.

926
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,900
You should have done it.

927
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,900
But you shouldn't have been humiliated.

928
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,900
It's all my fault.

929
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,900
So I'm willing to take a step forward.

930
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,900
Lord.

931
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,900
Give Ding a little more time.

932
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,900
He will give you a justice.

933
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,900
Go.

934
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,900
Someone is coming. Go.

935
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,900
Lord, hurry up and go.

936
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,900
But where are you?

937
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,900
He is still far away.

938
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,900
If you are worried about the soldiers,

939
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,900
I will do it.

940
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,900
Thank you, Lord.

941
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,900
Wait for you.

942
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,900
You are here.

943
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,900
More importantly.

944
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,900
More importantly.

945
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,900
I'm here.

946
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,900
More importantly.

947
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,900
We are connected to each other.

948
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,900
Lord.

949
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,900
The news we just received

950
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,900
is like a sound wave to the wall.

951
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,900
The sound of the forest drum.

952
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,900
I've been with you for a long time.

953
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,900
Sorry.

954
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,900
Sorry.

955
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,900
It's okay.

956
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,900
Let's go.

957
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,900
Come on.

958
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,900
I'm stuck in the frame.

959
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,900
I'm searching for you.

960
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,900
And now the light is on.

961
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,900
It's a big deal for us.

962
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,900
Actually,

963
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,900
I've already asked our Xiu Ziyin to

964
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,900
sorry.

965
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,900
Eat well.

966
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,900
The technology of agriculture and architecture.

967
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:26,900
Go to the ice factory.

968
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,900
Go.

969
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,900
Go.

970
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,900
We can change everything

971
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,900
in the life of Zhou Renping.

972
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,900
We have to endure it.

973
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,900
We have to endure

974
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,900
everything in the life of Zhou Renping.

975
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,900
We have to learn

976
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,900
about the truth.

977
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,900
No.

978
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,900
Of course, he hopes

979
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,900
to be a good man.

980
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,900
According to my opinion,

981
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:53,900
the man from the Liu Gong family is a good man.

982
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,900
I'm sorry.

983
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,900
I'm not a good man.

984
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,900
At present, I'm a good man.

985
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,900
Sorry.

986
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,900
I'm afraid that

987
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,900
the power of Zhou is out.

988
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,900
I'm sorry.

989
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,900
I'm sorry.

990
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,900
The first point.

991
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,900
I will place the next

992
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,900
military focus

993
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,900
on the Liu of Zhou.

994
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,900
The next military focus.

995
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:14,900
I'm sorry.

996
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,900
The commander of the Guizhu army

997
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,900
is more than three thousand.

998
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,900
We're all not good.

999
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:21,900
Everyone.

1000
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,900
We're all sorry.

1001
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,900
We're all bad.

1002
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,900
We're all bad.

1003
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,900
This is a good question.

1004
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,900
According to Liu Gong's opinion,

1005
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,900
I'm sorry.

1006
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,900
Come on.
