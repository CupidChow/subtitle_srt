00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,100
He never�도

17
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,000
deleted your past,

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
but secretly donated your soul

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,200
for father Zhao.

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,860
Later,

21
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,120
I dig my own grave

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,040
and everyone knows

23
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,520
that

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,080
we are getting imprisoned now.

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,120
Our country is crisis,

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,080
our sun is rising.

00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,400

protect your princess

40
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,840
I should accompany you this time.

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
I'm really busy.

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,840
I know you love me.

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,240
But I'm the daughter of the Emperor of the Dragon.

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,040
How can I be with you forever?

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,040
Don't worry. I'll take care of myself.

46
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,840
Okay.

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,440
Take care of my daughter.

48
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,840
Yes.

49
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,640
Go.

50
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,440
Royal Father isützening you.

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,440
But we have found this to be the reason why we left.

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,640
Princess, long live your Lin Punch.

53
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,240
N verdadify your Morocco Freetag.

54
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,140
The Montmartre rules must be the only chance.

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,040
But when we return, Father won't spare you.

56
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,040
Everything is on Princess's terms with the safety.

57
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,440
Princess, you don't have to think too much.

58
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,240
Let's go.

59
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,440
My lord, Liu Yang Xing didn't come to the banquet.

60
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,440
He must not have been against us.

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,440
Maybe he just wanted to keep it a secret.

62
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,440
So this time, we will personally go to the door and visit him.

63
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,240
We will be able to discuss the future of Yuan Zhou.

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,840
Although Lu Di is defeated,

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,640
but the northern tribes are not as strong as the northern ones.

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,440
Many of the stars are still afraid of the northern tribes.

67
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,240
Liu Yang Xing is too charming now.

68
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,640
We have to find a way to solve this problem.

69
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,440
Without you thinking so seriously,

70
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,640
in fact, most of the stars in Yuan Zhou

71
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
still want to get rid of the northern tribes and control them.

72
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,640
This time, we will just take it as a guest at the door.

73
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,240
Just be careful and cautious.

74
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,640
Lord Cheng,

75
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,240
where are our family members?

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,040
He and I will leave it to you.

77
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,640
We will not disappoint Lord Guangming's trust.

78
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,440
Brothers and sisters,

79
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,640
after we arrive at Liu Yang,

80
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,240
you two will stay nearby.

81
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,240
I will take some people to have a rest.

82
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Yes, my lord.

83
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,640
Come.

84
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,440
According to the legend,

85
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,240
before the thousand-year-old Sheng Qiang was taken,

86
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,240
how many northern tribes and tribes were under his control?

87
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,440
They sacrificed so many immortal blood and life for this.

88
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,840
We have no choice but to do so.

89
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,940
But Lili and Sang Sang

90
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,940
are all on this stone wall.

91
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,240
The northern tribes and tribes before

92
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,040
are so well-informed and so well-behaved.

93
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,640
They are so well-behaved.

94
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,840
So this is why they are called

95
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,640
the gods.

96
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,040
God will bless the palace

97
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,740
and protect the northern tribes.

98
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,440
But...

99
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,840
It's almost time.

100
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Uncle Ye.

101
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,640
It's almost time.

102
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,840
I will go in right now.

103
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
No.

104
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,440
You are not the royal family's disciple.

105
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,140
Only the royal family can tell us

106
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,240
how to bully them.

107
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,040
I cannot let you go into the cave.

108
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,440
But I thought that

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,640
after the bullying happened,

110
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,740
I could only...

111
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,440
It's too late.

112
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,040
Now I can only try to keep calm

113
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,240
and retreat to the left and right.

114
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,440
Remember to stay in the cave.

115
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,840
You should stay in the cave

116
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,040
and protect me.

117
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,240
Lord Yun must listen to my arrangement.

118
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,440
The ceremony is about to begin.

119
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,340
It's time.

120
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,240
Before we go,

121
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,540
just retort!

122
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,440
Princess!

123
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,560
Fu.

124
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,600
Somebody died here.

125
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,380
The derechos of the forest

126
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,340
I'll especially drink for the Beizu River.

127
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:27,260
I'll drink for the L 청 liquor to change your behavior and balance my получ eastward.

128
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,180
Leave me alone!

129
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,380
Crown Princess!

130
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,820
Herajo

131
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,800
Please, God

132
00:10:50,800 --> 00:11:15,100
I can't protect you

133
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,740
and simply lived not well,

134
00:11:47,260 --> 00:12:13,200
ãã PayPal eğ motor,

135
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
You are my daughter's husband.

136
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,200
You are now my father.

137
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Did you let me kill you?

138
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Get up.

139
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Now, there is an important mistake.

140
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Someone betrayed the tribe.

141
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Take out the letter from Ling Bu Xu.

142
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Under the rule of the rebels,

143
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
the tribe will be defeated again.

144
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
We can hide the situation.

145
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
We can make the tribe lose 20 times.

146
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I ask you to take out the tribe and support the tribe.

147
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,200
The tribe is no longer in our control area.

148
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
I heard it.

149
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,200
It's hard to accept.

150
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
The tribe has done so many times.

151
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,200
They are not guilty.

152
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
What's more ridiculous is that

153
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Ling Bu Xu has sent several letters to the tribe.

154
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
The tribe has been killed by the rebels.

155
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,200
This time, Sun Yun Qi is better.

156
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
He is in the city.

157
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Your Majesty, I suggest that

158
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,200
we send the executioner to kill the rebels.

159
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
General Yulin,

160
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
tell us your opinion.

161
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Prince Calan has been killed by the rebels.

162
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,200
He is in danger.

163
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Yes, father.

164
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,200
How can we deal with the rebels in this city?

165
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
That's the point.

166
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
If you agree,

167
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I will lead the troops to the city.

168
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,200
I will take care of the rebels in the city.

169
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
As for the people in Lu Di,

170
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
as long as you give me the order,

171
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
it's just a matter of time.

172
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
You two think that

173
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,200
the people in the city are the best.

174
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Who is the most suitable person?

175
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,200
General Jiana, Luo Si.

176
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Lord Luo Si is our family's leader.

177
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,200
The wine factory is very well-known.

178
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,200
I believe that we should send him to the city.

179
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,200
We can definitely take advantage of the rebels.

180
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Okay.

181
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,200
That's the deal.

182
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Your Majesty, we have the God of Heaven in the north.

183
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,200
We will not lose Yuan Zhao easily.

184
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Princess Khadam bullied the north.

185
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,200
The God will forgive her.

186
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,200
The state affairs are in danger recently.

187
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,200
We almost forgot the official affairs.

188
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Princess Khadam,

189
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
the crown prince of the imperial family,

190
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
and the emperor's grandson,

191
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,200
are all happy today.

192
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
He is still sleeping.

193
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Look.

194
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Look. The little bubbles I made for him.

195
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Do they look good?

196
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
They do.

197
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,200
I heard that Lu Di lost Yuan Zhou.

198
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
I was willing to support Yuan Zhou.

199
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
His Majesty was not willing.

200
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Instead...

201
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,200
I sent Luo Si to Yuan Zhou.

202
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
You know the truth.

203
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Luo Si has always supported Khadam.

204
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,200
It seems that he wants to make a strong effort.

205
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Your Majesty,

206
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,200
I have always disliked Luo Si and his father, Khadam.

207
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Besides,

208
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,200
the Data Clan led by Luo Si has already caused danger to our Scythe Clan.

209
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,200
But their strength is the top.

210
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
The power of the commander

211
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,200
comes from dignity and fear.

212
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,200
This matter will make our Scythe Clan

213
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
a whole Scythe Clan.

214
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Luo Si will also be more clear about our Scythe Clan

215
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
and even launch a war against us.

216
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,200
The Scythe Clan of War is leading the world.

217
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Our Scythe Clan seems to be the leader of the whole Scythe Clan.

218
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
But in fact,

219
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,200
it is also the other tribes that want to replace it.

220
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
For the power of the Scythe Clan,

221
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,200
the power of the Scythe Clan will be replaced by other tribes.

222
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
It will be like the Soul of the Ghosts.

223
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,200
It will surround the heart of the Emperor.

224
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,200
And this Ghost

225
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,200
has never been this close to me.

226
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,200
The King of Light comes from the Great Shed,

227
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
and the Light is in Liu Yang.

228
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Liu Yang is in a good mood.

229
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Today, you must drink it quickly.

230
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
I didn't expect that on the land of Yuanzhou,

231
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
there is such a fun land.

232
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,200
I have heard a saying before.

233
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Yangbao, West Valley, Shuhuan, Jiexi, and Anger.

234
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
One of these Anger

235
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,200
must be the owner of the city.

236
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Our Scythe Clan is happy and free.

237
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Liu Yang is a land of the world.

238
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
So the farmers are very good.

239
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
The people are very pure.

240
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
In the past years,

241
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,200
the people have always been unruly and unruly.

242
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Have they ever been disturbed by the Scythe Clan?

243
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
They are here to take it.

244
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,200
If they are too much, they will not have a chance to survive.

245
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
The Scythe Clan is very well-off.

246
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
There are many ways to survive.

247
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
I don't know what to say.

248
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Last time, when I came to the banquet,

249
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,200
I heard that Anger was not well-off.

250
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
It seems that King of Guangming

251
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
is avoiding the rule of the Scythe Clan.

252
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
The rule of the Scythe Clan has been separated for too long.

253
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,200
It is a matter of time before the rule of the Scythe Clan is established.

254
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,200
So the rule of the Scythe Clan is not to be destroyed by the Scythe Clan.

255
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
This is my purpose.

256
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,200
What are you going to do, King of Guangming?

257
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
First, we have to push the rule of the Scythe Clan

258
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
in the whole of Yuanzhou.

259
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,200
This rule has been supported by most of the form of Yuanzhou.

260
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Unification?

261
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,200
This rule is not harmful to you.

262
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,200
King of Guangming, let's drink first.

263
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,200
After drinking, we will continue talking.

264
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Okay?

265
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Wait.

266
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Wait until I finish my last words.

267
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,200
I won't be late to drink with you.

268
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
In the form of Liu Yang,

269
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
the name is Wufu.

270
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,200
The owner is Anger, a kind and kind customer.

271
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Here, I wish them

272
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
the best of luck for the other Tongbao in Yuanzhou.

273
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Cheers!

274
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
I'm not a wine-drinker.

275
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
I'm just a cup of wine in the legend.

276
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Do you have any place to rest?

277
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Let's start the banquet.

278
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
How about this?

279
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Come on.

280
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Let's have a toast to Liu Yang and King of Guangming.

281
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
King of Guangming?

282
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Come out, my lord.

283
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,200
King of Guangming, you are so smart.

284
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
You must be confused.

285
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,200
I didn't expect you would fall into my hands today.

286
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Lord Lu Di,

287
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
now that you have fallen in love with King of Guangming,

288
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,200
I think you will be late to take other forms.

289
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
I'm not sure.

290
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
I'm not sure.

291
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,200
I think it's too late to take other forms.

292
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
You have made a contribution.

293
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
I will not treat you badly.

294
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
My lord,

295
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,200
the gods know what happened in Yuanzhou.

296
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
They sent the Luo family to ask for forgiveness.

297
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
We want to let the living people

298
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
catch King of Guangming.

299
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
My lord, you did it.

300
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Some people say you are born to be ugly.

301
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
So you wear a mask.

302
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
But some people are scared.

303
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Gao Yuan said you are born to be ugly.

304
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
It's hard for him to be convinced.

305
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
So he wears a mask.

306
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
They say you are a good luck.

307
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,200
No one has seen the real face of your mask.

308
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Today,

309
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,200
I will let Lord Lu Di have a look.

310
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
What is underneath your mask?

311
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
The King of Guangming

312
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Zeshuai Xiu.

313
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Zeshuai Xiu.

314
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Zeshuai Xiu.

315
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Be careful.

316
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
He killed Lei Hong in the fire.

317
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
He has a broken arm.

318
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Come back.

319
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
It's dangerous.

320
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Long time no see, Lord Lu Di.

321
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Zeshuai Xiu.

322
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
You are King of Guangming.

323
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
No.

324
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
I mean,

325
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
we are old friends.

326
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Why are you so polite?

327
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Just call me A Xiu.

328
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
I didn't expect

329
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
to be treated like a bastard

330
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
after I was killed by the chief.

331
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
I will kill you today.

332
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,200
I will kill you with your head.

333
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Wait.

334
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Can you

335
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,200
untie the rope on me?

336
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I am too troublesome.

337
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Let go.

338
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Zeshuai Xiu.

339
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
You humiliate me.

340
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
I will not kill you today.

341
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I will not call you Lord Lu Di.

342
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Wait.

343
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
What are you doing?

344
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
It's too troublesome

345
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
to untie the rope on me.

346
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
I can guess

347
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,200
that you will not untie it for me.

348
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Take it.

349
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Tie yourself up.

350
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Kill him.

351
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
I told you he is good.

352
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Tang'er.

353
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Tang'er.

354
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
The gate is open.

355
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
The brothers

356
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
with Xiu Ziyin

357
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
and Baichuan are here.

358
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
They are here to take Liu Yang.

359
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Good.

360
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Leave him here.

361
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Take the others away.

362
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Okay.

363
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Let's go.

364
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Let's go.

365
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
What are you doing?

366
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
What are you doing to me?

367
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
What are you doing to me?

368
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
What are you doing to me?

369
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
What are you doing?

370
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
You can't kill me, right?

371
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
You have to make me embarrassed.

372
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
You can't fight.

373
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
You can't run away.

374
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
You will have fun after you die.

375
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
I have to do something

376
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
to you every day.

377
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
I can't do it.

378
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
I am so wrong.

379
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,200
My life is too dark for you.

380
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
I beg you.

381
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Let me go.

382
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Don't worry.

383
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,200
I won't let you go this time.

384
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Then you have to kill me.

385
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Kill you?

386
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
I can't bear to do that.

387
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Are you a pervert?

388
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
You are the pervert.

389
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
You can't go back

390
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
if I let you go now.

391
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Lu Di.

392
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
I am afraid

393
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
I can't keep this news.

394
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
The Emperor of Sairong

395
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
has sent the Luo Si to Yuanzhou.

396
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Maybe he will punish you.

397
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
I am not a pervert.

398
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,200
I have never been a pervert.

399
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
How can I go back to the north?

400
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
You are a pervert.

401
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
You have no right to lose.

402
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
You are a good pervert.

403
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,200
And you have a heart to be in.

404
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
I give up now.

405
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
It's a pity.

406
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,200
You can be a great general.

407
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Why do you have to do this?

408
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
I have a chance

409
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
to let you choose.

410
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Do you want to hear it?

411
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
What choice?

412
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,200
The first one to be the Emperor of Yuanzhou.

413
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
I am the pervert.

414
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Lei Hong is the pervert.

415
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Can you compete with him?

416
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
I am not as good as him.

417
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
Can you compete with him?

418
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
I don't believe in this.

419
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Exactly.

420
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Lei Hong is a pervert.

421
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
He is for his own life.

422
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
But you?

423
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,200
You are for the lives of countless people.

424
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
How can you do the same?

425
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Me?

426
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Yes.

427
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Think about it.

428
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
The war in Yuanzhou is over.

429
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
If you continue like this,

430
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
you will not defeat me.

431
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,200
But the war will still be inevitable.

432
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,200
I will not lose the support of Yuanzhou.

433
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
But you?

434
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
You will be a good general.

435
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,200
You will even be a good general.

436
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Think about it.

437
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Is it a bad plan?

438
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,200
If you are a good general,

439
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
you can still be a good general.

440
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
You can still keep your brothers safe.

441
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
From now on,

442
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
you will protect Yuanzhou with me.

443
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
I am sorry.

444
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
It's nothing different from what you thought.

445
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Can Yuanzhou be proud of me?

446
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
To be honest,

447
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
you have always been a training partner for the Alliance.

448
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,200
I admire you personally.

449
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
You are so good.

450
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
I am not.

451
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
You are.

452
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
I said I am not.

453
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
I said...

454
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
I said I am not.

455
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
I am not.

456
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
You are a man.

457
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Can you not be so sensitive?

458
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Yuanzhou Alliance is indeed not a normal army.

459
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Your tactics are indeed

460
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
so ugly as a little bit of me.

461
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,200
But you are brave and brave.

462
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,200
You are a good opponent.

463
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Yuanzhou Alliance is

464
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
a united army.

465
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
So...

466
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
As long as our target is the same,

467
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
we can be together.

468
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Do you understand my conscience?

469
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Why are you giving me a tip?

470
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Why should I give you a tip?

471
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Why should I give you a tip?

472
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
If I am not a brave man, I...

473
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Just leave if you want to.

474
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
I won't leave you.

475
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Come back.

476
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
Luo Di.

477
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
I know you are so good.

478
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
How about this?

479
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
You have two chess pieces in front of you.

480
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
One is the chess of the Northern Clan.

481
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
The other is the chess of the King of Light.

482
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
You choose which side you want to stand.

483
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
You leave the chess pieces.

484
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,200
You can stay in the camp during this time.

485
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
You can walk around in the army.

486
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
I am not afraid of you running away.

487
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Just think about it.

488
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Your Majesty.

489
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
You are here.

490
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
I am here.

491
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
You are here.

492
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
I am here.

493
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
You are here.

494
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
You are here.

495
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Your Majesty.

496
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
According to the information from the front line,

497
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,200
the King of Light has recovered 23 Star Towers in Yuanzhou.

498
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,200
It will only last less than a year.

499
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,600
I heard that the King of Light

500
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,600
is not only strong in battle but also in the country.

501
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,800
He has also unified the 23 front lines of Yuan Zhou.

502
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,600
That's very important.

503
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,600
Everyone, what do you think of this?

504
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,200
I think that the King of Light is winning.

505
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,800
We must not be too harsh.

506
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,400
Why don't we send the envoy

507
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,360
to send our Zichuan family's

508
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,400
and the rest of the people to guard Yuan Zhou?

509
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
This is too urgent.

510
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,400
We must be brave before the rest of the family.

511
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Everyone, let's see who will be sent.

512
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,400
My Lord, I suggest that Si Yi go.

513
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,400
He is more familiar with Yuan Zhou in two battles.

514
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
Si Yi Lin's position is noble.

515
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
He is the important person who has been in charge of Zichuan.

516
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,400
Si Yi Lin, prepare to leave Yuan Zhou as soon as possible.

517
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,800
Yes, my Lord.

518
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,400
Brother.

519
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,800
Why are so many people familiar with Yuan Zhou?

520
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,400
Why are they recommending me?

521
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,200
Take this.

522
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,000
Jin Chong medicine?

523
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,200
I'm not going to fight.

524
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,000
Take this.

525
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,400
Take it.

526
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
If you can use it.

527
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Yuan Zhou's formation has three soldiers.

528
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,200
With these 23 formation,

529
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,200
my clan must move forward

530
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,400
to attack the Zichuan family's territory.

531
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,200
I, Liu Feng and Lin Jiang,

532
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,400
have taken the whole Xichuan road.

533
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,400
For these 23 formation,

534
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,800
I have been planning for half of my life.

535
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,000
The Kadan was trapped in Zichuan.

536
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,800
The soldiers of my clan sacrificed were even more unspeakable.

537
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,000
But the land of Lu

538
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,800
took less than a year

539
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,600
to attack Yuan Zhou's territory.

540
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,000
Your Majesty, the Kadan prince is still kneeling in the palace.

541
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,600
He seems to be about to get married.

542
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
Take him back.

543
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,200
Let him think about it.

544
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,800
From now on,

545
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,200
the imperial edicts must not enter the palace.

546
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Yes.

547
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
Your Majesty, don't worry.

548
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,200
I will deal with Yuan Zhou.

549
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,600
There is a prince of light in Yuan Zhou

550
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,600
who has changed our clan.

551
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,400
Not only the clan,

552
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,200
but also the clan of the Yuan Zhou.

553
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,200
The time when the Liu Feng family and Zichuan were fighting against Li

554
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,400
has changed the whole Xichuan road.

555
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,000
You are too much.

556
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,600
Zichuan has won all these battles.

557
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,800
Yun Jun and Erge, you are too little to see Zichuan's strength.

558
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,600
In the last battle of Yuan Zhou,

559
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,200
they lost a lot of troops.

560
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,000
On the western border,

561
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,800
the border of Yixian is not right.

562
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,400
There are nearly 100 groups.

563
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,200
And I have seen some senior generals of Zichuan.

564
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,400
I have to say,

565
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,600
compared to my generals,

566
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,000
they know more about war and conflict.

567
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I agree with your point of view.

568
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,600
Also,

569
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,400
their ability to fight against the war and conflict is very strong.

570
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,400
But what about the Liu Feng family and the western border?

571
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,000
Liu Feng died a long time ago.

572
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
When he dies, the Liu Feng family will have a problem.

573
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,600
By then, Zichuan family will be re-enacted

574
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,200
without the threat of the west.

575
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,200
By then, Zichuan family will be our real threat.

576
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,600
In the battle of Yuan Zhou,

577
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,000
Zichuan family has a close relationship with each other.

578
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,320
Unto Met

579
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,120
Go ahead.

580
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,120
The higher the kung fu,

581
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,640
the more beautiful it is.

582
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,320
Don't you want to knock the door?

583
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,760
Wei...

584
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,800
testing Imperial 표ces once.

585
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,680
You think

586
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,280
you can protect him.

587
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,160
Isn't your target me?

588
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,400
Your opponent is welcome

589
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,560
in the result.

590
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,840
It was you.

591
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
You're not going to kill me?

592
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,320
It seems that you have no idea what you love.

593
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,320
I don't need to kill you.

594
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,320
One day, the God's will give you the answer.

595
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,320
He's not going to kill me?

596
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,320
What's the big deal?

597
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,320
I don't mean that.

598
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,520
If I were to hit that man,

599
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,320
my three siblings would be ashamed of me.

600
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,320
Better to set up the wedding party for myself now?

601
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,920
As long as she doesn't give up,

602
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,920
it's not a big deal if she doesn't.

603
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,320
I won't let my family sit in the wedding hall.

604
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,440
I don't want to bother myself anymore.

605
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,640
Who are you?

606
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,240
I'm the King of Light.

607
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,640
You're definitely not just the King of Light.

608
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,040
Who am I?

609
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,240
Is it important?

610
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,640
Isn't it important?

611
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,240
Is it important?

612
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,040
You can live with the Black Desert.

613
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,040
You can fight with it like him.

614
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,640
You can become a god.

615
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,440
This is not important.

616
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,840
Where is the sacred place he mentioned just now?

617
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,640
The sacred place of the God.

618
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,240
Where is the sacred place?

619
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,440
The sacred place of the God is called the sacred place.

620
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,440
It's the most mysterious place in the North.

621
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
As the military commander said,

622
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,440
you and the sacred place are far away.

623
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,440
No wonder.

624
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,440
I finally feel that I'm not that embarrassing to you.

625
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
What are you doing?

626
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,440
I'm bleeding.

627
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,440
I'm fine.

628
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,440
You can change it for me.

629
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,640
You pervert.

630
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,040
Let's go.

631
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,040
Recently, the pulse of the family has stabilized a lot.

632
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,840
It's thanks to the medicine that you brought back.

633
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,440
As long as it's well-groomed,

634
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,040
I'm sure that the family will be able to recover soon.

635
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,440
That's good.

636
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,240
That's good.

637
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,840
The medicine that you brought back is really useful.

638
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,240
This is great.

639
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,840
This is the husband.

640
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,240
I'm sure that Zichuan already knows about your illness.

641
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,640
I have to go to Lan City to help him.

642
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,240
Since your health is much better now,

643
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,040
I have to get up right away.

644
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,840
Shuang'er, you're in danger.

645
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,040
It's your turn.

646
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,240
I heard that Yuan Zhou has a prince named Guangming.

647
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,840
He has been in the army for a year.

648
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,440
But he's still a prince named Yuan Zhou.

649
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,640
He's definitely not that strong.

650
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,440
Now, the Xichuan road is no longer the same as before.

651
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,240
He's so cruel.

652
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,240
Although he has the power to take Yang Minghua,

653
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,640
he's not strong enough to make Zichuan so strong.

654
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,840
Zichuan has the most powerful disciple.

655
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,640
The most powerful property.

656
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,440
His family can only rely on their 100-year-old memories.

657
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,440
They can only rely on their noble personalities.

658
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,440
The key is who will be the most powerful Zichuan in the end.

659
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,840
Is there no hope for Zichuan to be the most powerful?

660
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,240
There's no way.

661
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,840
We can't predict the power of Sai Rong.

662
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,240
Unfortunately, in the next generation of Sai Rong,

663
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,040
there's no one to protect the world.

664
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,240
Lin family has always been peaceful.

665
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,040
They won't interfere in the fight on the road.

666
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,640
Moreover, we've been friends for generations.

667
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,640
So, Shuang'er,

668
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,040
the determination and future of Xichuan road

669
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,040
is with you and that prince, Guangming.

670
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,640
You saved my number yesterday.

671
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,840
I've decided to accept your proposal.

672
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,440
I'm willing to serve you.

673
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,640
I'll follow you to protect Yuanzhou.

674
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,440
Okay.

675
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,040
Very good.

676
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,440
These are the letters from the representatives of the group.

677
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,040
So many?

678
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,840
This is from the Snake Clan.

679
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,440
If they surrender to Lu Di,

680
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,640
they will withdraw to the beauty group.

681
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,040
What?

682
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,440
If they surrender to Lu Di,

683
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,240
they'll withdraw to the army and go back to the mine.

684
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,240
This is from the Dragon Clan.

685
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,240
My Lord,

686
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,440
the guy who surrender to Lu Di is so angry.

687
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,840
He's not like you.

688
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,440
Actually, no matter it's the Zichuan family,

689
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,440
the Snake Clan, the Dragon Clan, or even the Northern Clan,

690
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,640
why can't we let go of the promise?

691
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,440
We can't let go of the promise.

692
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,040
Moreover, what I'm thinking now is more important.

693
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,240
How do you deal with the leader of the Data Clan, Da Jun?

694
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,640
Yes.

695
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,040
Returning to Pai Yi City is our duty.

696
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,840
I know Pai Yi City well.

697
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,440
It's a difficult place to attack.

698
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Once the Lu Si Clan is in the battle,

699
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,040
this is our biggest disaster.

700
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,240
Episode 1

701
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,240
I'll take you out for a walk.

702
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,840
Take care!

703
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,240
Write down the price of your life.

704
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,040
Don't worry.

705
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,440
But there's still hope for us to live on.

706
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,680
There's a marketplace waiting for us

707
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,240
taking on anholder.

708
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,240
Yes.

709
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:11,440
I must look for the girl who is welcomed goods.

710
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,240
Where are we?

711
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,240
The imperial perpendicularity is true

712
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,240
The鍾上的壹隻

713
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,240
He is from Jinming family

714
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:44,140
The royal cups

715
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:55,640
Okay,geDad

716
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,240
I'm sorry.

717
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,240
I'm sorry.

718
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,240
Okay, I'll take care of you.

719
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
Good boy.

720
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,240
Find a excuse.

721
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
Don't be shy.

722
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,240
I'm sorry.

723
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,240
Let's go.

724
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
It's your turn.

725
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
Okay.

726
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,240
Then go to the bathroom.

727
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,240
Before the court is closed,

728
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,240
please forgive me.

729
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,240
I understand.

730
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,240
But I'm here because

731
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,240
I'm not a good person.

732
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,240
I'm not a good person.

733
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,240
According to the sentence,

734
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,240
before the court is closed,

735
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,240
the criminal will be the one to blame.

736
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,240
His wife and I

737
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,240
are in the same house.

738
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,240
How can I go back to the same house?

739
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,240
You're a criminal.

740
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,240
I'm here today.
