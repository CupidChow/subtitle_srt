1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not afraid of you.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,300
I'm not afraid of you.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,980
ario

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,340
Telegram

23
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,540
I see everyone name here

24
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,580
The owner of the house is fighting.

25
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,660
What's going on?

26
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,340
You should lead everyone to learn

27
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,340
the technology of opening and closing the door.

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,940
That's right.

29
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,420
They took the water purification

30
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,700
and learned the technology of closing the door.

31
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,380
Then they decided to use their own special products

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,260
to change the tools.

33
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,700
This is what the city of Pangxia wants.

34
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,580
Is there any problem?

35
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,260
The problem is in the changing tools.

36
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,740
The special products in each city are different.

37
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,020
One is a gold steel stone.

38
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,700
The other is a sandstone and a big piece of sandstone.

39
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,460
If you use sandstone and sandstone,

40
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,220
you'll feel that it's too smooth to change the stone.

41
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,540
You can't eat the stone.

42
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,140
You can't use it.

43
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,380
Why do you need so much tools to change the tools?

44
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,700
If you use sandstone and sandstone,

45
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,980
you'll feel that it's too smooth to change the sandstone.

46
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,180
You're too ridiculous.

47
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,380
We're in trouble.

48
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,260
Just like that.

49
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,540
No one is in trouble.

50
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,740
Finally, they fought and fought.

51
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,940
Fortunately, the city of Pangxia

52
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,020
stopped talking to the city leader.

53
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,340
That's why it's so peaceful.

54
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,180
This is indeed a problem.

55
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,220
In the north of the city,

56
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,140
the gold and sandstone of Zichuan family

57
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,900
can't be circulated here.

58
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,660
They don't have a unified standard

59
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,860
for the price.

60
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,100
If they encounter such a problem,

61
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,220
they can't exchange the price.

62
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,300
I'll tell you next time.

63
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,420
No, sir.

64
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,740
What should we do?

65
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,900
Those who are on the stage

66
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,180
come to learn technology.

67
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,980
We can't let them go back empty-handed.

68
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,100
We really need to let them

69
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,940
bring technology and tools back.

70
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,060
As for the city leader of Pangxia,

71
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,900
we need to let him get the right idea.

72
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,540
Technology is something

73
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,500
that needs to be learned for at least a few days.

74
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,780
How about this?

75
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,580
Go back and tell the city leader of Pangxia

76
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,460
that everything is in the right place.

77
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,460
Learn technology with a calm mind.

78
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,580
As for the way to exchange the price,

79
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:31,940
come.

80
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,180
Let me tell you in a few days.

81
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,180
Yes.

82
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,140
I came to the Yuan State to feed the school.

83
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,540
I didn't expect to be involved in this.

84
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,340
I didn't expect to meet you.

85
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,740
I didn't expect that Miss Lin Yu

86
00:03:51,740 --> 00:04:11,500
can take care of the Orange Seaforth

87
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,300
and move forward in Chase reload.

88
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,580
Miss Lin Yu.

89
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,740
Miss Lin Yu.

90
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,260
Miss Lin Yu.

91
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,220
Was he really living in the Jin City?

92
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,740
You're not the one who's in charge of the committee.

93
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,740
You're not the one who's in charge of the dragon light.

94
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,740
I...

95
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,740
You're...

96
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,740
Thank you.

97
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,740
Wait for me.

98
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
Are you sure?

99
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,740
I've investigated it.

100
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,740
Are you sure you're here?

101
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,740
Go in.

102
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,740
What do you want to buy?

103
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,740
Sir,

104
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,740
our current position is not very good.

105
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,740
I heard...

106
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,740
I heard that dragon feet can cure white disease.

107
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,740
Are you really brave?

108
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,740
Dragon feet is forbidden.

109
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,740
We're doing business here.

110
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,740
If you want to take medicine, I can give you a few.

111
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
But don't be too hard on yourself.

112
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,740
Please go back.

113
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,740
Are we really doing something wrong?

114
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,740
I've looked it up.

115
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,740
There's nothing wrong with this.

116
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,740
But...

117
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,740
What are you doing?

118
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,740
You're a man.

119
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,740
I'm not a man.

120
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
I'm just a man.

121
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,740
I'm a man.

122
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,740
I'm a man.

123
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,740
I'm a man.

124
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,740
I'm a man.

125
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,740
I'm a man.

126
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,740
I'm a man.

127
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,740
I'm a man.

128
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,740
I'm a man.

129
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,740
I'm a man.

130
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,740
I'm a man.

131
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,740
I'm a man.

132
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,380
If our tavern layout is a deal project,

133
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,820
we should take a step up

134
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,260
and there is no escape.

135
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,720
I bet he can't trust that

136
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,900
we're after them.

137
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,540
What shall we do?

138
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:34,860
рон.

139
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,020
We've ever punished you

140
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,260
in the Moon League camp.

141
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,260
I beg your pardon.

142
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,900
This gentleman, my husband is also suffering for the sake of Wei Zheng.

143
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,820
If it weren't for the medicine, we wouldn't have risked our lives.

144
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,100
Please allow me to kneel down.

145
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,420
Husband.

146
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,140
You look young and young.

147
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,940
You are a bit poor.

148
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,940
It's just that your long legs are very tight.

149
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,740
You are so close.

150
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,940
You two are so close to each other.

151
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,940
If he is like that, he wouldn't dare to betray you.

152
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,340
Please explain.

153
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,740
Think about it.

154
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,140
How long?

155
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,340
Please do your best not to fall for it.

156
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,540
Of course.

157
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,640
Don't rely on others.

158
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,740
Jun Ye, please sign.

159
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,560
Mynehmen was handed to you.

160
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Do you have any idea what happened?

161
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
No.

162
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,560
If you want to get good goods, you have to follow their rules.

163
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Once you enter the door, you have to ask the first three of you

164
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,560
who want a black medicine bottle and a three-feet leg.

165
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,560
In this way, he will know that you are an old master.

166
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Boss.

167
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Boss, do you have a medicine bottle?

168
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Yes.

169
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,560
The black-feet, the black-feet, the long-feet, the short-feet, the three-feet, the four-feet.

170
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,560
The long-feet, the long-feet, the short-feet. Which one do you want?

171
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,560
The three-feet, the black-feet, the medicine bottle.

172
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Do you have enough money?

173
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,560
You have found the right place.

174
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,560
I want the medicine bottle.

175
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Please come this way.

176
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Please.

177
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Please come this way.

178
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,560
You are old.

179
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,560
Sit.

180
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,560
The one who can enter this house is a new buyer.

181
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,560
But he wants to get good goods.

182
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,560
The long-feet here is all made by the county.

183
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,560
It's not suitable for the goods.

184
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,560
If I want it all.

185
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
What a big mouth.

186
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,560
You have seen my illness.

187
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,560
These years, I haven't seen any good medicine.

188
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,560
If Longjiao can cure my illness,

189
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,560
I don't care about the money.

190
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,560
I know you have the strength.

191
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
So I will give you a chance.

192
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
But we don't know the money.

193
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,560
We only take the gold and steel stones in the far-away area.

194
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Okay.

195
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
I will go to exchange the gold and steel stones.

196
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,560
You keep this goods for me.

197
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,560
It's alive.

198
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,560
I will go to exchange the gold and steel stones.

199
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,560
I will go to exchange the gold and steel stones.

200
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Live.

201
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,560
Live.

202
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,560
Don't worry.

203
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,560
Why do the merchants in the far-away area want gold and steel stones?

204
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,560
What's the use of this piece of broken stones?

205
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,560
It's too tight.

206
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Tight?

207
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
It's too tight.

208
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,560
I don't know.

209
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,560
I don't know.

210
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
I don't know.

211
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,560
I don't know.

212
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
I don't know.

213
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
I don't know.

214
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
I don't know.

215
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
I don't know.

216
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
It's tight.

217
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
How tight?

218
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,560
This thing is not broken.

219
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
It's not rotten.

220
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
It's not broken.

221
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
It's not broken.

222
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
It's not broken.

223
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,560
It's not broken.

224
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,560
It's not broken.

225
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
Last time you told me

226
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,560
the two merchants who fought because of the transaction

227
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
have gold and steel stones.

228
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Sha Luo City.

229
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Sha Luo City?

230
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
Tell me the specific situation.

231
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
Sha Luo City is in the north of Yuanzhou.

232
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
It's not big.

233
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
It's a mountain land.

234
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
It's not suitable for food.

235
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,560
So the people there don't have food.

236
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
Yes.

237
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
The land over there can't grow food.

238
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,560
Can you dig out the stones?

239
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
Put them back.

240
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
You can't even change

241
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,560
such a little food in Sha Luo City.

242
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,560
But if you want to buy food in Saerong City or Ditu City,

243
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
you must pay for it.

244
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Listen.

245
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,560
It's because Ditu City and the north don't have food.

246
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,560
It's not expensive.

247
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
That's the point.

248
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
It's not expensive.

249
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
Yuanzhou doesn't have a clear price.

250
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,560
But the gold and steel stones are the same.

251
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
We can use the gold and steel stones

252
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,560
as the currency of Yuanzhou

253
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,560
and control its production area.

254
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,560
So we don't need to exchange things.

255
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
We can use all the gold and steel stones to break it.

256
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Right?

257
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,560
Linong.

258
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Go and call the stone of Sha Luo City.

259
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
Go.

260
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Go.

261
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Go.

262
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,560
The three provinces are really cautious.

263
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,560
But I need to find out the truth

264
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,560
about the power of the soldiers.

265
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Ma Wei used to be in charge of the imperial decree

266
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
outside of the capital.

267
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
He took away the money.

268
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
We didn't use the decree before.

269
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
We can't deal with it.

270
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,560
We are going to report to the military commander.

271
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Now that we have this,

272
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
we can catch him

273
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,560
and get more evidence.

274
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
We can't delay it.

275
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,560
We are going now.

276
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
The work of the military commander

277
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
is done by the three provinces.

278
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
But the people of the province are not well-off.

279
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
The money can't be sent to the capital.

280
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
It's a disaster for the refugees.

281
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
They want to change the situation.

282
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
They say the refugees are not in charge of the army.

283
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
They want Yuanzhou to lose.

284
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,560
But the money is already spent on the three provinces.

285
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,560
They want the family to take the burden.

286
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
They are all in charge.

287
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
The three provinces are getting too much.

288
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
The members of the three provinces

289
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
have a lot of power in their back.

290
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
They are both strong and strong.

291
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
They are all in charge of the front and back.

292
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Before, the three provinces were suppressed by Yang Minghua.

293
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Yang Minghua left.

294
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,560
They raised the gold and silver and re-evaluated the Qi Valley.

295
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,560
The family was taken away and the village was in a difficult situation.

296
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,560
Now the Zichuan

297
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,560
can't afford to fight any more.

298
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,560
But if we don't investigate it,

299
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,560
it will be a trap for the three provinces

300
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,560
to take down the foundation of the corruption.

301
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,560
I will definitely make it more complicated.

302
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
You are right.

303
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
The Zichuan is a good idea.

304
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
It is a poison of corruption.

305
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
It is called the poison of the rich and the rich.

306
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
It is not a surprise.

307
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
You two have always been in the same boat.

308
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
You have always been in the same boat.

309
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,560
We will deal with you two.

310
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,560
The key is to give the people of the Wanyun

311
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
a belt.

312
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,560
I will definitely make it more complicated.

313
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,560
I will definitely make it more complicated.

314
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Sir,

315
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,560
have you really decided to attack the three provinces?

316
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,560
They are willing to do something for me.

317
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,560
I am not wise.

318
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
It is a good thing.

319
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Sir, you are wise.

320
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
I am wise.

321
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Dylan is a smart person.

322
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,560
He knows that he can't deal with the three provinces alone.

323
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,560
So he asked Luo Minghai to help.

324
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
He may not know.

325
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Sir, you have been waiting for him for a long time.

326
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
It is rare for the scholar and the commander

327
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,560
to be so wise.

328
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
As I said,

329
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,560
we have to share the wine.

330
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,560
We have to share the wine.

331
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
What are you doing?

332
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Don't come in.

333
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Sir.

334
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
Sir.

335
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
The food is at the bottom of the mountain.

336
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,560
I am too arrogant to be a scholar.

337
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Sir, the Wanyun drug and medicine

338
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
are in a mess.

339
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,560
Please come with us.

340
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,560
I am in a panic.

341
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,560
Be clear.

342
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,560
If you want to investigate me,

343
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
you need to get the evidence.

344
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Without the evidence,

345
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,560
how can you disturb the food?

346
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,560
I have always been a lawmaker.

347
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,560
If you are innocent,

348
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,560
I will send you back personally after the investigation.

349
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,560
What if I don't go?

350
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,560
It seems that you don't know me well.

351
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,560
Are you going to marry me here?

352
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,560
As long as I think that I am not good to Zichuan,

353
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,560
I can marry anyone

354
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,560
wherever I want.

355
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Sir,

356
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,560
although Ma Wei just entered the Three-Stars Stage,

357
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
it has been a long time,

358
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,560
but the Three-Stars Stage is still alive.

359
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,560
It is a great honor.

360
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
I know.

361
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,560
And if the spirit drug really goes down,

362
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
I am afraid...

363
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Ma Wei must be saved.

364
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
He is young and smart.

365
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
He has a good upbringing.

366
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
In a few years,

367
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,560
he will be the mainstay.

368
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,560
But how should we save him?

369
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,560
To be honest,

370
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
the spirit drug and Luo Minghai

371
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,560
are actually just soldiers.

372
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,560
You mean...

373
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,560
the military court?

374
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Sir,

375
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
the three-stars stage's Ni Bo is here.

376
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Please come in.

377
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Yes, sir.

378
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Please come in.

379
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
Ni Bo,

380
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
I greet you,

381
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Lord.

382
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
The year of the meal is the biggest.

383
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,560
The legs are different.

384
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Come, come, come.

385
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Please sit.

386
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Please sit.

387
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
What's wrong?

388
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Is there anything wrong with my dress?

389
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
No, no.

390
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,560
I remember when I saw you last time,

391
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,560
it was eight years ago.

392
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,560
You liked to draw

393
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,560
the books and paintings.

394
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Lord Yuan Xing always said that to you.

395
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,560
You were a person of the past.

396
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,560
Yes, yes.

397
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
You said that to me,

398
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,560
and you always helped me to draw.

399
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
Yes, yes.

400
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,560
I saw you two grow up.

401
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,560
I know your character the best.

402
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Of course.

403
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
You are the most important teacher

404
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,560
of my brother and I.

405
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Although you have a physical reason these years,

406
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,560
you are not very familiar with it,

407
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,560
but I remember your teachings.

408
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
I know that

409
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,560
you are very cold-hearted these years.

410
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Come,

411
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
add some more soup.

412
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Yes.

413
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,560
At that time,

414
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Lord Yuan Xing and I always talked.

415
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
He said that

416
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,560
if you are the family's mouth,

417
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,560
the three generations

418
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,560
will be the family's eyes.

419
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,560
If the people don't believe in these eyes,

420
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,560
then they won't believe

421
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,560
that the family's eyes are their eyes.

422
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,560
The eyes are the weakest part of the human body.

423
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
If you have a mouth,

424
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,560
it will be healed in a few days.

425
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
But if you hurt the eyes,

426
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,560
it will be hard to heal.

427
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,560
So the weaker the place is,

428
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,560
the more you have to protect it.

429
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Isn't it too hot?

430
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Get in the car.

431
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
I also remember

432
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,560
you asked me to be the teacher of the brotherhood.

433
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,560
I and my brother

434
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
were carrying it.

435
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
We just left it.

436
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,560
We played with the children of the servants.

437
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
After you saw it,

438
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,560
you were very angry.

439
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,560
You wanted to punish me.

440
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Every word is over 500 times.

441
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Look.

442
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
This word is...

443
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,560
You said that the mirror is made of clear evidence.

444
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Clear is the color of the birth object.

445
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,560
The proof is that both hands hold each other.

446
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,560
And the mirror is not disturbed.

447
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,560
It is always in the heart.

448
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,560
It's hot.

449
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
It's okay.

450
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
You said that the firepot

451
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
is not a test.

452
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,560
It's too hot.

453
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,560
It's too hot.

454
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,560
You said that the mirror is fragile.

455
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,560
But if you don't wipe it,

456
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,560
the pearl will be in the heart.

457
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,560
Teacher, this is the lesson you gave us.

458
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,560
If you don't mind,

459
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,560
I will give you this word.

460
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,560
You went back to the Nibos Cuisine?

461
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Yes.

462
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,560
I heard that the commander gave him a word.

463
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
What word?

464
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,560
I don't know.

465
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
But the Nibos Cuisine closed the door

466
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
and thanked all the guests.

467
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Including us.

468
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Now everyone is moving forward.

469
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,560
The people in this world are getting older.

470
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,560
It's getting less and less.

471
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,560
What should we do?

472
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,560
There is a brother named Ma Wei.

473
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Do you remember?

474
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,560
I heard that he is a white-handed person.

475
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
He is very good at doing things.

476
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,560
He is quite famous among them.

477
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,560
I guess he has arrived in the capital now.

478
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
He is useless.

479
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,560
He never talks about love.

480
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,560
He is the best of the best.

481
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
Of course he doesn't have love.

482
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,560
But...

483
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Since the restaurant is open,

484
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,560
there are few people here.

485
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Ma,

486
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,560
do you want to take a leave?

487
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
No.

488
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,560
The restaurant is closed.

489
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Someone is coming.

490
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Hurry up.

491
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Please.

492
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Do you have any special dishes?

493
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
Sir, look.

494
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
seafood fried rice.

495
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
Sir,

496
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,560
please don't look away.

497
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560
The seafood fried rice costs 100 grams.

498
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
I want 300 grams.

499
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Sir,

500
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
you gave too much.

501
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
You gave a lot of money.

502
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,560
The rest is for your hard work.

503
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
Thank you, sir.

504
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Is your meal a candy or a package?

505
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Candy.

506
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Okay, sir.

507
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Please wait.

508
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,560
Your mother is so good-looking.

509
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,560
The restaurant is in the center of the city.

510
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
People are very busy.

511
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
Whether it is a restaurant owner,

512
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
or a tourist from the outside world,

513
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
it is a must.

514
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
And the hardware store is

515
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,560
very good at cooking.

516
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
It is even more competitive.

517
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,560
You misunderstood.

518
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,560
I am a good-looking cook.

519
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,560
People say that the restaurant owner

520
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,560
is not as beautiful as a flower.

521
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,560
And she is good at cooking.

522
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,560
I am so glad to see you today.

523
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
Isn't the restaurant owner the same?

524
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
I knew that you were

525
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,560
so generous.

526
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
The seafood fried rice

527
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
in my family

528
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
can't be sold for a month.

529
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
You ordered 30,000 yuan.

530
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
You even gave me so much.

531
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,560
I am afraid that you came here

532
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,560
not just to eat fried rice.

533
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
You are so smart.

534
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Since you are so smart,

535
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,560
I will not be able to

536
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,560
tell you the truth.

537
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
I came today

538
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,560
to talk with my mother.

539
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,560
What do you talk about?

540
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
The restaurant.

541
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
The capital is divided into

542
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,560
five areas in the east, south, west and north.

543
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
The restaurant is located in the middle.

544
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,560
I chose four areas in the east, south and west

545
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
and the location is the best.

546
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,560
I invested my mother to open a branch.

547
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
You invested your money?

548
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Yes, my money.

549
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
If I can afford it,

550
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
I will split the money by 28.

551
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
I will split the money by 28?

552
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,560
No, it is my money.

553
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
You will split the money by 28?

554
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,560
Who is your father?

555
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
Ma Qing.

556
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
There is a brother in the family.

557
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,560
His name is Ma Wei Ying.

558
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
It is you, Ma Qing.

559
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Sorry to disappoint you.

560
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
It's okay.

561
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,560
I wonder if you have any wishes?

562
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
No.

563
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Now the world is bad.

564
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
People's lives are bad.

565
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,560
It is enough for a family

566
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
like us to live in a dark palace.

567
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Take care, Ma Qing.

568
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Come on.

569
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,560
I like to do business with people who are happy.

570
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Come on.

571
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
We are ready.

572
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,560
I will come or you will come?

573
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,560
I will come.

574
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
Don't move.

575
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Don't move.

576
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Don't move.

577
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Be careful.

578
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Don't move.

579
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
You are a liar.

580
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
Who are you?

581
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
I have announced the name of Prince Guang Mi.

582
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
From today on,

583
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Yuan Zhou banned the slave to betray the Long family.

584
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,560
They have found out that the kill is not a plan.

585
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Good.

586
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
Don't be so proud.

587
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
What does Prince Guang Mi do?

588
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
Lord Ludi won't let you off.

589
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,560
I will kick your servant when I see him.

590
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
Good.

591
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Good.

592
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
Good.

593
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Lord Zhang, please save my family and the people.

594
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,560
Our Long family is especially grateful to you.

595
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,560
I am the eldest brother of the Long family.

596
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,560
Thank you for saving the Long family.

597
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,560
I will never forget your kindness.

598
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Lord Zhang, please help Prince Guang Mi.

599
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
I will.

600
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,560
This girl saved my family twice.

601
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,560
This is my father-in-law.

602
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
I am so grateful to you.

603
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,560
I will give her to you today.

604
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Take it.

605
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,560
Take it, Miss Lin.

606
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Don't be so polite.

607
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
You are serious.

608
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,560
I will not give up.

609
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
I don't want to be grateful.

610
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,560
I just want you to help me cure my illness.

611
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
By the way,

612
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,560
Uncle Gu Wen,

613
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,560
Miss Lin Yu has taught me.

614
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,560
But I learned money from her.

615
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,560
I didn't give her any money to cure her illness.

616
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,560
I will help you.

617
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,560
My problem is related to this soil.

618
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Come on.

619
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
Take them away.

620
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Why do you say it?

621
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,560
Lord Zhang, what do you mean?

622
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Lord Zhang, let them stop.

623
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Let's talk.

624
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Shut up.

625
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
You'd rather die.

626
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
You can't get the Dragon's Feet.

627
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
What?

628
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
Dragon's Feet?

629
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
You and the Snake Clan,

630
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
the Northern Clan,

631
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,560
what's the difference?

632
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,560
The soil on the map is

633
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,560
the seal of the Dragon Clan.

634
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,560
The text says

635
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,560
it's the Dragon's Feet.

636
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Many years ago,

637
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,560
if we get the Dragon's Feet,

638
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
we can cure our illness.

639
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
In the last 100 years,

640
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,560
the Dragon Clan has been killed by the Snake Clan.

641
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,560
They are fighting each other.

642
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,560
The Dragon Clan is more dangerous.

643
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
I...

644
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,560
I don't know this note.

645
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
Is that what it means?

646
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
If Miss Linyu didn't save me,

647
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
I would have died long ago.

648
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
Jia Ru,

649
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
I'm willing to risk my life

650
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,560
to save her father.

651
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
I'm willing to risk my life

652
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
to repay her kindness.

653
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Stop.

654
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
I don't want your Dragon's Feet.

655
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,560
Don't say it's a fake legend.

656
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Even if it's true,

657
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,560
it's not my fault

658
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
to risk my life

659
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,560
to save her father.

660
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,560
Elder,

661
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
look.

662
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,560
It's a misunderstanding.

663
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
It's a misunderstanding.

664
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
You really think like that?

665
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
Of course.

666
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,560
There are so many spiritual pills in the world.

667
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,560
I believe

668
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
there is always one who can cure my father's illness.

669
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
It's really heartless to take this mistake.

670
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
I'm sorry.

671
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,560
Come.

672
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Actually,

673
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,560
we don't ask about the reason.

674
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,560
We should start with the first one.

675
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,560
Please forgive Miss Linyu.

676
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,560
It's okay.

677
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
Since this note

678
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
can't cure my father's illness,

679
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,560
I'll go to the other side to take the medicine.

680
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,560
I'll take my leave.

681
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
Chang'an San,

682
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
since it can't cure my father's illness,

683
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
I should go home.

684
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
You're in such a hurry?

685
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
Think about it.

686
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
We're from the same country.

687
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
How about I ask Lord Guangming

688
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,560
if he knows any spiritual medicine?

689
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
No need.

690
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,560
There's actually another way.

691
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
What is it?

692
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
This is the way...

693
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
I won't tell him.

694
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
I'll tell him.

695
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
I'll tell him.

696
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
I'll tell him.

697
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,560
I won't tell him.

698
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
This is the way...

699
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
to make the wish of the Nine Gods.

700
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
What is it?

701
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
This is the seal of our Yuan State.

702
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,560
It's written on the note

703
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
and buried in the seal.

704
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
It's covered in 100 different types of wine.

705
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
By then, the Nine Gods will be in the soil

706
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
and grow what you want.

707
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Why haven't I heard

708
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
that Yuan State has such a seal?

709
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
Because you've come here for a short time.

710
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,560
I've never heard of it.

711
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
I swear it's really great.

712
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,560
Where is the seal?

713
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Lord Guangming's residence.

714
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
Think about it.

715
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Lord Guangming is such a hero.

716
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
His residence must be the seal.

717
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,560
I'll handle this matter.

718
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Come on.

719
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Put your hands in the ground.

720
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
Come on.

721
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
It's a little small.

722
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
It's a little small.

723
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
Come on.

724
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,560
If you don't come,

725
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
I'll lose to you even if I come again.

726
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
You're so generous.

727
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,560
You still can't stand it?

728
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Really?

729
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
Come on.

730
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
Come on.

731
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,560
I can't stand it anymore.

732
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
I can't play anymore.

733
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
Uncle Jiang.

734
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
I didn't expect

735
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
you two to play so well.

736
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
They're all playing more than us.

737
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
I'm not afraid of them.

738
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,560
You want to play?

739
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Lord, don't listen to him.

740
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
He's too good.

741
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,560
Come on.

742
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
I'll block his underwear.

743
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,560
Okay.

744
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
Before I come,

745
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,560
I have something to tell you.

746
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,560
Come back.

747
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,560
He can't run.

748
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
He can't run.

749
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,560
I don't know

750
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,560
if there's any

751
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
long-term history in your mansion.

752
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,560
The most important thing is

753
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,560
the history of the Dragon Tribe.

754
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,560
Why is the history of the Dragon Tribe

755
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
so long?

756
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
Yes.

757
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
And it's not clear

758
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
about the Jinling Tribe.

759
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,560
The two tribes have been fighting for so many years.

760
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,560
It's quite rough.

761
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,560
If it wasn't because of the Dragon Tribe,

762
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
something happened later.

763
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Then the Jinling Tribe

764
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
wouldn't have won so easily.

765
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,560
Lado, thank you so much.

766
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
You and Miss Lin Yu are destined to be together.

767
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,560
And I think this matter

768
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,560
may have something

769
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
to do with the important relationship

770
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,560
between you and the Dragon Tribe.

771
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
That's why I asked you here.

772
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,560
If I can help Miss Lin Yu,

773
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
I'll be so happy.

774
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
But until now,

775
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,560
I haven't found the content

776
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,560
that describes the relationship

777
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,560
between us.

778
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,560
I'm thinking

779
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
only one thing.

780
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
What is it?

781
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,560
Can the Dragon Tribe

782
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,560
cure it?

783
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Why don't you ask the Elder Dragon Tribe?

784
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
No need.

785
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,560
In case he puts the knife on my neck again.

786
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,560
But I've read so many information.

787
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
I didn't find that

788
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
after eating the Dragon Tribe,

789
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,560
it can be cured.

790
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,560
Do you have any success?

791
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,560
Yes.

792
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
It seems that the rumor

793
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,560
has been spread out.

794
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,560
But it has caused such a big trouble.

795
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
What?

796
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,560
It's a natural thing to do.

797
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
But there is a little hope

798
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,560
that we can survive.

799
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,560
It's natural.

800
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,560
But there is a little hope

801
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,560
that we can survive.

802
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,560
Whether it's a rumor or not,

803
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,560
I'll try it.

804
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,560
Just like what you said,

805
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,560
the rumor is about

806
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,560
the Dragon Tribe and the Golden Tribe

807
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,560
in the war.

808
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,560
Think about it.

809
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
Is it a trap?

810
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
You're suspecting that

811
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,560
the rumor is

812
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
that the Golden Tribe

813
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
deliberately spread it out?

814
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,560
Yes.

815
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,560
But it's not a rumor.

816
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
Because there are things

817
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,560
that are really fake.

818
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
That's why people believe it.

819
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,560
Could it be that

820
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,560
there are really

821
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,560
similar drugs in the world?

822
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
It can cure diseases.

823
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
It's much better than that.

824
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
Let's look for some herbs

825
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,560
to see if there are any clues.

826
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,560
I...

827
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,560
The mountain's peak,

828
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
the dragon's foot,

829
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,560
the heaven and earth are bleeding.

830
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,560
The dragon's foot is not the dragon's foot.

831
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,560
The stone has a miracle effect

832
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,560
to change the spirit.

833
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,560
That rumor is really similar to the rumor.

834
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,560
That's what Xue Bo Teng said.

835
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,560
Our bloodline

836
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
is the one that is in the ancestral place.

837
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,560
It's something that we've been eating since we were little.

838
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,560
But it's not a rumor.

839
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,560
It's a rumor.

840
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,560
It's a rumor.

841
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,560
It's a rumor.

842
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
It's a rumor.

843
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,560
It's a rumor.

844
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
It's a rumor.

845
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,560
It's a rumor.

846
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
It's a rumor.

847
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,560
It's a rumor.

848
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,560
It's a rumor.

849
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,560
It's a rumor.

850
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
The medicine calculator

851
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,560
used by吳以來

852
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,160
has just released a rumor

853
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,560
that the result are

854
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
really the same.

855
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,160
But I don't

856
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,880
believe it could be

857
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,560
the result of agradecolar diseases.

858
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,560
I think

859
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,560
we've found the cure.

860
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,200
Did herailed

861
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,560
your position and princess Nning?

862
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,680
That could not be right.

863
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,480
If the princess is fine,

864
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,440
she can use Prince Nning'srog свemار.

865
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,020
Those two

866
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,080
ultimately are quite clear

867
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,720
and secretly trying.

868
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,240
It will be not the菜

869
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:09,540
to buy herself from the dirty

870
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,160
vassal stores.

871
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,560
You were so good to the people before.

872
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,560
You should have grown up.

873
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,560
You should have noticed some things.

874
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,560
But now, you still want to see him, right?

875
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,560
I want to see him.

876
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,560
But I'm not here because I'm being suppressed by Ma Wei.

877
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,560
I'm just a member of the charity.

878
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,560
I have my responsibility.

879
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,560
I must figure out what's going on.

880
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,560
According to the law,

881
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,560
the criminal is the most suspect before the public is convicted.

882
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,560
During this time, the criminal's family and friends

883
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,560
can be investigated by law.

884
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,560
Arrange for the criminal to be investigated.

885
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,560
Yes.

886
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,560
No.

887
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
Except for the military power...

888
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
Except for the military power, it's not...

889
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,560
I'm sorry.

890
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,560
Come on.

891
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,560
What's the good thing about it?

892
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,560
I'm sorry.

893
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,560
Do I need to walk?

894
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,560
I'm sorry.

895
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,560
I'm sorry.

896
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,560
I'm sorry.

897
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,560
I know.

898
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,560
I see.

899
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,560
He's still a member of the charity.

900
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,560
It's strange.

901
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
It's strange.

902
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,560
There's something else.

903
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,560
The criminal needs to be investigated.

904
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,560
You're stuck.

905
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,560
Sorry.

906
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,560
I think this is not the best...

907
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,560
No.

908
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,560
I think this is not the best solution.

909
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,560
Sorry.

910
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,560
Why did you stop?

911
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,560
It's hot.

912
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,560
It's too hot.

913
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,560
It's too hot.

914
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,560
Just to be honest, how about you?

915
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,560
It's...

916
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,560
I'm sorry.

917
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,560
The criminal is the most suspect before the public is convicted.

918
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,560
Everyone is guilty.

919
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,560
Sorry.

920
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,560
Everyone is guilty.

921
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,560
The criminal is so violent.

922
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,560
Now he's in the public.

923
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,560
Let's do it again.

924
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,560
Okay.

925
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,560
And he's such an important person.

926
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,560
I'm sorry.

927
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,560
I'm sorry.

928
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,560
I just want to get rid of...

929
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,560
the bad guys...

930
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,560
who are outside the group.

931
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,560
The bad guys?

932
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,560
They're not even in the group.

933
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,560
Are they?

934
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,560
Of course they are.

935
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,560
I'm sorry.

936
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,560
Okay.

937
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,560
I'll take you to your home.

938
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,560
