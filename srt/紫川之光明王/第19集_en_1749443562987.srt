1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To the full limit

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I will earn freedom

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
裁 tank

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 19

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,840
You have to see him study by yourself.

20
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,120
It's not my fault.

21
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,440
Do not concern unfairly.

22
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,640
I'll take the medicine twice.

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,120
How long will it take?

24
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,480
Almost as long as it's dead.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,200
It's good to be able to save your life.

26
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,160
When you wake up,

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,800
you'll be able to see your life.

28
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,000
I see.

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
Si Yi Lin is awake.

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,520
Inform me at the first sight.

31
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,960
Okay.

32
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,000
Si Ke has been caught by the commander.

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,280
I'll go back and prepare the hearing tomorrow.

34
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,080
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,080
Let me ask you.

36
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,960
How is Si Yi Lin?

37
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,600
He's not awake.

38
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,960
Don't worry, sir.

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,880
He should be fine.

40
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,440
These two criminals

41
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,000
dare to assassinate my commander.

42
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,480
They're so ruthless.

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,840
They must be executed.

44
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,320
They must be executed.

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,080
With any due notice,

46
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,720
he will analyze it Weekly.

47
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,640
He's almost this land.

48
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,200
Like a fish in wood, sights are limited.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,320
It's regarded as the cost of identification.

50
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,480
Here as it's safe,

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,040
it's considered as second.

52
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,800
That's not enough.

53
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,920
It can only be replaced

54
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,640
with the other 대해서 be exactingly.

55
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,880
At that time, everyone remembers the taste of the tea soup.

56
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,440
No one cares about the tea.

57
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,440
Who bought it?

58
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,960
Where did it come from?

59
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,120
How can we get the three-digit fee?

60
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,120
As long as we don't turn off the fire,

61
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,000
we're afraid that the tea won't be cooked.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But...

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,480
On the military leader's side?

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
I think...

65
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,520
If you really want to act,

66
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
after Lord Geshan was injured,

67
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,520
no one would have the chance.

68
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,200
This Si Yiling has been with Lord Geshan for so long.

69
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,560
Looking at him as a father and son,

70
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,600
it's not just like that.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
Compared with us,

72
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,440
Lord Geshan and Si Yiling are much closer.

73
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,080
But compared with the family,

74
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,240
you two, this tea is a success.

75
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,440
Si Yiling is my son.

76
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,440
But he's also my relative.

77
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Si Yiling, if you know Lord Geshan,

78
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,440
come to visit me personally.

79
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,440
I'll be waiting for you.

80
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,440
I'll be waiting for you.

81
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,440
I'll be waiting for you.

82
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,440
I'll be waiting for you.

83
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,440
I'll be waiting for you.

84
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
If you know Lord Geshan,

85
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
come to visit me personally,

86
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
I'll be very touched.

87
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,440
You've worked hard these days.

88
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,440
If Si Yiling comes over,

89
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
tell me immediately.

90
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,440
Okay.

91
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,440
Don't move.

92
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
It smells good.

93
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Smells good?

94
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Go. Go.

95
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Help! Help!

96
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Help!

97
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Stop!

98
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,440
You said that Luo Jie saved the female lead

99
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
from the north seat.

100
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
That's right.

101
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
Luo Jie saved all the women

102
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
who ran away from the house.

103
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,440
What do you think?

104
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,440
It's really a good idea.

105
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
It's all in the marriage.

106
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
What's the relationship with you?

107
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
It's a big relationship.

108
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Bai Chuan, listen to me.

109
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Yes.

110
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
From now on,

111
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
the female lead

112
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
will be the main lead

113
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
of our army.

114
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
You must keep an eye on them

115
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
from now on.

116
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Before we return to the home,

117
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,440
I want them to be free and free.

118
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
Send them back to the home?

119
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
Yes.

120
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
And we'll set off tomorrow.

121
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Tell everyone that

122
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,440
men are far away from that car.

123
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
You're really interested in

124
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
those women, aren't you?

125
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
These women

126
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
are not ordinary women.

127
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
This is the knock-down

128
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
brick sent by God.

129
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,440
It's really Jia Lan.

130
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
We're home.

131
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Come on, Fan Jia.

132
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Yes.

133
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
I'm not surprised.

134
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,440
I'm a good teacher.

135
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
I'm not surprised.

136
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
I'm a good teacher.

137
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Jia Lan.

138
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
It makes sense.

139
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
If you control her,

140
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,440
you can control Jia Lan's heart.

141
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
I heard that

142
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
the city's main lead

143
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
is a beautiful woman in the temple.

144
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Are you sure?

145
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
I'm here to thank you,

146
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
the city's chief.

147
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
You're welcome.

148
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
Although we're in danger,

149
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
we're able to save the women.

150
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
We're very grateful.

151
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
But for justice,

152
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
we still have to

153
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
take charge of the army in the far away.

154
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
I know you don't want to give the women

155
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
back.

156
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
You can't do that every day.

157
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
I'm grateful to you.

158
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
This time,

159
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,440
thanks to Lord Guang,

160
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
we're here to

161
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
kill the body.

162
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
What?

163
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Take it!

164
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Damn it.

165
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
We saved the wrong man!

166
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
We didn't save the wrong man.

167
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
But we saved the wrong man.

168
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
These women

169
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
are probably used to

170
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
give them gifts.

171
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Good for you, general.

172
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
I surrender.

173
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
You're so mean!

174
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
I'll give you all the women

175
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
as a gift.

176
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
I'll send you a piece of paper!

177
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
I should be able to open it.

178
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
How can I open it without anything?

179
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Take this.

180
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
It's spring.

181
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Tong'er,

182
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
what do you think?

183
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
What else can I do?

184
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
I'll sleep.

185
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
The city director has ordered

186
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
to send Lord Guang to you.

187
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
I'm here to see you.

188
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Who asked me?

189
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
This is our family's

190
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
special cow blood tea.

191
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
It's specially used

192
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,440
for guests.

193
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
It's really delicious.

194
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
It has that

195
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
original taste of catfish.

196
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,440
When I first saw it,

197
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
I was so sure

198
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
to drink it.

199
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,440
Lord Guang is really extraordinary.

200
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
No way.

201
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
When I first saw it,

202
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
I invited me

203
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
to your room for tea.

204
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
I'm so glad.

205
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
I'm so glad.

206
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
I'm so glad.

207
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
I'm so glad.

208
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
I'm so glad.

209
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
I'm so glad.

210
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
I'm so glad.

211
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
I'm so glad.

212
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
I'm so glad.

213
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
I'm so glad.

214
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
This house should be Doncadre's house.

215
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
It's really so borrowkey.

216
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,440
It should be ridiculous

217
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,960
as long as we have the ghost water.

218
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
If so,

219
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
let's talk about our family.

220
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm just doing my best.

221
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,440
But I respect you.

222
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
You're the only female City Master.

223
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,440
I respect you for being so angry.

224
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,440
I guess you'll be teaed when you get home.

225
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,440
I'm sure you're still a little nervous.

226
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
I guess so too.

227
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Those women's scrolls must be for Lu Di.

228
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
I didn't expect to be sent back by someone

229
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,440
who's been taken by the people.

230
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
In Lu Di's eyes,

231
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Wu Yi is the one who came to our Yuan State.

232
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,440
I think City Master is even more panic than I am.

233
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,440
You're giving Lu Di a reward.

234
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Why should I be panic?

235
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,440
Now the north tribe has been beaten by Yuan State.

236
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,440
You're afraid of getting offended by Lu Di

237
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
and the formation of the formation.

238
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,440
You're so eager to invite me to your room to have tea.

239
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,440
I guess there's a plan for the chaos.

240
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Prince of Guangming is smart and smart.

241
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
I'm not talking about the secret.

242
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,440
I can be in a good relationship with Lord Lian Meng

243
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,440
and even be a good friend.

244
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
You must still have a plan for the future.

245
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
That's right.

246
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,440
But you must marry me.

247
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
I'm a lazy person.

248
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,440
I like to bully my subordinates and always have a hard time.

249
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
I'll make a lot of money from the housework.

250
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,440
I'll pay for the rest of the expenses.

251
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
I'll pay for the rest of the expenses.

252
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,440
I usually like to drink and also drink.

253
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
I don't even have time to pay for the rest of the expenses.

254
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
I don't have many other expenses.

255
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
I have more women.

256
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,440
If you like it, I'll pay for the rest of the expenses.

257
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
I have two subordinates.

258
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,440
One is able to smell and the other is not.

259
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,440
The number of people who can smell is 10.

260
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
You can't do that.

261
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
I don't want to do that.

262
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,440
But the city that can attack the water source

263
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
is controlled by the north tribe.

264
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
If I can't trust you,

265
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,440
it's hard to make a decision about the north tribe.

266
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
I can also give you water.

267
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
What's the point of you and the north tribe?

268
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
If you don't marry me,

269
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,440
you can't rest assured and get into the alliance.

270
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,440
Before you came, I've already thought about it.

271
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,440
The best result is that you are willing to marry me.

272
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,440
The final result is that we appreciate each other

273
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,440
and achieve political unity.

274
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Is this the worst result?

275
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,440
Will you kill me and punish me for my father's crime?

276
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,440
I'll give you a day to think about it.

277
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Come on, cheers.

278
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,440
If not, our city chief is great.

279
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,440
He will be the King of Light.

280
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Of course.

281
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
Come and drink.

282
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Tong'er, if you don't say it,

283
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
you should have let him win.

284
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
We are not in a hurry.

285
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
If you really don't want to save me,

286
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
you two have time to talk.

287
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Why don't you make a decision?

288
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Sir, please make a decision.

289
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Have you ever heard of a saying?

290
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
It's called,

291
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,440
there is a world without a cloud.

292
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Tong'er,

293
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,440
you are blind.

294
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,440
You are blind.

295
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
What I mean is,

296
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
you are a good person.

297
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Next time, you will be blind.

298
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Go.

299
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Go.

300
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Sir, you have already made a plan.

301
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
You two go to Jialan from Nüquan.

302
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
I will follow you in the back.

303
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
If you are in danger,

304
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,440
I will come to save you.

305
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Thank god, you are not blind.

306
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Otherwise,

307
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
you will be in the middle of life.

308
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Go.

309
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
The city chief looks good.

310
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
He is old.

311
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Is he good?

312
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
He has a bad hair.

313
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
He looks too dark.

314
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
He has no light.

315
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Who said he is not good?

316
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,440
What are we?

317
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Embroidery?

318
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
Colorful?

319
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Wolf-caught?

320
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
A city chief with a good appearance?

321
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
If anyone marry you,

322
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,440
it will be the luck of the Yuan State.

323
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
No face.

324
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
A few days ago,

325
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Governor of the capital,

326
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Lord Goshan,

327
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Commander of the imperial court,

328
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Lord Siyi Lin,

329
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
was killed by the army.

330
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Lord Goshan,

331
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Lord Goshan,

332
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
Lord Siyi Lin,

333
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
can be arrested at the scene.

334
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,440
Today,

335
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
we will arrest the god.

336
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
We will arrest the criminal.

337
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
Hands up.

338
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Hands up.

339
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
Hands up.

340
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Hands up.

341
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
Hands up.

342
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
Hands up.

343
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Hands up.

344
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Hands up.

345
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Hands up.

346
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Hands up.

347
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
Hands up.

348
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Hands up.

349
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
Hands up.

350
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Ding Cheng,

351
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
the criminal is dead.

352
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
What else do you want to say?

353
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
During the assassination of Goshan,

354
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
we killed a carriage driver.

355
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
That driver must have been

356
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,440
a man of his own.

357
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
I know

358
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
how he suffered.

359
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
So,

360
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
I am willing to take all the responsibility

361
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
for the death of Lord Goshan.

362
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
And Lord Siyi Lin.

363
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
He used to lead us to the battle of Yuxue.

364
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
I am sorry

365
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
that I didn't have the chance to hurt him.

366
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,440
But I don't regret it.

367
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
Good.

368
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,440
The criminal Ding Cheng,

369
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
who was a criminal,

370
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
killed the criminal.

371
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
According to the law of this village,

372
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
he is still a criminal.

373
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Three days later,

374
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
I don't want to serve you.

375
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
I have been a criminal

376
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
for hundreds of years.

377
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Every child of the Wawing family

378
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
in the battlefield,

379
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
they all died outside the capital.

380
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,440
But what did we get?

381
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
We got military weakness.

382
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
People are suffering.

383
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
We got

384
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
23 stars in the far away.

385
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
But the capital is still a military reserve.

386
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Tanwu.

387
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Fu Bai.

388
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
That's right.

389
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Someone must use blood

390
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
to be a police officer.

391
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,440
To clear the way to the capital.

392
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
We are willing to do this.

393
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Even if we die,

394
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
we will die.

395
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
We will die.

396
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
We will die.

397
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
We will die.

398
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
We will die.

399
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
We will die.

400
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,440
People in Wawing and the capital

401
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,440
are all killed,

402
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,440
crucified

403
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
to defend the families

404
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
and soldiers.

405
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
They suffer

406
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
an external death.

407
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Disappointment.

408
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Disappointment.

409
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Disappointment.

410
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,440
Disappointment.

411
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
Disappointment.

412
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
Disappointment.

413
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,880
See you later.

414
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,400
Xiao Mi, don't be such a manantist anymore.

415
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Right now, you're already stuck.

416
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
I have something urgent to take care of.

417
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,320
I'm at your marathon,

418
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,600
so take care of your audience patiently.

419
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
You're still receiving the hearing?

420
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Have you already decided?

421
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Not yet.

422
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,600
But Wen He just sent a message.

423
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,600
He said that many people have already sent in the letter to the outside world.

424
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
He asked for the two assassins to be free.

425
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
You can't go now.

426
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,600
If you have anything to say, you can write it down.

427
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
I'll send it to you.

428
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
I have to go myself.

429
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
I'll go now.

430
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Sir, there are thousands of people in the court.

431
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Please give the two assassins free.

432
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
I'll go now.

433
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
I know.

434
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
It seems that you have already expected it.

435
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
How dare you!

436
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,600
You two are both guilty of murder.

437
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
You also tried to trick the people.

438
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
You are the most reasonable.

439
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
You are the most reasonable.

440
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
You are the most reasonable.

441
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
You are all just a few people.

442
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
If you don't stop them, we will save them ourselves.

443
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Save them.

444
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,600
We will be released from prison after the execution.

445
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Yes.

446
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Let go of me.

447
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Let go of me.

448
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Let go of me.

449
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Wait a minute.

450
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Sir.

451
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
What are you doing here?

452
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
I have something to say.

453
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Wait a minute, okay?

454
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,600
As the source of this matter,

455
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,600
I want to cancel their control.

456
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
I want to be free.

457
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,600
I am the commander of the imperial army.

458
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,600
I am the commander of the imperial army.

459
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,600
My soldiers love me.

460
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,600
They believe me, but I can't lead them.

461
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,600
I want to bring victory back to Zichuan.

462
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,600
This is my duty.

463
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
I have no responsibility for my life.

464
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,600
I have no control over Zichuan's order.

465
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
I have to let the people be hurt.

466
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,600
I have to let the people be betrayed.

467
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
This is my duty.

468
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
So,

469
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
the two of them are guilty.

470
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
I am the one who is responsible.

471
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,600
I love this path.

472
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
I have the right to do it.

473
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
I love this path.

474
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
I love this path.

475
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
I love this path.

476
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
I love this path.

477
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
I love this path.

478
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,600
I love this path.

479
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
I give this path.

480
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
I give this path.

481
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
I need you to stay here for love.

482
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,600
I don't want you two to be left in the mood for love.

483
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,600
But this doesn't mean that I forgive you.

484
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Not to mention that I know I am wrong.

485
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:18,600
I just want you to know that you can't escape the consequences of the defeat.

486
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,600
I know that you have disappointed Zichuan.

487
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,600
You want Zichuan to be a strong and fair and fake.

488
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,600
But now, the North is in danger.

489
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,600
You can't use your own sword.

490
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,600
You can't use your own sword.

491
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,600
If you think that you can kill me,

492
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,600
and solve this problem,

493
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,600
I won't kill you again.

494
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
You won't live!

495
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Soldiers!

496
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Brothers!

497
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,600
You have shed blood for this family.

498
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,600
What is this family?

499
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,800
the俺

500
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,600
is your price.

501
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,880
The price

502
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,240
won't go down

503
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,520
to anyone

504
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,640
or to any other

505
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
behind your wedding.

506
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,840
You

507
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,360
will finally bless

508
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,480
the respect

509
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,440
and loss

510
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,620
This magic can assert a real enemy

511
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,220
The experiencing the fate...

512
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,700
Zun Xian

513
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,580
Brother Ping,

514
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,020
沒有權者付罪你臉

515
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,340
But, brother,

516
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,120
this is our own problem

517
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,260
The subject job is to be closely ionized

518
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,460
Elder

519
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,700
Yes!

520
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
Yes!

521
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:54,700
The magic of love is also the meaning of the existence of magic.

522
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,700
Although Ding Chengchang and Li are both wrong,

523
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,700
there is a reason for it.

524
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Besides, Si Yi Lin has not been pursuing them.

525
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,200
He is asking to free them.

526
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,700
As for the family of Fu Xue Jin and the Xiu Shanwa Yun,

527
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,700
I will give you an explanation.

528
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:21,700
Long live the emperor!

529
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
Lord Ge.

530
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,700
Lord Si Yi Lin, I have something to give you.

531
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,700
The heart of Bodhisattva is long-awaited.

532
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,700
There is no way. I am a soldier.

533
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,700
Stupid.

534
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,700
Lord, it is really hard for you today.

535
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,700
Lord, you have become the criminal of the hero.

536
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Our Lord, you are more important than anyone else.

537
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,700
You are the one who taught me to be in this case.

538
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,700
You taught me to let go of the child.

539
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,700
If you let go of the child,

540
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,700
you will not be in Si Yi's place.

541
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,700
I am the person who is heartless.

542
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,700
He has become so clear and has regained his face.

543
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,700
Law can be changed because of a person's plan.

544
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,700
It is fair and fair.

545
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,700
But it is not important that politics is balanced.

546
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,700
Our Lord is putting everyone on the line.

547
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,700
He is the one who is the one who is the most important.

548
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,700
Lord, the things that are difficult to do are controlled by this.

549
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700
Everyone is punished.

550
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,700
I am the one who is the most important.

551
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,700
It is to be punished.

552
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,700
I am the one who is the most important.

553
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,700
Do you know why I am punishing you?

554
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,700
It is not because you did something wrong.

555
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,700
It is because we want to give the people an explanation.

556
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,700
I want to withdraw you from this world first.

557
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,700
The duty of Du Zheng Si is to find someone else to replace you.

558
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,700
Liu Feng family cannot fight anymore.

559
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,700
The more refugees, the more refugees will become refugees.

560
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,700
Once the refugees become bandits,

561
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,700
the world will be in chaos.

562
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,700
What you said before is right.

563
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,700
Thank you, Lord.

564
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,700
How can we make peace with refugees?

565
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,700
I understand.

566
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,700
I will go back now.

567
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,700
Okay.

568
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,700
Lord, I will listen to your words.

569
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,700
Thank you.

570
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
Have a safe journey.

571
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,700
Doctor, how is my husband?

572
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,700
He is fine.

573
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
He has four weak and weak muscles.

574
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,700
He can't use them for now.

575
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,700
I can only delay the process of my house.

576
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,700
If I can't keep my mouth shut,

577
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,700
it will be so hard for me to go back.

578
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,700
Then I...

579
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,700
Is there really no other way?

580
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,700
As long as you can cure my husband,

581
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,700
Liu Feng family will be more important.

582
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,700
Doctor, please think of a way.

583
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,700
Help him.

584
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,700
I have an old method.

585
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,700
It's just that the rumor is hard to find.

586
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,700
Even if I get it,

587
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,700
I don't know how many times I can cure it.

588
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,700
No matter what, I will do it.

589
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,700
The mountain's peak, the bridge of dragons.

590
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,700
The world is blood-sucking.

591
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,700
The feast is back to the court.

592
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,700
What does this mean?

593
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,700
Thank you for your advice.

594
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,700
What does this mean?

595
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,700
It means that the medicine is in the Far East.

596
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,700
The prescription is written on the letter.

597
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,700
Can you get it?

598
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,700
It depends on you.

599
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,700
Since I know the location,

600
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,700
I can go find it myself.

601
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,700
I'll go with you.

602
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,700
You are the eldest of the Lin family.

603
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,700
I can't delay your time anymore.

604
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,700
Take me to the medicine and thank you.

605
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,700
I promise.

606
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,700
I promise.

607
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,700
Go.

608
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,700
I'll go too.

609
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,700
The swings are like saltshades.

610
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,700
This is my first time coming here.

611
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Why is it full of gekl broadcasts?

612
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,700
Editing is my idea.

613
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,700
Let's see if this cases by chance.

614
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,700
and love each other.

615
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,300
So,

616
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,500
you don't like these gifts anymore?

617
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,700
These gifts are too high-end.

618
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,300
They are not good enough for me.

619
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,900
I am a low-key talker.

620
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,100
Why don't we listen to your subordinates' opinions?

621
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,900
They've been with you for so long.

622
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,900
They must know your likes well.

623
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,300
I think the first set is good.

624
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,100
High-class and generous.

625
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,500
I think not every set is good.

626
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,900
Every set is good.

627
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,700
That's to make a good deal for you.

628
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,500
You can choose whatever you want. I'm not afraid of death.

629
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,500
But I know you won't do that.

630
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,900
Shut up.

631
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,500
You two talk. I'll just hide.

632
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,100
Not bad. I like it.

633
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
No, no, no.

634
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,300
I think the first set is good.

635
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,500
My lord, my lord!

636
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,100
The water from the dungeon is coming out.

637
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,300
My lord,

638
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,700
after all these years,

639
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,700
I'm not willing to let you go.

640
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,000
But when I think about it,

641
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,700
you're finally going to harm someone else.

642
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,500
To be honest, I'm a little worried.

643
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,800
Song Jun is a thousand miles away.

644
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,700
He's back to the city to get his double-edged sword.

645
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:33,100
I really didn't expect you to get married like this.

646
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,900
I didn't expect that

647
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,500
after so long with you,

648
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,100
I thought you were a good daughter.

649
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,900
You're overreacting.

650
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,700
I didn't expect that you still have this little person in your life.

651
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,100
I'm so proud of you.

652
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,100
How come you suddenly become a little bit more...

653
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,300
Tao Er,

654
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,500
I hope that in the future, you can drink and get someone to pick you up.

655
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
If you make money, you don't need to drink all of it.

656
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,100
You can save some for yourself.

657
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,700
I don't want to leave you.

658
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,100
I can't bear to lose you.

659
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,500
Wait, why are you crying?

660
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,500
Don't cry.

661
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,900
Old Tao...

662
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,900
Won't our brother become a little bit more sad?

663
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,500
I'm so sad.

664
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,700
Don't be sad anymore. I'm also sad. I'm tired.

665
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,700
I didn't expect that a flower in my faraway land is now...

666
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,500
Prince Guangming!

667
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,600
You're right.

668
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,800
This thing...

669
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,600
んだ.

670
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,900
You never set foot in my school.

671
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,200
Brothers.

672
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
You solved the problem of the water source?

673
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,600
We have been collecting the water for the north.

674
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Can you find a place to get water?

675
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,800
He is my subordinate. I will answer this question.

676
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,600
Xi Ya.

677
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Call me the leader.

678
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
You and I are not that close.

679
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,000
I don't think there is any problem.

680
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,200
That's great.

681
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,200
As long as we can control the north of the water source,

682
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,400
my people will not need to look at their faces.

683
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Family, independence, we can bring them on.

684
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
Come on. Get up.

685
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Don't cry. Sit.

686
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,400
If Li Nong solved the problem of the water source,

687
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,400
then we don't need to get married, right?

688
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Who needs you when you have water?

689
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Think about it.

690
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,400
I suddenly feel a little bit like a singer.

691
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,400
If I do, it seems like I just bought a rope and I am ready to jump.

692
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,400
I am afraid that this rope will break.

693
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
But thanks to you,

694
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,400
I found the key to the control of the water source.

695
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
I will do my best to help you.

696
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,400
If Li Nong stays and helps you solve the problem of the water source,

697
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,400
then the Yuan Zhou Alliance Army and your family

698
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,400
will be a common thing.

699
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Of course.

700
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Good.

701
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Let's work together.

702
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Let's go.

703
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Hello.

704
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Don't be afraid.

705
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
I want to ask you

706
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,400
if you know what this word means.

707
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
I don't know.

708
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Are you from the north or the Alliance Army?

709
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Don't talk to these arrogant people.

710
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
If you meet the north, you will be caught.

711
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Sister, go to the temple to ask the chief of the department.

712
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
He doesn't know anything.

713
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Hurry up.

714
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
Okay. Thank you.

715
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,400
When the Duke marries Din Shou a big man will like theขam red osmen.

716
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,400
It is no better than you to love the邊九九 only for me.

717
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
Don't take it away from me.

718
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Dad,

719
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,400
please let me take the land rites away.

720
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
Yes.

721
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,480
I'm Lin Yu.

722
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,120
I'm sorry for causing the millions of bugs.

723
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,920
Can you come from XCRUEST?

724
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,960
Of course.

725
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,680
tablespoons first.

726
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,560
Mountains are Sketch,

727
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,320
Col眉 is shadows,

728
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,680
Earth is all rest.

729
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,040
His government's government has been reipped.

730
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
I have a question for you.

731
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Elder, please ask.

732
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
To cure your father's illness,

733
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,400
will you hurt someone innocent?

734
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Of course not.

735
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
My father taught me that

736
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
the path of evil must be determined.

737
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,400
But it's not possible to kill someone innocent.

738
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Then I can answer your question now.

739
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Actually, many people know the meaning of this word.

740
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
Including me.

741
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,400
But to cure the person who meant the word,

742
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,400
I'm afraid I will only mislead you.

743
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Mislead?

744
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
You are a kind child.

745
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
In the Kucheng family,

746
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,400
there are several lovers in Pingyang.

747
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,400
There will be someone to help them get to the hospital.

748
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,400
There may be a clue you need to find.

749
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,720
Big Brother,

750
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,900
have you invited someone?

751
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Thank you, Elder.

752
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Then I can go now.

753
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,320
Where is the fledged one?

754
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,660
He's Ji Yiren.

755
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,580
He is the Lord of the Flames Clan.

756
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,580
This is Yaren Chen's

757
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,700
sanctuary agents

758
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,080
to stop the flood.

759
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,260
Please go see her.

760
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,460
Please sit.

761
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,300
Sit.

762
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:21,400
From here, it's being directly connected to the

763
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,840
But we've been promoted by so many stars.

764
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,880
I'm afraid it's too much time.

765
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,200
So,

766
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,120
I want to take the place of Jialai

767
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,400
to hold a banquet.

768
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,920
I want to invite those

769
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,360
who haven't been controlled by the North Tribe

770
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,600
to learn the technique

771
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,240
and take this opportunity

772
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,360
to gather the whole Yuan State together.

773
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,200
That's good.

774
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,520
Water is a must.

775
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,520
Now, we can solve the water source problem.

776
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,080
I believe no one will refuse.

777
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,120
That's right.

778
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,640
But,

779
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,640
since you want to use Jialai,

780
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,840
I'll take some local fees

781
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,200
from Lord Guangming.

782
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,320
It's not a big deal, right?

783
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,360
You really don't have

784
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,960
any money to buy and sell.

785
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,720
But I like it.

786
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,320
In that case,

787
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,160
I'll take some tuition from you.

788
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,760
With my name,

789
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,300
send an invitation to our homie up to議 on a show

790
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,280
and host a banquet together at Jialai.

791
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,440
Good.

792
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,400
Remember.

793
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,040
ằng

794
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,340
않았

795
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:57,660
What the hell are you doing?

796
00:44:59,780 --> 00:44:59,880
Brother

797
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:02,940
Brother

798
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,420
How far are you going?

799
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,440
OK

800
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,440
The second one is very good

801
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,440
I can hold it

802
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,440
After that

803
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,440
I can hold it

804
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,440
Then I can hold it

805
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,440
I can hold it

806
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,440
OK, this side is the same

807
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,440
Thank you, everyone

808
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,440
Just take this one

809
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,440
Just take this one

810
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,440
The third one

811
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,440
When I am in the mountain

812
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,440
I will

813
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
put it on you

814
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,440
I want to put it on you

815
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,440
There is nothing on both sides

816
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,440
Nothing

817
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,440
Look

818
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,440
Look

819
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,440
Look

820
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,440
Look

821
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,440
Look

822
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,440
Look

823
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,440
Look

824
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,440
Look

825
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,440
Then I can do this

826
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,440
I forgot the words

827
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,440
I forgot the words

828
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,440
I won't

829
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,440
По-reverse

830
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:23,440
Roll it

831
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,300
The horse'll shoot

832
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,440
It comes

833
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,440
I'm waiting for you

834
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,440
Open your mouth

835
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,440
We are in the middle of the day and night

836
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,440
But it's dark

837
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,440
The south wind is blowing

838
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,440
So we are going to go up together

839
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,440
We are going to go up together

840
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,440
Then we come back

841
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,440
If we arrive at the wall

842
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,440
The place where the wall is set up

843
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,440
It must be the management room

844
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,440
But

845
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,440
My home

846
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,440
My home

847
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,440
Will never be isolated for the sake of hard work

848
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,440
I'm sorry

849
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,440
I'm sorry

850
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,440
Come on

851
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,440
You can't be so serious

852
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,440
Your face

853
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,440
I'm not serious

854
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,440
Why

855
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,440
Now the far away is out of the stable

856
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,440
Who

857
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,440
It's not right for us to be hit

858
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,440
Look

859
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,440
This is the cloud
