1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,900
cream

17
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,620
cream

18
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,620
Beans

19
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Episode 29

20
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,600
This is...

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,920
map?

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,420
You want to help me escape?

23
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,860
This is the map of the Xichuan Road in Yanzhou.

24
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,940
Including the economy,

25
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,140
culture,

26
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,860
politics, and three versions.

27
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,700
These materials are recorded

28
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,220
in different historical sites

29
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,980
in different places in Yanzhou.

30
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,460
Brother Xiu.

31
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,220
If he is in the town of the north,

32
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,540
he should be here.

33
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,060
This book is the book of the Yanzhou Temple.

34
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,740
Although it's gray,

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,780
the history of Yanzhou

36
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,180
is a good supplement.

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,900
Today,

38
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,820
these are your homework.

39
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,980
When did I say

40
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,260
you are such a teacher?

41
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,340
Tomorrow,

42
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,140
I will ask you

43
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,340
about the problems in Yanzhou.

44
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,180
I then asked my father-in-law

45
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,940
What did you tell him?

46
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,200
Before, we introduced Yanzhou.

47
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,700
We are talking today

48
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,540
about the every special life

49
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,940
of the Zichuan family

50
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,700
Liu Feng Jiah.

51
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,740
They are not easy to get into the battle.

52
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:40,380
All of this is to be attributed to their female

53
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,380
Liu Feng Shuang.

54
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,380
Liu Feng Shuang?

55
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,380
Let's take a break, Li Qing.

56
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,380
Let's chat.

57
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,380
Well, who did you just say?

58
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,380
Liu Feng Shuang?

59
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,020
Does he look good?

60
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,020
He's very old.

61
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,020
He's the same age as you.

62
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,020
Same age?

63
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,020
There are many small groups of Liu Feng family.

64
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,900
It's also because of this that Liu Feng family

65
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
has been under real development.

66
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,900
But after Liu Feng Shuang's expansion,

67
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,900
he's been in trouble for decades.

68
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,940
He's the flagship of the Liu Feng family.

69
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,940
He's a young master of the family.

70
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,940
Liu Feng Shuang?

71
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,940
He's my colleague.

72
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,980
Then, I have a chance to be like him.

73
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,980
Li Qing, you just came.

74
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,980
I have a lot of questions to ask you.

75
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,980
Tell me, what are the questions?

76
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,980
I saw a book in front of me.

77
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,980
It says that the North is more than a year

78
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,020
from the time of the war between the North and Zichuan.

79
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,020
In order to win the Xiqian,

80
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,020
we have to stay away from the East.

81
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,020
Why do they have to stay away from the East?

82
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,020
We mentioned the East before.

83
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,020
It's a desert land with a thousand years of ice.

84
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,020
There are wild animals and animals in it.

85
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,020
It's not a living creature.

86
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,020
The North is the East of the Lin.

87
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,020
So the Xiqian is very bad for them.

88
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,060
Look, there's blood on it.

89
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,060
Princess, you like these the most.

90
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,060
But since you came back from Zichuan,

91
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,060
there's no movement at all.

92
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,060
I haven't had a chance to eat these lately.

93
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,060
These are all the snacks that General Yun Qian Xue gave me two days ago.

94
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,060
Please have a taste.

95
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,060
General Yun?

96
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,060
Has he been here often lately?

97
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,060
General sent me a lot of things.

98
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,100
But he didn't mean to ask for a meeting.

99
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,100
He said I've been feeling sick lately.

100
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
I'll have to rest a little bit

101
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,100
before I can thank him.

102
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,100
Yes.

103
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,100
Let's leave.

104
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,140
Let's go.

105
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,140
Yes, this is the place.

106
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,140
Uncle.

107
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,140
Can you hold on a little bit?

108
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,140
Be gentle.

109
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,180
Yes, this is the place.

110
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,180
I feel so comfortable.

111
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,180
I'll change my clothes.

112
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,180
Has Li Nong been wearing me out?

113
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,180
He hasn't been out for a while.

114
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
He's obviously blind.

115
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,180
Why is he in a bad mood?

116
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,180
I think your medicine is good.

117
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,180
It's really good.

118
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,180
This is our ancestral secret recipe from the left-wing.

119
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,180
With this medicine, you should be much better.

120
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,180
Really?

121
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,220
Is it almost ready?

122
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,220
General, it's not that fast, right?

123
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,220
It's not that fast.

124
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,220
Don't stop.

125
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,220
It's not that effective.

126
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,220
It's too bad that I can't do it.

127
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,220
Li Nong, it's the end of today.

128
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,260
You've worked hard.

129
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,260
By the way,

130
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,260
remember to call Azi over to do something.

131
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
Come, let's go tomorrow.

132
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,260
Yes.

133
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,260
Everyone, thank you.

134
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,260
No, thank you. Hurry up.

135
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,260
Let's go.

136
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,260
Old man, I can see things in my eyes.

137
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,260
Don't tell them.

138
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
Why?

139
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
What's wrong?

140
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
Too much pressure.

141
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
I can't have such an opportunity.

142
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,300
I have to cherish it.

143
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,300
I really want to live like this every day.

144
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,300
By the way,

145
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,300
by the way,

146
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,300
I asked you about the thing I asked you last time.

147
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,300
How did you do it?

148
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
According to the prescription you wrote for me,

149
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
everything is in order.

150
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
It's obvious that it's because of the coin.

151
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
You.

152
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,300
The left king?

153
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
The secret of the martial arts of the left king?

154
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Sir,

155
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,300
did you write the secret of the martial arts of the left king?

156
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
What secret?

157
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
The secret of the left king.

158
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
The name is strange.

159
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,300
You don't know it's true.

160
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,300
I think

161
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,300
we should collect all the secrets of these chaotic military forces.

162
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,340
Indeed.

163
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,340
It's a lie.

164
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,340
I think

165
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,340
these secrets are true.

166
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,340
Chuan Da,

167
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,340
the left king is a legendary person.

168
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,340
Is there anyone who doesn't know it?

169
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
Of course there is.

170
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,340
The old man is really existent.

171
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,340
And he is very tall and tall.

172
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,340
Chuan,

173
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,340
have you seen the left king?

174
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,340
I have.

175
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,340
Chuan Da,

176
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,340
don't bully me.

177
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,340
The martial arts of the left king

178
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,340
is the first thing that the whole west is on the road.

179
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,340
His secret is this.

180
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,340
You don't understand it.

181
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,340
The left king is very rich and humorous.

182
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,340
So his secret is also like this.

183
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,340
Actually, he uses this very common way

184
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,340
to make you interested.

185
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,340
It's very popular.

186
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,340
Indeed.

187
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,380
It makes sense.

188
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,380
But it's still very fake.

189
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,380
I...

190
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,380
It's because he is far away from the rumors

191
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,380
that's why it's so hard to find the historical advantage.

192
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,380
So it's true.

193
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,380
It's none of his business.

194
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,380
He is not bad at hunting.

195
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,380
What if it's true?

196
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,380
Exactly.

197
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,380
Let's go.

198
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,380
I don't want to hunt.

199
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,380
Lian Lian.

200
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,380
What the hell is Zi Chuan Xiu doing?

201
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,420
It's not a good idea.

202
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,420
Do we hunt?

203
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,420
No.

204
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,420
This woman is a hunter.

205
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,420
Exactly.

206
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,420
Yu Mei.

207
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,420
What are you doing?

208
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,420
I'm not around.

209
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,420
Da Lun called me.

210
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,420
What's the matter?

211
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,420
The secret books of your master.

212
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,420
Is it really useful?

213
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,420
Of course.

214
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,420
The most missing is the real experience.

215
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,420
Bai Chuan.

216
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,420
You can't move the things on my desk.

217
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,420
Those are all military secret drugs.

218
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,420
This is also a military secret drug.

219
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,420
This is confiscated when I checked it.

220
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,420
The contents of this book are really bad.

221
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,420
But...

222
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,420
I will definitely

223
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,420
take advantage of the health of the brothers.

224
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,420
I must confiscate it for them.

225
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,420
How do you know which one I got?

226
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,420
You can see it in your eyes.

227
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,420
How is that possible?

228
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,420
I can't see it.

229
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,420
I remember there are several books on this table.

230
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,420
In addition to the military secret books,

231
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,420
there is a book that was confiscated from Luo Jie.

232
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,420
Bai Chuan.

233
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,420
Bai Chuan.

234
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,420
Go back now.

235
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,420
I feel a little uncomfortable.

236
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,420
Uncomfortable?

237
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,420
Lord Xiuxiu.

238
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,420
I'll help you to rest.

239
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,420
Rest?

240
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,420
Come.

241
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,420
Rest well.

242
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,420
Come.

243
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Sit.

244
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,420
You are not in the same room as before.

245
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,420
Don't you feel bored?

246
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,420
Bored?

247
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,420
What do you mean?

248
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,420
Lord.

249
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,420
Actually,

250
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,420
there is something

251
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,420
that I wanted to tell you a long time ago.

252
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,420
You can change the name.

253
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
I want to calm down now.

254
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
I'm not sure.

255
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,420
You have something on your mind too.

256
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,420
Tell me about it.

257
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
It's a small matter.

258
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,420
I'll tell you later.

259
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,420
I'll tell you later.

260
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,420
Brother Xiuxiu.

261
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,420
Why is your face red?

262
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,420
Bai Chuan.

263
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,420
It's late now.

264
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,420
I...

265
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,420
I...

266
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,420
I'll go to bed.

267
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,420
You should go too.

268
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,420
I'll give it back to you.

269
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,420
I'll go to bed.

270
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,420
I'll go to bed.

271
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,420
You can go to bed.

272
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,420
I see.

273
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,420
You are so angry.

274
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,420
Bai Chuan.

275
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,420
Why did you take off your clothes?

276
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,420
Come on.

277
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,420
You are so cool.

278
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,420
Zichuan Xiuxiu.

279
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,420
Bai Chuan.

280
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,420
I'm telling you.

281
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,420
Next time,

282
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,420
you are going to be like this.

283
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,420
I'll sue you for the capital punishment.

284
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,420
Are you going to sue Zichuan's capital punishment?

285
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,420
You...

286
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,420
Don't be too angry.

287
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,420
Who is angry?

288
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,420
You are obviously good-looking.

289
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,420
Why did you lie to us?

290
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,420
I...

291
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,420
I swear.

292
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,420
I've been seeing this for the past two days.

293
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,420
And I was seriously injured.

294
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,420
The martial arts skills are almost the same.

295
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,420
So I need to rest.

296
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,420
I need to rest for ten days.

297
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,420
Besides,

298
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,420
thanks to your care these days,

299
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,420
I can have the energy to share the secret skills

300
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,420
that my master left for everyone.

301
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,420
You took me to Mount Guqi.

302
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,420
You said that I was your most loyal subordinate.

303
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,420
I think you just want me to help you

304
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,420
to pretend that you are a good-looking man.

305
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,420
How...

306
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,420
How can you be a good-looking man?

307
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,420
Xiuxiu is too weak to be a soldier.

308
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,420
He can be a thief.

309
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,420
But if he meets a bad day,

310
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,420
he won't be able to hold out for five minutes.

311
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,420
So if you want to be in the far-away region,

312
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,420
you must improve your strength.

313
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,420
With these secret skills,

314
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,420
the martial arts skills are indeed what my master left.

315
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,420
They are all true.

316
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,420
Explain it.

317
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,420
The real martial arts skills are all in my mind.

318
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,420
I can only draw them out.

319
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,420
Look,

320
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,420
I've made different martial arts for everyone.

321
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,420
Think about it.

322
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
Although this Li Nong is not good at strategy,

323
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
he is good at it.

324
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,420
And Zhe.

325
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,420
Although he is timid,

326
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,420
you must give him a knife.

327
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,420
He will become different immediately.

328
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,420
And the other soldiers from Xiuxiu are born with a lot of flow.

329
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,420
They have a lot of experience in fighting the whole family.

330
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,420
So my secret skill for them is to improve internal strength

331
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,420
and strategy.

332
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,420
Think about it.

333
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,420
Think about it.

334
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,420
Am I a kind-hearted person?

335
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,420
You should be able to forgive me for being kind.

336
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,420
It's okay if you want me to forgive you.

337
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,420
Recently, everyone has been working hard for you.

338
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,420
Your eyes are already healed.

339
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
Shouldn't you be letting everyone be angry?

340
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,420
You...

341
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,420
What are you doing?

342
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,420
Why are you so stingy?

343
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,420
This is also written by the Left-winged King.

344
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,420
Let's exchange it and see.

345
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,420
You are a fake one.

346
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,420
You are so talented.

347
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,420
How could you be so distant from the Left-winged King?

348
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,420
Why are you talking like that?

349
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,420
Take it.

350
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,420
No.

351
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,420
Something happened.

352
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,420
What's wrong?

353
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,420
What's wrong?

354
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
What's wrong?

355
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
What's wrong?

356
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
What's wrong?

357
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,420
What's wrong?

358
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,420
What's wrong?

359
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,420
The North Army has already sent a message to our tribe.

360
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
Why are you so angry?

361
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,420
Head, your eyes are healed.

362
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,420
It's all because of the Left-winged King.

363
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,420
I'll tell you in detail later.

364
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,420
The important thing is that

365
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,420
our tribe's brothers

366
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,420
have been suffering the most in our Xiu Ziyin.

367
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,420
Now, the tribe is in danger.

368
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,420
We can't let Xiu Ziyin be a master.

369
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,420
Now,

370
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,420
let's get the weapons in our hands.

371
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,420
Go out and kill them.

372
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,420
Head,

373
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,420
we are really close to the half-baked brothers.

374
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,420
They are indeed good.

375
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,420
But if we fight them,

376
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,420
we might be completely defeated.

377
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,420
Everyone,

378
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,420
I know that you have been practicing martial arts recently.

379
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,420
Now, you are making a good opportunity to build a palace.

380
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,420
Are you going to miss this opportunity?

381
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
Head,

382
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,420
go out and open the gate of the village.

383
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,420
I count ten trees.

384
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,420
If anyone dares to hide here and not go out to win the enemy,

385
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,420
I'll kill him first.

386
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,420
Yes.

387
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,420
Head.

388
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,420
Head,

389
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,420
are you serious?

390
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,420
What do you think?

391
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,420
I'll go now.

392
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,420
Go.

393
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
Why are you so bad?

394
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
I...

395
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,420
Hurry up.

396
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,420
Hurry up.

397
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,420
Go.

398
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,420
Go.

399
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,420
We know that you are good at fighting.

400
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,420
Today,

401
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,420
we are mainly training our courage.

402
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,420
We'll leave here in a while.

403
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,420
Don't let our friends hurt you.

404
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,420
Yes.

405
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
Yes.

406
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
Okay.

407
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Just do your best.

408
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
Okay.

409
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,420
Brothers,

410
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,420
you can't blame me for this.

411
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,420
The boss said that

412
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,420
you won't go out and you will be killed.

413
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
What should we do?

414
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,420
So,

415
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,420
we can't say anything about Xiu Ziying.

416
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,420
Go.

417
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,420
Go.

418
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
Brothers,

419
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
go.

420
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
What should we do?

421
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,420
This move is really useless.

422
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,420
Go.

423
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,420
Everyone, stop fighting.

424
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,420
Stop fighting.

425
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,420
You are the one.

426
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,420
Today,

427
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,420
we are lucky

428
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,420
to have this guy

429
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,420
who beat up Xiu Ziying.

430
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,420
Brothers,

431
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,420
you are the one who

432
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,420
will be killed today.

433
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,420
You are not a murderer.

434
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,420
Kill.

435
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,420
A Zeng Shui is really good at fighting.

436
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,420
What are you doing?

437
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,420
Do it.

438
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,420
Brothers,

439
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,420
stop fighting.

440
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,420
You are so capable.

441
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
Are you the one who invited us here?

442
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,420
Of course not.

443
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,420
This is

444
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,420
a real traitor.

445
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,420
Xiu Ziying is really strong.

446
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,420
Zichuan Xiu

447
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,420
is the best teacher in the world.

448
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,420
Brothers, sisters,

449
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,420
today is

450
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,420
a very meaningful day for Xiu Ziying.

451
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,420
We have completely removed

452
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,420
the nickname Zichuan Soft-Blooded.

453
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,420
We have used our real strength

454
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,420
to win the first time.

455
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,420
Today is the beginning

456
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,420
of our new Xiu Ziying.

457
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,420
So from now on,

458
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,420
we will fight

459
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,420
for Xiu Ziying.

460
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,420
Good.

461
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,420
Brothers,

462
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,420
you are really good.

463
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,420
Brother,

464
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,420
today,

465
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,420
you and these brothers

466
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,420
are really good at fighting.

467
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,420
If we really fight,

468
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,420
I will not be able to beat them.

469
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,420
I will go and see that.

470
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,420
I will go and see.

471
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,420
Brother,

472
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,420
it's useless to fight only.

473
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,420
Now Xiu Ziying's ability to fight is really good.

474
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,420
But for the whole army,

475
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,420
the real problem is not solved yet.

476
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
No money means

477
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,420
we can't buy gold and silver.

478
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,420
It also means

479
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,420
we can't buy money.

480
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,420
No money.

481
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,420
Xiu Ziying can be famous.

482
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,420
How can you not have money now?

483
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,420
What are you doing?

484
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,420
This old De Lun,

485
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,420
he told me that he has no money

486
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,420
and he wants to borrow money from Xiu Ziying.

487
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,420
No money.

488
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,420
No money.

489
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,420
No money.

490
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,420
Listen to me.

491
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,420
Everyone, have a drink.

492
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,420
Listen to me.

493
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,420
Since I left this house,

494
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,420
this talisman,

495
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,420
this talisman is basically a waste.

496
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,420
Now we have to rely on you to take care of the food.

497
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,420
If you lack money,

498
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,420
you can look for me.

499
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,420
How is it, Han Xiu?

500
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,420
Old De Lun,

501
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
what did you do?

502
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,420
What did you do?

503
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,420
You are so busy.

504
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,420
You will take me next time.

505
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,420
If you say that,

506
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,420
it's because of you.

507
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,420
Because of me?

508
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,420
Back then,

509
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,420
our left-wing group

510
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,420
was under the talisman.

511
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
We opened a hall.

512
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,420
The village around us

513
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,420
was full of people.

514
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,420
We also went around

515
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,420
with the right-wing group.

516
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,420
But we know

517
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,420
our left-wing group

518
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,420
has low living costs.

519
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,420
So we found a place

520
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,420
like this.

521
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,420
We hid it.

522
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,420
Old De Lun,

523
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,420
I won't be polite to you.

524
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,420
I won't be polite to you either.

525
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,420
What do you mean?

526
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,420
I'm not in the mood for this.

527
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,420
I don't have time.

528
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,420
I don't have time.

529
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,420
Old De Lun,

530
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,420
don't be bad.

531
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,420
You are so good.

532
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,420
You taught me to learn.

533
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,420
How is it?

534
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,420
Good.

535
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,420
It's so good.

536
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,420
Where did you get this?

537
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,420
Please pay attention to your words.

538
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,420
These are not

539
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,420
the good news

540
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,420
I have about my Zi Chuan show.

541
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,420
It's a friendship between

542
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,420
the two of us.

543
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,420
So much money.

544
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,420
What are you doing?

545
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,420
This year,

546
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,420
someone wants to borrow money.

547
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,420
That's good.

548
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
What are you doing?

549
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,420
What can I do?

550
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,420
I have nothing.

551
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,420
I can do it.

552
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,420
Only I can do it.

553
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,420
I have a future.

554
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,420
How much is the interest?

555
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,420
100 million.

556
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,420
The price is already

557
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,420
very high in Yanzhou.

558
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,420
Besides,

559
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,420
with this money,

560
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,420
we can

561
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,420
re-enter the town.

562
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,420
What are you going to do?

563
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,420
Of course,

564
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,420
we will go there.

565
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,420
Please have a drink.

566
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,420
You said a few days ago,

567
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,420
we have already

568
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,420
returned the north tribe army.

569
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,420
Why did you let us

570
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,420
come out to patrol?

571
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,420
You forgot

572
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,420
our lord's name in the north tribe.

573
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,420
How many people are afraid

574
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,420
of his head?

575
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,420
Beiyan,

576
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,420
I was wrong.

577
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,420
What's wrong?

578
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
You smell the blood from the clothes.

579
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,420
It's still heavy.

580
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,420
It's from that side.

581
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
North tribe.

582
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,420
Mokokong,

583
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,420
bury them all.

584
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
It's so disgusting.

585
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,420
The blood is not dried yet.

586
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,420
The murderer

587
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,420
must have been away.

588
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,420
They should have heard

589
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,420
our footsteps

590
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,420
and left.

591
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,420
And from the blood,

592
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,420
they must have

593
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,420
been injured

594
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,420
and fell into the forest.

595
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,420
The footsteps were also very chaotic.

596
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,420
Go in and have a look.

597
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
Be careful.

598
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Stop!

599
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,420
We will let you in.

600
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,420
It seems that it's the rebels from the far away.

601
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,420
We have no malicious intent.

602
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,420
We want to talk with you.

603
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,420
Go.

604
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,420
The soldiers from the north tribe

605
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,420
are all killed by you, right?

606
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
Yes.

607
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,420
Did anyone get hurt?

608
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,420
Some of them are dead.

609
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,420
Come out.

610
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,420
Let's go.

611
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
The medicine and the food.

612
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,420
Hurry up.

613
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,420
Give the brothers some medicine.

614
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,420
Hurry up.

615
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,420
Come on.

616
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,420
Be careful.

617
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,420
Be careful.

618
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
Thank you.

619
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,420
You're welcome.

620
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,420
By the way,

621
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,420
you are...

622
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,420
My name is Hu An.

623
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
I am the fifth general of the Zichuan family,

624
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
the fifth general of the Zichuan family,

625
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,420
the fifth general of the Zichuan family,

626
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,420
Qi Ling.

627
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,420
The fifth general?

628
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
I am from the capital.

629
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,420
The fifth general

630
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,420
was betrayed by Zichuan.

631
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,420
Then he joined the north tribe.

632
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,420
Yes.

633
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,420
When Lei Hong betrayed,

634
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,420
the Zichuan family didn't dare to betray him.

635
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,420
He killed them all.

636
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,420
So now,

637
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,420
we are all traitors.

638
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,420
What happened to the bodies of the north tribe?

639
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,420
The tribesmen from the north tribe

640
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,420
couldn't see us these rebels.

641
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,420
Lei Hong died,

642
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,420
and he was more cruel to us.

643
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,420
So...

644
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,420
What are you going to do next?

645
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,420
Have you ever thought about going back to Zichuan?

646
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,420
We have our own blood.

647
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,420
The family can't forgive us.

648
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,420
Let's take a step back.

649
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,420
We'll fight

650
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,420
if the north tribe really comes after us.

651
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,420
Thank you, Li Yao.

652
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,420
Do you have any extra food and medicine?

653
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
I'll buy you some gold coins.

654
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,420
The village has some.

655
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,420
Food and medicine are all very sufficient.

656
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,420
Since you don't know

657
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,420
where to go next,

658
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,420
you can come back with us.

659
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,420
I think they are traitors.

660
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
It's better not to have any conflicts with them.

661
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,420
What about us?

662
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,420
We are different.

663
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,420
We are innocent.

664
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,420
They are real.

665
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,420
I'm afraid they are even more difficult to deal with.

666
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
Who are you?

667
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,420
Don't worry.

668
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,420
We are the same people.

669
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,420
We are traitors, too.

670
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,420
We are Xiu Ziyang.

671
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
Xiu Ziyang?

672
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,420
Then Zichuan is Xiu?

673
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,420
Yes.

674
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,420
Zichuan is our last time.

675
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
Brothers,

676
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,420
they are not right.

677
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
Zichuan is Xiu.

678
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,420
We want to be the hero and the hero.

679
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,420
What are you doing?

680
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,420
His world is spread in our group.

681
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,420
We admire him.

682
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,420
We can't help you

683
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,420
with the Red-Haired Man.

684
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
We can't help you.

685
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,420
We can only do what we want

686
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,420
to survive.

687
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,420
But he is different.

688
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,420
He did what we wanted

689
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,420
but he didn't dare to do it.

690
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,420
Brothers, you all know

691
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,420
that he is the real hero.

692
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,420
Yes.

693
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,420
He is the real hero.

694
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
Yes.

695
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,420
Tao Er,

696
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,420
you finally did something

697
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,420
that makes us so sad.

698
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,420
I'm so happy for you.

699
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,420
You...

700
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,420
You are so stupid.

701
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,420
Sir.

702
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,420
Wait.

703
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
Wait for me.

704
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,420
Sir.

705
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,420
Let's stop here.

706
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,420
What's wrong?

707
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,420
This is our Xiu Chuan.

708
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,420
This is the leader of the Left-winged group.

709
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,420
Hu An, right?

710
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
Yes.

711
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,420
Sit down.

712
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,420
Sit down.

713
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,420
Sit down.

714
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,420
Thank you.

715
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,420
Thank you.

716
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,420
My morning is so long.

717
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
Let's use the sun tile

718
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
to feel the scenery.

719
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,420
If we live,

720
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,420
we will claim our country.

721
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,420
Don't hut.

722
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,340
where we were in danger,

723
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,420
they sent us to there.

724
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,180
When we were in the Paiyi,

725
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,140
you were the first to attack the city.

726
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,100
Yes.

727
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,260
The Du's team was behind us.

728
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,260
The brothers were injured and were not allowed to retreat.

729
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,420
Some were killed by Huo Huo.

730
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,020
They were the bodies of the young maids.

731
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,300
After the death of Lei Hong,

732
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,620
we fled.

733
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,700
But some brothers

734
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,380
were chased by Du's team.

735
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,460
They were killed by Huo Huo

736
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,260
on the tree.

737
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,460
Later,

738
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,980
we were the first to attack.

739
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,260
We were left with the first force

740
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,740
and killed them.

741
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,860
We were left with no one.

742
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,260
The Paiyi's team was in the Paiyi's army.

743
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,700
Do you know that?

744
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,740
Of course.

745
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,300
We were in the Paiyi's army.

746
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,820
We were low in rank.

747
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,300
We couldn't contact the important secret.

748
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,620
But I heard a rumor.

749
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,380
After the Paiyi was besieged,

750
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,340
the Paiyi's team got the Paiyi's army.

751
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,660
But the long-term threats and attacks

752
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,060
made their army and equipment

753
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,100
very weak.

754
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,900
The closest distance

755
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,020
is from Lu's team.

756
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,180
My lord.

757
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,660
After you killed Lei Hong,

758
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,340
he became General Pingyuan.

759
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,500
I'm still a big man.

760
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,580
No one in the north?

761
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,140
General Pingyuan

762
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,220
is the most important one.

763
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,340
In the past,

764
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,980
the order of the Emperor of Saerong

765
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,380
was to kill the most people.

766
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,020
No one can take it.

767
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,940
After Lu's team heard it,

768
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,340
they went to Yueliang Bay.

769
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,700
They killed tens of thousands of people.

770
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,740
Then they killed other generals.

771
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,340
Tens of thousands of people?

772
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:20,820
Yes.

773
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,100
The order of the Emperor of Saerong

774
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,500
was to keep the Emperor

775
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,100
and not leave anyone.

776
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,100
Your Majesty.

777
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,860
Old DeLuan, where are you going?

778
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,740
I'm in a hurry.

779
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,060
I'm going to save them.

780
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,540
Don't rush.

781
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,180
Wait.

782
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,740
Bai Chun.

783
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:40,980
You go down first.

784
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,500
Yes.

785
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Old DeLuan, I know you're in a hurry.

786
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,180
Don't worry.

787
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,100
You're going to save them.

788
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,100
You're going to save the people in Xiuzi Camp.

789
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:54,980
It's no use.

790
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,980
Xiuwan.

791
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,420
Thank you.

792
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,300
But Yueliang Bay

793
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,980
is not just one of our left-winged clans.

794
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,180
There are many elite clans.

795
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,980
There are many other clans.

796
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,580
I want to talk to those clans

797
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,420
in the village.

798
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,820
How can I save them?

799
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,180
I'll go with you.

800
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,860
Xiuwan.

801
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,580
Xiuwan.

802
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,460
Don't worry about

803
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,620
Yuanzhou anymore.

804
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,340
Yuanzhou's clans

805
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,980
have been very sincere to the Zichuan people.

806
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,220
The block is enough.

807
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,900
You're here now.

808
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,100
We didn't say anything.

809
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,420
If you want to

810
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,300
take part in the Yuanzhou people's affairs,

811
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,980
I'm afraid we'll have a big problem.

812
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,060
How about this?

813
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,620
I'll just listen to you.

814
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:44,860
Okay?

815
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,020
Okay.

816
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,860
Let's go.

817
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,300
The enemy is a bad guy.

818
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,540
De Lun Shu.

819
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,060
Stop joking.

820
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,060
Save the people.

821
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,020
Who doesn't know

822
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,540
we can't fight the Snake Clan?

823
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,460
We can.

824
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,700
What's the difference between Song Si and us?

825
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,620
You're so selfish.

826
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,900
You can't fight.

827
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,180
The way to escape is the fastest.

828
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,980
You can go to the enemy's firepower.

829
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,740
Then you're the enemy's clans.

830
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,140
You're so good at digging the hole.

831
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,500
You should go to be a brother.

832
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,340
What are you talking about?

833
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,060
You're so good.

834
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,540
Go to be a brother.

835
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,620
We're all Yuanzhou people, right?

836
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,260
We'll go together.

837
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,660
We'll have a Zhao Ying, right?

838
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,580
I think

839
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,660
saving people

840
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,660
is inevitable.

841
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,780
In all the tribes,

842
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,740
the Dragon Clan's temperament is the strongest.

843
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,140
And the kung fu is the best.

844
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,500
The Moon Sect and the Sword and the House of the Martial Arts

845
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,340
were also built by them.

846
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,220
The Moon Sect is the most familiar to them.

847
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,900
The Fulong of the Moon Sect

848
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,060
is mostly the elite clan.

849
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,580
Before the elite clan was founded,

850
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,460
they took our Dragon Clan

851
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,460
to the Moon Sect's land

852
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,420
and drove us away.

853
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,940
Now we have to save them.

854
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,140
It's impossible.

855
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,180
Let's go.

856
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,820
Let's go.

857
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,140
Uncle De Lun,

858
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,460
the Moon Sect is now in the north.

859
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,900
We have to retreat.

860
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,420
We can kill the Fulong of the Moon Sect

861
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,380
and the Holy Temple.

862
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,500
It's a good idea.

863
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,260
Even if you're a group,

864
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,860
you don't want to help.

865
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:07,980
My De Lun

866
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,300
will take my left team

867
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,220
to the Moon Sect.

868
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,260
Let's retreat.

869
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:13,900
Let's go.

870
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,460
Let's go.

871
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,220
Let's go.

872
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,020
Let's go.

873
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,060
Let's go.

874
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,780
De Lun,

875
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,420
although the Yuan Zhaoyuan

876
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,460
is not good at fighting,

877
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,860
each of them has their own strengths.

878
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,420
If we can organize them

879
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,660
and train them well,

880
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,980
the Yuan Zhaoyuan and the Yuan Zhaoyuan

881
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,060
will be a great team.

882
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,340
We have a lot of potential.

883
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,860
The Yuan Zhaoyuan

884
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,980
has many people,

885
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,460
but they don't care about each other.

886
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,180
The nine graces between the different groups

887
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,780
are strong and low.

888
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,060
I can't even say it in three days and three nights.

889
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,300
We can't get along.

890
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,060
We can't fight.

891
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,660
If we have a leader,

892
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,620
it's great to be a group.

893
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,220
I understand.

894
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,860
De Lun,

895
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,020
don't worry.

896
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,860
Xiu Ziyin and I

897
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,460
will go to the Moon Sect with you.

898
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,860
You don't have the right to fight.

899
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,260
And you see

900
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,460
the values of these people.

901
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,260
I'm afraid

902
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,060
they won't accept your love.

903
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,660
There's no love in the world.

904
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,660
I don't know what I'm thinking.

905
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,660
Besides,

906
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,460
I don't act for others.

907
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,860
After hearing your discussion,

908
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,860
I think

909
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,260
we need at least

910
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,860
a leader of the Yuan Zhaoyuan.

911
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,060
Go!

912
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:10,860
Go!

913
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,660
Go!

914
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,460
Go!

915
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,060
Go!

916
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,260
Go!

917
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,660
Go!

918
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,660
Go!

919
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,860
You want to learn martial arts?

920
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:23,860
Go!

921
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,060
If you go to the Moon Sect with me,

922
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,660
I'll send someone to teach you.

923
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,660
I won't.

924
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,260
I won't save the Golden Bell Clan.

925
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,460
I won't learn martial arts from a Zichuan.

926
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,860
If the Northern Sect is the holy temple of the Wei State,

927
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,060
you won't be able to save the Golden Bell Clan.

928
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,460
With your current skills,

929
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,660
I'm afraid

930
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,260
you won't be able to save

931
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,060
even your own clan.

932
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,660
Actually, I want it very simple.

933
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,260
You just have to draw

934
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,260
the pattern of the Moon Zhaoyuan and the prison layout.

935
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,460
We are responsible for the fight.

936
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,860
You are responsible for saving people.

937
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,860
I promise you

938
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,860
that you will be safe and sound.

939
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,660
When the Northern Sect is killed,

940
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,060
we must drink and drink.

941
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,460
We will start with

942
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,060
the first-class wine and wine-making skill

943
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,460
to get into the river.

944
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,460
The second-class wine and wine-making skill

945
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,660
is the most relaxing place

946
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,460
in the prison.

947
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,060
We can get in there at that time.

948
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,860
Why are you here?

949
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,660
Are you going to save people or fight?

950
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,660
Hurry up.

951
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,060
I don't need your Dragon Clan to save me.

952
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,460
I don't need your Purple Clothes to save me.

953
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,460
I'm telling you.

954
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,460
I'm just willing to help you with the conditions.

955
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,860
Do you think I'm willing to save you?

956
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,260
If you don't want to live,

957
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,060
you'll die here.

958
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,060
You think I'm afraid of dying?

959
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,260
You're not capable of fighting.

960
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,260
Stop it.

961
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,460
Don't care.

962
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,460
Look.

963
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,060
If you don't protect them,

964
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,660
we'll all die in the Moon Zhaoyuan.

965
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,260
What do you want?

966
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,260
I need you.

967
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:38,860
Let go.

968
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,260
I need you.

969
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,660
Good.

970
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,260
I didn't expect you to be so ungrateful.

971
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,460
You're so ungrateful.

972
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,060
See?

973
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,660
His temper is bigger than yours.

974
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,260
I heard you're not afraid of dying.

975
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,460
He must be not afraid of hunger.

976
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,060
What a pity.

977
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,260
I prepared a roast chicken in the kitchen.

978
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,460
And a roast rabbit.

979
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,260
And a white noodles steamed bun.

980
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:16,860
I can't say it.

981
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,860
I feel hungry when I say it.

982
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,260
Where's the steamed bun?

983
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,860
Why did you bring the hot hands back?

984
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,260
You gave them money and energy on the way.

985
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,260
You asked them to leave.

986
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,860
If they're in trouble,

987
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,660
they'll expose the location of the village.

988
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,260
We'll play with them.

989
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,260
Besides,

990
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,860
you saw what they did to us.

991
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,260
Don't expect them to be grateful to you.

992
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,260
They're their own hands.

993
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,660
They'll die if they leave.

994
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,260
They'll die if they leave.

995
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,260
Alright.

996
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,260
What's the way to deal with it?

997
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,060
Talk to their village then.

998
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,060
Why?

999
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,460
I was thinking

1000
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,100
that

1001
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,060
I should poison them at all costs.

1002
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,260
What will they be?

1003
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,060
I think

1004
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,260
the tanemail in麗家和囚

1005
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,460
has already been a winner and winner.

1006
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,980
That's good.

1007
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,980
At least, it's better than now.

1008
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,140
The mess Lei Hong made

1009
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,940
can't be blamed on you.

1010
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,260
The moon is twinkling and the stars are falling.

1011
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,020
Maybe, in the future,

1012
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,940
the faraway states will turn into a piece of waste.

1013
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,140
I don't care at all.

1014
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,020
I don't care at all.

1015
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,380
Who can phase out the填兵?

1016
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,020
Deng Alba!

1017
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,500
Can't you just tell the whole world

1018
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,900
who came here?

1019
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,300
Are you still in the palace?

1020
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,500
Sorry?

1021
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,000
Well, my feet hurt so badly

1022
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,220
that I need some help.

1023
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,140
Deng improvements.

1024
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,140
I want to cover this

1025
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,140
Just cover it

1026
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,140
The opening in the deep

1027
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,140
3 2 1

1028
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,140
Start

1029
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,140
The edge of the edge of the edge

1030
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,140
Wait for the rush

1031
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,140
Looking for a dream

1032
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,140
Drink the wine and change it to sweet

1033
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,140
Your torch

1034
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,140
The fire is burning

1035
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,140
The fire is burning

1036
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,140
The fire is burning

1037
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,140
The fire is burning

1038
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:09,140
The fire is burning

1039
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:17,140
The viewing of the lantern

1040
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,140
We disappeared

1041
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:25,140
The destiny VR

1042
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,140
Let's go.

1043
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,140
One more.

1044
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,140
This way.

1045
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,140
I'll do it too.

1046
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,140
One more.

1047
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,140
One more.

1048
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,140
One more.

1049
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,140
One more.

1050
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,140
You're doing great.

1051
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,140
You're so good.

1052
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,140
Come on.

1053
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,140
This is the real you.

1054
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,140
I'm the real you.

1055
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,140
Look at him.

1056
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,140
Stand down.

1057
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,140
Look at his eyes.

1058
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,140
Even if we're just looking at each other,

1059
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,140
we'll never be together.

1060
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,140
Zhang Wei.

1061
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,140
Li Zhang Wei.

1062
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,140
Li Zhang Wei.

1063
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,140
All the friends in the village

1064
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,140
will be...

1065
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,140
Thank you for your kind words.

1066
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,140
You're the best.

1067
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,140
You're the best.

1068
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,140
Yes.

1069
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,140
What's wrong with you?

1070
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,140
Yes.

1071
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,140
You're the one who sent me here.

1072
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,140
But I'm sorry

1073
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,140
for what I did to you.

1074
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,140
Sorry.

1075
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,140
I want to ask you a question.

1076
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,140
Sorry for the noise.

1077
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,140
Okay.
