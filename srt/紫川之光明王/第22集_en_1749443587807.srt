1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid, I want to change myself!

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm afraid of you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid not?

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not afraid of you.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ou...

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm afraid of you.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not afraid of you.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,600
You can do it.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,900
I'll show you how I really feel changed.

25
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,500
Before catching a tiger,

26
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not afraid of you.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm afraid of you.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not afraid of you.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,760
across this stream.

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,320
Go and bury the brasilell resilient and battle with the vine.

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,960
Zhang Doherty.

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's stay out for two hours here.

33
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
Are you sure this is where the port is located?

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,280
intrigued by this lake body,

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,960
the most beautiful and perfect place.

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,080
It's different from other lakes.

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
It likes to live inside theestyle.

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,120
This is the cursed place

39
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,000
full of water and fresh water.

40
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,840
There are so many echelons.

41
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,700
They are all gathered here like this.

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,800
But if you don't have one here,

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,120
I seem lose.

44
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,820
quarto.

45
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,180
Arrest him.

46
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,440
I won't let him harm us anymore.

47
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,440
I'm not in need of it.

48
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
I'll use the water of the mountains to wash it.

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
The water of the mountains will nourish the beauty.

50
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
I would have been so tired.

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,440
I asked Luo Jie and the others to come help me.

52
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Where are you?

53
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
Lin Yu.

54
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
Hurry.

55
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Come here.

56
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
What are you looking at?

57
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Kick me if you want to reach the mountain.

58
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,560
powerless

59
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,440
It turned out that no one is walked on the bookshelf.

60
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,140
I really am forgetful and careless.

61
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,280
I was lucky as God didn't make any mistake.

62
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,340
It doesn't matter if you are very lucky or mine?

63
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,340
Anyway, thank you so much.

64
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,340
It's not worth mentioning.

65
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,340
Looks like we're really going to say goodbye this time.

66
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,340
Where's the mountain top? I'll give it to you.

67
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,340
Or I'll let someone else give it to you.

68
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,340
No need.

69
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,340
It's okay.

70
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,340
Thank you so much this time, Gao Ren.

71
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,340
Gao Ren?

72
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,340
I'm just a normal Zhang A-san.

73
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,340
You're so humble.

74
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,340
You can enter the capital like a nobody.

75
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,340
You can travel far away from the north.

76
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,340
I didn't expect that the famous Prince of Guangming

77
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,340
is the one who wears the three-leafed silk.

78
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,340
You're so admirable.

79
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,340
You can re-enact the military power with the Emperor of the Dragon.

80
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,340
You can also take the long journey to the faraway land.

81
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,340
The young master of the Liu Feng family, the commander of the Hundred-month Army,

82
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,340
Liu Feng Shuang.

83
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,340
I'm glad to hear that.

84
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,340
Brother San, I have a question that I want to ask you for a long time.

85
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,340
You go ahead.

86
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,340
As a soldier, why did you fight?

87
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,340
Why did I fight?

88
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,340
For those who love me and the people I love,

89
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,340
I'm not afraid of being seen by the good things I treasure.

90
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,340
I'm sure that there are many suitable things in this world.

91
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,340
I will use my life to defend them.

92
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,340
What about you?

93
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,340
Why did you fight again?

94
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,340
You fought for your faith.

95
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,340
And I fought for the Liu Feng family.

96
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,340
If the whole family needs sacrifice,

97
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,340
I would also be willing to die.

98
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,340
If we meet at the battlefield the other day,

99
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,340
please don't be so sad.

100
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,340
If we really leave this time,

101
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,340
we will die here.

102
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,340
There is a chance to regret.

103
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,340
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,340
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,340
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,340
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,340
I'm sorry.

110
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,340
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,340
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,340
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,340
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,340
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,340
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,340
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,340
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,340
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,340
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,340
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,340
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,340
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,340
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,340
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,340
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,340
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,340
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,340
If you continue to be so desperate,

132
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,340
you will lose your life if you can't wait for the god to stop.

133
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,340
Don't stand here anymore.

134
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,340
Before you prove my innocence,

135
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,340
I will never be honest.

136
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,340
Your Highness.

137
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
Ma Wei.

138
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,340
I'm fine.

139
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,340
This place is cold.

140
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,340
It's not where you came from.

141
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,340
Go back.

142
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,340
If you want to prove your innocence,

143
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,340
you should live well first.

144
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
Your Highness.

145
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,340
Your Highness.

146
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
Don't beg me.

147
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,340
I'm just a sacrifice.

148
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,340
Actually, we are similar in some places.

149
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,340
You were kicked out by the josses.

150
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,340
I was kicked out by the three provinces.

151
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,340
You were kicked out by the people of An'an.

152
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,340
I was kicked out by the josses.

153
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
Look.

154
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,340
Is it the same?

155
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,340
So, you didn't do anything about the corruption?

156
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,340
Is the answer important?

157
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,340
Because I didn't tell them the answer.

158
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,340
They did!

159
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,340
Of course, it's important.

160
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
I don't believe that in Zichuan,

161
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,340
someone can get the place where they can be held back and defend themselves.

162
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
The truth is,

163
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,340
as long as we can investigate,

164
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,340
he will be able to get the place where he can be held back.

165
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,340
I'm very grateful that you came here.

166
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,340
But you are a member of the Jiao clan.

167
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,340
You still have a lot of things to worry about.

168
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,340
You don't have to worry about me.

169
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,340
Zichuan,

170
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,340
if I can sell it, I will sell it.

171
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,340
I can't sell it.

172
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,340
I said I can't sell it.

173
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
I don't want to save it.

174
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,340
Don't be sad, Ni'er.

175
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,340
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,340
I've made a mistake.

177
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
But I'm thinking about it.

178
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,340
I'm thinking about having a name that can be called by you.

179
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,340
Ning'er.

180
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,340
Ni'er.

181
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,340
Ni'er.

182
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,340
Ni'er.

183
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
Ni'er.

184
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,340
I'm afraid I won't have a chance to sell it.

185
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
There's no chance to sell it.

186
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
Don't say that.

187
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,340
I've been a coward for my whole life.

188
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,340
I have a regret.

189
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,340
But I have only one.

190
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,340
I've always been a girl.

191
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,340
She's smart and obedient.

192
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,340
She's cute.

193
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,340
She's a good girl.

194
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,340
She's always been a good girl.

195
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,340
She's a good girl.

196
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,340
She's a good girl.

197
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,340
She's a good girl.

198
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,340
She's a good girl.

199
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,340
Don't say that.

200
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,340
I'm going to say it.

201
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,340
I won't have a chance to sell it.

202
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,340
My woman is.

203
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,340
I'll take her by my side.

204
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,340
Your embarrassing name.

205
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,340
I'll take it.

206
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,340
I'll do it so that you can tell me what you're up to.

207
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,340
I'll take it.

208
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,340
Please stop.

209
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,340
Unless she really feels a sense of Responsibility Aoki Saki.

210
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:53,340
Lord Ning is probably not a criminal nor the wife of a brave girl.

211
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,180
I won't be suffering anymore...

212
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,500
I won't have courage to tell the truth.

213
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,500
Protect...

214
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:03,960
Ma Wei!

215
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:29,340
If you are really innocent, the truth will definitely be revealed.

216
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,340
This won't be the last time.

217
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,340
I am already the criminal of the Shuling Temple!

218
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,340
The heir of the Three Kingdoms!

219
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,340
No one will be willing to prove my innocence!

220
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,340
There's another person.

221
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,340
I'll be the only one who can prove my innocence!

222
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,340
Before I prove my innocence,

223
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,340
the only thing you have to do is to continue living.

224
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,760
Ok?

225
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,340
Great.

226
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,300
Hi.

227
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,540
He has passed away.

228
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,820
I'll send you home.

229
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,580
No.

230
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,300
I'm going to our Commander.

231
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,100
To secret the throne?

232
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:37,220
the

233
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
I think you'd better not interfere in this matter

234
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,220
if you really believe in the truth.

235
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,220
Your Highness Ning, you're going back?

236
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
Yes.

237
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,220
Yes.

238
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,220
Do we have any other way?

239
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,220
Yes.

240
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,220
The air force, the commander of the Baoshuai,

241
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,220
the Mawei Division,

242
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,220
the Three provinces' Taishi Division,

243
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,220
you know that too.

244
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,220
Mawei is a member of the Three provinces' Taishi Division,

245
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,220
but it's full of people,

246
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,220
and it's full of people,

247
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,220
and it's a very important act.

248
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,220
It should be punished by the people.

249
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,220
The Three provinces' Taishi Division is not good at managing it,

250
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,220
and it's not able to investigate it as soon as possible.

251
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,220
It should be punished by the people.

252
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,220
What kind of punishment is it?

253
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,220
The Three provinces' Taishi Division

254
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:21,220
is sentenced to death.

255
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,220
The Xiangguan people are all under control.

256
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,220
Yes.

257
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,220
We've turned the Mawei Division over.

258
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
We found the secret room.

259
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,220
We've found a account book.

260
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,220
We've recorded all the money in Ba Yun.

261
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,220
Most of the members of the Three provinces' Taishi Division are in the secret room.

262
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,220
We've found the evidence.

263
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,220
They're in the middle.

264
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,220
Go to the Shuli Division

265
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,220
and tell the commander of the division.

266
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,220
Yes.

267
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,220
What's wrong?

268
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,220
My Lord.

269
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,220
My Lord.

270
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,220
My Lord, please go over to your room.

271
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
Go!

272
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
Go!

273
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,220
Go!

274
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,220
Go!

275
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Go!

276
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,220
Go!

277
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,220
Go!

278
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,220
Go!

279
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,220
Go!

280
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,220
Go!

281
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,220
Go!

282
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
Go!

283
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,220
Come on!

284
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,220
We'll take the money.

285
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,220
We'll take the money.

286
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,220
Let's say it's okay.

287
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
Today, we'll use the money.

288
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,220
You'll use the money.

289
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,220
I'll give you 20.

290
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,220
You'll have to pay.

291
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,220
I'll pay.

292
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
10 of them.

293
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,220
I'll pay too.

294
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,220
Go!

295
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,220
Go!

296
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,220
Go!

297
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,220
Go!

298
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,220
Go!

299
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,220
Go!

300
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,220
Go!

301
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,220
I'll pay.

302
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,220
Again.

303
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,220
Go!

304
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,220
Go!

305
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,220
My Lord, look.

306
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,220
Pang Xi won the whole division.

307
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,220
Just like you.

308
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,220
I'm not good at it.

309
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,220
I've kept my underwear and socks.

310
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,220
It's really a good idea to have a good time.

311
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,220
Tao Er.

312
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,220
You're exactly the same as you expected.

313
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,220
Go!

314
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,220
Go!

315
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,220
Go!

316
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,220
The whole army is unfair.

317
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,220
Why not?

318
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,220
I won the whole division.

319
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,220
Right?

320
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
Yes.

321
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
In our city, potatoes are very expensive.

322
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
I'll pay 5 potatoes.

323
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,220
It's equal to you.

324
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,220
20 of them.

325
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,220
But from the number,

326
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,220
it's less than you.

327
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
If you say so,

328
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,220
I'm not a bad guy.

329
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,220
I paid 20 potatoes.

330
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,220
But you paid 5 potatoes.

331
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,220
You're unreasonable.

332
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,220
Why don't you say it?

333
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,220
I don't understand.

334
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,220
Stop it.

335
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,220
I thought

336
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,220
it's okay to use the same thing.

337
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,220
But I didn't expect it to be the same thing.

338
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,220
It's different in our cities.

339
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,220
Right.

340
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,220
If you're not mistaken,

341
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,220
the local city is a different city.

342
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,220
But it's not expensive here.

343
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,220
It seems that we can't open the bureau today.

344
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,220
Who said that?

345
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,220
Let's find a person who is familiar with the city.

346
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,220
It's the same value.

347
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,220
Isn't it?

348
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,220
For example,

349
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,220
this gold steel stone,

350
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,220
it belongs to the western-owned mines.

351
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,220
It's really expensive.

352
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,220
Your 10 kerosene coins,

353
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,220
my 10-core corn,

354
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,220
your 10-car coal coal.

355
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,220
Right.

356
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,220
Everyone lives with gold and stone.

357
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,220
It's not unfair.

358
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,220
Right.

359
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,220
Everyone knows that

360
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,220
this potato

361
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,220
is the richest coal in the area of ​​Yuanzhou.

362
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,220
It's obviously the same potato.

363
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,220
In your area, there are only two coins.

364
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,220
In my area, there are only five corn.

365
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,220
But if you want to buy five corn from two coins,

366
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,220
you can't buy it directly.

367
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,220
Our trading is always like this.

368
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,220
Instead, it's better to trade with the north.

369
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,220
What do you mean?

370
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,220
Do you want us to go back to the north again?

371
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,220
I'm just mentioning my opinion.

372
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,220
What do you mean?

373
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,220
We are all from the city,

374
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,220
we have our own plan and plan.

375
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
We have to control the north

376
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,220
to control the communication and trading between us.

377
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
In this way, we can work with them

378
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,220
in our territory

379
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,220
and work with them.

380
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,220
So,

381
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,220
each city uses a similar currency.

382
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,220
One potato is in your city.

383
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,220
Your city.

384
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,220
Your city.

385
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,220
Or your city.

386
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,220
It's only two coins.

387
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,220
Then we can bet on one table.

388
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,220
Right?

389
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,220
Yes.

390
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,220
What you mean is

391
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
we can bet on one table.

392
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
Yes.

393
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,220
I found out that

394
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,220
the trading between the black market

395
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,220
and the black market

396
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,220
was used by the capital city.

397
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,220
In fact, every city has its own currency.

398
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,220
The capital city has a stable value.

399
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,220
So it's the most suitable

400
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,220
to use to make a total currency.

401
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,220
Yes.

402
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,220
Yes.

403
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,220
Yes.

404
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,220
Yes.

405
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,220
Yes.

406
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,220
Yes.

407
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,220
Yes.

408
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,220
I think it's okay.

409
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,220
Yes.

410
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,220
It's okay.

411
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,220
But the capital city is big and small.

412
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,220
I said it's big and he said it's small.

413
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,220
We'll fight it out.

414
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
So,

415
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,220
the total currency is the first step.

416
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,220
Then,

417
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,220
we have to control the trading between us.

418
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,220
We have to change the system.

419
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,220
We can control the economy and the system.

420
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,220
Then Yuan Zhou can be independent.

421
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,220
How do we know?

422
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,220
You're the next emperor.

423
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,220
Yes.

424
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,220
The emperor

425
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,220
will only hold the power

426
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,220
in his own hands.

427
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,220
In the future,

428
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,220
Yuan Zhou will hold the power in everyone's hands.

429
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,220
As for what the future Yuan Zhou will look like,

430
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,220
it's not what I said alone.

431
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,220
But what the city leaders do

432
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,220
represents the people of every city

433
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,220
and the people of all cities.

434
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,220
Yes.

435
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,220
You're right.

436
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,220
I agree.

437
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
If Yuan Zhou is forever

438
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,220
the tribe of Lin Sui,

439
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,220
then he will never be able to stand up.

440
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,220
Yes.

441
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,220
Yes.

442
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,220
You're right.

443
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,220
I'll go to the King of Light.

444
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,220
I'm the city leader of Ke'er.

445
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,220
I agree.

446
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,220
I hope the King of Light

447
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,220
can follow your promise

448
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,220
and not let down the hope.

449
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,220
I'll go to the King of Light.

450
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,220
Please have a seat.

451
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,220
The princess has taken your prescription.

452
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,220
She has been sweating for several nights.

453
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,220
I think

454
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,220
you're not fit to take care of the princess.

455
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,220
You may leave now.

456
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,220
It's all my fault.

457
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,220
I'll leave now,

458
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
and won't let the princess go.

459
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,220
Zhao Li has two houses.

460
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,220
It's just that

461
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,220
and other doctors from the hospital.

462
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,220
My lord always tried to find the wrong place

463
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,220
to make them leave.

464
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,220
This is not a long-term plan.

465
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,220
The princess is in a hurry.

466
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,220
The time is different.

467
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,220
She needs to make arrangements.

468
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,220
I have some arrangements.

469
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
You may leave.

470
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,220
General, the Black Sniper Army is here.

471
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,220
Why are you here?

472
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,220
Be careful, my lord.

473
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,220
Don't be afraid.

474
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,220
Of course.

475
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,220
Don't worry.

476
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,220
The doctor said that

477
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,220
the doctors and doctors from the hospital

478
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,220
are usually not suitable for the princess.

479
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,220
The emperor is worried.

480
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,220
He is worried that the princess might be hiding something.

481
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,220
So he asked me to come and see.

482
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,220
Thank you, my lord.

483
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
and the military officials.

484
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,220
The princess is fine.

485
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,220
She needs to take care of my doctor.

486
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,220
I need to know the situation

487
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,220
after the princess is buried.

488
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,220
I need to ask the doctor

489
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,220
to arrange the suitable doctor.

490
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,220
Of course.

491
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,220
But...

492
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,220
The princess just fell asleep.

493
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,220
It's okay.

494
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,220
I can tell the princess

495
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,220
to be buried with the silk thread.

496
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,220
My lord.

497
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,220
What's the problem?

498
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,220
Yun Qianxue is guilty.

499
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,220
I hope you can save me

500
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,220
in front of the emperor.

501
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,220
Tell me.

502
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,220
The doctors and doctors

503
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,220
didn't make a mistake.

504
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,220
I set her up on purpose.

505
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,220
I framed her.

506
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,220
You are worried that

507
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,220
the two princes are not in the same family.

508
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,220
You are afraid of hurting others.

509
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,220
You are afraid of hurting others?

510
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,220
You can't do that.

511
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,220
General Yulin is thinking about the situation.

512
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,220
I can't tell the emperor about this.

513
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,220
There is only one thing.

514
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,220
Please tell me.

515
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,220
The mortal world

516
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,220
is in danger of the princess.

517
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
Please take the old man.

518
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,220
It's too hard for General Yulin.

519
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,220
I can't hide it

520
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,220
from you.

521
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
Princess.

522
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,220
Don't worry about it.

523
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,220
Just take good care of yourself.

524
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,220
Leave the rest to me.

525
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,220
I have a way.

526
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,220
Even if it's a law,

527
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,220
you can't find out the truth

528
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,220
and abuse the criminal.

529
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,220
Lord Yulin didn't abuse the criminal.

530
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,220
I am willing to be in jail.

531
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,220
This time, I am willing to be in jail.

532
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,220
Only the criminal can resist the crime.

533
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,220
It's a crime.

534
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,220
A crime?

535
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,220
You are a criminal

536
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,220
who has been in jail for a long time.

537
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,220
You know the crime.

538
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,220
What you have done

539
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,220
is not a crime.

540
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,220
Take the witness.

541
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,220
Lord Yulin

542
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,220
Lord Yulin, the evidence is a lie.

543
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,220
The evidence is all burned.

544
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,220
Including the report.

545
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,220
I know.

546
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,220
There is no evidence.

547
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,220
So you are here to make a scene.

548
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,220
You are here to hide the truth.

549
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,220
It's okay.

550
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,220
I admit that

551
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,220
I did know the truth

552
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,220
for the paper.

553
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,220
The law is serious.

554
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,220
If I don't repeat the paper,

555
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,220
the scene will be ruined.

556
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,220
The consequences will be dire.

557
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,220
But according to the investigation,

558
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,220
the paper is useless.

559
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,220
It's a personal matter.

560
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,220
When I was investigating this,

561
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,220
Lord Luo always wrote me down.

562
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,220
Lord Luo is a witness.

563
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,220
I did find something.

564
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,220
But it's just a piece of paper.

565
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,220
It's not the evidence

566
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,220
of the book of the Emperor.

567
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,220
The paper didn't fall to the truth.

568
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,220
It's because the Wanyun land is badly damaged.

569
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,220
I want to promote the government

570
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,220
to do a lot of money management work

571
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,220
and human affairs.

572
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,220
If it's like this,

573
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,220
you can control me.

574
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,220
I have no money.

575
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,220
I wonder

576
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,220
how the law and justice of this village

577
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,220
are related to it.

578
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,220
Lord Dinglin,

579
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,220
do you think

580
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,220
I can't bear to go back

581
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,220
or to the Three Kingdoms?

582
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,220
Do you think that

583
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,220
the Three Kingdoms

584
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,220
are really the masters?

585
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,220
Do you know

586
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,220
what the law and justice of this village is?

587
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,220
I don't know.

588
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,220
I'm not sure.

589
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,220
I'm not sure.

590
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,220
I'm not sure.

591
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,220
I'm not sure.

592
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,220
I'm not sure.

593
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,220
I'm not sure.

594
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,220
I'm not sure.

595
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,220
I'm not sure.

596
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,220
But I, Shulisi,

597
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,220
have always been a law and justice

598
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,220
to protect the Zichuan family.

599
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,220
It's because of this law and justice,

600
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,220
that I can't go back now.

601
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,220
I can't go back.

602
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,220
As for the Three Kingdoms,

603
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,220
the family used to supervise the operation of the operation.

604
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,220
Does it have anything to do with Shulisi?

605
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,220
Shulisi only cares about what Shulisi should care about.

606
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,220
It's always been like this.

607
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,220
It's even more like this in the future.

608
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,220
I have something else to say.

609
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,220
Although it has proved my innocence,

610
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,220
I'm not a coward when I'm in the house.

611
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,220
There's another reason.

612
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,220
And this reason

613
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,220
is related to the three Kingdoms' first meal, Xiao Pin.

614
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,220
You!

615
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,220
Xiao Pin is the first meal of the Three Kingdoms.

616
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,220
But he's a criminal.

617
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,220
He's been a criminal for thousands of years.

618
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,220
In order to raise the army,

619
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,220
you have to take advantage of the money.

620
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,220
When you work together,

621
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,220
you should listen to your relatives.

622
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,220
You should keep your promise.

623
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,220
I've heard about it before.

624
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,220
I've heard about it.

625
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,220
I've heard about it.

626
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,220
But I'm not sure.

627
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,220
So I don't dare to say it.

628
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,220
Until this time, I'll be in jail.

629
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,220
That's the final decision.

630
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,220
Just now, Lord Lin Kang Kai and I

631
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,220
were in a hurry.

632
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,220
You're so fair and fair.

633
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,220
Please investigate this matter deeply.

634
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,220
You'll be in great danger.

635
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,220
You!

636
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,220
Ma Wei!

637
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,220
You're a fool!

638
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
Do you have evidence?

639
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,220
There's no wall that can't be opened.

640
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,220
The world is a wall.

641
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,220
You can only do that.

642
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,220
You can only do that.

643
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:23,220
It's huge.

644
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,220
Do you want to remove this,amento?

645
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,720
Prince Li.

646
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
I have nothing committed for you.

647
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,220
Really?

648
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,420
All of it,

649
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,480
I'll get you water

650
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
Go

651
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,460
Sorry, earlier this time better us

652
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,020
more than fighting

653
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,040
this time

654
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,160
Not bad

655
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,600
His company was very noble

656
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,660
He doesn't allow me to redeem

657
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,640
Good

658
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,540
You spent so many days

659
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,300
Only have a chance to be monochrome

660
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,420
After the fall of mygos

661
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,240
I went to Xiao Ping mansion

662
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,220
But he just can't get out of the door and doesn't see me.

663
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,220
So who saved you from this?

664
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
Greetings, Your Excellency.

665
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,220
Greetings, Your Highness.

666
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
Thank you, Your Excellency.

667
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,220
I've heard that many people have been talking about me.

668
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:24,220
They say that I'm very smart since I was a child.

669
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,220
Look at this.

670
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:32,220
I've been studying for a long time, but I still can't solve it.

671
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,220
It's a pity that I made this mistake.

672
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,220
I just made a mistake and it became a waste.

673
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,220
Which word are you talking about?

674
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,220
This word.

675
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,220
Although I can put it here to cut off the white paper,

676
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,220
but I also messed up the layout of the family.

677
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,220
I will eventually become a playboy.

678
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,220
It's a pity that I can't get it back.

679
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,220
You can't.

680
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,220
Qi and Qi Zi are all made by humans.

681
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,220
Qi is also made by humans.

682
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,220
What do you think?

683
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:33,220
If that Qi Zi can fulfill her destiny,

684
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,220
she will surely make a way out.

685
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,220
If she does,

686
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,220
she will be the one to blame.

687
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,220
Please sit.

688
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,220
I've made Qi Zi's life.

689
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220
I'll make her my wife.

690
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,220
I'll make her my wife.

691
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,220
I'll make her my wife.

692
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,220
I'll make her my wife.

693
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,220
I'll make her my wife.

694
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,220
The three provinces' imperial court is in a state of disdain.

695
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,220
The central security of the state is in a state of disdain.

696
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,220
The people are not well-off.

697
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,220
The county is in a state of disdain.

698
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,220
The subordinates are waiting to be handled.

699
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,220
The horse-drawn meal is a good thing for the young.

700
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,220
Today, the throne is decorated with three different performances of Heaven up setting.

701
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,220
We request the Commander's Guards and three provinces

702
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:45,800
to take their meals on the

703
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,940
You have pulled your hand over,

704
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,580
you areittaing at the right time.

705
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,260
I feel like the capital is

706
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:25,980
like your palm

707
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,420
is in a strange line.

708
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,140
The family

709
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,860
is capable of doing this.

710
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,380
Are you talking about

711
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,980
Lord Junzhang?

712
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,540
The alliance with Longming Hai

713
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,620
is too much.

714
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,540
Now,

715
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,820
not only did they break

716
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,180
their only alliance,

717
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,860
but also found

718
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,060
their own power

719
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,900
in the Three Realms.

720
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,420
Lord Junzhang

721
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,020
is so heartless.

722
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,700
Now,

723
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,380
Zichuan is even more confused.

724
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,380
You

725
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,780
should be more careful.

726
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,460
Thank you.

727
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,180
Thank you.

728
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,340
My lord.

729
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,940
I have Pizza without long career.

730
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,260
They gave me the right to chance at back yard.

731
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,380
Just as the horse didn't let me leave here for washing.

732
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,380
They also asked me to become

733
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,180
the boss's chief fries.

734
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,060
Desperate End

735
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,400
Wu Ai

736
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,060
Wu Pu

737
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,000
However,

738
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,100
Don't say trash.

739
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,980
My father

740
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,420
thrown word

741
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,140
on the court.

742
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,180
It's done.

743
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,740
Anyway, we'll have a drink out!

744
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,340
It's controlling the wohl.

745
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,940
It's just a partisan rebel!

746
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,660
provides for us,

747
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,700
for us to carry out both our efforts as well!

748
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,660
Zi Chuan's got better in sickness,

749
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,680
right out of the blue!

750
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,940
All of you

751
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:56,140
I can clearly

752
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,940
If I'm a mermaid

753
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,940
If I'm a mermaid

754
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,940
Peipei

755
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,940
Come again

756
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,940
You're already in the big storm

757
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,940
I'm sorry

758
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,940
Sorry

759
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:10,940
Don't panic

760
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:11,940
It's okay

761
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,940
It's the same

762
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,940
The silk and gold coins in Zichuan are getting more and more difficult to pass

763
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,940
No, it's getting better

764
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,940
It's here

765
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,940
It's here

766
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,940
It's here

767
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,940
It's here

768
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,940
It's here

769
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,940
It's here

770
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,940
It's here

771
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,940
It's too big

772
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:31,940
It's here

773
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,940
Sorry, you fell

774
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,940
Sorry

775
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,940
I'm sorry

776
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,940
The floor is not in the middle

777
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,940
This is the stone

778
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,940
This one

779
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,940
Sorry

780
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,940
Sorry, I'm too strong
