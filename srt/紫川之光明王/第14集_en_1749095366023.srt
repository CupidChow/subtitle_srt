1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll sit up straight.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
An endless spread of freedom.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The Grand Chamberlain

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Episode 32

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Take a look over there.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
You two, over there.

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,760
After them!

22
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,240
Here!

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,720
After them!

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,720
Go!

25
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,720
General.

26
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm here to eat.

27
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,480
You can come.

28
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,640
General.

29
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,800
Are you all right?

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,640
Run

31
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,600
About you

32
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,440
Chang YOU

33
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,160
Why did you want to come in so late?

34
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,920
Chang YOU

35
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,280
What's so special about you?

36
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,600
Chang YOU

37
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,880
What is it?

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's finally time to go back to the old house.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The grain hasn't been harvested yet.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But the grain is gone.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Even the sword is gone.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm doomed.

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's okay.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I...

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What?

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The King of Kadoan is coming to the capital to fight?

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's not cute at all.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Tell me.

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yuan Zhou has attacked Wen Yi.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He's very strong.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
When I'm done here,

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll ask him to come here.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
My Lord.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Are we not going to be full?

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We must win the battle of Xiangyang.

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So we can tell the King of Qin.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Where's my money?

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's here.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There are 50,000 in the palace.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The battle of Wen Xiang is over.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We'll take down the temple.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I didn't expect the same Ma Feng Wo.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Just to deal with the plan of their development,

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
they wasted too much of our strength.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They even planned to take the capital.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Tell the army to leave immediately.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Attack the Bulu Village.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Kill the King of Kadoan.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The little group is still searching for the Wuzi.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm afraid they can't keep up.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Report.

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm taking 50,000 soldiers from the north.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The Bulu Village is coming.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It looks like it's going to attack the city.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't panic.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Fortunately, before you left,

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
you left this beautiful scenery.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Head-shape?

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Next time, we must...

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We must...

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No one is in the way.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What's the name of Lord Guangming?

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Lord Guangming has many tricks.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He's making a fuss again.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Watch your eyes.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Watch your eyes.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm the first general of Lord Guangming.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I represent the whole Bulu Village.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Head-shape.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Come out.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What tricks do you want to play?

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
My Lord.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I want to know too.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Lord Guangming heard about Lord Lu Di.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You lost 50,000 soldiers and attacked the Bulu Village.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You left the city last night.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Other people know Lord Guangming left.

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They all ran away.

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's all the old and weak

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
who are left in the village.

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We know Lord Guangming can't resist.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Instead of playing with him,

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
we should think about it.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I hope you can be strong and strong.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We'll give you the Bulu Village.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Don't move.

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
My Lord.

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Open the gate.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You may enter the city.

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
My Lord.

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It seems that there's nothing to do with it.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We have a horse with us.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Even if Lord Guangming set up a trap,

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
we're not afraid of him.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't move.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Brothers.

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's start our performance.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Stop.

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You have to be careful.

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He won't believe you if you play with him.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
My Lord.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The Bulu Village is back.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You won't resist.

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You may enter the city.

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
My Lord.

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
My Lord.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What did you hear?

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't move.

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Open the gate.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
My Lord.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
My Lord.

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There's a soldier outside the city.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's go in now.

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's the Bulu Village.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
My Lord, you're wise.

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Be careful.

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't know where Lord Guangming is.

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I can only trick the beast

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
with such a low-key method.

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I won't be fooled.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
My Lord.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What should we do now?

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We've won.

145
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What?

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's all.

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I've broken Lord Guangming's little sword.

148
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We've won.

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's wait for them to calm down.

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
My Lord.

151
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
My Lord.

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
My Lord.

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
My Lord.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
My Lord.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
My Lord.

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
My Lord.

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
My Lord.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
My Lord.

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
My Lord.

160
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
My Lord.

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
My Lord.

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
My Lord.

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
My Lord.

164
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
My Lord.

165
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
My Lord.

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's so cold.

167
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The army of the Bulu Village is really weak.

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It seems that

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
it won't be a success for now.

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's really hard to be fooled

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
by his subordinates.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm willing to be in the capital

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
but I can't be in the Bulu Village.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Lord Guangming is indeed the king.

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Lord Guangming?

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's right.

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But this matter

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
hasn't been informed by the imperial court yet.

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's the news that my scout came back.

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The lord of Guangming

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
always wears a mask

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and leads all the tribes in the Far North.

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But his identity

184
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
hasn't been found out yet.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you didn't report it to the imperial court,

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
do you think that Guangming...

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm not sure.

188
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But wearing a mask and making a fuss

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
is like that kid.

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He's quite good at playing now.

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No.

192
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Even if he's really Lord Guangming,

193
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
he's a good friend of the Bulu Clan.

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He's still a traitor

195
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
to the family.

196
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So

197
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
this isn't a good news.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
By the way,

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
look at this.

200
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The Liu Feng Clan?

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This is the letter from Liu Feng Ming.

202
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's called Liu Feng Shuang.

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's a traitor.

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If it wasn't for their family's internal chaos,

205
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I wouldn't have made it so smoothly.

206
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's said that Liu Feng Shuang

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
planned to escape from the Zichuan from the Liu Feng Clan.

208
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He asked us to keep an eye on his whereabouts.

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If we catch Liu Feng Shuang,

210
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
they'll be willing to open up and fight for nothing.

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
They won't be able to fight with Zichuan for three years.

212
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's too unambitious.

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
According to the current situation,

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
they can't do anything

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
in three years.

216
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But no matter what,

217
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
we have to find him first.

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
By then,

219
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
we'll use him to exchange for peace

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
or to take the initiative

221
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
to look at our intentions.

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So,

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
do you have any news about him?

224
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I received the letter this morning.

225
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But two days ago,

226
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
my scout was outside the city

227
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and found the trace of the Black Tiger Gang.

228
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Black Tiger Gang?

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Is that the killer group of the Liu Feng Clan?

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's right.

231
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That means

232
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
they didn't stop Liu Feng Shuang.

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's very possible.

234
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Liu Feng Shuang

235
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
has entered the map.

236
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Liu Feng Shuang,

237
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
a woman,

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
a fierce and fierce appearance,

239
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
a good-looking and strong martial art,

240
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and if there are any witnesses,

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
they'll be rewarded.

242
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It seems that Zichuan family

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
has some misunderstandings for you.

244
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The cause and effect of the explosion

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
is their biggest misunderstanding.

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Every victory of ours

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
is very positive.

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I really can't bear to see such a miracle.

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But it seems

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
they already know

251
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
we're in the capital.

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Black Tiger Gang may know it too.

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I think

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
we should go first.

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We must take Zichuan

256
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
to the Lin family.

257
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And we must buy medicine to cure the wounds.

258
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The capital is the best choice.

259
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And there are many people in the capital.

260
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not a matter of time

261
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
for Black Tiger Gang to find us.

262
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But I'm sure the capital inn

263
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
is now in danger.

264
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Where are we going?

265
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let me ask you.

266
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If Zichuan family

267
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
has the right to attack a woman,

268
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
where will she

269
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
be the most vulnerable?

270
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Mr. Peng,

271
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
it's a surprise.

272
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You've done a good job

273
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
with the flower pot today.

274
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Long time no see.

275
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Sister Mingyue

276
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
is the head of Chunfeng Garden.

277
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Why do you care about the name of the flower pot?

278
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Who?

279
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's you.

280
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You owe me money.

281
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How dare you come here?

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm here.

283
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Come with me.

284
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Didn't you run away from Zichuan?

285
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The whole capital is attacking you now.

286
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
How dare you come back?

287
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You're dead.

288
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What are you doing this time?

289
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Sister Mingyue,

290
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I told you

291
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
that I want you to help me

292
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
find a boss

293
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
who sells food.

294
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Be careful.

295
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He's a big boss.

296
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That simple?

297
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes.

298
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Fine.

299
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But you have to wait a while.

300
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Today is the day

301
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I choose the flower pot.

302
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
After I choose the flower pot,

303
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'll arrange it for you.

304
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Okay.

305
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'll be here

306
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
waiting for Sister Mingyue to come back.

307
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Okay.

308
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Two people?

309
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Why don't you live in the inn?

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Can I ask you something?

311
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Did you see the room?

312
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You can stay there tonight.

313
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What's wrong?

314
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Let's go.

318
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This place is quite bad.

319
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But it's safe.

320
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Nothing special.

321
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Let's go.

322
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Move it.

323
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Why is it here?

324
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No color?

325
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Why?

326
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Why did you use it?

327
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Why then?

328
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm afraid that

329
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
you just realized

330
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
that thì

331
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,720
Maybe it's because of my behavior.

332
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,680
Will it be leaked?

333
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,440
Then shall we go somewhere else?

334
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,960
No need.

335
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,200
You go to the interview room first.

336
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,160
I'll go in and check.

337
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,960
Okay.

338
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,920
Then be careful.

339
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,160
He's interested in this kind of thing.

340
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,960
Old man, young man.

341
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,680
As long as you come, it's a lesson.

342
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,920
Everyone who is sitting here today

343
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,400
is so lucky.

344
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,640
There is one girl in our village.

345
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,680
The other one.

346
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,000
All of them are here.

347
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Today is the day

348
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,960
when our village is full of flowers every month.

349
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,440
If you like any girl,

350
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,680
you can give her a lot of money.

351
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,480
The girl in our village

352
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,960
doesn't love anything else.

353
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,840
She loves money.

354
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,640
On the other hand,

355
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,520
the girl who has the most money

356
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,560
in front of her is the girl

357
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,840
who is the flower girl

358
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,400
in our village.

359
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,920
The one who has the most money

360
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,400
is the one

361
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,520
who has the chance to

362
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,640
share the money with the flower girl.

363
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,160
She is so happy.

364
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,320
The flower girl is starting.

365
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,640
She's traveling.

366
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,240
Good girl.

367
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,360
She is really cool.

368
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,840
Only she is an actress now.

369
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,880
They are so happy.

370
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,000
Therefore,

371
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,800
she is the one Who comes every day.

372
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,080
Let's go.

373
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,040
Let's go.

374
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,680
Let's go.

375
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,260
Let's go.

376
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,240
Let's go.

377
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
Let's go.

378
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,360
Let's go.

379
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,240
Come here.

380
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,280
It's me.

381
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Zhang Ah San.

382
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,240
What are you doing?

383
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,920
Go, go.

384
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,120
I'll help you heal them.

385
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,240
Hide first.

386
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,080
How can I hide here?

387
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
Just stay with them.

388
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,000
It'll be better if you stay with them.

389
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,040
Hurry, hurry.

390
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,640
Go.

391
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,960
I'll send you there first.

392
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,400
What's this?

393
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,600
It's so dark.

394
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,520
It's so dark.

395
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,200
What's this?

396
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm sorry, we don't mind.

397
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,560
We can go out.

398
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,840
It's fine.

399
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,600
We won't force Kid's heart to follow me here.

400
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,000
It's fine.

401
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,400
Anything can be done.

402
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,320
See?

403
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,000
It's fine.

404
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,440
It was five o'clock o'clock.

405
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,400
The elevator has до blocks at last.

406
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,400
Stop.

407
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,360
What are you doing?

408
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,280
Don't touch mine.

409
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,400
Tools.

410
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,360
What are you doing?

411
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,960
There was indeed a girl wearing a suit.

412
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,760
She went out from here.

413
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,360
Are you sure?

414
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,960
I'm sure.

415
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,160
Let's go.

416
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Take care, Ji Weiyan.

417
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,160
Good.

418
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,760
Good.

419
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,160
Good.

420
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,360
Good.

421
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,760
Good.

422
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Good.

423
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,360
I announce that today's chosen girl is...

424
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,960
It must be A Yu.

425
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,760
Yes, yes, yes.

426
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Today's flowerpot is...

427
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,160
A Yu.

428
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,360
A Yu.

429
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,560
A Yu.

430
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,760
A Yu.

431
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,960
A Yu.

432
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,160
A Yu.

433
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
A Yu.

434
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
A Yu.

435
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
A Yu.

436
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,360
A Yu.

437
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,560
A Yu.

438
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,360
We all escaped.

439
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,560
Yes, we all escaped.

440
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Quiet.

441
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,560
I'm the one who has the most money.

442
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,760
Yes, yes, yes.

443
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,960
You said we all escaped.

444
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,160
We're not lucky, right?

445
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
We're not lucky to have money to pay.

446
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,960
This A Yu is really...

447
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,360
She didn't even say hello.

448
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,760
So she left.

449
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,360
I thought you were staying in the room.

450
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,960
You made me upset.

451
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,760
Who was that?

452
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,360
He stole my flowerpot.

453
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,760
In my heart,

454
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Mingyue is the only flowerpot.

455
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,760
I just helped my friend solve it.

456
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,360
You're rich now.

457
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,960
This time, I owe you my love.

458
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,960
Oh, no.

459
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,360
My knife.

460
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,760
That person indeed came from afar.

461
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
The people from Black Tiger Gang also came.

462
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,160
We can't stay here anymore.

463
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,360
I have a lot of storage in the western Liang Cang.

464
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,160
How much do you want?

465
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,560
A lot.

466
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,360
How much do you want?

467
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,560
A lot.

468
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,560
A lot?

469
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,360
Why do you need so much food?

470
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,560
Boss Feng,

471
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,960
you don't know my hometown, Bu Lu Village.

472
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
It's not open to the public anymore.

473
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,160
Bu Lu Village?

474
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,760
It's not because we don't have money.

475
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,360
It's because we don't have rice to cook.

476
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,160
Isn't that Yuan Zhou's base?

477
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,760
Yuan Zhou has already been painted to the north.

478
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Besides, even if we lack food, we can't come from Zichuan.

479
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,960
No, no, no.

480
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,360
With such a big transaction,

481
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,160
if the North Clan knows that

482
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,160
the food is from Zichuan,

483
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,560
it will easily cause a big dispute.

484
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,160
I won't be able to escape from this.

485
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
You see,

486
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,760
you've made the North Clan stand up for you.

487
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,560
You've suffered a lot.

488
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,360
I feel the same way.

489
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,560
I also want to help you.

490
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,560
You say this...

491
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,160
Still not a good idea.

492
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,360
Boss Feng,

493
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,760
you can rest assured about the money.

494
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,960
I promise you

495
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,160
that I'll pay for every batch of food.

496
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Oh, this is not a matter of money.

497
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,560
You say such a big deal,

498
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,760
what if something happens between the two clans?

499
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,960
Fine.

500
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,160
Then let's do this.

501
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,560
You take me to buy food in Zichuan.

502
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,160
You don't need to directly transport Yuan Zhou.

503
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,760
My people will be responsible for the transport in Zichuan.

504
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,560
Even if someone finds out that there are goods in the far-away area,

505
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,160
that's all my people.

506
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,960
In this aspect, for you,

507
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,160
it's really not risky.

508
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
There's nothing to lose.

509
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,960
Buy?

510
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Since the cooperation between the North Clan and the North Clan,

511
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,360
the border has been stable.

512
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,960
Zichuan has been able to safely invest in production.

513
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,360
This year, the South Clan and the North Clan have been in a good match.

514
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,760
According to the Poisonous Pond,

515
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,960
the amount of grain and cotton that has been collected

516
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,560
has completely recovered to the level before the war begins.

517
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,760
That's right.

518
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,760
The peace talks have been successful.

519
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,160
The credit should be back to the land.

520
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,960
Today, the peace talks have been successful.

521
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,360
We will see the land when it's back to its original state.

522
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,760
Thank you for your consideration.

523
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,560
But, there's a phenomenon that is worth paying attention to.

524
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
Tell me.

525
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,960
Although Zichuan's grain and cotton production has been rising,

526
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,360
the national treasury and military needs are not clear enough.

527
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,560
This is from what I know.

528
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,360
The most important reason is that the border has been in the far-away area.

529
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,360
Many goods have been sold to the far-away area.

530
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,360
Even the Lin family.

531
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,960
Are you hurt?

532
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,160
The main reason is that no matter how natural it is,

533
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,560
why did the Lin family buy so many goods?

534
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,360
This must have caused our warning.

535
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,560
Because the Lin family and the Liu family have always been friends.

536
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,960
These goods are what the Liu family wanted to buy.

537
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,960
The Liu family is currently in a mess.

538
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,960
But once they get the message,

539
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,760
they will soon be in the border and cause danger.

540
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,160
Everyone,

541
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,160
what's the plan for the battle?

542
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,160
Actually, this has always existed.

543
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:52,760
I don't know if you remember the

544
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,360
The reason is that the situation is like this.

545
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,760
It's just that the border was in a mess.

546
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,160
The important problem is how to solve the mess.

547
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,960
It's not about the economy.

548
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,560
But now is the most peaceful time for Zichuan.

549
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,160
It's also the best time to re-release and implement the law.

550
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,560
How about this?

551
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,560
This matter is handed over to the Secretary of the State of Shuli.

552
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,960
When the inspection is done,

553
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,760
we can get more information.

554
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,560
Dili,

555
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,160
the intelligence report is always true.

556
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,160
The intelligence report is the guarantee of victory.

557
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,560
The only way is to fight without losing.

558
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,760
Understood.

559
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
Boss Feng, why are you here?

560
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

561
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,160
Don't mention it. There's no time for this.

562
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,560
I'm here to tell you that we can't do business anymore.

563
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,360
What's going on?

564
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
You don't know?

565
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,960
The map has been remodeled and remodeled to the Wusi County.

566
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,760
They said they would limit the border transaction.

567
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,160
And this matter is still in the Shuli Bureau.

568
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,360
I know their team. You should find someone else.

569
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,360
I'll take my leave.

570
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,960
Boss Feng.

571
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Shuli Bureau?

572
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,760
Am I pretty?

573
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,960
You're the prettiest.

574
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,360
Qiu Jia, drink some water.

575
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,960
Get some rest.

576
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,760
Why are the girls from Chunfeng Courtyard gathered in our shop?

577
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,960
She's back.

578
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,360
She's finally back.

579
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,760
Big Brother.

580
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
Prince of Guangming.

581
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Big Brother.

582
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,560
Don't you think I'm really a traitor?

583
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,160
I'm a North Tribe. I only have one goal.

584
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,560
I'm to kill Lei Hong and avenge everyone.

585
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,760
You were thinking of giving Lei Hong a head-on reward.

586
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,160
But you were tricked by the god and sealed you away from the capital.

587
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,760
You can't be self-righteous and stay in the capital.

588
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,960
Big Brother, you're the one who knows me best.

589
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
I don't need to explain anything.

590
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,560
Since you're so thoughtful,

591
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,160
why did you become Prince of Guangming?

592
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Big Brother, I was just an accident.

593
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,960
My brother and I were playing games in Yuanzhou.

594
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,560
The North Tribe was in the area of Qiyan.

595
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,960
I took the troops to the capital to take the troops to Ludi.

596
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,360
The old man in Yuanzhou was very considerate of me.

597
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,760
He insisted on me becoming Prince of Guangming.

598
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,360
So they forced you to do that?

599
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,160
Yes.

600
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,560
You're not willing to do that?

601
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,360
Of course.

602
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,760
Say it.

603
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,960
Big Brother.

604
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,960
You don't even know?

605
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
I'm thinking about it.

606
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,160
I'm already in a deep state.

607
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,560
I can't just ignore them.

608
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,160
If I finish this battle,

609
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,960
they'll still be a group of three.

610
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,160
At that time, they'll still be bullied by the North Tribe.

611
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
So I'm thinking about it.

612
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
I'll be the one who's free and the South.

613
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,960
I'll be the Prince of Guangming.

614
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,760
Looks like you're really free and the South.

615
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,560
Yes.

616
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
But do you know that

617
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,960
you'll betray Zichuan in this matter?

618
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,560
Don't worry.

619
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,360
When I retreat from the North Tribe,

620
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,960
I'll take Yuanzhou back to Zichuan.

621
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,560
You brat.

622
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
You don't even know to send a letter back.

623
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,960
I'm worried about you, Big Brother.

624
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Big Brother.

625
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
I-I was wrong.

626
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,160
I should have come back earlier to see you.

627
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,960
I haven't seen you for so long. Are you okay?

628
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,760
I'm fine.

629
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,160
You brat. If you come back this time,

630
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,760
won't you just come back to take a bath?

631
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,360
I really came back this time for a small matter.

632
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,360
Please help me.

633
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,360
This Tangtang Prince of Guangming still has something to ask me.

634
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
Big Brother.

635
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,160
Isn't this because of the new law?

636
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,760
I came back to Zichuan to take a bath.

637
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,560
But the new law

638
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,960
I can't move out of it.

639
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,960
I-I'm so anxious.

640
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,560
So, aren't we here to find you?

641
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,960
Okay. I'll help you find a way.

642
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,960
But...

643
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,560
You don't want to ask me for money, right?

644
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,960
Of course, I have to.

645
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,360
I...

646
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,160
Can you bear the pain?

647
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,760
No.

648
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,160
I'm heartless, Big Brother.

649
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,160
You know that your brother and I

650
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,160
are so busy in Yuanzhou.

651
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
I'm so pitiful.

652
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,160
I can help you to take care of yourself.

653
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,160
But if you need a long-term food,

654
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160
you still have to buy Zichuan.

655
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,360
You can't take the advantage of Zichuan.

656
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Just take care of yourself.

657
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,360
Let's go. Let's go find your second brother.

658
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,960
Big Brother.

659
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,360
I can't go to see my second brother.

660
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,560
Why?

661
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,160
With my current identity,

662
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,360
it means I'm going to harm him.

663
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,760
You know my bad temper.

664
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,960
If you see me,

665
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,760
you'll tie me up to see Lord Jun.

666
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Lord Jun won't take me.

667
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,160
Tomorrow is your second brother's wedding.

668
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,960
Wedding?

669
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,160
Let's have a drink.

670
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,760
Now?

671
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,360
We'll drink it later.

672
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,560
It's different.

673
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,960
It's a mess.

674
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,760
You can drink it any time.

675
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,960
Let's see what good wine Big Brother brought you.

676
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,960
Fire-shrink?

677
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,560
I haven't seen it for a long time.

678
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,760
It's a new day.

679
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,360
I've heard of a wine merchant from the Xiu family.

680
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,560
I prepared it for you.

681
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,960
I wanted to drink it at the Martial Hall in Yanzhou.

682
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,560
The price of the blood is high.

683
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,760
The wine is like a wine.

684
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,960
You're just playing with wine.

685
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,560
I remember now

686
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,560
that I'm so angry.

687
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,760
Come on.

688
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,960
The man who's the big brother of the Xiu family.

689
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,760
Be my big brother.

690
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,360
I'll be your wife.

691
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,360
But I'm not here.

692
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,760
I'm here.

693
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
I'm here.

694
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
I'm here.

695
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
I'm here.

696
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,960
I'm here.

697
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
He's here.

698
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,760
Yes.

699
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,760
He's here.

700
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,360
Mom.

701
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,960
We'll drink this wine.

702
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,560
We'll drink it at the Martial Hall in Yanzhou.

703
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,360
Come on.

704
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,960
Put down the past in your heart.

705
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,560
Open the window of the city.

706
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,560
The world is hard to understand.

707
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,960
How many years have passed?

708
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,160
Life and death are all known.

709
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,760
We'll get married tonight.

710
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,960
We must drink it.

711
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,560
Let's have a toast.

712
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,960
Cheers.

713
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,360
Let's go.

714
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,360
My lord, what are we doing with the imperial uncle?

715
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,760
I wanted to heal my wounds and leave the capital.

716
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,960
But I didn't know that I'm not a police officer.

717
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,760
After the new material distribution plan,

718
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,160
I've been doing my best to check the secret.

719
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,760
Now I want to go out to the city

720
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,960
and have a special pass.

721
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,360
Or I can use the pass that Zicuan's internal medical institution is offering.

722
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,360
Are you trying to kill the imperial uncle?

723
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,160
Didn't you just hear them say that

724
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,760
they're going to have a wedding today?

725
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,560
After they're done with the wine, we'll start to kill them.

726
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,360
It's not too late.

727
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,960
My brother and I were always alone.

728
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,160
Let's Não

729
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,720
Let's정

730
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,280
Let's not

Let's not

732
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,800
Let's not

733
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,480
Let's don't

734
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,480
Let them

735
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,080

Today's party,H broker I'm happy for them

737
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,860
What a happy family

738
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,960
you know

739
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,560

The

742
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,880
Second Brother, happy wedding.

743
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:32,080
Kata, I'll attend your wedding today.

744
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,080
I remember the first time you touched her, it was here.

745
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,580
That time, Si Yi Lin.

746
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,580
I heard you say thank you to her.

747
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,080
But it turned out to be like a face mask.

748
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,580
There was no expression.

749
