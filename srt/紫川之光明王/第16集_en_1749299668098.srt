1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not afraid of you.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't say it.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,880
The Acid's

22
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,000
The Acid's

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Have already come.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why not hurry up?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm tired.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I have to be careful.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In case it is dirty to dish up breakfast for you.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry, I'm a little clumsy.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,720
Fortunately,

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,320
Tong Mishi sent me a secret letter.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
She and the master of the West Mountain are pleading for help.

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,800
I hope I can take you to rescue them.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,440
I've arranged it.

34
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,560
I'll send two troops from the sea to pick you up.

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,480
I'll make sure Liu Fengming can't be caught off guard.

36
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,680
Has the leader of the Lin family agreed to send troops?

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,240
Don't lie.

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,800
I can see it when you lie from a young age.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,280
I can't do anything about your business.

40
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,280
Now Liu Fengming is in a tight spot.

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
If you don't have Yuan Jun,

42
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,240
you'll be in trouble.

43
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,840
I'm very grateful that you can help me this time.

44
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,720
Since the leader doesn't agree to send troops,

45
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,440
I can contact the Banyan Army to rescue Li Ying'an and Shi Shi.

46
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,000
It can't affect you because of my family.

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,080
Your family?

48
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,160
I, Ling Yunfei, have been a big boy since I was a kid.

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,200
I've confessed to you,

50
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,240
proposed to you,

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,320
even forced you to get married.

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,360
At least you have to have 20 or 30 times.

53
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,320
The Lin family went to the leader and got down to the rich.

54
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,800
They all know I'm sincere to you.

55
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,080
What if they don't agree?

56
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,920
I won't leave you alone.

57
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,800
First of all,

58
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,600
since I was a kid,

59
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,760
I've treated you as my best sister.

60
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,000
Fine, I'll eat some chopsticks.

61
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
I'll treat you as my brother.

62
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,080
Next time,

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,440
I'll tell you to leave me alone.

64
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,640
Just leave me alone.

65
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,160
Even if there are many dangers in this world,

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,680
I won't leave you alone.

67
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,760
Protecting you

68
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,880
is my promise since I was a kid.

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,680
Do you know what my situation is?

70
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
The bandits and pirates

71
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
killed bandits.

72
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
The family was in chaos.

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,760
I don't care about that.

74
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,840
I've experienced life and death.

75
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,640
Before life and death,

76
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,280
I know

77
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,000
what's the most important thing for me.

78
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,000
What?

79
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,360
You?

80
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,080
If I remember correctly,

81
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,920
this must be the 79th confession.

82
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,600
This is the Borus Village.

83
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,320
There is

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,520
the location of the other tribes of Lian Meng Army.

85
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,480
This time,

86
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,240
we'll make another plan.

87
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,240
This is the location of the Snake Clan's grandson.

88
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,440
He's the most greedy and afraid of death.

89
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,640
We can't hold on

90
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,800
under the Lian Cao tribe.

91
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,720
Let's start from him.

92
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,200
Let's start.

93
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,880
How is it?

94
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,680
How is it going?

95
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,320
The Ludi tribe

96
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,560
is very dangerous.

97
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,560
They are very dangerous.

98
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,760
What did the King of Guangming say?

99
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,360
He told us to guard the real place.

100
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,280
Guard?

101
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,480
If we guard it, it will be dead.

102
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
How much is the grain tea?

103
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,520
It can last for three days.

104
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,000
But there are soldiers

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,040
who don't have enough grain.

106
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,560
When will it be?

107
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,600
It's still in chaos.

108
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,200
Wait.

109
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,520
You should hide the grain from the grain storage.

110
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,400
You should send someone

111
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,480
to the Borus Village.

112
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,520
Tell me.

113
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,080
We can't hold on.

114
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,800
Hurry.

115
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,840
I see.

116
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,840
When the Luddis occupied Sun City,

117
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,680
the next threat

118
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,680
will be LВО and LĒ.

119
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,320
We are here

120
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:23,880
on the Borus Village.

121
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,040
I didn't think Ludi would come.

122
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,840
They dare not.

123
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,640
The strategy does

124
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,880
get better than the wall palace.

125
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,840
Moreover,

126
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,960
even if L cosy

127
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,360
of the Borus Village,

128
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,920
we can't make it.

129
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:39,760
Lord,

130
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,880
Sun City comes here again for lifecycle.

131
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,080
We expect it to be successful.

132
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,280
The Sun family sent people to report.

133
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
They can't hold on any longer.

134
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,240
Please help them.

135
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,040
How long will they last?

136
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,080
Three days.

137
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,200
Yes.

138
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,800
The defense war is not enough.

139
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
The experience is not enough.

140
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,640
Although there are three days left,

141
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm afraid they can't hold on for a day.

142
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,960
If the Lu Di is just a palace,

143
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,360
if we get out of the city

144
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,440
and get attacked by them,

145
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,600
we won't be able to get a chance.

146
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,360
If we continue like this,

147
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
there will be chaos.

148
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,160
Let the Gu Lie keep the Yang Zhuang Guang Ming King

149
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,120
and disturb the Lu Di's descendants.

150
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,040
We won't move.

151
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,440
Wait for you to come back.

152
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,040
If the front line is lost,

153
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,320
it will be dangerous if we don't get out of the city.

154
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,200
My lord,

155
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,800
the team of the Gu Lie and the Yang Zhuang Guang Ming King

156
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,920
will fight with me in the defense.

157
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,920
Will they fall into the war?

158
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,200
The Gu Lie and the Yang Zhuang Guang Ming King

159
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,440
are three years old children?

160
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,000
This must be his army.

161
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,600
The East and the West.

162
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,440
It's to let us give up the Sun family.

163
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,840
What does this mean?

164
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,800
What does it mean?

165
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,160
It means our strategy is working.

166
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,760
The way to catch the Gu army is right.

167
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,840
I told you that

168
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,320
the King of Guang Ming is not like this.

169
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,840
I know that his army is not as strong as the others.

170
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,360
I don't dare to fight with my army.

171
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,960
Send the army down.

172
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,640
Keep attacking Sun family.

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,720
Tonight,

174
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,320
I'll kill him.

175
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,840
My lord.

176
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:19,920
My lord.

177
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,160
We can't hold on.

178
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,560
The Lu's army is coming in.

179
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,160
So fast.

180
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,400
The wolf is hiding in the room.

181
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,360
Commander, let's retreat.

182
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,320
Oh, my god.

183
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
The Lu's army is out of the capital.

184
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,480
The soldiers are not in the army.

185
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,520
It's good that they're back.

186
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,240
They're out of the city.

187
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,160
What?

188
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,960
They're still alive for three days?

189
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,360
We just got the news.

190
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,400
The Lu's army has taken Sun family's camp.

191
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,280
They want to leave.

192
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,200
They're probably after them.

193
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,600
Take them to the camp now.

194
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,640
Oh, my god.

195
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,800
Hurry.

196
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,320
Hurry.

197
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,480
Stop.

198
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,240
My lord.

199
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,280
We're in the forest.

200
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,440
The forest is not good for the army.

201
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,960
And the forest is so dense.

202
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,800
I'm afraid there's a ambush.

203
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,880
Don't chase them.

204
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,800
Return to the camp.

205
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,480
Use this method.

206
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,320
Take the camp of the Lu's people

207
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,600
away from the city.

208
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,520
I'll see who can stop the Lu's army.

209
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,520
You're hiding here

210
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,920
and are only defending us.

211
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,440
You just need to say something.

212
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,360
Defend?

213
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,200
Do you know how hard it is for me?

214
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,960
Do you know how long

215
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,320
we haven't eaten a meal?

216
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,320
Why didn't you give us food?

217
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,680
Where's Prince of Guangming?

218
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,800
I want to see him.

219
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,080
Prince of Guangming.

220
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Come out, Prince of Guangming.

221
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,960
Prince of Guangming is having a cold.

222
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,440
He's resting.

223
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:00,920
Yes.

224
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,840
He's sick.

225
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,680
He's the leader of our army.

226
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,480
Is he sleeping in the bed

227
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,040
to make him feel better?

228
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
Of course not.

229
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,520
You finally know it.

230
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,200
I've heard your words.

231
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,720
And you're right.

232
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,160
I know you're struggling

233
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,800
in the front line.

234
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,040
So I asked Luo Jie to take the food

235
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,280
and come back to thank you.

236
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,880
Luo Jie, come in.

237
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,480
Open it.

238
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,280
See?

239
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,320
I'll send all of them

240
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,840
to you.

241
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,720
Really?

242
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,840
Of course.

243
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,520
And I can promise you

244
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,480
I'll ask the emperor

245
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,360
to avenge you.

246
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:56,920
Okay.

247
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,840
I'll trust you again.

248
00:09:59,300 --> 00:09:59,940
Let's go?

249
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,960
I'll send you a drop later.

250
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,320
Toniga,

251
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,000
you're really back.

252
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,480
We have food.

253
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,040
They do not need any.

254
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,040
Toniga, I put up a fold.

255
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,160
But that does exist.

256
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,440
I've asked theคน dou to师 nao

257
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,020
Zhu Li and Ah Pei, those three are the same!

258
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,240
But Li had comes all of a sudden...

259
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,720
편 MILе II Bahه

260
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,720
How many different subordinates?

261
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,760
oner Communications

262
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,660
How can I be more than six?

263
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,760
He has a mother often

264
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
My lord.

265
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
We are not qualified.

266
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,040
Let Lord Lian Meng

267
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,360
just kneel down and be the emperor.

268
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,760
It's already broken in my heart.

269
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Why do I always feel that it's not right?

270
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
It seems that every time I talk to Lord Guang Ming

271
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,160
I have this feeling.

272
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,360
My lord.

273
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,960
The Ministry of Justice must have been in charge of the four palaces.

274
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,760
For the sake of our own good, it's just...

275
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,560
What is it?

276
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
It's just that we have several patrol teams to attack.

277
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
We have killed 50 people.

278
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,960
How many people?

279
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
10 people.

280
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,760
It's fine.

281
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,560
We will come back tomorrow.

282
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,360
My lord.

283
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,560
My lord.

284
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,960
My lord.

285
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
My lord.

286
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,560
We have been reported by all the patrol teams.

287
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,160
Many Lian Meng Jun has come out.

288
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,560
He is safe and sound.

289
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,160
He doesn't want to fight with us.

290
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,360
He just killed 50 people.

291
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,560
After all these days,

292
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
we have already killed thousands of people.

293
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,360
All the patrol teams must not fight.

294
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,160
If we kill more than 50 people, we will run away.

295
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,760
If we count it like this,

296
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,760
at least 1000 people will be damaged by Lord Lian Meng.

297
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,560
But there are tens of thousands of people in Lord Lian Meng.

298
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,960
How long do we have to kill them?

299
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,160
Moreover, Lord Lian Meng

300
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
will not be killed by us every day.

301
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,760
Don't worry.

302
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,160
Ludi is more anxious than us.

303
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,560
I understand.

304
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,960
He wants to take us down one by one.

305
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,160
We can't lose this time.

306
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,960
This must be Lord Lian Meng's plan.

307
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,160
Such a strategy and such a strategy.

308
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,960
Lord Lian Meng must have sent his main force.

309
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,760
Ludi wants to know the most.

310
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,360
Where is our main force?

311
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Because he thinks that with his strength,

312
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,760
he can easily destroy our main force.

313
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,360
He will be forever.

314
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,160
If that is the case, we will tell him

315
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,360
where our main force is.

316
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Moreover, we must strengthen our defense.

317
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,760
We must fight to destroy their intelligence system.

318
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
We will fight and fight.

319
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,160
We will go to the seven villages directly.

320
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,360
We must not let Lord Lian Meng's plan get to the end.

321
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,160
How can he know where our main force is?

322
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:31,480
W

323
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Prince of Guang Ming.

324
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,560
Where is the Prince of Guang Ming?

325
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,760
Where is his main force?

326
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,560
Ludi is best not to be the prince of Guang Ming?

327
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,360
We've met the small valley team in this period of time.

328
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,360
This time, we suddenly got a new army.

329
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,360
It seems that the main force of Lord of Light is Wu Yi.

330
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Very good. Let the half of the Fu Ge team chase the enemy.

331
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,360
The rest, keep the camp.

332
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Report!

333
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,360
My lord, there's an enemy in the east and west direction.

334
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
This is very likely to be the main force of the tribe.

335
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Why do you say that they are the main force?

336
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Lord of Light personally went up to kill the enemy.

337
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,360
This mountain area is more suitable to hide the main force.

338
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
This is a trap.

339
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
Tell the whole army not to care about this team.

340
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Keep chasing the army.

341
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Yes.

342
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Lord of Light, the enemy of the Lu Di team is not close to us.

343
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
They are still chasing the mountain area.

344
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Very good.

345
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
Let's continue to rest.

346
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Let's continue to play.

347
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Yes.

348
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Report!

349
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
My lord, it's bad.

350
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,360
After the enemy we are chasing is entering the mountain area,

351
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
we will immediately retreat and retreat.

352
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
We will immediately retreat and retreat.

353
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Our enemy is chasing the mountain area.

354
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
We will immediately retreat and retreat.

355
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
This light is fooling me again.

356
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Moreover, the enemy in the east and west direction just now

357
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
has advanced to the force.

358
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,360
He has advanced to the front and knocked down the valley.

359
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
He!

360
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Send someone over to take out this team.

361
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
I will fight in order.

362
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Yes.

363
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,360
My lord, don't be angry.

364
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
I am angry.

365
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Now, there is another team of the Lu Di team near the mountain area.

366
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,360
But we can't judge which team is the real one.

367
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
What weapon is the Lu Di team wearing?

368
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
The unified equipment is long-range.

369
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
It also has bowels.

370
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Only a few soldiers in Yuan Zhou can equip long-range bowels.

371
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Lord of Light must think that I will act in impulse.

372
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Using the enemy's means to knock down the valley.

373
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
It's just a matter of the Xu Zhang.

374
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,360
The truth is that he is hiding his true power in order to hide his true power.

375
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
He almost killed his brother again.

376
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Brother Fu, bring half of the team to the dragon group.

377
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Yes.

378
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,360
My lord, Lu Di sent someone to the dragon group this time.

379
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
This Lu Di is really...

380
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,360
He is really smart in every step I take.

381
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Oji, tell everyone to wear the whole suit.

382
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Prepare to fight.

383
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
Tong, we really fight.

384
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
But it's not the Lu Di team.

385
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,360
If we fight with him now, he will beat us to death.

386
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Who will we fight with if we don't fight with Lu Di?

387
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
You are useless.

388
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,360
You don't even know where the master is.

389
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,360
I will kill you and then kill him.

390
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,360
My lord, there are several teams in the forest this time.

391
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,360
Lord of Light is also in the team.

392
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,360
This time, it must be right.

393
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,360
Didn't you say that Lord of Light is fighting with the valley?

394
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,360
That is really a corner.

395
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,360
I will kill him with all my strength.

396
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Be careful.

397
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,360
This Lu Di's camp is quite rare.

398
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
His temper is a bit poor.

399
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,360
He is so bad at such a good thing.

400
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
What a pity.

401
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
My lord.

402
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Tong, the food is ready.

403
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
The happy time is always short.

404
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
It's time to say goodbye again.

405
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
My lord.

406
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,360
But I can give him a small gift.

407
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,360
He will be very happy.

408
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
My lord.

409
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Our camp has been attacked.

410
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,360
What did you say?

411
00:18:50,360 --> 00:19:19,120
The

412
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,720
What can I say?

413
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,080
Master,

414
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,960
light the昨na.

415
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,340
Our Amulet Xi

416
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,480
has been snatched by Prince Guangming.

417
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,840
Report!

418
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:46,320
Master

419
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,760
Theիs of Yuzhu Army,

420
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,980
The tiger recently died.

421
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,280
It's about to arrive.

422
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:52,880
Hurry!

423
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,520
Yes, sir.

424
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,640
My lord.

425
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,640
My lord.

426
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,160
Do not get angry.

427
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,160
I'm so embarrassed.

428
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Okay, sir, don't cry.

429
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,760
Don't cry.

430
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Sir, don't cry.

431
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,760
Tali Temple, Yasuda Temple.

432
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Two brothers, please calm down.

433
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Get up and talk.

434
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Sir, we can't get into the prison.

435
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,760
I didn't expect they would suddenly appear outside Yasuda.

436
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
They are everywhere.

437
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
I just got the news that

438
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Mr. Qin heard the sound of the city gate being broken.

439
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Tali Temple is the same.

440
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,760
Fortunately, the soldiers of the Lord sent troops to see it.

441
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:12,340
Horshan, we are like the

442
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,760
The Dragon-Demon Star Sect.

443
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
You should rest.

444
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
You've worked hard.

445
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,760
Go back and rest.

446
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Sir.

447
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,760
Please listen to us.

448
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Sir.

449
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
Lord Guangming.

450
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
Come on.

451
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Let's go.

452
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Sir, we can make a big deal this time.

453
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,760
We can't let you down if we don't want to.

454
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,760
He is busy cleaning the battlefield.

455
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Stop.

456
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
This is the situation.

457
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
We need to be patient.

458
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
We have arrived.

459
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Besides, Lu Yi is in a state of emergency.

460
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,760
I think he is in a serious injury.

461
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,760
He won't be in danger in the short term.

462
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
The food from the capital is delivered.

463
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,760
Give it to her.

464
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
We can finally rest.

465
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Did Brother Xiu come here like this?

466
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Every Xiyu people wants to be masters.

467
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,760
They must endure the pain that others can't endure.

468
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,760
The first step is to take the horse.

469
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,760
I used to think that

470
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,760
he was so good at being born.

471
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
I didn't expect that...

472
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,760
No one is as good as you.

473
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,760
Not that he is a successor.

474
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,760
But you will become a qualified one.

475
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
It's just that the process is more difficult

476
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,760
than the horse-drawn horse-drawn horse-drawn horse-drawn horse.

477
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,760
Your Highness, the horse-drawn horse-drawn horse is asking for an audience.

478
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Take a break.

479
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Since the last jade seal,

480
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,760
I've always wanted to send you a weapon that can protect your body.

481
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
This is the best craftsman I've ever asked for.

482
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
I'll make sure that you can take care of it.

483
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
This nut...

484
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Try it.

485
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
It's still a bit cold.

486
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
I'll teach you.

487
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Your feet are stable. Your hands are too high.

488
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,760
Your fingers are too big.

489
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
You hit it!

490
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
It's quite interesting.

491
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
Thank you.

492
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
You're welcome.

493
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,760
I'm a good servant.

494
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,760
It's a pity that you're a civil servant.

495
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,760
I won't bother you with the gift.

496
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,760
I'll ask you to go out and enjoy the food.

497
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,760
Your Highness, I'll take it and help you pack it.

498
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
Sister Li Qing doesn't like it.

499
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,760
I don't like it either.

500
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,760
It's just a nut.

501
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,760
I don't like it or not.

502
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
I'm not saying it's a nut.

503
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
It's just a normal person.

504
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
He's your friend.

505
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,760
I've never had any friends.

506
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,760
I know who's sincere to me.

507
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Let's continue.

508
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,760
Listen to me.

509
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,760
We've got a lot of money for this.

510
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
That's right.

511
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,760
This time, Lord of Light really made us open our eyes.

512
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
We didn't even see Brother Lu.

513
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,760
But we got everything we wanted.

514
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,760
I didn't expect that the factory would be so big.

515
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
So remember.

516
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
You can't touch them.

517
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,760
You know, Brother Lu.

518
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Although he's a little bit suspicious,

519
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,760
his soldiers are all in a deep battle.

520
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
You're right.

521
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
If you touch them,

522
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
they'll definitely defeat you.

523
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
Yes.

524
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,760
So if you want to fight the Emperor,

525
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,760
you must use your tactics.

526
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,760
It's a pity.

527
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,760
We've been slaves before.

528
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,760
We didn't have the chance to learn these things.

529
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,760
It's really not as good as the North Tribe.

530
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,760
That's true.

531
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,760
Before, we didn't return to the city.

532
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,760
Brother Lu entered the palace and took the land.

533
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,760
That Sun Shi was still alive for three days.

534
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,760
But what happened?

535
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
He didn't die in half a day.

536
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
It's not his fault.

537
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,760
The soldiers of the Snake Tribe are indeed worse than the North Tribe.

538
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,760
But we have Lord of Light now.

539
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,760
If Lord of Light can give us the war books,

540
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,760
we'll be able to protect our Yuan State better.

541
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,760
Right?

542
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
Yes.

543
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
You're right.

544
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,760
Our physical strength is more than the North Tribe.

545
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
If we can learn to use the war books,

546
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
the North Tribe will definitely not be our opponent.

547
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Right?

548
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Yes.

549
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
Lord of Light.

550
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Lord of Light.

551
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Lord of Light.

552
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
Lord of Light.

553
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Lord of Light.

554
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Lord of Light.

555
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
Good.

556
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
OK.

557
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,760
You will be pleased to learn the politics of the rest of the three districts.

558
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,760
Right.

559
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
Good.

560
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,760
It's not easy to play, but it's not difficult to attack.

561
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
It's not easy to use your little hands.

562
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,760
And it's easy to use your big hands.

563
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,760
In short, you must finish the enemy in our hands.

564
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,760
Let him follow our footsteps to fight.

565
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,760
In this case, we can protect the victory in our own hands.

566
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
That makes sense.

567
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
I really understand.

568
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
This...

569
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,760
You must be careful when you fight.

570
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,760
If you win, don't be proud.

571
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,760
If you lose, don't be annoying.

572
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Don't be impulsive.

573
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,760
Your brain is a good thing.

574
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,760
You must wear it when you fight.

575
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Get off the car.

576
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,760
After this series of calculations, what can we get?

577
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
We can get eight wins.

578
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,760
This is a very high victory rate.

579
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,760
If we attack, we will win a lot.

580
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
If the result is less than five,

581
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
then you must think carefully.

582
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,760
Is it worth attacking?

583
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Is it worth it or not?

584
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Good question.

585
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,760
If you attack, you will be trapped.

586
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
If you have a bad conscience,

587
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,760
then you will have a problem of good and bad.

588
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,760
Then you will become an important question.

589
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Do you understand?

590
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,760
I'll think about it again.

591
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,760
I understand.

592
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,760
Do you want to know if there is any decisive battle?

593
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,760
Of course, I have my answer.

594
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
I have fought so many battles.

595
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,760
I have never lost.

596
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Today, I will give you this secret weapon.

597
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Do you want to hear it?

598
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Yes.

599
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
Hit the bell.

600
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,760
Yes.

601
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,760
This secret weapon is...

602
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,760
If you can't hit it, then run.

603
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,760
Don't let others have the chance to win you.

604
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,760
Then you won't lose.

605
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,760
If you don't lose, then you will win.

606
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,760
Don't you think it's reasonable?

607
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Old Doulun, you tell me.

608
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Is it reasonable?

609
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
I want to know it.

610
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
It's reasonable.

611
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Bu Si, do you think you can beat me?

612
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
Yes.

613
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,760
Okay.

614
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,760
Then I will not lose.

615
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,760
One, two, three.

616
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Good.

617
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Good.

618
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
Very good.

619
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Light up.

620
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Light up.

621
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,760
Let me see.

622
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,760
So strong.

623
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Did you change your poem a few days ago?

624
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Do you want to try this?

625
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,760
How do you know?

626
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,760
Lord Guangming, you know he has a poem?

627
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,760
I know him, but I know you.

628
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,760
You have to eat more these days.

629
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,760
You must be hungry.

630
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,760
Try this.

631
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,760
Try this.

632
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,760
Thank you, Lord Guangming.

633
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
No need.

634
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
Keep practicing.

635
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,760
Keep spirit. Keep energy.

636
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,760
How do you know they are full of energy?

637
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,760
It doesn't look like it's a simple thing.

638
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Three.

639
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
You follow me for so many years.

640
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,760
You don't know us?

641
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,760
You are a leader who needs to be lowered.

642
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,760
Six.

643
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,760
In fact, besides the oil and chicken battle,

644
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
you are a little bit more simple.

645
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
You are a little bit more simple.

646
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,760
And the fish battle.

647
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,760
I've been playing for three days.

648
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,760
Do you know that I didn't come out of the office last night?

649
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,760
I am a perfect leader.

650
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,760
I know them all.

651
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,760
I think about them and do what I need.

652
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,760
I even dare to talk to them in my class.

653
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,760
My leg is about to be broken.

654
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,760
Liu Fengming.

655
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
What are you doing here?

656
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,760
Don't be nervous.

657
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,760
I just want to have lunch with my father.

658
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,760
We haven't had lunch together for a long time.

659
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Get out of here.

660
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
What are you doing?

661
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,760
Liu Fengming, let go of my leg.

662
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,760
I think my father really spoiled you.

663
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,760
Now I just want to have lunch with my father.

664
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Are you going to do that?

665
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Father.

666
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
Please.

667
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,760
This first cup of wine is for your good daughter,

668
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
my good sister,

669
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,760
the greatest general of the Liu Feng family.

670
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Liu Fengshuang.

671
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
Oh, right.

672
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,760
I just received news that

673
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,760
the people in the Black Tiger Gang found their trace

674
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
in the front yard.

675
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,760
Now the traitor has been killed successfully.

676
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Shuang'er,

677
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,760
that's your sister.

678
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,760
My husband,

679
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,760
why do you think I am your family?

680
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,760
You always treat me like a soldier.

681
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,760
You always want to destroy me.

682
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,760
I think you are a big hearted man.

683
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,760
You don't like me.

684
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,760
That's right.

685
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,760
I am not as good as Shuang when I am a soldier.

686
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,760
I am not as good as Shuang when I am a soldier.

687
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,760
But I have my advantages.

688
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,760
I have ambition and ambition.

689
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,760
But you still don't like me.

690
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,760
Do you remember this place?

691
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,760
You have been keeping me here for three days and three nights.

692
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,760
I lost to Shuang because of me.

693
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,760
So I don't even have water to drink.

694
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
In other people's eyes,

695
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,760
you are a great hero.

696
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,760
But in my eyes,

697
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,760
you are a ruthless father.

698
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,760
I know you don't want my son.

699
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,760
You can't have such a useless son.

700
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,760
You even want to starve me to death.

701
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,760
You are a lunatic.

702
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,760
You don't have to hit him.

703
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,760
He treats you so harshly.

704
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,760
He treats you so well.

705
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,760
What do you want?

706
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Brother.

707
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,760
I said you shouldn't disturb my son.

708
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,760
Brother.

709
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
General Shuang.

710
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,760
Please rise.

711
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
This is the old man of the Baiyue Army.

712
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,760
Thanks to him for helping me to find the old man,

713
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,760
I was able to return to the faraway capital.

714
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Cheng Lie has made a good point.

715
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,760
The news you have been exposed by the Black Tiger Gang has been spread to the palace.

716
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,760
The defense of the East City Gate is very strict at this moment.

717
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
The defense of the West City Gate is very relaxed.

718
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,760
We can just make a bridge and enter the city from the West City Gate.

719
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
No.

720
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,760
We have to make a big entrance.

721
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
General.

722
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,760
I'm afraid we will make a mess.

723
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Not only that,

724
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,760
but also make a big move.

725
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,760
You asked someone to create fake news.

726
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Is it not because of Qiao Qiao's entrance,

727
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
that Liu Fang Ming is in a hurry?

728
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,760
I just wanted her to be afraid.

729
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
Ying Mulan.

730
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
You go to the north gate.

731
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,760
You go to the south gate.

732
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,760
You go to the south gate.

733
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,760
Fei, I'll leave the West Gate to you.

734
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
General.

735
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
What about you?

736
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,760
I'm going to open the East Gate by myself.

737
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,760
I want to let those people who want to kill the Liu Feng family know.

738
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,760
Liu Feng Shuang is back.

739
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,760
What the hell is going on?

740
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,760
What's going on?

741
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
All the city gates have been attacked.

742
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
I don't know where he came from.

743
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
But he must be the one who led the people.

744
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
The north gate was taken down by the people.

745
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
It's a war against the south gate.

746
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
The south gate was on fire.

747
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,760
The East gate was under water.

748
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,760
The West gate was attacked by the people.

749
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
It's like...

750
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,760
It's like the Lin family.

751
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,760
What?

752
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
The Lin family is here too?

753
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
It's over.

754
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
It's over.

755
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,760
Go and get everyone.

756
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
Go!

757
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Yes.

758
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
Why is it like this?

759
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
Where are they?

760
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Call everyone over.

761
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
Don't worry, Young Master.

762
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,760
There are many people here.

763
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Liu Feng Shuang can't get in.

764
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
Young Master!

765
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,760
Young Master!

766
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
The place where the family was killed by the people

767
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
is being attacked.

768
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
They can't stand it anymore.

769
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,760
What are you saying?

770
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Liu Feng Shuang is back?

771
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Yes.

772
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,760
All of you go and get him back.

773
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Everyone go!

774
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Wait.

775
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
Kill him.

776
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
Yes.

777
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
All of you come with me.

778
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Yes.

779
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
Kill him.

780
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,760
Young Master.

781
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,760
We didn't find the location of the house.

782
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,760
It's impossible that we can get you back now.

783
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,760
It will be tough for you and idea of the place.

784
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Wait a minute.

785
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
We'll call the army.

786
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
Yes.

787
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
Since then.

788
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:21,000
Noord spreading the name of the道の劍

789
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,700
it's highly possible that the glorious current of Right brick sects might Avait him here in the door.

790
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,800
Then have your husband severe the

791
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,300
I'm going to another place

792
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,840
Brother.

793
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,400
Brother.

794
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,680
Do you still remember when we played lily?

795
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,560
As for Cloud G Boris,

796
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,080
we had Thor.

797
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,360
Hand.

798
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,440
We were playing on balance.

799
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,440
As long as I sing outside, you'll be afraid of running away.

800
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,440
You're still so timid after all these years.

801
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,240
Why do you always like to take away what belongs to me?

802
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,440
I won't let you take it away that day!

803
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
Don't come over.

804
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,440
Where are they? Hurry up!

805
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,440
They all asked you to send them out to kill me.

806
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
Have you forgotten?

807
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,440
Don't come over. I'll kill you if you come over!

808
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,440
Where are they? Hurry up! Where are they?

809
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
Where are they?

810
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,440
Come here! Close her up!

811
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,440
Sister!

812
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
You're hurt!

813
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
I'm fine.

814
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,440
I'm fine. I just don't know why you're so late to come out.

815
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,440
Father, I'm sorry. I came late.

816
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,440
I was in a mess. I was under pressure to take care of you.

817
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,440
These boards, I'll take them off immediately!

818
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,440
Keep them.

819
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,440
Everything has its cause and its result.

820
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,440
Tomorrow, I'll take them out.

821
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,440
I won't let you do this to me.

822
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,440
Rong'er, take her back to the residence.

823
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,440
I won't see her again.

824
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
Father!

825
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,440
No.

826
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,440
Thank you, Chief Xan.

827
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,440

We don't like it.

850
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,680
We don't like it.

851
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,920

853
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:08,840
The silence is waiting for you to open your mouth

854

The lost old friend

855
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,440
He never left in his life

856
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,240
I feel so bad

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,240
The silence is waiting for you to open your mouth

Sorry, I have a word missing

859
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,640

Don't let go of our hands

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,640
Can you take a picture of me?

00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,640
Come on, take a picture of me

863
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:54,640
There is someone who likes to stay in the old place

864
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,640
Just stay with me and my brother

865
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,640
No one can decide

866
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,640
Just stay with me and my brother

867
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,640
No one can decide

868
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,640
The silence is waiting for you to open your mouth

869
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,640
The silence is waiting for you to open your mouth

870
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,640
I have already found the problem

871
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,640
But I have to find the right person

872
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,640
