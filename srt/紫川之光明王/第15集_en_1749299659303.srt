1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:52,880
Go The

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,200
Then do you understand what I mean?

17
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,160
Yes.

18
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,840
I asked Someone to clean up the study room.

19
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,760
Tomorrow morning,

20
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,800
Have a good rest.

21
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,360
You should rest here.

22
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,720
The land of the north

23
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,000
is hard to find.

24
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,360
You must be very worried about this flower.

25
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,520
Since it's planted,

26
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,360
it's not that hard to see.

27
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,000
The flowers are beautiful.

28
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,480
It's time to open the field tonight.

29
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,880
Let them stay with you.

30
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,000
I have work to do.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,080
I'll leave first.

32
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Yun Jun.

33
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,520
Thank you.

34
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,000
Han Aizhang

35
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,000
Come on.

36
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,800
Let's go.

37
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:16,960
Tomorrow just drink!

38
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
Today we'll drink and then leave.

39
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,080
Thousands all around the world can have their own lives.

40
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,640
Nobodypaper hesitant prying at the truth as well.

41
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,640
Li feng must take responsibility.

42
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,700
Let's go.

43
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,700
What are you doing here?

44
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,700
Have you seen anyone?

45
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,700
I saw a black shadow passing through my room.

46
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,700
I think he's not in my house.

47
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,700
It's a few people stealing the order of the imperial guards.

48
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
They're in a hurry.

49
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,700
As for their body, you're in the wrong.

50
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Ge Xian has already handed over the guards.

51
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,700
It's just a few thieves. They're running faster.

52
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,700
You're a new officer now.

53
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Take a look at your wife.

54
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,700
Leave the rest to me.

55
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
She didn't turn down the Edm subscribe account,

56
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,700
so she must respect you.

57
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,700
No.

58
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,700
Make sure your wife doesn't pick up any more oil column goods.

59
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,900
It will be really no use.

60
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,700
It's too bad.

61
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,700
I had no reaction.

62
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
I can't see the fresh play.

63
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,700
Your Highness likes it.

64
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,700
That's the best.

65
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,700
I've sent someone to send two to the mansion.

66
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Today is the day that you're in the car.

67
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,700
Mr. Ma, you're so thoughtful.

68
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,700
How did you think that you'd be so helpless on this carriage?

69
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
A few days ago, I went to the Demon of the Clouds.

70
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,700
It was more difficult there.

71
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,700
The soldiers were using the charcoal to warm up.

72
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,700
I saw it and I got a magic.

73
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,700
I used the same charcoal to burn the silver and double charcoal.

74
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
That's much cleaner.

75
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,700
It's much cleaner.

76
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,700
You didn't get disturbed, did you?

77
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,700
Did something happen?

78
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,700
Someone wanted to steal the army's army.

79
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Ge Qing found out that he was fighting with him.

80
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,700
I'm the vice commander.

81
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,700
I can take the enemy's handphone from the army.

82
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,700
Are you worried that I'll be disturbed by a few little thieves?

83
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,700
I was in a hurry.

84
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,700
This is the first snow of this year.

85
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Go to bed early.

86
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,700
You're not going back to your mansion?

87
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,700
It's rare that I'm the main commander.

88
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,700
I'd like to ask you to go to bed early.

89
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,700
It's a long night.

90
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
I'll be your guard.

91
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,700
Hurry!

92
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,700
Lei Biao!

93
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,700
She's sad to let you live here with her.

94
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Who told you that you can't be swept away?

95
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,700
Focus on your career.

96
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
You two come together?

97
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,700
I'm not sure if I can see it.

98
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,700
But I don't think I've seen such a beautiful scenery in this place.

99
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,700
I think that the people of Ditu

100
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,700
should be able to see more beautiful scenery in the ordinary.

101
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,700
Yes.

102
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,700
Everyone envies the wealth and wealth.

103
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,700
But sometimes what we want more

104
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,700
is just a normal person's happiness.

105
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,700
Your Highness, I've already asked someone to prepare some dishes.

106
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,700
It turns out that you already have a plan.

107
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,700
What are you looking for?

108
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
I've been keeping your taste for a while.

109
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
I'll make some for you.

110
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Please have a taste.

111
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
Please.

112
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Your Highness.

113
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,700
Your Highness.

114
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,700
The history of Ditu has been under control for hundreds of years.

115
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
What's the situation?

116
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Unfortunately, I've learned from the books.

117
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,700
It's hard to pass on the knowledge.

118
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,700
You're young and young.

119
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
You're a noble man.

120
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,700
Why do you think so?

121
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,700
Your Highness, I have no idea.

122
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,700
Actually, I've always wanted to be a colleague

123
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,700
and fight for the battlefield.

124
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,700
Unfortunately, my father was ill in the early morning.

125
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,700
My mother was sick too.

126
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
She passed away early.

127
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Only my brother and I were together.

128
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,700
We were forced into the Ma family's house.

129
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Everyone says that I'm old and young.

130
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
I'm deeply hurt.

131
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,700
But I don't know how my revenge will end.

132
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Zi Chuan is the most important now.

133
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
He's a farmer.

134
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,700
It's the time for you to fight for the battlefield.

135
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
It's dangerous to be in the battlefield.

136
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,700
It's not easy to get rid of the enemy.

137
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
It's a good time to save the country.

138
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,700
I didn't expect you to be so thoughtful.

139
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,700
I'm happy.

140
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,700
You're willing to be my friend today.

141
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,700
I'm glad to be your friend.

142
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
Don't be so kind.

143
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,700
I've never seen you before.

144
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
I'm so happy to see you tonight.

145
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,700
I'm so happy to see you.

146
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
Your Highness,

147
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,700
I'm so happy to see you tonight.

148
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Your Highness,

149
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,700
I'm so happy to see you tonight.

150
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:03,220
Xiao Ning, happy birthday.

151
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:11,220
You must grow bigger, but I will always protect you.

152
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,380
I'm a little drunk.

153
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,740
How could you hesitate before me?

154
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,660
No!

155
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,800
All this has nothing to do with Tai Li.

156
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,460
Don't you think that when you stood upon his place of residence,

157
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,140
I got emotional?

158
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,900
Just how are you?

159
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,940
This diary has noadel thinking.

160
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,980
I'm just curious about what you were thinking.

161
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:50,960
Go back.

162
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,380
Okay

163
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,760
Find the

164
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,780
Surely, there is evidence

165
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,400
About 10 meters in the sorcery

166
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,620
If they alguma chance

167
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,220
Brother

168
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,500
Tell me a story

169
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,960
There is a perpetrator

170
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,520
There is a murderer near General identification

171
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,620
The suspect may rise from the city

172
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,700
watching

173
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,380
I'm afraid it's impossible for Xiao Cong to escape from here.

174
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,380
General, why don't we kill them?

175
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,380
I've just seen the carriage.

176
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,380
It's decorated with good flowers.

177
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,380
It came out from the bottom of the private forest.

178
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,380
The one inside must be Noble Lady Da Guang.

179
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,380
We'll take this carriage.

180
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,380
They won't dare to act rashly.

181
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,380
Okay.

182
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,380
I'll go and get the soldiers.

183
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,380
We'll meet in Nancheng.

184
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,380
I'll go and get the soldiers.

185
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,380
I'll go and get the soldiers.

186
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,380
We'll meet in Nancheng.

187
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,380
Who's there?

188
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,380
Hold him!

189
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,380
Who's there?

190
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,380
Stop!

191
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,380
Why did you stop?

192
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,380
It's you.

193
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,380
It's you?

194
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,380
You're just doing this to your benefactor?

195
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,380
Don't stop me.

196
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,380
Why are you following me?

197
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,380
You stole the carriage.

198
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,380
You stole the carriage and wanted to take the carriage.

199
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,380
You wanted too much.

200
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,380
It's a strict investigation on the street.

201
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,380
Of course, I need to do another disguise.

202
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,380
You're the one who chose the carriage of the capital.

203
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,380
It's not good to be in the capital.

204
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,380
So you're not following me.

205
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,380
It's for this carriage.

206
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,380
I see.

207
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,380
You should leave now.

208
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,380
What's the difference between this carriage and the carriage?

209
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
It's for the people in the carriage.

210
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,380
I have to take the carriage.

211
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,380
Men in the carriage, you can change yourself.

212
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,380
But women can't.

213
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,380
With a master like you, you can protect them secretly.

214
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,380
I'm afraid the identity of the woman in the carriage is not the same.

215
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,380
I'll have to use it more.

216
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,380
I'm telling you. You...

217
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,380
This is the capital.

218
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,380
The army will come soon.

219
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,380
You'll be in trouble.

220
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,380
I know.

221
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,380
So I want to see your friend.

222
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
You're so strong.

223
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,380
Get out of the way.

224
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,380
You're good at using my blood knife.

225
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,380
Don't be so stingy.

226
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,380
Who's there? Stop him.

227
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,380
Hurry up.

228
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,380
I'll be there.

229
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,380
You're so generous.

230
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,380
You're really embarrassing the army.

231
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,380
You'll be in trouble tomorrow.

232
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
I deserve to die.

233
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,380
Lord Ding Ling.

234
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,380
What's going on?

235
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,380
You don't have to worry about me.

236
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,380
I heard that there are criminals in the village.

237
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,380
The soldiers will investigate it.

238
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
Let's go somewhere else.

239
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,380
I'll take my leave.

240
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,380
Search the alley near the village.

241
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,380
Yes.

242
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
Why aren't you leaving?

243
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,380
I was going to leave.

244
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,380
I saw someone robbing the waist belt.

245
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,380
I was worried that I might get in the trouble.

246
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,380
Lord Ding Ling is in the car.

247
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,380
You're the only one who can rob the waist belt.

248
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,380
Are you the second one?

249
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,380
Are you kidding me?

250
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,380
I saw you carrying the truck.

251
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,380
If you didn't appears,

252
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,380
I'd have given it to Zhifu.

253
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,380
It's a huge land now.

254
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,380
He can't even run.

255
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,380
Are you still here?

256
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,380
I'm here.

257
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,380
I've prepared the grains for you.

258
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,380
You're in charge of the brand.

259
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,380
I must make the decision.

260
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,340
You've heard it. You'll be the leader.

261
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,300
Go.

262
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,460
Brother.

263
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,980
I have a request.

264
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:28,820
Okay.

265
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,180
I'll send you to your mansion.

266
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,900
Ge Qing.

267
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,260
Send Ma Wei back first.

268
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,700
I'll send you back to your mansion.

269
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,180
Yes.

270
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:47,780
Yes.

271
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,260
I saved your life.

272
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,620
This time,

273
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,540
he saved me three times.

274
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,900
It's good that you're fine.

275
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,740
But after this process,

276
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,540
I'm afraid I can't use this token.

277
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,180
Find a place to rest.

278
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,980
We'll find a way out tomorrow.

279
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:18,900
What about you?

280
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,940
I have something to do.

281
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,900
I'll meet you later.

282
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:58,780
Ro-

283
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,220
Nian.

284
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,340
You.

285
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,740
is more important than the weapons.

286
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,500
Compared with the weapons,

287
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,060
I wish you could find a more gentle,

288
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,900
more considerate,

289
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,460
and more romantic one.

290
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,020
I can make you feel more at ease.

291
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,820
You must find

292
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,220
someone who really loves you.

293
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,580
Because you won't be bullied.

294
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,900
What am I thinking?

295
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,340
How could you be bullied by others?

296
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,060
No matter what kind of person you are,

297
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,180
remember,

298
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,940
don't think about me again.

299
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,860
I'm not afraid of you.

300
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,260
I'm not afraid of you.

301
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,500
I'm not afraid of you.

302
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,940
I'm not afraid of you.

303
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,500
I'm not afraid of you.

304
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,060
I'm not afraid of you.

305
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,660
I'm not afraid of you.

306
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,300
I'm not afraid of you.

307
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,100
I'm not afraid of you.

308
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,900
I'm not afraid of you.

309
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,580
I'm not afraid of you.

310
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,820
I'm not afraid of you.

311
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,660
I'm not afraid of you.

312
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,680
Listen!

313
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,060
FollowingÖ

314
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,760
Of course, you must follow me.

315
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,860
Qing Gu has closed Force Anyway.

316
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,260
Are you my boyfriend?

317
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,180
Go.

318
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,180
I'll listen to you if you want to live.

319
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,180
Okay.

320
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,180
Now, the woman is back.

321
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,180
You can't do it again.

322
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,180
Please trust me.

323
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,180
For this cooperation,

324
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,180
I chose the best song.

325
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
I'm really happy.

326
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,180
How can you forget it?

327
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,180
I...

328
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,180
I'm going back to the hospital.

329
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,180
Get up and have a good rest.

330
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,180
You should go home early.

331
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,180
Don't come over here.

332
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,180
I'm so worried that you're so strong.

333
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,180
Why are you here?

334
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,180
Brother Shu, are you still here?

335
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,180
Don't worry.

336
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,180
I've been here all this time.

337
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,180
I'll go back to the hospital.

338
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,180
Brother Shu.

339
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,180
Brother Shu.

340
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,180
Xiaomei.

341
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,180
Xiaomei.

342
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,180
Miss.

343
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,180
Xiaomei.

344
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,180
Miss, you're awake.

345
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,180
Xiaomei, where's Brother Xiuxiu?

346
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,180
Lord Xiuxiu.

347
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,180
Lord Xiuxiu is not here.

348
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,180
Brother Xiuxiu is back.

349
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
I heard his voice yesterday.

350
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,180
You were on the journey last night.

351
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,180
Lord Dingling sent you back.

352
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,180
Lord Xiuxiu is not here.

353
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,180
I think I saw him yesterday.

354
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,180
Miss.

355
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,180
He even played our song.

356
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,180
Miss, are you okay?

357
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,180
Miss, are you okay?

358
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,180
Lord Mawei is still waiting outside.

359
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,180
How about I ask him to leave first?

360
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,180
Yes.

361
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,180
He sent me back last night.

362
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,180
I might have drunk too much last night.

363
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,180
Please wait for a while.

364
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,180
Yes.

365
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,180
Miss.

366
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,180
Yes.

367
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,680
Miss, thank you.

368
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,680
I've been Watching P немpia about you last night.

369
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,680
We happened to meet.

370
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,160
to fail oragne your Highness.

371
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,960
Just wait for the other party to got engaged.

372
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,400
To sort out Master Ding Ling,

we quickly his it just when we got here.

374
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,880
Run around a bit longer.

375
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,620
I want to spend my days

376
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,560
being a setup boy

377
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,900
Did Si Ke really get caught?

378
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,100
Master Ding Ling has been busy with this.

379
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,140
Lord Log bot

380
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,960
满迪勒柄 아 girlfriend

381
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,800
Si Ke must be so busy withging this mess.

382
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,680
I'm just asking you to accept my condolences.

383
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,680
I'm really sorry for your kindness.

384
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,680
You don't have to blame yourself.

385
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,680
I'm fine.

386
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,680
Isn't this good?

387
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,680
I brought some honey with me.

388
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,680
It's so sweet and delicious.

389
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,680
It's as sweet as a star.

390
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,680
Lord Ma, you're not feeling well?

391
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
Are you all right?

392
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
Thank you for your concern.

393
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,680
As long as you're well, I'll be fine.

394
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,680
In order to help me see my daughter out here,

395
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,640
I decided to rumors that your mistress微妆

396
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,680
has a great power over Too Hot.

397
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,680
And therefore, I have accepted a dowry for you.

398
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Lord Ma, follow me with the foodie.

399
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
Okay.

400
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,680
How come even a thief can't catch him?

401
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Did he catch him or did he let go of him?

402
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Check the territory carefully.

403
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,680
Yes.

404
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,680
The gate is very strict.

405
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,680
It's also a check-in and a counter-check.

406
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,680
We really have no choice.

407
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,680
The big beard is really our precious.

408
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Guard.

409
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
The army is calling the number and the date.

410
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,680
This is the carriage of the commander.

411
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,680
Why did the minister come in person?

412
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,680
The person from the Shulü Temple came out today.

413
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
He's the commander of the Shulü Temple.

414
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,680
He's the commander of the Shulü Temple.

415
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
I can't be clear about the situation.

416
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,680
The carriage of the Shulü Temple can't be taken in person.

417
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,680
Stay here for a while.

418
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,680
I'll go back first.

419
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,680
By the way,

420
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,680
take this.

421
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
The Shulü Temple's handkerchief?

422
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
I already have the Shulü Temple's handkerchief.

423
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
You made a mess tonight.

424
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,680
You can take it with you tomorrow.

425
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,680
I'll go back to the Shulü Temple.

426
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,680
I'll go back to the Shulü Temple.

427
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,680
I'll go back to the Shulü Temple.

428
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:36,680
Doctor, my way is to break the dirty water into the commander's head.

429
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
Tell me.

430
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,680
The army's number is calling today.

431
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,680
You're really a coward.

432
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,680
I'm the commander of the Shulü Temple.

433
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,680
If you delay the matter,

434
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,680
can you all be responsible?

435
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,680
It's the people from the Black Wu Gang.

436
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Catch him.

437
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Go.

438
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
The gate is closed.

439
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,680
We're investigating the commander's handkerchief.

440
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,680
My Lord.

441
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Who knows who went through the Black Wu Gang?

442
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,680
The bed is out of the city.

443
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,680
Why did my handkerchief go into the Black Wu Gang's handkerchief?

444
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,680
I've checked it.

445
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,680
Our people have no handkerchief in their hands.

446
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Although they did receive the handkerchief,

447
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,680
it was only a few months ago.

448
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,680
Why did the bell go out?

449
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,680
I'm afraid it was because we checked it and made it in a mess.

450
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,680
Even so,

451
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,680
why did he find it out so coincidentally?

452
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,680
I'm not good at this.

453
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,680
Please punish me.

454
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Punish?

455
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,680
What's the use of punishing?

456
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,680
I can't be punished.

457
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
Lord Lu.

458
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,680
Why did you put such a big handkerchief in my hand?

459
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,680
Lord Bell.

460
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,680
Where's the person?

461
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,680
He ran away.

462
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,680
How?

463
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,680
I've already chased him.

464
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,680
But I wanted to interrogate him.

465
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,680
So I didn't kill him.

466
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
But I accidentally let him run away.

467
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
Someone could run away from your brother's handkerchief?

468
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
Did he run away?

469
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
Or did you just push him away?

470
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,680
What do you mean?

471
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
I haven't asked you yet.

472
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,680
You came to question me.

473
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Is this really your commander's handkerchief?

474
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Or did you deliberately leave the handkerchief to Black Wu Gang

475
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,680
to secretly collude and sell military supplies?

476
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
This matter.

477
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,680
I will find out the truth.

478
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
Okay.

479
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,680
I believe Lord Lu will find out the truth.

480
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,680
If you need my help,

481
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,680
you can contact me anytime.

482
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,680
I won't.

483
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
Then I'll wait for Lord Lu's good news.

484
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
Lord, do you want to investigate?

485
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,680
Yes.

486
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,680
I'll ask him to show us the appearance of that big fox.

487
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,680
Let's see what kind of background he is.

488
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,680
Yes.

489
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,680
Brother.

490
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Brother.

491
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
There are so many teeth in the capital.

492
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
You have taken so many Yao Pai.

493
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
You can beat them up.

494
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
Okay.

495
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,680
Let's go.

496
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,680
Get in the car.

497
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
Brother.

498
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,680
Brother.

499
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,680
Brother.

500
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
Brother.

501
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,680
Brother.

502
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,680
Brother.

503
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,680
I left this time.

504
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
I don't know when I'll see you again.

505
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,680
I really don't want to see you that much.

506
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,680
Anyway, I'll just go back to my car.

507
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
Let's go.

508
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,680
Brother.

509
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,680
Brother.

510
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
Come out.

511
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,680
Brother.

512
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,680
Brother.

513
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,680
How did you know that we're in there?

514
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,680
When I just went out of the city,

515
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,680
there was only one person in the car.

516
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,680
But I just took a ride

517
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,680
and he was asleep.

518
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,680
When I went out anyway,

519
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,680
I went to the city.

520
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
It's okay.

521
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,600
Right?

522
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,280
Next time, I'll let the complications also be treated艵

523
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,060
I think I messed up

524
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,900
Xiaoyu is trying to sweep this base

525
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,620

This should be my fourth rescue

528
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,260
Why do you remember so clearly

529
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,800
in the Guild.

530
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,060
It can be very troublesome.

531
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,680
You're a master of being오�òn Flyingbear.

532

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,660
I will defeat you first.

534
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,000

551
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,420
Miss Lin Yu, I'm sorry to trouble you.

552
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,420
Third Brother, the mountain is high and the water is long.

Someone is meeting you.

00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,760
We tried Không,

560
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,660
Thief's Sect was all defeated.

561
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,920
Miss Lin Yu,

562
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,700
David Long took in Buddhist~~~~

563
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,940
We approach them.

564
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,420
There is no way.

565
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,500
Just sit down to calm us down.

566
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,620
Just sit down and calm us down.

567
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,140
Lord Jinxia has created aório in Banan area with the name,

568
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,260
Black Aleech.

569
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,180
After arriving at the castle,

570
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,240
we immediately find the Harper definition here.

571
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,900
I know each Interestingly,

572
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,860
they are both the confirmation of the dyeing of grass and its official reality,

573
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,640
which shows that the white part was just a piece of cloth.

574
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
Let's just go to DON Forest.

575
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,640
You are really amazing.

576
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,640
Chuan.

577
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,640
Chuan.

578
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,640
There is a new military code.

579
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
Take the gold and gold.

580
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,640
Take it out and have a look.

581
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,640
It's empty.

582
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
It's empty again.

583
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,640
Chuan, it's my turn.

584
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,640
Who is this?

585
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,640
Here.

586
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,640
We are about to finish the food.

587
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
Prince Guangming will come back soon.

588
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
We will be in trouble.

589
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
So soon?

590
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,640
Didn't you say it'd take seven days to finish?

591
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,640
Sister Chuan, why don't you think about it?

592
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,640
We have been trapped here for more than 10 days.

593
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,640
I have tried to keep it.

594
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,640
If it's really a war,

595
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,640
we will be doomed.

596
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,640
General, pass through this forest.

597
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,640
There's a forest ahead.

598
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,640
Okay.

599
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,640
You really don't want to give up?

600
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,140
You have to work with money.

601
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,640
You have to think of a way to save your life.

602
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,640
Okay.

603
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,640
General!

604
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,640
You've been waiting for me here for so long.

605
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Do you know why I want to go to the Lin family?

606
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,640
To find the old soldier.

607
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,640
Do you know who I am?

608
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,640
Is it important to find the old soldier?

609
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,640
Since you're here, come out!

610
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,640
I can't stand it anymore!

611
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,640
Bring all the goods here.

612
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,640
Okay.

613
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,640
Please.

614
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
Look for the old soldier.

615
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,640
Excuse me.

616
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
The old soldier.

617
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,640
The old soldier.

618
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,640
The two of you are in the same army.

619
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,640
They're in the same army.

620
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,640
The two of you are in the same army.

621
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,640
The two of you are in the same army.

622
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
The two of you are in the same army.

623
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
Let's start our performance.

624
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,640
I'm not a ghost.

625
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,640
I'm sleepy.

626
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,640
Mr. Yuan.

627
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,640
Please.

628
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,640
Sorry.

629
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,640
You're not as good as you were.

630
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,640
You're not as good as you were.

631
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,640
You're so arrogant.

632
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,640
I don't know either.

633
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,640
I'm not...

634
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,640
I'm not...

635
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,640
Even if he's really a ghost,

636
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,640
open your mouth.

637
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,640
Open your mouth.

638
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,640
I'm singing with my heart.

639
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,640
I'm singing with my heart.

640
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,640
I'm singing with my heart.

641
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,640
The two of you are in the same army.

642
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,640
I'm singing with my heart.

643
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,640
Wait.

644
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,640
Don't say that.

645
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,640
Don't say that.

646
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,640
They're all making up jokes.

647
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,640
They're not serious.

648
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,640
They're not serious.

649
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640
They're not serious.

650
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,640
Excuse me.

651
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,640
One more time.

652
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,640
No more serious.

653
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,640
No more serious.

654
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,640
No more serious.

655
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,760
He is so cute.

656
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,560
Rallying with a song,

657
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,320
yogurt has originated from the innocence of the king.

658
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:29,920
Ok.

659
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,800
I'm sorry.

660
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,720
Those people willing to leave for the capital

661
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,560
are responsible

662
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,720
for taking out his duty.

663
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,320
Youあぁ

664
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:43,680
Understand

665
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,720
If he wasn't in Medusa,

666
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,400
he might not know

667
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,840
her

668
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,740
my baby

669
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,200
My love

670
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,140
My love

671
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,200
Why did you ask.

672
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:12,240
I didn't show my Tourism

673
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,440
Come on

674
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,960
Let me come
