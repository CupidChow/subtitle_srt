The Best Cooking Secrets

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You cooked for us and even did the dishes.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You don't have to do this.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No, the beginning and the end of cooking

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
is from the ingredients to the dishes.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Oh, right.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Did you know that your dream was to be a chef?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I thought so.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
They even opened a restaurant.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's called Three Frogs Cuisine.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You didn't open it in Korea, did you?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If I opened it in Korea, I wouldn't have known.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm the executive director of the Korean Food Association.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Mr. Jin, you're so funny.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You're so serious.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You're good at joking.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not joking.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm serious and quiet.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You're so funny.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is driving me crazy.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I didn't even drink. Why am I so drunk?

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What did you say?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I mean, we didn't even know each other until yesterday.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We ate together,

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
talked,

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and laughed.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's all weird.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It feels like a dream.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Is it because of the time difference?

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's not a normal relationship.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
According to the Law,

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
it's a relationship that took place after 3,000 years of fear.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What do you mean?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In Buddhism,

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
it's divided into times of fear and human relationships.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Once every 100 years,

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the water drops fall off

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and it takes time to remove the rocks that are as big as a house.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
To meet and spend a night together in one place,

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
we needed 3,000 times of fear.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's how precious a relationship is.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I think I can help you.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
3,000 times of fear.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm so tired.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What is that?

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What is that?

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Dalle?

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Dalle?

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What is it?

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What's going on? Where are you?

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Dalle?

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Dalle?

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Dalle?

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Dalle?

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Dalle?

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I think it was before I met you.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Sometimes, things like this happen.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What about when you're hurt?

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, what about you?

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm fine too.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What do you think?

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh...

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Dalle, what are you doing?

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Wait.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Close your eyes.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
My eyes?

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Your eyes.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You can't open your eyes until you leave.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Never.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You can't open your eyes.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't open your eyes.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't open your eyes.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't open your eyes.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't open your eyes.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't open your eyes.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't open your eyes.

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't open your eyes.

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't open your eyes.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't open your eyes.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't open your eyes.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't open your eyes.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't open your eyes.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Don't open your eyes.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't open your eyes.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The street is ringing

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I want to hear you sing

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
from our memories

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
My heart is full

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
of your small breath

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and your preciousness

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're like a rainbow

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What?

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What happened?

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, nothing. I was cool.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I was cool.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I was cool.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I was cool.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Okay.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes, I understand.

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll see you in a few.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What did you say?

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What?

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're suing me?

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're trying to make me

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
look like a fake?

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't worry.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll do whatever it takes

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
to keep you from getting hurt.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Our lawyers are good.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I pay them a lot of salary.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The woman from the front coast

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
asked you to

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
thank her.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
To me?

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I haven't paid the money yet,

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
but I found out that it was a fake

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
thanks to you.

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't think she'll work

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
with a high-profile.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
She might be suspected

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
of other works.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The problem is with

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Mr. Hitonari.

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I found him.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What?

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He attended Yang Don's party

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
with our lawyer.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He's so cute.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He's a great dancer

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
with Yang Don's people.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He drinks and dances

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
until he becomes a ballerina.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He's still on a diet.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No way.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What a relief.

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
there's bad news.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Our employees are here.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
They're here.

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So I have to go.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Oh, really?

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The weather is nice.

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm glad

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
that our schedule was well-arranged.

151
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What did I do?

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I told you it wouldn't be a big deal.

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I told you it wouldn't be a big deal.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What about the employees?

164
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
They said they're here.

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll get going.

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Ms. Dal.

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yesterday,

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I was grateful.

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I had fun too.

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Bye.

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Excuse me.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll be busy tomorrow.

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I have important business

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and I have to check

176
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
other areas before that.

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I have to get the flight tickets

178
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and leave for Amsterdam

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
tomorrow morning.

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I have meetings

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
even when I'm in Korea.

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I have to report on the contract.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's my situation.

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you were this relaxed,

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
you could have experienced

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
the beauty of the Netherlands.

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But I'll definitely stop by the museum.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What?

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll try to find a way

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
to stop by the museum.

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll see if the Korean people

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
like the pictures or the pictures.

194
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll stop by the cafeteria

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
which is not as good as your place.

196
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And...

197
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll meet you there.

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay.

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll see you there.

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll be there.

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You have to wait for me.

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I promise.

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Bye.

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Bye.

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Mr. Jin?

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That watch is really important to me.

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So you have to take it

208
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
when we meet next time.

209
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I promise.

210
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Mr. Jin!

211
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
How did you fall in love at first sight?

212
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's not easy to explain.

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It must be fate.

214
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Okay!

215
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Bye.

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What? Where is the museum?

217
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't even know the phone number.

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Wait!

219
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Sorry!

220
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Let go!

221
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's go!

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Mr. Jin!

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Whoa!

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Watch where you're going!

225
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Mr. Jin!

226
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Mr. Jin!

227
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Mr. Jin!

228
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Mr. Jin!

229
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm here.

230
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What's the name?

231
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
How did you find me

232
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
with a name you don't even know?

233
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You said you went home.

234
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What's the name of your neighborhood?

235
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I went to get a car all night.

236
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
How would I know the name of my neighborhood?

237
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You're not drunk, are you?

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Well...

239
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What?

240
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Father, didn't you have a dream?

241
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
No, I didn't.

242
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I mean...

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I cooked for you and told you some funny stories.

244
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Right.

245
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I went to a party and made a hole

246
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
in a $1.6 billion painting.

247
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
$1.6 billion?

248
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
$1.6 billion?

249
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
$1.6 billion?

250
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Mr. Jin!

251
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I must have had a dream.

252
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Wait.

253
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Father, where's the watch?

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What?

255
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's a wristwatch.

256
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I told you to leave it because it's too expensive.

257
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's a black one.

258
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, really?

259
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Why are you trying to turn it off?

260
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You can turn it off.

261
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Could it be that woman...

262
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
There's a black-haired woman.

263
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
She only talks very smartly.

264
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's what she's like.

265
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
How did you know?

266
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
She laughs at everything you say.

267
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Right.

268
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
She seems to be a good person, but she's very quick.

269
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Right, she is.

270
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
She's a thief in professional terms.

271
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm going to go.

272
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry, can I get you my phone?

273
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
How can you quit your job

274
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and quit your job for a watch?

275
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
If it's worth a few billion dollars,

276
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
it's not a bad deal.

277
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
She was crying in front of the hotel.

278
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's acting, of course.

279
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No, she's not that kind of woman.

280
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There must be a reason.

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Oh, my.

282
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
There's no thief without a reason.

283
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
This is so much fun.

284
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
When you regret something,

285
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
just say thank you.

286
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's not a normal relationship.

287
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
According to the law,

288
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
we've been together for over 3,000 years.

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's how precious it is.

290
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
How dare you say that to me?

291
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You're dead if you get caught.

292
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You die!

293
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Hello.

294
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Hi.

295
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Hello.

296
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Hello.

297
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
In this 22 years of experience in the art sector,

298
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
as well as in October 2019

299
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and so on,

300
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:22,760
I as Lee J 속못은

301
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
have been splendid in my career.

302
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
SStudio's celebration

303
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,560
being gateskeeper at a brothel

304
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,520
as well as the eldest son...

305
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,720
Just a minute.

306
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,360
Mr. Cha.

307
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,720
I am giving up that sorrows

308
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,220
as the eldest son left us all this.

309
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,760
However, Kim Siyeong, the eldest son of Cheongsong

310
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,800
and the representative of the family,

311
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,440
will be maintained by her father

312
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,100
and run the art gallery of Cheongsong without any problems.

313
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,840
And the cultural welfare business...

314
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,100
Isn't that Jang Taejin's car?

315
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,300
The world's Jang Taejin?

316
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,500
I think that's him.

317
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,600
Mr. Jang!

318
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,840
I didn't say anything!

319
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Let's go.

320
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,840
Mr. Jang Taejin, are you okay?

321
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,840
What's the matter?

322
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,880
Are you okay?

323
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,280
I said, are you okay?

324
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,480
Are you okay?

325
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,080
Are you okay?

326
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,480
Are you okay?

327
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,680
Are you okay?

328
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,040
It's a false alarm.

329
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,440
We have an offer.

330
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,940
I've been told that Cheongsong Art Gallery

331
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,040
is having a hard time these days.

332
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,040
We'll bring you in under much better conditions

333
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,440
than other competition companies.

334
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,980
If you have any collections...

335
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,280
Excuse me.

336
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,380
Wait.

337
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,880
You're being rude to someone.

338
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,040
I'll borrow a famous song from a man of high rank.

339
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,040
It's a greeting that reminds me of a saying

340
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,640
that I should give to a family that's in sorrow.

341
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,040
If you don't know, please come down.

342
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,040
I'm sorry.

343
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,280
I'll think about it.

344
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,240
I'll borrow a famous song from a man of high rank.

345
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,640
I'll borrow a famous song from a man of high rank.

346
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,940
Thank you for finding me.

347
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,440
Don't!

348
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,800
Oh, right. Deputy Executive Officer Jang Tae Jin of the world group...

349
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,900
Who are you calling a director?

350
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,080
What about you?

351
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,940
Why did he want to marry Director Ahn's daughter?

352
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,620
Why do you say late-night chat Mer这.

353
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:54,840
Director.

354
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
It's a lie.

355
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Tell me it's a lie.

356
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:22,840
I'm sorry.

357
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,840
I think all the regular customers will be here.

358
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,840
Take good care of them so they don't worry.

359
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,840
Yes, I will do that.

360
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,840
And I want you to know about the financial condition

361
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,840
of the Cheongsong Art Museum.

362
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,840
I won't be quick.

363
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:10,840
Okay.

364
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Director.

365
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,840
Director.

366
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:37,840
Director.

367
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Dad.

368
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
What are you thinking about?

369
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Why are you so relaxed?

370
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
Oh, no.

371
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,840
I just have a lot to think about.

372
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
You haven't gone to work yet.

373
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
I must have been sick.

374
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,840
I was busy preparing for the Netherlands

375
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
so I was busy.

376
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
I said I'd go to work tomorrow

377
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
so don't worry too much.

378
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,840
Oh, well...

379
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,840
What kind of art museum is it?

380
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
What?

381
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,840
The museum is a waste of money.

382
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,840
Why is it a waste?

383
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Why?

384
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,840
You can't be sure, can you?

385
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,840
I'm sure the museum recognized it and took care of it.

386
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
The museum is a waste of money

387
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,840
because it's a waste of money.

388
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,840
I guess so.

389
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Bye.

390
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Bye.

391
00:24:47,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Today.

392
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Do you see receiver?

393
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,840
You're你要ing a lot of work.

394
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,180
From Madame leaves began to fall.

395
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,460
Really.

396
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,420
I only have to make souped up tripes?

397
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,700
How many bowls could that be.

398
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,000
Dae tat.

399
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,640
Do you know who I am?

400
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,680
No, no.

401
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,420
You should eat and get some strength.

402
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,820
If you hide in the North,

403
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,860
the penguins will strangle you.

404
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,860
If you hide in the South,

405
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,720
even if you hit a white-tailed tiger,

406
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,460
I'll catch you with my own two feet.

407
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,860
With my own two feet!

408
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,760
The polar bear lives in the North

409
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,040
and the penguins live in the South.

410
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,140
You startled me.

411
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,880
Did you come all the way to the sick boss' house

412
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,980
to point that out?

413
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,520
You're so loud.

414
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,380
I thought you couldn't even drink water.

415
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,980
So I thought you'd at least eat this.

416
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,720
Who died?

417
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,420
Why are you starving?

418
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,300
I know.

419
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,700
Why did I worry about something so sad?

420
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,900
Gosh.

421
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,940
That looks good.

422
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,840
How's it going with the Netherlands?

423
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,580
Well...

424
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,080
How much did you pay for the land?

425
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,720
The detective still hasn't found a single person.

426
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,720
That's the Netherlands.

427
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,320
The time doesn't pass by so quickly.

428
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,660
I called the detective again

429
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,460
and he said he'd pay me 10 times more if I find him.

430
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,820
What? 10 times more?

431
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,020
He can't even get scared because he's next to me.

432
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,260
He needs to have that money to work.

433
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,440
I'm just curious.

434
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,080
Did you want to find the watch or the woman?

435
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,940
Of course I did.

436
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,880
Yes, I did.

437
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,180
We're not seeing each other.

438
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,660
Shi Gye- electronic produce.

439
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,720
Gosh.

440
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,660
I'm sorry.

441
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,300
Did you ask the bank

442
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,400
to report the loan situation?

443
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Well...

444
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,800
Everyone was busy.

445
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,900
So we decided to meet again today.

446
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,200
We've been investigating the loan situation.

447
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,000
The financial situation is worse than I thought.

448
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,400
I heard that the murder art museum

449
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,020
is standing out,

450
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,280
but I never would have known it would be this large.

451
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,760
The rich chargeL loaded with wealth

452
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,300
came to life.

453
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,700
Since Jung Geurae is an artist,

454
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,460
how can he be un gymnastic

455
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,900
for 40 years here

456
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,740
without him here at his coração years ago?

457
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,980
Should I say that he's full of respect

458
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,680
You're like a pathetic person.

459
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,580
I'm planning to sell all my assets except the museum.

460
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,880
Including this house.

461
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,480
If you find a suitable buyer...

462
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,620
I can't sell the real estate that was tied to the development

463
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,880
proposal.

464
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,880
It's still under the bank's protection.

465
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,080
The property tax will be paid soon.

466
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,880
Do you have a plan for that?

467
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,680
I don't know.

468
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,880
Maybe...

469
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,580
I might have to give up my inheritance.

470
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,380
Where are you going with that money?

471
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,280
I have to visit the hospital and I have to pay the bank.

472
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,380
If it's about money, you can ask me to do it.

473
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,180
It's my personal business. Why would I ask you to do it?

474
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,380
How can I trust you?

475
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,080
I'm really in a hurry.

476
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,680
The auction date is coming.

477
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,980
You can't see me and you can't reach me.

478
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,880
If you tell me where you went to work,

479
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,480
I'll go and find you myself.

480
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,780
I beg you.

481
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,480
Mr. Ji isn't in Korea right now.

482
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,880
What?

483
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,980
He went to South Africa for the international

484
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,280
financial symposium. He won't be back in Korea.

485
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,680
He's going to the stock room in South Africa.

486
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,180
Because of the global economic crisis.

487
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:59,480
And he's going to New York for his daughter's wedding.

488
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,780
I don't know when he'll be back.

489
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,080
Hey!

490
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,080
Mister.

491
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,080
Yes?

492
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,580
It's me.

493
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,680
When did he come to Korea?

494
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,980
He never had a second-hand business.

495
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,180
And his credit rating isn't bad either.

496
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,580
If you suddenly want him to cancel the auction...

497
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,080
Please do me a favor.

498
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,680
I'll find a way to get rid of him quickly.

499
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,980
Mister!

500
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,980
I beg you, Dali.

501
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,180
Please save me.

502
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,980
Your father is going to kill you.

503
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,980
It's not about the credit rating.

504
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,480
Your father was a credit.

505
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,980
Your father is dead. He didn't even tell me.

506
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,680
He said he was going to the art museum.

507
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,080
Let's just leave everything else

508
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,580
and start with our bank account.

509
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,780
That's what we have to do.

510
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,880
Dali.

511
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,980
Are we strangers?

512
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Yes?

513
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,680
I'm your father's best friend.

514
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,780
Dali, please.

515
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,480
Please save me.

516
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,580
Okay?

517
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,080
Did you have to cancel the bank account?

518
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,180
Turn your head.

519
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,880
If the bank is sold,

520
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
the bank will be sold off and the account will be

521
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,380
sold off.

522
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,580
Why do you have to cancel the bank account?

523
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,180
Money is money when you touch it,

524
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,680
look at it, and get a number.

525
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,180
If you get hacked, will you take responsibility?

526
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,480
You're so suspicious and cautious.

527
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,980
How could you fall for a woman

528
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,980
who doesn't know anything and throw away

529
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,980
that expensive watch?

530
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,480
Who would fall for her?

531
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,280
Darn it.

532
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,680
Dali.

533
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,780
I didn't get paid again.

534
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,580
Was she pretty?

535
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,880
What?

536
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,080
Was she pretty?

537
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,280
The Dutch woman.

538
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,480
That's not it.

539
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,180
Then she must have lost weight.

540
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,780
That's not it.

541
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,580
Or maybe she took medicine.

542
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,780
Like a sleeping pill.

543
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,180
Darn it.

544
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,080
Then what is it?

545
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,380
How did she fall for someone

546
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,580
who doesn't even know a watch?

547
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,580
As a person,

548
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,180
she wouldn't have given up on that woman

549
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,680
if she didn't believe in her personality.

550
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,180
Bye.

551
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,980
Well...

552
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,680
Mr. Jin?

553
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,880
That watch is really important to me.

554
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,580
So I have to bring it out when we meet next time.

555
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,880
I have to.

556
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,280
Well, of course.

557
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,980
As long as I'm not crazy.

558
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,380
What?

559
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,380
What is it?

560
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,480
Nothing.

561
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,280
I was just looking at the focus.

562
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,480
Did she come to Korea?

563
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,280
No way.

564
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,380
She's always running away.

565
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,680
I guess so.

566
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,080
Hey, you're drunk.

567
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,480
You should've taken your glasses off.

568
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,880
I'm not drunk.

569
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,180
Hey, you're drunk.

570
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,580
I'm not.

571
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,180
You're not drunk.

572
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,580
I'm just a little drunk.

573
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,780
You're always drunk.

574
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,880
Ma'am, be quiet.

575
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,280
I'm not drunk.

576
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,380
Why are you being like that?

577
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,180
Are you not drunk?

578
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,380
I'm not drunk.

579
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,080
Who is this Mr. Ju Hantak?

580
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,380
Hey, you!

581
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,480
What did you say?

582
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,980
I'm here to see Mr. Ju Hantak.

583
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,480
He's not here today. Did you not call him?

584
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,180
I don't have his number.

585
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,080
I just heard that he works here.

586
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,780
Come back tomorrow.

587
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,980
Or you can leave your number here.

588
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,280
Excuse me.

589
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,280
Please call him.

590
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,780
The director passed away.

591
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,380
He didn't eat or sleep.

592
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,280
He might catch a person.

593
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,780
Thank you.

594
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
Sure.

595
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
Why did you call me when I didn't know you were here?

596
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,680
You punk.

597
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,580
Go.

598
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,480
Is this the woman?

599
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,680
Yes.

600
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,580
You punk.

601
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,380
Sir, please sit down.

602
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,380
What?

603
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,880
I mean...

604
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,380
You should've gotten some meds

605
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,180
before you went to the hospital.

606
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,380
You don't have to.

607
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,080
I didn't get it because I didn't need it.

608
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,380
I didn't get it because of the money, did I?

609
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,580
I don't think you got it because of the money.

610
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,980
Well, if you think about the money you spent on the watch,

611
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,480
you should save at least one.

612
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,080
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

613
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,780
I'm looking for it.

614
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,780
I'll chase the earth to the end

615
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,080
and find what I need.

616
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,880
Get off the car and go home.

617
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,380
Why? You should go home.

618
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,580
No. I have to go to the pharmacy.

619
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,180
You again?

620
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,280
What happened is that

621
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,980
students come to the police station more often

622
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,780
than they do when they go to school.

623
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,780
What?

624
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,580
If you feed and sleep the kids

625
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,480
with the money from the orphanage,

626
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,380
they'll be able to live quietly

627
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,780
without talking nonsense.

628
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,180
It's because of kids like you

629
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,080
that the kids who don't have parents are being bullied.

630
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,580
They grow up without even seeing it

631
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,180
and are being bullied by the kids.

632
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,680
What?

633
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,180
You punk.

634
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,480
You punk.

635
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,880
You're going to get your eyes

636
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,880
on me because of this?

637
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,080
You're not going to get your eyes on me?

638
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,280
Let go!

639
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,280

00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,380
The mahjong is on fire.

00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,980
The mahjong is on fire 2.

643
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,380
The queen of the prize pool.

644
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,080
The treasure hunt in the golden city.

645
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,080
The recruitment of the talented cat.

646
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,680
The prize pool captain.

647
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,080
The super high rate of compensation.

648
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080
The reward rate is high.

649
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,980
There are many opportunities for revenge.

650
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,280
Hurry up and join.

651
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,280
AOMG New Beijing Entertainment City 772772.

652
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,980
The detective just gave the victim

653
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,680
a physical, mental, and language violence.

654
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,180
Don't delete the CCTV.

655
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,380
It's all recorded on my phone anyway.

656
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,980
What's going on, you punk?

657
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,280
It's my daughter.

658
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,380
Isn't that Cheong Seongguk?

659
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,380
Cheong Seongguk, Kim Nakjun?

660
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,880
This is my son.

661
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,480
What?

662
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,480
I saw the situation.

663
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,280
These students

664
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,480
bullied a child with disabilities.

665
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,680
My son tried to stop them, but they got into a fight.

666
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,980
Am I right?

667
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:11,280
That's what I taught them.

668
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,680
Use your fists for the weak.

669
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,380
Did I teach them wrong?

670
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,980
I'm sorry.

671
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,980
I didn't know what to do,

672
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,980
so I made a mistake.

673
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,980
Why don't you go over there and have a cup of tea with me?

674
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,680
No.

675
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,180
I should apologize to my son.

676
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
If you sincerely apologize,

677
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,480
my son will accept it.

678
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,380
I'm sorry.

679
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,680
Just finish it on up.

680
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,280
We're finally done.

681
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,180
You're hungry, right? Let's eat.

682
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,980
I told you not to meddle in my business, right?

683
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,080
Call the manager and that's it.

684
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,880
If I get hit by other kids,

685
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,880
are you going to pretend you didn't see me?

686
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,320
Yes! I'm going to pretend I didn't see you!

687
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,320
Liar.

688
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,820
I'm not a liar.

689
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,820
You look great.

690
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,120
Thanks.

691
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,600
What?

692
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,240
Sir, it's the best opportunity for a man, isn't it?

693
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,780
She's a great-lookingコ.

694
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,200
Won'Sa would be planet하 right?

695
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,980
Right, sir?

696
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,240
Right, sir?

697
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,960
Shit,卡 aims.

698
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:29,160
Ming

699
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,520
What?

700
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,320
Hey!

701
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,120
Did you wake him up?

702
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,920
Hey, how did you know I was here?

703
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,820
I went to the police station and they told me.

704
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,120
I called but they didn't pick up.

705
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,320
Oh, my.

706
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,220
Can I come in?

707
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,520
Of course.

708
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,320
Where are you going?

709
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,620
No, wait for five minutes.

710
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,320
No, wait for ten minutes.

711
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,520
Just ten minutes.

712
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,320
You can't come in.

713
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,320
Wow, it's a falaie!

714
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:47,120
Oops.

715
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,120
What?

716
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,120
You were home.

717
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,120
Wait a minute.

718
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:16,120
It wasn't a woman, it was a man.

719
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,120
You've been waiting a long time, haven't you?

720
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:32,120
Come on.

721
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:44,120
Oh, the recycling waste recycling is my job.

722
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:49,120
It was stuck in front of the door.

723
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,120
Let's not be late.

724
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,120
You crazy bastard.

725
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,120
What?

726
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,120
Huh?

727
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,120
No, nothing.

728
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,120
No, the owner of the house is living downstairs.

729
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,120
I think there's a mental problem.

730
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:14,120
Yeah.

731
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:21,120
I paid for the annual tea today.

732
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,120
Huh?

733
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,120
This.

734
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,120
What is it?

735
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:34,120
You like roll cake.

736
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,120
What's this?

737
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,120
My father usually means that he won't take the interest.

738
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:47,120
Thank you for being with me on the way you sent your father and being sad with me.

739
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,120
I'll just take it.

740
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:55,120
Sir, you were my father to me.

741
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:01,120
I'm not just a supporter of the orphanage.

742
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,120
Was it a thoughtless thought?

743
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,120
Was it a thoughtless thought?

744
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:11,120
Am I the only one?

745
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,120
You'd be really happy to hear this.

746
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,120
You know, right?

747
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:27,120
That your father thought of you like your son.

748
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:32,120
That's why I'm going crazy.

749
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:37,120
I loved you, I respected you, I just kept it in my mouth.

750
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:42,120
I couldn't let go of you once.

751
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,120
I should've at least hugged you.

752
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:50,120
I should've held your hand.

753
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:57,120
He told me to find you before he died.

754
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,120
What a great job.

755
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:06,120
I'm not even a kid anymore.

756
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,120
There's so much to ignore between families.

757
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:21,120
You think you'll understand and understand.

758
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,120
I'm sure your father understood that.

759
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,120
He never knew.

760
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:36,120
He was always proud of me.

761
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,120
Who are you?

762
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:49,120
Who are you trying to comfort?

763
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,120
Hello?

764
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,120
It's downstairs.

765
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,120
I need to talk to you for a second.

766
00:49:54,120 --> 00:50:04,120
Aren't you going out?

767
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,120
Let's talk next time.

768
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,120
But what are you talking about next time?

769
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:16,120
When are you going to pay me my rent this month?

770
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:20,120
When are you going to pay me my rent?

771
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:26,120
When are you going to pay me my rent?

772
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,120
It's not worth it.

773
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,120
Be quiet.

774
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,120
I didn't eat.

775
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,120
I'll pay you by tomorrow.

776
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,120
How can I trust you?

777
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,120
Not once or twice?

778
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,120
17832-144-3860 at the bank.

779
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,120
By 10 a.m. tomorrow.

780
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,120
If you don't pay by then, I'll go to the police station.

781
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,120
Okay?

782
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,120
I'll go to the police station because of the rent.

783
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,120
Okay?

784
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:55,120
Okay.

785
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,120
Weren't you living alone?

786
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,120
You two live together?

787
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,120
What does it matter if we live together?

788
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,120
Why does it matter?

789
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,120
It does matter.

790
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,120
How much is the difference between the rent and the rent?

791
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,120
Where are you looking?

792
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,120
Where are you looking?

793
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,120
No wonder it was weird.

794
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,120
The laundry was going all night,

795
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,120
and the rent suddenly went up 10,000 won.

796
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,120
No.

797
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,120
I live alone.

798
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:37,120
Why? What's going on?

799
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,120
Are you the owner of the house?

800
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,120
I'm hungry.

801
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,120
I'll make you something delicious.

802
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,120
What should I make?

803
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:53,120
Oh, my.

804
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,120
Oh, my.

805
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,120
I think I'm going to die today.

806
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,120
I'll take you on the way.

807
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,120
No, you said it was an emergency.

808
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,120
Go ahead.

809
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,120
It's not too late to take you home, right?

810
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,120
It's because I have someone to meet.

811
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,120
At this hour?

812
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:41,120
Yeah.

813
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:53,120
Alia.

814
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:23,120
Dad.

815
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:33,120
I'm too late, right?

816
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,120
What do you mean?

817
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,120
Alia.

818
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,120
What do you mean?

819
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,120
The art museum director is dead?

820
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,120
Is that true?

821
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,120
He's really dead.

822
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,120
Yes.

823
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,120
But why are you only hearing that now?

824
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,120
We're late for a physical education in the Netherlands.

825
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,120
I'm sorry.

826
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,120
Wait a minute.

827
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,120
Let's go.

828
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:07,120
Oh, my.

829
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,120
Now that we've got some money,

830
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,120
do you think we can make $2 billion?

831
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,120
Don't you know that someone who's crazy

832
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,120
left $2 billion behind

833
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,120
is dead or alive?

834
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,120
The bank's rumors are spreading.

835
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,120
And you're giving your own business

836
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,120
a hard time?

837
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,120
You're never going to get money

838
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,120
from your own business.

839
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,120
What are you going to do now?

840
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,120
Why are you going to sell $2 billion?

841
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,120
It's not like you can't get rid of a person

842
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,120
just because he's dead.

843
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,120
If it's a clean house,

844
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,120
it's a famous artist who's sold in Korea.

845
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,120
You can't take our money

846
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,120
because you don't have $2 billion?

847
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,120
It's not like you can sell a painting.

848
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,120
They've been talking about the Sokbing River

849
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,120
for a long time.

850
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,120
But a famous artist?

851
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,120
What kind of artist would die of cold?

852
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,120
There are not just one or two places

853
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,120
where you can get money.

854
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,120
I heard that art museums

855
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,120
will be closed soon.

856
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,120
You said it was a clean house.

857
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,120
You said it was 100% clean

858
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,120
and 200% clean.

859
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,120
You said $2 billion

860
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,120
is $2 billion!

861
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,120
I can take care of it.

862
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,120
What? You jerk!

863
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,120
Don't get involved in useless things.

864
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,120
I'm innocent to my father.

865
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,120
You're a housekeeper.

866
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,120
Did you see me get hit by money?

867
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,120
I never sell my own business.

868
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,120
I'll even pay you interest and get you a job.

869
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,120
Stop worrying and get out of here!

870
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,120
What?

871
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,120
Do you have a loan?

872
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,120
Dad.

873
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,120
What kind of person is our Mua Gi?

874
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,120
He lent us $2 billion

875
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,120
without any loan.

876
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,120
Right, Mua?

877
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,120
And!

878
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,120
You're so scared of money,

879
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,120
yet you still look down on people.

880
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,120
$2 billion!

881
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,120
You don't have to be so scared.

882
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,120
How much do you think you can do?

883
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,120
Director.

884
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,120
Are you okay?

885
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,120
I'm probably okay.

886
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,120
This is such a sudden death.

887
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,120
I think the bank is in a state of panic.

888
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,120
There must be a family.

889
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,120
My wife died 20 years ago.

890
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,120
I have a child as a family.

891
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,120
I heard she was very impressive.

892
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,120
Of course.

893
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,120
Right.

894
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,120
What's so impressive?

895
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,120
She graduated from Seoul National University

896
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,120
and graduated from the Japanese Academy of Education.

897
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,120
She's a top academic in the field of

898
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,120
the youngest academic in the world.

899
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,120
She's currently working as a

900
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,120
leading researcher at the European Museum.

901
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,120
What do you mean?

902
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,120
You don't know much about her,

903
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,120
but it's because you don't know her.

904
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,120
She's amazing.

905
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,120
She's the best in Spain,

906
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,120
the best in Iberia, and the best in the world.

907
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,120
She's the best in Spain.

908
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,120
You're talking nonsense.

909
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,120
So in a word,

910
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,120
she's a loser who doesn't have the ability

911
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,120
to make money and just studies

912
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,120
without her parents' support.

913
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,120
Is that how you interpret it?

914
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,120
I can't do this.

915
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,120
Her score is low,

916
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,120
and if she keeps doing this,

917
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,120
she'll get hit in the head and hit again.

918
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,120
What are you going to do?

919
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,120
Right.

920
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,120
Maybe...

921
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,120
Because she's a student,

922
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,120
that might work.

923
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,120
No way.

924
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,120
Is there any other way to deal with this?

925
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,120
No.

926
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,120
I'm sorry.

927
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,120
I'm sorry.

928
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,120
Okay.

929
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,120
We're ready to go as you ordered,

930
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,120
and everyone's waiting.

931
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,120
Timing is important.

932
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,120
We have to finish it quickly.

933
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,120
We have to consider a lot of situations

934
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,120
and the timing of our operation.

935
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,120
We've set the time to 10.

936
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,120
Okay.

937
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,120
What's going to happen to our museum?

938
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,120
It's in the bottom of Gyeonggi-do.

939
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,120
There's nowhere to go to get more printing.

940
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,120
We'll close it down soon.

941
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,120
There's a decent supplier.

942
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,120
They say it's doing well,

943
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,120
but why would we close down a museum?

944
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,120
It's better to sell it

945
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,120
and live in peace.

946
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,120
Then shouldn't we start looking elsewhere?

947
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,120
Oh, my.

948
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,120
Don't you think Mr. Kim knows something?

949
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,120
He's your nephew.

950
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,120
I don't think so.

951
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,120
When I scouted at Doam Museum,

952
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,120
I thought I'd leave.

953
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,120
I can't believe I trusted you.

954
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,120
You're so mean.

955
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,120
You did so much for us.

956
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:55,120
This isn't what people do, is it?

957
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,120
I'm sorry.

958
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,120
It's too late to say goodbye.

959
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,120
Thank you for staying silent

960
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:21,120
even when you're in trouble.

961
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,120
I'm not enough to be your father's son

962
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,120
as an artisan from today.

963
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,120
I hope you'll help me.

964
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,120
Then are we not closing down the museum?

965
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,120
You don't have to worry about that.

966
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,120
I've been talking to the bank's head

967
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,120
and it's all being resolved.

968
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,120
We're in trouble.

969
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,120
Please come quickly.

970
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,120
Where's the owner?

971
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,120
Come out right now.

972
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,120
Come out right now.

973
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,120
You should pay back the money you borrowed.

974
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,120
Someone's selling land.

975
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,120
Come out, you!

976
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,120
Come out!

977
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,120
I'm Oh Sol-hee, the head of Majang-dong.

978
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,120
I won't move a single step

979
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,120
until you pay me back the money.

980
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:38,120
Before I turn this art museum into a black sea,

981
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,120
pay me back the money!

982
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,120
Pay me back!

983
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,120
Pay me back!

984
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:55,120
Before I burn down all the paintings here,

985
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,120
pay me back the money!

986
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,120
Pay me back!

987
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,120
Pay me back!

988
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,120
Ms. Jin?

989
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,120
No.

990
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,120
No.

991
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,120
I'm sorry.

992
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,120
You and I are no more than

993
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,120
the real estate agent and the real estate agent.

994
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,120
Are you following me?

995
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,120
Ms. Jin?

996
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,120
I'm sorry.

997
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,120
Let's go to Segi-gu.

998
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,120
What is this?

999
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,120
There's a rumor that you had a fight with the successor.

1000
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,120
Are you saying that you're buying women's hearts with money?

1001
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:45,120
Ms. Jin keeps blaming me.

1002
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,120
That woman is the real estate agent.

1003
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,120
You're the real estate agent and she's the real estate agent!

1004
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,120
Can I protect the art museum?

1005
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,120
You can't.

1006
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,120
What if I help you?
