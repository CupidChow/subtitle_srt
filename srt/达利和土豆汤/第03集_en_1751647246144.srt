1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The King of the World

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The King of the World

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The King of the World

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Give it to me!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Give it to me!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Before I burn down all the paintings here,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
give me my bloody money!

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Give me my money!

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Give me my money!

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Give me my money!

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sure you've picked the right person, right?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
First, 2XL.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Chapter 1 The Second Place

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,020
Chapter 1

15
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,960
Mr. Jin?

16
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
No, it's not.

17
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,560
Isn't it Mr. Jin?

18
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
What?

19
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,200
It's Mr. Jin, right?

20
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
It's Mr. Jin.

21
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,100
It's Mr. Jin.

22
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,860
It's my first day at work, so I'm not used to it.

24
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,900
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,900
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,900
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,900
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,900
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,900
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,900
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,900
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,900
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,400
I was so surprised to see you again here.

36
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,900
How did you get into this relationship?

37
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,460
We've been together for two years.

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,260
I almost couldn't recognize you.

39
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
You've changed your style.

40
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,360
Oh, right.

41
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,740
You said you had an important contract.

42
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,340
Did you finish it well?

43
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,100
It was an accident because of a misunderstanding,

44
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,260
but I was worried that things wouldn't have gone wrong.

45
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,640
I can't listen to you anymore.

46
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,960
Why do you keep getting close?

47
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,900
Did something happen between us?

48
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,200
Are you two even related?

49
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,640
We're not related.

50
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,640
Let's be clear.

51
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,900
You and I are not more than

52
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,740
the third-rate and the third-rate.

53
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,740
Do you understand?

54
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,900
I understand.

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,640
Why are you only drinking coffee?

56
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,640
It's not coffee. It's boy tea.

57
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,100
I can't see the chicken.

58
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,240
It's not boy tea.

59
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,440
Isn't it sour?

60
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,540
It's not boy tea. It's boy tea.

61
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,760
Forget it.

62
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,640
You're not even here to drink tea.

63
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,300
Did you see it earlier?

64
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,300
AOMG New Peking Entertainment Center 772772.com

65
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,940
The most exciting PG game on the line.

66
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,340
The mahjong is over.

67
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,940
The mahjong is over.

68
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,340
The queen of the prize pool.

69
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,040
Find the gold city.

70
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,000
The talented cat.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,640
The gold captain.

72
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,100
The super high rate of compensation.

73
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,140
The reward frequency is high.

74
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,900
There are many opportunities to pay back.

75
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,240
Hurry up and join.

76
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,200
AOMG New Peking Entertainment Center 772772.com

77
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,080
What?

78
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,720
I don't even have parents or children.

79
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,320
Law? Immigration?

80
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,680
I don't know anything about that.

81
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,340
So don't think about the relationship.

82
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,980
Don't think about the weight of it.

83
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,980
Pay me back before you see the worst.

84
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,140
That's because there's no list of things

85
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,420
that a lawyer would write.

86
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,920
I don't know.

87
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,340
That's not my part-time job.

88
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,740
I borrowed money from you

89
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,200
and I don't want to take a single penny.

90
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,140
So whether you sell your house or your painting,

91
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,840
sell your house, your house, your rice field,

92
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,740
and your money, it's best to settle it.

93
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Oh, right.

94
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,100
I'm just saying this just in case.

95
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,880
Don't think about the number of things

96
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,300
that you're supposed to take with your painting.

97
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,280
You have to pay me back. You know that, right?

98
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,800
If you don't, I could just weld

99
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,280
everything here.

100
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,040
Over here.

101
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,980
It's done.

102
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,200
Like this, a little bit.

103
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,880
Just make it look nice.

104
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Like this.

105
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Almost there.

106
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
And here, just like this.

107
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,740
Thank you.

108
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,020
Dr. Jin?

109
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,420
You have to get your ticket before you leave.

110
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,220
It's for more than 15 people, so it'll be a group-sale discount.

111
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,620
Please help me with the tickets.

112
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,300
Bye.

113
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,620
Okay.

114
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,720
This way, please.

115
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,100
I heard that the museum is really nice.

116
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,300
It's really nice.

117
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,460
I don't know what it is.

118
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,940
You're so ignorant.

119
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,740
You don't know what it is? That's art.

120
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,740
Do you understand?

121
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,540
Is that right?

122
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,180
It's different because it's a clean and clean place.

123
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,780
The best part about beauty is that

124
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,180
you don't get discouraged or feel lost in front of these people.

125
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,660
Is that what you're doing?

126
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,660
You... What?

127
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,160
I told you not to speak English in front of me.

128
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,260
You're not that...

129
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,700
No, no. I'm not good enough with that.

130
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,700
Anyway,

131
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,700
you don't have that in you.

132
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,100
But...

133
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,820
Anyway, how do you know if it's a clean and clean place?

134
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,460
How would I know?

135
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,460
I just happened to see you a few times.

136
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,400
Oh, like a lady at a local market.

137
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,100
You saw me a few times on your way here.

138
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,580
That's not it.

139
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,880
But maybe it'll be solved in a way that's easy to do.

140
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,580
Why?

141
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,680
You know Segi Group, right?

142
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,480
Segi?

143
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,360
The one you saw earlier was a mess with the successor.

144
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,440
They went to the wedding and cleaned up the place.

145
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,440
I don't know why, but it's not like they're short on money.

146
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,580
I guess they weren't very good people.

147
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,880
Or maybe they're just bad at humor.

148
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,020
Humor?

149
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,520
Why would they be?

150
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,720
I've been feeling this since I first saw you.

151
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
You're really...

152
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,800
I mean, you're a funny person.

153
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,840
You're good at counting the number of potatoes

154
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,240
and counting the number of potatoes in the party.

155
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,880
Anyway, you're the funniest person I've ever met.

156
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,020
But why is it so easy to solve

157
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,720
when you're already in a relationship?

158
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,820
The potatoes still can't get rid of their feelings.

159
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,600
They said they backed up the wedding

160
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,000
without even caring about the wedding.

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,700
But the woman they love is being...

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They're being cheated on.

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,280
And they're worth billions.

164
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,540
They're Segi Group.

165
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,040
They're going to lose.

166
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,380
Are you saying you're buying women's hearts with money?

167
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,180
What?

168
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,980
Are you saying you're going to turn your back on them?

169
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,820
You're a cleaner, but you're an easy woman?

170
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,760
You're not a famous writer.

171
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,100
Just do your job.

172
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,600
I'm not going to do anything.

173
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,400
I'm going to get beaten up.

174
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,140
I'm going to be a hit.

175
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,300
Why are you so hot?

176
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,200
You're driving me crazy.

177
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,440
What's wrong with you?

178
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Segi Group

179
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,240
You're here. You're giving me money?

180
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,440
You're not going to go bankrupt, are you?

181
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,840
What are you doing in someone else's office?

182
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,540
What?

183
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,540
I mean...

184
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,080
I was wondering what happened because you said

185
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,180
you went to the art department.

186
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,580
But you're being a bit weird.

187
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,460
What's the difference between you and me?

188
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,760
Do I need to get permission to come into my brother's office?

189
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,860
Darn it.

190
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,860
So what happened?

191
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,980
Do you have money to give me?

192
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,320
You won't take it if I say I don't?

193
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,820
Don't worry. I'll take it no matter what.

194
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,660
Fine. You're not the one who's going to take the money.

195
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,080
But let's be clear about this.

196
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,880
I just introduced you to cleaning.

197
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,740
I decided to lend you money

198
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,100
because you're the one, right?

199
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,800
What?

200
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,300
That's the truth.

201
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,540
I like to be sure of everything.

202
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,840
Then I'll get back to work.

203
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,340
Segi.

204
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,720
Yes?

205
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,620
You know the person who died at the art department?

206
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,120
Why?

207
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,000
He died by accident.

208
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,060
Did he have any illness?

209
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,060
How would I know?

210
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,660
I was able to connect with you

211
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,400
and meet you the day before he died.

212
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,560
Why would I meet him?

213
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,440
Wasn't it the day I went to the art department?

214
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,240
You said you'd come to see me.

215
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,440
That's it.

216
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,280
He knew you lent me money

217
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,220
and he couldn't go because you were so crazy.

218
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,740
So what did I do to win

219
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,080
when he made trouble?

220
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,980
Oh, well.

221
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,480
This is it.

222
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,920
You still had the same gun, right?

223
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,580
Come in and use the show!

224
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,280
A lot's different than your methods, Choo.

225
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,600
You have to give me the link back soon.

226
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,960
Excuse me?

227
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,100
Watchers must've paid your fare.

228
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,360
Oh, my behalf!

229
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,860
Miss, could you please...

230
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,760
Stay back.

231
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,860
Oh, TERRIFIED!

232
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Okay.

233
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Okay, I understand.

234
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Most of the important documents

235
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,960
were kept in this file.

236
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Okay.

237
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
It must have been the money

238
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,960
for the Basquiat exhibition.

239
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
It was a very popular exhibition

240
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
and it was competitive,

241
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
so the cost of the exhibition

242
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
must have been high.

243
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
The Basquiat exhibition?

244
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
People have to open

245
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
such high-quality exhibitions

246
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
in Korea

247
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
to find an art gallery.

248
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
The museum manager

249
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,960
put a lot of effort into this exhibition.

250
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
When is it going to be held?

251
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
It's scheduled for the first week of October next year.

252
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,960
You were very surprised earlier, right?

253
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,960
How can you be so ignorant?

254
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
It's been a long time since you lost your mind.

255
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
And you're talking about

256
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
a work of art that's so sacred.

257
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,960
You're a gangster, so you should have listened to me.

258
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
But you're making a scene in front of me.

259
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
It's the first time in 20 years

260
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
that you're making a scene in front of an Oculator.

261
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,960
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
What?

263
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
The people who did it were the wrong people.

264
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Why would the manager do it?

265
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,960
You're the manager now.

266
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,960
I thought you'd clean up the art gallery.

267
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
You may look like a dirty dog

268
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
and a dirty person to others,

269
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
but you've been watching over me,

270
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
so you know very well

271
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
what the reality of Korean art galleries is like.

272
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Thank you for not giving up

273
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,960
and taking responsibility for me.

274
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,960
You'll have to help me a lot.

275
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Of course.

276
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Let's see.

277
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
What should I start with?

278
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,960
This is the collection of our art galleries.

279
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
And this is the list of artists

280
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,960
who work with us.

281
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
There's a lot.

282
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,960
And this is the schedule for this year's exhibition

283
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,960
and the preparation for next year's exhibition.

284
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
There's a lot to study, right?

285
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
You're quite quick to learn.

286
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
You must be difficult.

287
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
And this is the list of artists

288
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
who work with us.

289
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
And...

290
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Oh, right.

291
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,960
I got a lot of calls from all over the world

292
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
asking for you.

293
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
I blocked them from the exhibition,

294
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,960
but I think you should know about it.

295
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,960
You helped me a lot at the funeral.

296
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Shouldn't we say goodbye at least once?

297
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Wait a minute.

298
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
You can just send them off.

299
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Dad.

300
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Dad.

301
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
Dad.

302
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Dad.

303
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,960
Dad, wait a minute.

304
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Dad.

305
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Did you send them off?

306
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
Then send them off to the gallery.

307
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,960
You're so rude.

308
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Hey, do you have a business in front of money?

309
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Where can you find a company

310
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,960
that can wait for your payment when art is ruined?

311
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,960
Well, I have other plans.

312
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Just do as I tell you.

313
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Do your best.

314
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Bye.

315
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,960
An exhibition from a serve

316
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,960
and an exhibition from a store

317
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,960
a totally caught struggle

318
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,960
December 27, 2013

319
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Show everything on the head

320
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
lanes

321
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
Show everybody

322
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Show them

323
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Show them

324
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Show them

325
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
I'm hungry. Come quickly.

326
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
I have to go home by 1 p.m.

327
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
If you don't come out, I'll ask you to go out.

328
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,960
Why do you keep coming when the pre-review is over?

329
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Why do you keep coming?

330
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Isn't there a tteokbokki place near your company?

331
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
It's not a company. It's a gallery.

332
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,960
And I'm an ang-tta. No one wants to eat with me.

333
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,960
So what kind of person came today and did something crazy?

334
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
How did you know?

335
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,960
That our gallery is a nuclear power plant?

336
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
You were told to eat whenever you were stressed.

337
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
So on the pre-review day, you ate five servings of potato soup.

338
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Didn't you eat it all by yourself?

339
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Wow, you remember all that?

340
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,960
I was interested in it.

341
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Even if you say you're my type,

342
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,960
there's a line between us that we can't cross.

343
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Keep that line.

344
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Just a little bit more.

345
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Look at how cute you are.

346
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
But what you can't do is what you can't do.

347
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,960
So who's that nuclear power plant?

348
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,960
You said you'd double it. You said you could double it.

349
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
What kind of bitch lied to me?

350
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
Is it you?

351
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
No.

352
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
It's you.

353
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
No?

354
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
If it's not you.

355
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Is it you?

356
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
No.

357
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Then?

358
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
What do you mean, it's you?

359
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
How dare you try to make fun of me?

360
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Ma'am, I'm not making fun of you.

361
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Please calm down.

362
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
You're sitting here talking like you're calming down.

363
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,960
Hey, what did you say to me then?

364
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
You said that old man was having a date today.

365
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
You said he'd double the price if he died.

366
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,960
You said he'd double the price if he died first.

367
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
I did?

368
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Hey, you looked like the old man's son-in-law.

369
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
A young woman who's 20 years old

370
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,960
and a two-year-old who's even a old man.

371
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,960
So that's what you are.

372
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
A two-year-old and an old man.

373
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Ma'am, this work is not about stocks or real estate.

374
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
You have to look at it in the long run.

375
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,960
You have to look at it in the long run.

376
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,960
That young man came out of the store the other day.

377
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
What are you going to do with my money now?

378
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
What are you going to do with my money?

379
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,960
You're a bad person.

380
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,960
There's still a stupid person like that?

381
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
Did you just watch it?

382
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
Then what? He's a customer.

383
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
That's VIP.

384
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
You're a customer.

385
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
You're going to go out in that position.

386
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,960
You're going to go out more recklessly.

387
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Eyes on eyes.

388
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Ears on ears.

389
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
You have to go out harder.

390
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Oppa, what's ears?

391
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
It's nose.

392
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Eyes on eyes.

393
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Nose on nose.

394
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
What's this?

395
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
You just have to recognize the nose and ears.

396
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,960
This is the line that I can't cross between you and me.

397
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
You're so ignorant.

398
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Awesome.

399
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Wow, that lady took it off in three steps.

400
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
What is it?

401
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Look.

402
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
No, it's not.

403
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
It's not a new product.

404
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
There's no place to do that.

405
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Why are you doing this in an art museum?

406
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
This is really ignorant.

407
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,960
What if you can't speak English and you don't understand the dictionary?

408
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,960
At least you don't do this in front of an art piece.

409
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Well, there must have been a reason.

410
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
There must be a reason.

411
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Come on.

412
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Where did you see this?

413
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Here, eat.

414
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
One more sundae, please.

415
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
A lot of dried persimmons.

416
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
Anyway, the cleaning is over.

417
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,960
What do you mean?

418
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Do you want to come to an art museum with these crooks?

419
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
Do you want to do an art exhibition?

420
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
You're closing a museum that has no audience

421
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
and no artwork.

422
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,960
I'm sure the rumors have spread all over the place.

423
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
There's still a long way to go.

424
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
What are you worried about?

425
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,960
How long have you been fighting with my wife?

426
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
I'm not worried about anything.

427
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
I'm serious.

428
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
I'm serious.

429
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Wait a minute.

430
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,960
You don't have to worry about that.

431
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,960
I have a new supervisor.

432
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
I see.

433
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
What?

434
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Of course.

435
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
I'll see you with the new supervisor soon.

436
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Yes, yes.

437
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Goodbye.

438
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,960
Yes, yes.

439
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Wait a minute.

440
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Hello?

441
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Yes.

442
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,960
The exhibition is going on without a charge.

443
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
The loan?

444
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,960
I'm not sure about that.

445
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
Wait a minute.

446
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
Yes, I'm busy.

447
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
There was a small accident.

448
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,960
It'll be fixed soon.

449
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,960
I'm trying to find a place to say hello to the members.

450
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
See you tomorrow.

451
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Yes, I'll call you back after I decide on a schedule.

452
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Yes, this is Kim Dalri.

453
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,960
No, it was a small accident.

454
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
It'll be fixed soon.

455
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Please wait a minute.

456
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
I'll try to solve it without any problems.

457
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
Okay.

458
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
Don't worry.

459
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Of course.

460
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Hey, Chaekyung.

461
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
You're here too.

462
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
No, I'm not.

463
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
Okay.

464
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Thank you.

465
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Thank you for your hard work.

466
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Take care.

467
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,960
Thank you.

468
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Thank you.

469
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
Goodbye.

470
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Goodbye.

471
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,960
You've been catching people since the first day.

472
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Can't you do that?

473
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Oh, my.

474
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
Money?

475
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
I don't know.

476
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,960
What a long day.

477
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,960
You must have saved up for the day off.

478
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
I'm sorry.

479
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
Are you okay?

480
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
Mr. Jin.

481
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Mr. Jin.

482
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Oh, yes.

483
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Oh, yes.

484
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Oh, yes.

485
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
Why are you here again?

486
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,960
I heard that you were in a mess.

487
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Did you come because you were worried about me?

488
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,960
I came to keep an eye on you

489
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
in case you'd steal my money and play the wild card.

490
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Oh, right.

491
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,960
You said that you're not close to any of the rich

492
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
and that you'd be a good friend.

493
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
You know me well.

494
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
What's wrong? What's the problem?

495
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
What?

496
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Why are you wearing those?

497
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Are you wearing them to get your insurance?

498
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
With the damage insurance?

499
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,960
I don't think they're pretty.

500
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
They're just scary.

501
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
I don't have any in the Netherlands yet.

502
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
This is the only pair of shoes I have.

503
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
I...

504
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Don't worry too much.

505
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,960
Seriously.

506
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,960
Who says I should worry?

507
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Why should I worry about you?

508
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
Whether the museum is in a mess

509
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,960
or if my legs break, it doesn't matter.

510
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
It doesn't matter?

511
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
No.

512
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,960
I won't be a wild card, so don't worry.

513
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Wait a minute.

514
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Why are you wearing these?

515
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
No, it's okay.

516
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
If I wear them like this...

517
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,960
We're in a relationship of wealth and wealth.

518
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,960
I shouldn't wear these.

519
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
You said a word of thanks is enough.

520
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
I'm sorry.

521
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
I'm sorry.

522
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
I'm sorry.

523
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
I'm sorry.

524
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
I'm sorry.

525
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
You said a word of thanks is enough.

526
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
We did that in the Netherlands.

527
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,960
When others show kindness,

528
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
you just have to say thank you.

529
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
You don't have to do this.

530
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
Did you hear about your father that day?

531
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
That day?

532
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,960
Why did you break up with me in front of the hotel?

533
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
You're right.

534
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
Everything happened so quickly.

535
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
I don't even know what's going on.

536
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,960
How did you get to Korea?

537
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
How did you spend your wedding?

538
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Oh, right.

539
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
We were supposed to meet at the museum.

540
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
Did you wait long?

541
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
No.

542
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Why would I wait?

543
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
I told you that my schedule was very tight.

544
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,960
I couldn't afford to go out, so I called you, but you didn't pick up.

545
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,960
I thought you were busy.

546
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Cool.

547
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,960
Did you know my phone number?

548
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Oh, that...

549
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
I called the library...

550
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
I called the museum...

551
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
I called the museum.

552
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
You told them my personal number at the museum?

553
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,960
They told me.

554
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
They said I was your brother.

555
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
Oh, really?

556
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
I was worried that you were so busy with your business.

557
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,960
But...

558
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
I'm serious.

559
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,960
You were worried that I might have hired a detective?

560
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
You just wanted to know my phone number?

561
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
It's not that.

562
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
I'm almost there.

563
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
I think you can get off in front of there.

564
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,960
Thank you.

565
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Okay.

566
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
Oh, it's cold.

567
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Is it cold?

568
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
Are you following me?

569
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
I'm not following you.

570
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,960
I'm just going to see if the new product is out.

571
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Come to this department store often.

572
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
I'm a diamond.

573
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Use the lounge alone.

574
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,960
Okay.

575
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,960
Okay.

576
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Was it the third floor?

577
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
I told you.

578
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
I won't steal the night shift.

579
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
I...

580
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
I was going to get my shoes.

581
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
That's very important to me.

582
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Okay, then.

583
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,960
Give it to me later.

584
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
I'll be going.

585
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Bye.

586
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Bye.

587
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
You have to give it to me.

588
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
What? What's wrong?

589
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
What's wrong?

590
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
What's wrong?

591
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
What's going on?

592
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
What's going on?

593
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
What?

594
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,960
What?

595
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
What?

596
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
What...

597
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
I'm sorry.

598
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,960
You must have been flustered.

599
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Why aren't you asking why?

600
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Do I have to be curious?

601
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
You can go now.

602
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
I think you'll show up again. Are you okay?

603
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,960
I'm fine.

604
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
I'm fine.

605
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
I'm fine.

606
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,960
I'm fine.

607
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
I'm fine.

608
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
I'm fine.

609
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
I'm fine.

610
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
I'm fine.

611
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,960
Are you okay?

612
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,960
You look like you're floating around.

613
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
I'm fine.

614
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
Let's go.

615
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
I'll support you until the end.

616
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Here.

617
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Okay.

618
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
I'll go.

619
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
What kind of place is this?

620
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
I'm a regular here.

621
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
Oh, my. You're here.

622
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
It's only been a week.

623
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
It's been a while.

624
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
How have you been?

625
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,960
Thanks to you.

626
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,960
When did you come from the Netherlands?

627
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,960
Did you lose some weight?

628
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
I'm from Namguri.

629
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Wait a minute.

630
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
Jungwon, can you guide the customers?

631
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Yes.

632
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Let's go over there.

633
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
It's a bit noisy here.

634
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
This way, please.

635
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Jungwon, please look over here.

636
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
Okay.

637
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,960
Oh, the manager has changed.

638
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,960
There's only one store left in Korea.

639
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,960
The avant-garde style is exactly your style,

640
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
so I'm a bit disappointed.

641
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
It's too cheap.

642
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
I'm going to wear it when I work.

643
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,960
Okay.

644
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
This is a stop sign.

645
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Do you have any other cards?

646
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,960
Really?

647
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
I'm sorry.

648
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
Don't mention it.

649
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
I'm sorry.

650
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Don't mention it.

651
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
This is also a stop sign.

652
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
That can't be.

653
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
This is it.

654
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,960
Jungwon.

655
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
Please pack a few things according to your clothes

656
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
and the bags and the coat.

657
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
You know the size, right?

658
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,960
Of course.

659
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,960
No.

660
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,960
Don't do that.

661
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Why?

662
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
You must have been busy coming in

663
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,960
and couldn't pack your things properly.

664
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
Please get ready.

665
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
Okay.

666
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,960
No.

667
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,960
Don't do that.

668
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
You don't have to worry about me.

669
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
We're not that close.

670
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Ms. Jin.

671
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,960
What are you doing here?

672
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
You have to pay for this.

673
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,960
Everyone is waiting, right?

674
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
I'm here to send you my stuff.

675
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,960
I'm so busy.

676
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
I'm here to send you my stuff.

677
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
I have to pay.

678
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
Please pay.

679
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Okay.

680
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
Here you go.

681
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
Oh, right.

682
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
Wait a minute.

683
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
It's 5 percent, right?

684
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
You can't do that at our store.

685
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,960
I think it's next door.

686
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
It's next door.

687
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
It's next door.

688
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,960
It must be next door.

689
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
How much is it?

690
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,960
Thank you.

691
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Can we talk for a minute?

692
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
I'm in trouble because I have work today.

693
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,960
I'll come visit you next time.

694
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,960
I have something to say too.

695
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
Let's go.

696
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,960
Let's go.

697
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
I'm sorry about the debt.

698
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
I'll pay you back for the credit card.

699
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
It's okay.

700
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
No one is late.

701
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Oh, my.

702
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
You didn't want to pay me back?

703
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
I'm sorry.

704
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
I'm sorry.

705
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,960
I'm sorry.

706
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
I'm sorry.

707
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,960
I'm sorry.

708
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
I'm sorry.

709
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,960
I'm sorry.

710
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,960
I'm sorry.

711
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
I'm sorry.

712
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
I'm sorry.

713
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
I'm sorry.

714
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,960
I'm sorry.

715
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
I'm sorry.

716
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,960
I'm sorry.

717
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
I'm sorry.

718
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
I'm sorry.

719
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,960
I'm sorry.

720
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
I'm sorry.

721
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
I'm sorry.

722
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,960
I'm sorry.

723
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,960
I'm sorry.

724
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,960
I'm sorry.

725
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
I'm sorry.

726
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
I'm sorry.

727
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
I'm sorry.

728
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,960
I'm sorry.

729
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,960
I'm sorry.

730
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
I'm sorry.

731
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960
Dad.

732
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,960
Dad.

733
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
Dad.

734
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,960
What are you saying?

735
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
It's a week.

736
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
The wedding is in a week.

737
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,960
Why did you get up?

738
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
It's been so long.

739
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
I'm sorry.

740
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
I'm sorry.

741
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
I'm sorry.

742
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
I'm sorry.

743
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,960
I'm sorry.

744
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
I'm sorry.

745
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
I'm sorry.

746
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,960
I'm sorry.

747
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
I'm sorry.

748
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,960
I'm sorry.

749
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,960
I'm sorry.

750
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
I'm sorry.

751
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
I'm sorry.

752
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,960
I'm sorry.

753
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,960
I'm sorry.

754
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,960
I'm sorry.

755
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,960
I'm sorry.

756
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
I'm sorry.

757
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
I'm sorry.

758
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,960
I'm sorry.

759
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,960
I'm sorry.

760
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,960
I'm sorry.

761
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,960
I'm sorry.

762
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
I'm sorry.

763
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,960
I'm sorry.

764
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,960
I'm sorry.

765
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
I'm sorry.

766
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
I'm sorry.

767
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
I'm sorry.

768
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
I'm sorry.

769
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,960
1772, Tong.

770
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,960
I can do it.

771
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,960
Anything?

772
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
Anything.

773
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Then...

774
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,960
I'm sorry.

775
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,960
I'm sorry.

776
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,960
I'm sorry.

777
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
I'm sorry.

778
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,960
I'm sorry.

779
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,960
I'm sorry.

780
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,960
I'm sorry.

781
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,960
I'm sorry.

782
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
I'm sorry.

783
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
I'm sorry.

784
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,960
I'm sorry.

785
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
I'm sorry.

786
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,960
I'm sorry.

787
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,960
I'm sorry.

788
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,960
I'm sorry.

789
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
I'm sorry.

790
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
I'm sorry.

791
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,960
I'm sorry.

792
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,960
I'm sorry.

793
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,960
I'm sorry.

794
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,960
I'm sorry.

795
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,960
I'm sorry.

796
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,960
I'm sorry.

797
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
I'm sorry.

798
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
I'm sorry.

799
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,960
I'm sorry.

800
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,960
I'm sorry.

801
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
I'm sorry.

802
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,960
I'm sorry.

803
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,460
I'm sorry, but may I say something?

804
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
You might think that you're dating

805
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,960
someone who's only two and a half years old,

806
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
but I don't think you can say anything more.

807
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,960
Especially since you have a lot of eyes today.

808
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,960
If that was scary, I wouldn't have started.

809
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,960
I wasn't like that five years ago.

810
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,960
I was able to endure that pain

811
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
and endure it because I believed

812
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,960
I could get over it again.

813
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,960
I'll find you again.

814
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,960
Yes, lawyer Cha.

815
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
I'm glad you sold it

816
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
even though it took some time.

817
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
Then please proceed with it.

818
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
What?

819
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
A fake credit?

820
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,960
Then the credit card was suspended.

821
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,960
Do you know where it was?

822
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,960
Okay.

823
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,960
I'd like to

824
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,960
advance the contract date.

825
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,960
No, I'm fine.

826
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,960
I can take out the money tomorrow.

827
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,960
Okay.

828
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,960
Okay.

829
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,960
Okay, done!

830
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,960
Wow, that's amazing!

831
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,960
Thank you.

832
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,960
Okay.

833
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,960
I'm going to go home now.

834
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,960
Okay.

835
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,960
I'm going to go home now.

836
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,960
Thank you.

837
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,960
Thank you.

838
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,960
Okay, bye.

839
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,960
Thank you.

840
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,960
Bye.

841
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,960
Bye.

842
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,960
Bye.

843
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Bye.

844
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,960
Okay.

845
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,060
All done!

846
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,500
Wow, it's a swing!

847
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,640
Dad, let's make a swing.

848
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,140
How is it? Good?

849
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,040
One more time?

850
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,740
Okay.

851
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,740
Here.

852
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,000
You're wormless.

853
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,060
You're all done.

854
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,500
Here.

855
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,140
I'll drop you off at your party.

856
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,520
Thanks.

857
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,600
Did you totally forget about the grant

858
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,600
you had for studying, separation between us?

859
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,480
Are you awaiting another good day?

860
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,880
No, it's not like that.

861
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,140
You're right.

862
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:34,640
Birth cerk means you must know how to protect yourself.

863
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,960
I wish you would be

864
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:57,960
You go home

865
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,960
Anything just to be with you

866
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:10,960
You go home

867
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,960
I want to end it all for you

868
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:36,960
You go home

869
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:50,960
Excuse me

870
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:58,960
All right.

871
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:08,960
All right, I'll be right there.

872
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,960
Excuse me.

873
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,960
Can I ask what you do?

874
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,960
No.

875
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,960
Hey, I'm so...

876
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,960
What is it?

877
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,960
I think it suits the bad guys in the morning.

878
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,960
Let's play in the legal framework.

879
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,960
Without making each other's faces.

880
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,960
What?

881
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,960
Legal framework?

882
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,960
I'm physically bad guys.

883
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,960
It's because I'm getting a bump.

884
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,960
Here you go.

885
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,960
Chicken breast.

886
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,960
This means 99.9% of the probability that you're the bad guy.

887
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,960
Let's be careful.

888
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:08,960
I'm not going to let you live in one house.

889
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,960
Be careful not to lose your room.

890
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,960
I'm sure I told you not to.

891
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,960
If you drag another woman,

892
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,960
The electricity bill, the water bill, the maximum.

893
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,960
I'm going to get it.

894
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:27,960
All right?

895
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:37,960
Excuse me.

896
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:45,960
You're a man of your word.

897
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:55,960
What do you know about the sound of the bell?

898
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:05,960
Hey, hey, hey.

899
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,960
You're a bookworm and she's a debtor.

900
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:18,960
You're a bookworm and she's a debtor.

901
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,960
Wake up.

902
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:31,960
Wake up.

903
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,960
Oh, my God.

904
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:41,960
Oh, my God.

905
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,960
Let's do it.

906
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,960
Hey, you're going to die.

907
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,960
You're not going to die.

908
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,960
I'm not kidding.

909
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,960
You're coming out.

910
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,960
Mr. Park, we're here to see you.

911
00:50:50,960 --> 00:51:02,960
Yes, sir.

912
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,960
What's this?

913
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,960
You must have been surprised.

914
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,960
I guess I practiced a little bit because I thought I was weak.

915
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,960
Good job, good job.

916
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,960
Are you going again today?

917
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,960
What are you talking about?

918
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,960
You said you wouldn't miss a day until you got 2 billion.

919
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,960
What about their kitchen?

920
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,960
Aren't you guys doing business?

921
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,960
Don't worry about it.

922
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,960
I'm going to get ready at dawn.

923
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,960
Why are you working so hard?

924
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,960
I got a call saying the bank balance was completed.

925
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,960
Bank balance?

926
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,960
It's Cheon Song's bank account.

927
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,960
I have to do it before I use my hands somewhere else.

928
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,960
What?

929
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,960
It says stop here. Do you have any other cards?

930
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,960
Really?

931
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,960
I'm sorry.

932
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,960
No problem.

933
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:13,960
This is also a stop.

934
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,960
I'm going to take out the new money.

935
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,960
I'm going to make it work.

936
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,960
That way, we can return to our daily lives and make progress in this world.

937
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,960
Yes, ma'am.

938
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:32,960
Why are you doing things you're not even asked to do?

939
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,960
Let's go.

940
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,960
Let's go.

941
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:44,960
Let's go.

942
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:12,960
I'll be right back.

943
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,960
Can you give me a minute?

944
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:22,960
I want to go.

945
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,960
What do I do?

946
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,960
They came again yesterday.

947
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,960
You guys are really...

948
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,960
What are you doing here?

949
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,960
Get out.

950
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,960
Me alone?

951
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,960
I'll go out first.

952
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,960
I'll call the police.

953
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,960
What are you doing? Hurry up.

954
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,960
Where did you go? You were here just now.

955
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,960
Mr. Han Gyu-rae.

956
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,960
Yes.

957
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,960
Don't contact the police.

958
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,960
Yes.

959
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,960
I know.

960
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,960
If you touch them too quickly, you'll get in trouble.

961
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,960
You shouldn't just let the police...

962
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,960
There's a lot of officers.

963
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,960
Oh, my God.

964
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,960
Mr. Han.

965
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,960
Hurry up.

966
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,960
I don't know. You do it yourself.

967
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,960
Mr. Han.

968
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,960
You called me.

969
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,960
Give me my money.

970
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,960
Give me my money.

971
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,960
Give me my money.

972
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,960
Give me my money.

973
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,960
I know.

974
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,960
What's this?

975
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:35,960
What's this?

976
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,660
I bought a ticket today.

977
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,360
Thank you for coming back.

978
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,160
It's nice to lie down and enjoy the show,

979
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,460
but why don't you enjoy it in a different way?

980
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,460
What?

981
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,260
One, two, one, two, three, four.

982
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,860
Gosh, hold on.

983
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,160
I'm sorry.

984
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,960
Yes, thank you for coming back in a different way.

985
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,160
Thank you.

986
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,860
Thank you.

987
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,960
Thank you.

988
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,460
Thank you.

989
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,160
Thank you.

990
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,560
I hope you enjoy the show.

991
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,560
Excuse me, miss.

992
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,360
Hey, you.

993
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,860
Who do you think you are?

994
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,060
You're a Parisian, aren't you?

995
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,360
Right?

996
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,660
I'm a curator.

997
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,760
What?

998
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,060
Do you have any questions?

999
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,060
What is this drawing?

1000
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,160
Let me see.

1001
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,360
What can I see?

1002
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:03,860
You can see all the red spots

1003
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,760
such as the black spot and the blue spot.

1004
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,760
What?

1005
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,760
You're so loud.

1006
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,160
I can see that.

1007
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,060
Isn't this a flower?

1008
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,360
It looks like a flower.

1009
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,860
Now that I think about it, it is.

1010
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,660
Bye.

1011
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,060
What?

1012
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,660
You're ignoring me?

1013
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,260
You're ignoring us because of that barista, right?

1014
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,760
No, it's not that.

1015
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,560
It's because Barista...

1016
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,560
He doesn't know about it.

1017
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,960
Oh, so he doesn't know about it.

1018
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,060
Right.

1019
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,960
So what if he doesn't know?

1020
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,360
It looks pretty.

1021
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,760
I want to eat dakgalbi.

1022
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,660
What are you eating?

1023
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,260
It's not dakgalbi.

1024
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,360
It's a flower.

1025
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,660
Let's go.

1026
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,160
Let's go.

1027
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,560
Let's go eat dakgalbi.

1028
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,760
Let's go.

1029
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,660
Who's playing around?

1030
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,360
You're working.

1031
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,760
The store manager said he got it ready.

1032
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,160
Don't worry.

1033
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,760
I'm going to get paid for real.

1034
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,660
I won't let you get anything wrong.

1035
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:36,660
Bye.

1036
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,660
You're really leaving me behind.

1037
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,860
Mr. Kim.

1038
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,160
Did you get home safely yesterday?

1039
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,360
Yes, thanks to you.

1040
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:57,960
What is it?

1041
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,460
It's the card value.

1042
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,360
I'm sorry...

1043
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,660
And thank you.

1044
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,560
It's nothing.

1045
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:10,060
I keep paying Mr. Jin for his credit.

1046
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,360
I'll try to get the rest of the money

1047
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,260
as soon as possible.

1048
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,760
He'll be anxious and angry,

1049
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,560
but I'll try to get him to pay me back.

1050
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,560
I'll try to get him to pay me back.

1051
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,960
He'll be angry, but...

1052
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,760
I don't have any complaints,

1053
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,460
but can't you wait a little longer?

1054
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:35,260
No...

1055
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,160
That's not such a simple problem.

1056
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,260
I'll do as you say.

1057
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,260
I'll take all the conditions.

1058
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:42,460
Just a little...

1059
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:45,260
Just a little longer.

1060
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,160
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

1061
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,760
What the...

1062
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,860
Why did you do this?

1063
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,660
You're a fraud!

1064
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,560
What are you doing?

1065
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,760
Mr. Jung!

1066
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,060
It's not even a payday yet. What are you doing?

1067
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,260
Even if you're a tax collector,

1068
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,460
you can't just give us back to you.

1069
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,860
Is that even possible?

1070
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,060
What are you doing?

1071
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,160
Pay us back everything we owe you!

1072
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,460
Don't do this.

1073
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,460
Don't do this!

1074
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,160
We won't let you get away with this!

1075
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,660
I won't let you get away with this!

1076
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,360
We've got a lot of money here!

1077
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,460
Even if we take all the money we owe you,

1078
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,060
we can only use it to pay for the damages.

1079
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,660
We have to take the money!

1080
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,760
That's right. This is a place for money.

1081
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,060
Before we get our red cards,

1082
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,460
let's go get the money!

1083
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,760
Wait!

1084
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,360
Let go of me!

1085
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,860
Let go of me!

1086
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:44,460
What are you doing?

1087
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,860
Can't you stop right now?

1088
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:46,960
What are you?

1089
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,760
Get out of my way!

1090
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,160
Princess Na, call the police.

1091
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:51,960
What?

1092
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,560
Call the police right now.

1093
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,460
Okay.

1094
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,760
Police?

1095
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,560
Who would call the police?

1096
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,060
Darn it!

1097
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,160
Oh, my gosh!

1098
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,660
That hurts!

1099
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,360
That hurts!

1100
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,260
Let go of me!

1101
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,660
I'd let go of you if you let go first.

1102
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,860
Let's talk.

1103
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,260
Talk.

1104
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,760
This is an art gallery.

1105
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,060
Let go of me, you jerk!

1106
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,660
Naturally, this maybe not the best idea.

1107
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,020
No.

1108
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,960
Hold it!

1109
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:45,360
How much is this for?

1110
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,660
Who are you?

1111
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,760
How dare you harm me?

1112
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,460
Me?

1113
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,960
What?

1114
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,500
How much do you have to pay for this?

1115
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,200
Oh, right.

1116
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Madam, here.

1117
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,700
$3,000. $4,500.

1118
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,500
$2,800.

1119
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,300
$6,500.

1120
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,360
What?

1121
