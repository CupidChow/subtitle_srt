1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,300
It's strange, isn't it? Our meeting

2
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:44,600
How did it get so bright in the first place?

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,800
It's not easy to explain

4
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,300
It must be fate

5
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:01,900
I will only give you this love

6
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,900
It's so bright

7
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,400
It's a street lamp

8
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Oh, it's a street lamp

9
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Then goodbye

10
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Oh, yes, then

11
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,400
What are you doing? Where are you going?

12
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
I'm going to take the bus

13
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Are you telling me to take the bus alone at this time?

14
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,500
I just did something big

15
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,500
What do you mean by something big?

16
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Get in the car quickly, don't make me look weird

17
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I'm comfortable on the bus, so I'll take the bus today

18
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
No

19
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,500
The bus stop is right in front of you, you don't have to worry

20
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
I drank

21
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
What?

22
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Are you going to leave the drunk driver behind?

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:37,480
That would be a

24
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:47,580
I'm going to turn on the navigation

25
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,580
Oh, yes

26
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,580
Where is the friend's house that you live with?

27
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,580
Why?

28
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,580
Let's go to that friend's house first

29
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,580
Then I can call the driver

30
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,580
Oh, yes

31
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,580
Where is it?

32
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,580
You don't have to take it, I know the way

33
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,580
Someone's holding it

34
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,580
Excuse me

35
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,580
You go first

36
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,580
No, you go first

37
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,580
It's Lady Bast

38
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,580
What?

39
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,680
No, Lady First

40
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
You go first

41
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,680
The lips

42
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
The lips

43
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
Why the lips?

44
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,680
Because there's a lipstick on it

45
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Get off

46
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Thank you

47
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,780
What?

48
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,780
The Queen of the Trophy

49
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,780
The Golden City of the Trophy

50
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,780
The Golden Cat

51
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,780
The Super High Rating

52
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,780
The Ratings

53
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,780
There are many opportunities for revenge

54
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,780
Hurry up and join

55
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,780
Aomensin Pujin Entertainment City

56
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,780
772772

57
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,780
How did you know my house was here?

58
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,780
You said you lived with Won Tak

59
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,780
You said you didn't know where you lived

60
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
You said you didn't know where you lived

61
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
That's...

62
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Oh, Won Tak

63
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Hi

64
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
You're here to throw away the trash again, aren't you?

65
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
What happened?

66
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Mr. Jin was drunk so I drove instead

67
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,880
What?

68
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
No, no, no

69
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
To give it to you? It's dangerous

70
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,980
So...

71
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,980
You can give it to my house

72
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,980
I have a friend who's been drinking for a while

73
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,980
My friend's house

74
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,980
No, it's okay

75
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,980
You can rest at home

76
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,980
Let's go, I'll give it to you

77
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,980
No, you're drunk, you should go home

78
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,980
I'll give it to you

79
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,980
Right?

80
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
Yeah

81
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,980
Bye

82
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Anyway

83
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,980
Our Won Tak

84
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,980
Our Won Tak

85
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
No

86
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,080
He kissed me just now

87
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
And he's going home with a different guy's arm

88
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,080
I was going to give him a massage today

89
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Why did I do that?

90
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
Why did I do that?

91
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,080
Hormone?

92
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Pericardium?

93
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
A man's tears

94
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
Are they impure?

95
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
I'm sorry

96
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,180
No, no

97
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,180
Then maybe

98
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,180
Can I come in for a second?

99
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,180
Yeah

100
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,180
You can come in

101
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,180
Oh, my

102
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Oh...

103
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Are you going somewhere?

104
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,280
I have to go out with my emergency

105
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Oh...

106
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
Is everything okay?

107
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
I said everything's okay

108
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
If something happens

109
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Don't be so stubborn and talk

110
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Like last time at the police station

111
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,280
And last time at the department store

112
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,280
It's weird, you and that guy

113
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,380
What?

114
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,380
You...

115
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,380
Maybe

116
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,380
Maybe?

117
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,380
Are you being threatened?

118
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,380
What?

119
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,380
Threatening is nothing else

120
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,380
Physical or mental

121
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,380
If you feel threatened

122
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,380
That's what you're threatening

123
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,380
Even if you're the most powerful

124
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,380
You have the right and duty

125
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
I'm not forcing you to do that

126
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Why are you...

127
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Oh, the right-hand man

128
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
The right-hand man

129
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
What?

130
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Right-hand man

131
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Are you listening to me?

132
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Yeah, I'm listening

133
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,480
Anyway

134
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
The right-hand man and the left-hand man

135
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Tell me what I can't do

136
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Don't drag me around

137
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,580
If I can't do it, will you let go?

138
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,580
No, I'll take care of it

139
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,580
I'll tell you if something happens

140
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,580
Wake up, Kim Dalri

141
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,580
Wake up, Kim Dalri

142
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,580
Oh my gosh

143
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,580
Are they here to get us out of the exhibition?

144
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,580
Not to get our debt?

145
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,580
I called the emergency department

146
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,580
The sun was out today

147
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,580
Oh, my

148
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,680
What's going on?

149
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,680
What's going on?

150
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,680
Hello, everyone

151
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
Director

152
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Congratulations

153
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,680
Oh, my

154
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
They're going crazy

155
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,680
Oh, my

156
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,680
Who invited the celebrities and influencers?

157
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,680
Oh, my

158
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,680
They must have heard the news

159
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
It was so hot after the press conference

160
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,680
Of course

161
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Jewelry and One Piece

162
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,680
They were all over the place

163
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,680
I didn't see the celebrities

164
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,680
Do you think they'll just come?

165
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,680
If they post a picture with a bag on

166
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,780
They'll be out of the brand for a year

167
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,780
It's all about money

168
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,780
Money

169
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,780
Is it Taejin?

170
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,780
Gongju

171
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,780
The artist doesn't care about money

172
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,780
No matter how much money is sold

173
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,780
Do you know how much money is sold

174
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
To the ones who can't pay?

175
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,780
Remember that

176
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,780
Okay?

177
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,780
Anyway

178
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,780
We covered all the celebrities

179
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,780
Without a single cent

180
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
We covered them all

181
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Is this what you call a 100%?

182
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
You're the real

183
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
A fortune teller

184
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
No

185
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Kim Dali

186
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Kim Dali

187
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
Kim Dali

188
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Why are you guys doing this?

189
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
You just put a spoon on the table

190
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
If you talk so modestly

191
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
We should take a walk

192
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Let's go

193
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,980
Kim Dali

194
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,980
Kim Dali

195
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,980
Kim Dali

196
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,980
Kim Dali

197
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,980
Kim Dali

198
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,980
Kim Dali

199
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,980
Kim Dali

200
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,980
Where is he?

201
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,980
Let's go and have a meeting

202
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,980
Today is the day of the meeting?

203
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,980
Let's go

204
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,980
What is this?

205
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,980
Hey

206
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,980
Come here

207
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
Then the art camp program

208
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
We will prepare it with Dondon FMB

209
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,980
We will deliver the related data

210
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,980
To Dondon as soon as we are done

211
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,980
I will go to the orphanage

212
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,980
What's next?

213
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,980
Next is the opinion of the audience

214
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
It's a suggestion

215
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,080
To make the parents who are tired of parenting

216
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
To enjoy the exhibition

217
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
We should open a kids cafe

218
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
No

219
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
Even if the world is out of your control

220
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
What are you doing in the art cafe?

221
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,080
A kiss cafe?

222
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
Why do you kiss in the art cafe?

223
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,080
Kids cafe

224
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Did I help you that much?

225
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,180
Did I help you?

226
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,180
I said kiss

227
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Kids cafe

228
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,180
Kids cafe

229
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,180
Next is the kiss herring

230
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,180
Kiss herring

231
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,180
Why don't you kiss?

232
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,180
Why do you do that?

233
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,180
It's the artist's name

234
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Kiss herring

235
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,280
What's wrong with the artist's name?

236
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Is it really his name?

237
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
The next week's work is

238
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
The poem and the two names

239
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,280
Romantic poet

240
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Words word the Byron

241
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Ki-i-t

242
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Ki-i-t

243
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Ki-i-t

244
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
I'm sorry

245
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Okay

246
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
Let's continue

247
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
Did you go home well yesterday?

248
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
What's wrong?

249
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
What's the matter?

250
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
Teacher Jin

251
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,280
Tell me

252
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Why are you doing this?

253
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
What do you mean?

254
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Are you uncomfortable because of yesterday?

255
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,280
I'm sorry

256
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,380
If you're uncomfortable because of yesterday

257
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,380
What's there to be uncomfortable about?

258
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,380
We're not teenage teenagers

259
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,380
It could be like that between grown-up men and women

260
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,380
I was relaxed and tired yesterday

261
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,380
I was so nervous that I made a mistake

262
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,380
Mistake?

263
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,380
Disorder?

264
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,380
Disorder?

265
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,380
Accident?

266
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Accident?

267
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
Anyway, I'll apologize for anything

268
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Just like nothing happened

269
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Can't we go back to the past

270
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
As a family of the rich and the poor

271
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
Like you said, I'm an adult

272
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
So I'll be gentle

273
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
I did what I could

274
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
And I did what I needed to do

275
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Do you kiss a man by mistake?

276
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,480
I never make mistakes with my mouth

277
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Eating, speaking

278
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,580
Doing

279
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
And what we did yesterday

280
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,580
And why do you make such a big mistake

281
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,580
What big mistake?

282
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,580
I wasn't a mistake

283
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
So, Kim Dal-ri

284
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
Think about it again

285
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,680
Was the moment we shared

286
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Yesterday really a mistake?

287
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,680
I'm sorry

288
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,780
I'm sorry

289
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,780
I'm sorry

290
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
The road is a bit rough

291
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,980
I'm sorry

292
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,980
Sir

293
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,980
That's my house

294
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,980
This is your house?

295
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,980
The very top of that building?

296
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,980
Yes

297
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,980
That's Joo Won-tak's house

298
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,980
Dal-ri lives here

299
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,980
Yes

300
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,980
And...

301
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,980
What else is left?

302
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,980
The owner of the building is Jin Moo-hak

303
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,980
Gamja-tang?

304
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
Gamja-tang?

305
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
It doesn't look like it was drawn on purpose

306
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,080
But it looks like it was a coincidence

307
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
What a coincidence

308
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,080
It's a writer who gets on my nerves

309
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,080
No

310
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,080
No matter how different the world is

311
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
What are you doing at an art gallery?

312
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
A kiss cafe?

313
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
Why would you kiss at an art gallery?

314
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,080
No

315
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Why would you kiss me instead of me?

316
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,080
I'm sorry

317
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
I wasn't a mistake

318
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
So, Dal-ri

319
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
Think about it again

320
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,180
If the moment we shared yesterday was a mistake or not

321
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,180
What's wrong with you?

322
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,180
Dal-ri?

323
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,180
How did you get here?

324
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
I have more questions

325
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
What?

326
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,280
Why did you have to go to a place like that?

327
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
What's wrong?

328
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
Sir, let's go

329
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
Go

330
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,280
Get out

331
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
You can get up

332
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,280
It's less painful

333
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
How did you know this place?

334
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,380
Is it harder for me to understand this situation?

335
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,380
Is it harder for Won-tak to find a house?

336
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,380
A donation?

337
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,380
It's a meeting where young managers meet every time they have time

338
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,380
They go on yachts and golf

339
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,380
The more it's a meeting, the more they like the name

340
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,380
Everyone liked it because it was a donation

341
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,480
If you can get a good foundation, you can open a wallet anytime

342
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
So make sure to make a good program

343
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
It was really hard for me

344
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,480
I went to find a lot of sponsors while preparing for the exhibition

345
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
They were all my father's connections

346
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,480
It was hard to find a meeting because it was hard to find time

347
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,480
It was hard to find a meeting

348
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
For them, the art sponsor was not the foundation

349
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,480
It was your father's foundation

350
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,480
The amount of money he had to pay for his father's death must have disappeared

351
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,480
It's been a lot of water on the floor while you were out

352
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
I'll say hello

353
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
This weekend is fine, right?

354
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,480
This weekend?

355
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Yeah, this weekend's meeting

356
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
It went well after a natural greeting

357
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
What?

358
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Is something wrong?

359
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,580
I'm so pathetic

360
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,580
I don't know if I was this incompetent

361
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,580
Or if I couldn't do anything by myself

362
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,580
I keep blaming you

363
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,580
I hate myself

364
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:26,580
Why did you die and become the most responsible for your father's death?

365
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,580
You gave up on your favorite study

366
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,580
You organized all your property

367
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,580
You gave up on everything you did to not give up for a week

368
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,680
It's not something anyone can do

369
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
You're doing well

370
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,680
But where are we going?

371
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
What are you looking for?

372
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,680
I don't know if you'll remember the password

373
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Go in and talk

374
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,680
I'm sorry

375
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,680
I couldn't stay calm because I chose this house with you

376
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,680
But I can't live in it

377
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Other than me and Secretary Kim

378
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,680
The company and the house don't know

379
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,780
It means I can keep it a secret

380
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,780
Keep it a secret?

381
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,780
There's nothing to think about

382
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,780
It's just an empty house

383
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,780
You can come in whenever you need it

384
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,780
You can leave whenever you want

385
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,780
It's better if you don't

386
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,780
Dal-hee

387
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,780
What should I do then?

388
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,780
I'm just staying still because I live in a house like that?

389
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,780
I'm not buying you a house

390
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,780
I can't do this for you

391
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,780
Even if you can do it for everyone

392
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,780
You can't do that

393
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,780
What?

394
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,780
You left the wedding for a few days

395
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,780
And you're acting like a patient

396
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,780
And you're coming here like a saint

397
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,780
Because I have nowhere to go

398
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,780
To our newlywed house?

399
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,780
Are you being considerate?

400
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
Are you being considerate?

401
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
If you keep your password

402
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,880
You thought you'd be touched?

403
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
Why are you so cool?

404
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Why are you so...

405
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,880
You don't care?

406
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
If I didn't care

407
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
I wouldn't have let you go

408
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
When I saw you at the funeral home

409
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,880
I was acting like a saint right next to you

410
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,880
So that you wouldn't hurt your feelings

411
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
So that you wouldn't back down

412
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,880
I was so careful, you know?

413
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
It's not because I don't like you

414
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,880
It's because I don't want to use your situation

415
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
Let's start over

416
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
What?

417
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
For the past 5 years

418
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
I've never forgotten you

419
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
Because of my choice

420
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,980
I've been in pain every day

421
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,980
You haven't forgotten me either, have you?

422
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,980
Yeah

423
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,980
I haven't forgotten you either

424
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,980
How can I forget you?

425
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,980
I heard that

426
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,980
But

427
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,980
What didn't work 5 years ago

428
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,980
Was that I didn't want you to forget me

429
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,980
Is it possible now?

430
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,980
The art gallery at this hour is different, right?

431
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,980
After a long sleep

432
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,980
The paintings are even more shiny

433
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,980
Then, if we get married

434
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,980
Are we going on a date at this hour?

435
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,980
Here?

436
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,980
Every day?

437
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,980
Are you coming here with me every day?

438
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,980
Of course

439
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,980
Like a black bird

440
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,980
I'll follow you everywhere

441
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,980
No matter what happens

442
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,980
I'll be there for you

443
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,080
No matter what happens

444
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,080
Until the end of the world

445
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Forever

446
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,080
I'll be there for you

447
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,080
The surface of my heart

448
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,080
That has you in it

449
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,080
Fading

450
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,080
Disappearing again

451
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:23,180
I want you to hold me

452
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:32,180
Let me shine all night long

453
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,180
I can't find you in my heart

454
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:46,180
The same face as your face

455
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:52,280
I'm a lonely, hidden

456
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:58,280
No one knows

457
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,280
I'm in your room

458
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:08,280
Where are you?

459
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,280
I want you to hold me

460
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,280
Let me shine all night long

461
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,280
I can't find you in my heart

462
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,280
The same face as your face

463
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,280
I'm a lonely, hidden

464
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,380
No one knows

465
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,380
I'm in your room

466
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,380
Where are you?

467
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,380
I'm going to go in later

468
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,380
I'm going in

469
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,380
Do you have anything to buy?

470
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
Where?

471
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
It's the same as when I was young

472
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
Why aren't you going in?

473
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,480
I just like this neighborhood so much

474
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
There's a playground like this

475
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,480
I went to the convenience store

476
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,580
There's a playground and a convenience store

477
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,580
The rooftop night view is amazing

478
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
You don't even go to such a neighborhood?

479
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,580
So come in and sleep

480
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,580
You always say that it's an emergency because of me

481
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,580
You sleep in the dormitory

482
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,580
If you keep doing that

483
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,580
I can't stay here

484
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,680
Who says it's because of you?

485
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,680
It's usually like that with detectives

486
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,680
What happened today?

487
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
What do you mean?

488
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,680
It's been a long time

489
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,680
I got a confession from a man

490
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
I was a little excited

491
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,680
Kim Nalli didn't die

492
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,680
And then

493
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
To some men

494
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,680
I got a suggestion to come in and live

495
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
It's a normal day

496
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Everyone spends a day like that

497
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
Did you meet that guy?

498
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
He's asking you to meet him again?

499
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
Do you want to come in and live?

500
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
What are you talking about?

501
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,780
What did you say?

502
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,780
You didn't say you'd do that, did you?

503
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,780
That bastard, Haengyeon, is not the director

504
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,780
If you're just sweating, I'm really strong

505
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,780
Do you still have feelings for him?

506
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,780
You can't fix people

507
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,780
He can't

508
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,780
It's over with Taejin

509
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,780
He's already gone

510
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,780
People say

511
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,780
When you're having a hard time, you don't say it

512
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,780
That it's over

513
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,780
The pain and sadness

514
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,780
They disappear with time

515
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,780
But if you think about it, it's a sad thing

516
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,780
The happy

517
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,780
The things I loved

518
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,780
They all disappear

519
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,880
They all disappear in the end

520
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
Mom

521
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Dad

522
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
Taejin

523
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,880
Nothing lasts forever

524
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
Right?

525
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
Euntak

526
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
But please stay with me for a long time

527
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
Don't go away

528
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Then I'll be so lonely

529
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
I'm sorry

530
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,880
Oh, there, there

531
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,980
Oh, I'm sorry

532
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,980
Oh, you look so

533
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,980
kind

534
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,980
Is it because you're a police officer in Korea?

535
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,980
That's what Kim Dali said

536
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,980
Did you say something

537
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,980
when you were walking Kim Dali last time?

538
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,980
What did you say?

539
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,980
Oh, well, I didn't

540
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
I didn't say anything

541
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Don't say it right away

542
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
If you look back on it

543
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
I didn't say it

544
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Oh, my Euntak

545
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,080
You're always so short-tempered

546
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
You didn't save water and electricity

547
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
But you saved your words

548
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Why, why, why

549
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
I said it was nice and friendly

550
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,080
If you ask Dali to do it again

551
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
I'll die

552
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,080
Oh, my

553
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,080
That, that, that

554
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
How did you know about the O-sol-i scramble in Majang-dong?

555
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,080
If you weren't Dali's friend

556
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
The night is so nice

557
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
The night is so nice

558
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,080
You always look at your face at work

559
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
Do you have to call me on weekends?

560
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,080
You'll get caught in labor law

561
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,080
Come in and live

562
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,080
Yeah

563
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,080
I have to eat home cooked meals once a week

564
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,080
Madam, the meal is ready

565
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,180
Yes, let's go

566
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,180
Home cooked meals, yes

567
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,180
Home cooked meals at home

568
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,180
But do you have to eat at home?

569
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,180
Who's eating at home?

570
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,180
I'm eating because it's delicious, this isn't work

571
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,180
If I drink this much

572
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,180
I don't have to work anymore

573
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,180
I can go to the infirmary right away

574
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,180
Wow, this is amazing

575
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,180
This party

576
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
I said it was a work of art

577
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,280
I was wondering how great it was

578
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Hey, I'd be better than that painting even if I did it with my feet

579
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Isn't that right?

580
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
No, I've never seen a bunch of people

581
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,280
who are out of their minds

582
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
like that

583
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
A crazy bitch doesn't forget the sound

584
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Doesn't she put the business in the coffin?

585
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
She looks at it again

586
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
and says it's good, and she's holding hands

587
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
She's drunk

588
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
She's just a fool

589
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
That's what art is

590
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,380
Eating and doing nothing is money

591
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,380
Why do you have to bring money?

592
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,380
Oh, really

593
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,380
Did you really not feel anything?

594
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,380
After seeing those works?

595
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,380
What?

596
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,380
What? What?

597
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,380
Something here

598
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,380
Something that's hot

599
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,380
and it's like a dragon's howl

600
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,380
Something that can't be expressed in words

601
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,380
Something here

602
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,380
Just burn!

603
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Burn with your feet!

604
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Did you just burn your feet?

605
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,660
I'm not a

606
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,660
foodie

607
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,660
Eat, guys

608
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,660
Eating alone at home

609
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,660
and being lonely and lonely at the same time

610
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,660
Why did I come here?

611
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,660
If you're lonely, get married

612
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,660
Married? With who? An Sangtae's daughter?

613
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
What's the big deal about that?

614
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
You� I'm not closer to you

615
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Oh no, too sweet

616
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,180
GonnaDead式

617
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,180
U.S.A générals

618
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,200
Season 3

619
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
A.K.A Grandma's Millionaire

620
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,760
Urgent

621
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,260
ники

622
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,380
Pinocchio

623
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,380
returns

624
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,380
Busy

625
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,380
B caterpillar

626
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,380
What?

627
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,820
I'm saying...

628
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:27,160
You should marry a woman who likes you more than a woman who hates you.

629
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,660
Isn't that right?

630
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,600
What are you talking about?

631
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,100
What are you talking about?

632
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
Hey, hey, hey!

633
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,140
Take this.

634
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,180
I bought one more to eat at home.

635
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
This too.

636
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,260
Soybean paste?

637
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,260
It's been a hundred years since I made soybean paste.

638
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,520
Go and make some soup.

639
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,560
You should've packed it in a plastic bag.

640
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Hey.

641
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
How long are you going to keep the art gallery like that?

642
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,140
What do you mean?

643
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,200
You're so young and you're just going to stand around

644
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,420
and try to get your hands off it just to pay me back $2 million.

645
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,700
What are you going to do then?

646
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,540
You can't keep the art gallery anyway.

647
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,400
What? Don't make the poor girl lose her hope

648
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,080
and lose more weight.

649
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,740
Just say that we're going to take the money.

650
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,280
What are you talking about?

651
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,040
You're not going to make me lose $2 million anyway.

652
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,020
If you want to eat, eat it now.

653
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,580
Before you get sick and sick again.

654
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,420
I'm sick.

655
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,180
Bye.

656
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,660
Darn it.

657
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,020
Hey, Wiseo.

658
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,180
I need to find out something.

659
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,420
You?

660
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,320
You bought this land?

661
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,320
Why?

662
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,420
Didn't you know?

663
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,020
It's a huge land.

664
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,120
Is there a development project?

665
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,120
I'm not sure.

666
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,120
I'm not sure.

667
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,120
I'm not sure.

668
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,120
I'm not sure.

669
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,120
I'm not sure.

670
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,120
I'm not sure.

671
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,120
I'm not sure.

672
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,120
I'm not sure.

673
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,120
I'm not sure.

674
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
I'm not sure.

675
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,120
I'm not sure.

676
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,120
I'm not sure.

677
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,720
Is there a development project?

678
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,120
It's a development project.

679
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,120
You should think that there's no deal.

680
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,120
That's what I thought, but it wasn't.

681
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,820
The Amami deal was in effect five or six years ago.

682
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,520
It's been back to business recently.

683
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,220
Do you know when it started?

684
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,220
Since Director Kim Nakcheon died.

685
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,020
You said that

686
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,020
there were more than one or two places

687
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,320
that wanted to open a clean-up museum.

688
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,520
What did you hear from them?

689
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,920
I guess the person who wanted to develop

690
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,220
Director Kim Nakcheon was a big shot.

691
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,420
He was the most important person

692
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,020
in the art department.

693
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,920
He was a big shot in the social sector,

694
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,920
but he must be removed from the development.

695
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,420
He was working with a civic organization.

696
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,920
Anyway, he said he was a big shot.

697
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,220
You can't protect Director Kim Nakcheon anyway.

698
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,220
If you want to eat, eat now.

699
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,120
Before you see everything.

700
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,420
But I looked at the head of the land

701
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,620
just in case.

702
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,020
You know the VIP guests at the opening party?

703
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,620
I saw a lot of their names.

704
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,620
The VIP guests at the opening party

705
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,620
are the VIP guests.

706
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,620
I'm sure they're the VIP guests.

707
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,820
Go Siwon?

708
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,820
Yes.

709
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,820
You look like Go Siwon.

710
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,620
I'm curious about that.

711
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,820
It depends on the condition.

712
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,320
But with the price of your scarf,

713
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,820
you can buy it for three months.

714
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,620
Ms. Gong.

715
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,720
Did I do something wrong to you?

716
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,720
You always feel like you're standing on edge.

717
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,620
I'm not standing on edge.

718
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,720
Have you ever thought that people around you

719
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,220
are too kind?

720
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,820
What?

721
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,020
You've never thought that.

722
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,720
You're always so helpful and kind.

723
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,120
You're always so generous and kind.

724
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,820
See you at the exhibition.

725
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,420
You put a spoon on the last thing we prepared

726
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,220
and took all the balls by yourself.

727
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,320
I'm jealous.

728
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,420
The world is so easy with a clean-up.

729
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,220
If that's what you think, I'm impressed.

730
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,020
But Ms. Gong,

731
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,520
the world isn't everything.

732
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,220
Right.

733
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,720
It's not everything.

734
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,120
Hello.

735
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,120
The director and the secretary are a bit late.

736
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,820
They'll be joining us later.

737
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,120
Okay.

738
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,520
Let's go in.

739
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,720
The Three Frogs Restaurant

740
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,820
is not a program to feed children.

741
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,020
It's a program to understand the art world of Da Vinci

742
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,220
and to participate in Da Vinci's recipes.

743
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,920
That's what it's about.

744
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,920
I'd like to present a more realistic recipe...

745
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,120
Yes, Ms. Song.

746
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,320
Go ahead.

747
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,720
I think there's been a mistake.

748
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:27,340
I heard that Ms. Ha's

749
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,720
I'm sorry.

750
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,920
Come in.

751
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,820
This is the most important part.

752
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,620
I'm worried...

753
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,920
Director.

754
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,820
Is it over already?

755
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,620
I was just about to leave.

756
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,720
Then I'll just...

757
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,120
I'll take care of it.

758
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,320
You two can leave.

759
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,120
Okay.

760
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,020
Have a seat.

761
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,120
What's going on?

762
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,320
Why do you look so pale?

763
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,320
Mr. Jin.

764
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,120
Tell me.

765
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,820
Did you invite a PR agency

766
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,620
for the opening ceremony?

767
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,320
The idols and influencers

768
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,220
that we didn't invite, the YouTubers...

769
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,020
Yes, I did.

770
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,320
I invited them.

771
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,420
What?

772
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,820
I thought something big was going to happen.

773
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,520
Opening ceremonies are something you can't ignore.

774
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,120
When you launch a new product or open a restaurant,

775
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,320
you have to call in people

776
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,420
and make them talk about it.

777
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,520
I had to apologize in the beginning

778
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,720
even if it was just for the money.

779
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,120
So I overreacted.

780
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,120
That's what's left of the business.

781
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,020
Look.

782
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,420
People are all over the place.

783
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,120
Then what about the first day's audience?

784
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,020
No, no.

785
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,620
I don't do that much.

786
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,320
No matter how much it's rumored,

787
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,120
there has to be evidence,

788
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,520
whether it's pictures or pictures.

789
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,320
If you just put a few people in a line

790
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,720
and take good pictures,

791
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,520
it looks like a lot of people.

792
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,320
Why are you doing this?

793
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,720
Why would you do that?

794
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,120
You're all trying to make money.

795
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,920
Do you think someone's doing this because they have money?

796
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,920
And the windmill is

797
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,920
a basic thing that even elementary schools and chicks use.

798
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,120
I think someone's using some amazing technology.

799
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,320
Artists don't sell.

800
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,220
Why not?

801
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,020
You got paid and sold tickets.

802
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,420
Why?

803
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,020
Do you think you're a good businessman?

804
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,320
You should be elegant, high-class, and rich.

805
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,220
Are you hurting your pride?

806
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,020
That's not what I meant.

807
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,620
This is a trick to trick the audience.

808
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:05,920
You're really shitting me.

809
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,820
Mr. Jin.

810
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,220
I thought you were in your right mind.

811
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,020
Fine, I like this.

812
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,520
I've lived without knowing how much money I've made.

813
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,020
Let's move on to the money issue.

814
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:20,720
Then what about your art and work?

815
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,720
You guys are all fighting over the money.

816
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,120
You're partying and drinking wine.

817
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,720
Is that enough?

818
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,420
Do you think you're okay without the audience?

819
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,720
Is it okay if you don't show it to people?

820
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,720
You said you made it after years of hard work.

821
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,720
You said you prepared it

822
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,920
so that people like you can't sleep at night.

823
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,120
Then you should show it to at least one person.

824
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,520
This is a work by Choi Jeonghwa.

825
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,820
As you can see,

826
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:54,820
I only make the garbage from Ilsan.

827
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,120
I'm the best artist in the world.

828
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,320
I'm the best artist in the world.

829
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,120
An art museum without people.

830
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,120
What's the difference between a piece of art?

831
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,920
I know everything you said is true.

832
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,120
But I don't want to admit it.

833
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,320
If I want to show a good piece

834
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,320
to at least one person, I have to try everything.

835
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,320
I need money, of course.

836
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,520
But I can't accept that money is the only thing

837
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,420
that can decide everything.

838
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,120
It's not because of my pride.

839
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,620
It's not because I'm a high school student.

840
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,820
I don't want my employees' efforts

841
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,920
to be ignored by money.

842
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,420
I don't want to be an insult to other art museums.

843
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,720
If you were proud,

844
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,020
you wouldn't have hidden it from me either, right?

845
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,620
It's not because I'm not proud.

846
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,120
It's because I wanted to see you happy.

847
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,320
Like in the Netherlands,

848
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,820
if I wanted to see you smile at least once,

849
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,920
I would have done it.

850
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,620
Then you should have found another way.

851
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,220
talking to someone

852
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,720
You punk!

853
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,120
You punk!

854
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,620
Hey, don't you know who I am?

855
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:30,020
I'm Kim Siyeong, the head of the cleaners!

856
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,420
I know.

857
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,820
Why would the head of the cleaners

858
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,520
rent money to sell the market?

859
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,420
You're going to piss off our people?

860
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,020
How much longer do I have to wait?

861
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,420
I can't afford to sell my art!

862
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,020
How would our people know that?

863
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:52,220
You know that your love for me is endless, right?

864
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,520
You punk!

865
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,320
I'm Lee Jiyeong.

866
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,720
Whether you bring money,

867
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,320
or bring your stuff, or bring your will,

868
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,520
you must bring one of the three options.

869
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,320
Hey, let's go.

870
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,120
What the...

871
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,520
This is it!

872
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,120
Hey, the rescue team has to order the dresser.

873
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,620
Isn't the operator here yet?

874
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,420
They're going to sell the dresser and the sales

875
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,320
at the art gallery themselves.

876
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,220
They took all the equipment and the credit card.

877
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,420
Who?

878
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,620
What? The new head.

879
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,320
This is crazy!

880
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,120
Where is it?

881
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,820
Where did you get it?

882
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,620
Where did you get it?

883
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,120
Where did you get my cafe?

884
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,320
Hey,

885
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,320
who are you to take it with you?

886
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,120
Who are you to make your own cafe?

887
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,020
What's wrong with you?

888
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,120
Get out of here.

889
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,620
Don't meddle in other people's business.

890
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,120
Watch your mouth.

891
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,520
What?

892
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,620
You can leave. It's okay.

893
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,320
The cafe is

894
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,620
a business department that's originally in the art gallery.

895
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,520
You said you'd take care of the department

896
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,620
that's not doing well. What's the problem?

897
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,220
The cafe is...

898
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,120
My uncle told me to take care of the department

899
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,520
and he told me to take care of the art gallery.

900
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,220
He told me to take care of the art gallery.

901
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,420
He told me to take care of the department

902
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,220
and he told me to take care of the art gallery.

903
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,220
You don't know what you're doing.

904
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,720
The art gallery was originally mine.

905
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,920
You're different from what I heard from your father.

906
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,020
You were kicked out of school because of drugs

907
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,620
and you were kicked out by your father.

908
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,320
Wouldn't it be unpleasant if you were left

909
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,520
at a cafe by a guy who goes to Korea empty-handed?

910
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,020
That's what he told me.

911
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,320
What?

912
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,920
The operating expenses are paid for

913
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,520
and I don't know how much it costs.

914
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,020
The furniture is ruined and I can't even report it.

915
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,020
He's my father.

916
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,320
I know he told me to do that because he's my nephew,

917
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,420
but I can't do it anymore.

918
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,520
If you don't like it, you can leave the art gallery.

919
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,820
But...

920
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:21,920
Junsun.

921
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,220
The art gallery is really tough.

922
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,220
This isn't just my problem.

923
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,420
It's your problem and my family's problem.

924
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,220
Help me, okay?

925
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,120
Who do you think I can trust and rely on in this situation?

926
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,120
I know.

927
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,420
You can leave it to me. I know.

928
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,720
I'll take care of this mess for you.

929
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:52,920
What?

930
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,020
Hey.

931
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,820
Do you think it makes sense for a girl

932
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,120
to be a part of the family?

933
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,120
What did you do to your father's daughter?

934
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,320
I'm warning you.

935
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,820
Don't touch me.

936
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,120
If you touch me one more time,

937
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,220
I don't know what to do.

938
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,220
Got it?

939
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,320
No need.

940
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,120
Are you okay?

941
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,520
Yes, I'm fine.

942
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,920
But not while you're alive,

943
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,800
either trying your best or carefully.

944
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,060
I guess you don't see the changes any more.

945
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:09,920
Some people sometimes express sadness with their words.

946
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,720
Siyeong must be upset too.

947
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,120
If he was that kind of person...

948
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,620
Yes, I guess so.

949
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,820
I'll do it.

950
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,120
It's okay.

951
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,720
Did he say he was tired today?

952
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,220
Wontak, were you on a day off today?

953
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,720
Did he go to the convenience store?

954
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:15,320
Yes.

955
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,320
Hey.

956
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,320
Are you home?

957
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,320
Yeah.

958
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,320
I can't go in today.

959
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:33,320
Keep your eyes closed.

960
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:15,320
Oh, my God.

961
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:45,320
Hey.

962
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:15,320
Oh, my God.

963
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:25,320
Dalri?

964
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:45,320
Oh, my God.

965
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:55,320
I'm going to be a new person all night.

966
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,320
I can't help but be worried.

967
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,320
That's why I can't help but worry.

968
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:09,320
Are you two living together?

969
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,320
Please introduce me today.

970
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,320
I think you're mistaken.

971
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,320
I'm the supervisor and you're the sponsor.

972
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,320
I'm buying the land around the museum from Don Don's F&B.

973
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,320
It's true that you're suspicious.

974
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,320
Shouldn't you make excuses or explain?

975
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,320
It's a warning.

976
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,320
When you say something good, you fall for Dalri.
