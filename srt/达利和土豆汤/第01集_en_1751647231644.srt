1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
The Yu Family

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Where's Dolly?

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,520
Where else would she be?

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,720
Why is the director so obsessed with Ali?

5
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,400
Because without having to lift a finger,

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,560
the director gets the finest research papers from Dolly time and time again.

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,040
Not only that, but Dolly's from a wealthy family.

8
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,640
And we all know how the director loves rich people.

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Yeah.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
Okay.

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,480
I'm going to go check on the hospital.

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,640
I'm going to go check on the hospital.

13
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Hi, Mrs. Call.

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,140
How long have you been like this?

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,640
Three and a half days.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Have you eaten?

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,640
Oh, right.

18
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,640
You're surviving on sweets again?

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Well, science says that humans store about

20
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,640
160,000 calories in their body.

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,640
If we calculate that the average human requires

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,640
about 1,600 calories,

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,640
this means we can survive at least three months

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
on stored energy.

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
On top of that, if we consume enough liquids and salt...

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,640
How many times must I tell you

27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,640
that this museum is not a library?

28
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
As director of this museum,

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,640
I cannot have people accusing me of neglecting my employees

30
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,640
to the point of overworking them to death.

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,640
Go home, eat something real, and go to bed.

32
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
But Mrs. Call,

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,640
No books, no papers, no tablet.

34
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
Just sleep.

35
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,640
Even if I'm not sleepy at all?

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
Even if you're not sleepy at all.

37
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,640
This is so, so unfair.

38
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
This is so...

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Don't come into work tomorrow.

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Go to this museum tomorrow.

41
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
I'm going to sleep.

42
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
I'm going to sleep.

43
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
I'm going to sleep.

44
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
I'm going to sleep.

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
I'm going to sleep.

46
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
I'm going to sleep.

47
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
I'm going to sleep.

48
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
I'm going to sleep.

49
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
I'm going to sleep.

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
I'm going to sleep.

51
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
I'm going to sleep.

52
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
I'm going to sleep.

53
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
I'm going to sleep.

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
I'm going to sleep.

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
I'm going to sleep.

56
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
I'm going to sleep.

57
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
And who knows?

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Maybe you'll see a Morgliani you love in that place that you hate.

59
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
Really? Are you serious?

60
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,640
But I'm Bronco's girl handsome Morgliani?

61
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
But Morgliani hasn't been in the market for years.

62
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Where did she get it?

63
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
I'm going to sleep.

64
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
If it's not Morgliani,

65
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
that party would be a disaster.

66
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Yes.

67
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,640
Everyone is interested in money,

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
but the party is a disaster.

69
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,640
But you have to keep bumping into people

70
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,640
to broaden your horizon.

71
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
In the end,

72
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,640
the real Morgliani is in the world.

73
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
By the way,

74
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,640
what have you been eating?

75
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Are you eating snacks?

76
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Did you forget to eat snacks because you were studying?

77
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Did you go out for a few days this time?

78
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
No, it's not like that.

79
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
No, it's not like that.

80
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
If you sleep with snacks, you can take care of yourself.

81
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
The reward frequency is high.

82
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
There are many opportunities to take revenge.

83
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Hurry up and join.

84
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,640
Aomensin Pujin Entertainment City 772772.com

85
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
I'm sure he found it.

86
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
It looks like Korea.

87
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
What?

88
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
He said he heard you nagging

89
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
and that it looks like he's at my house.

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,640
You're so talkative.

91
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
I miss you, Dad.

92
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,640
It's been so long since we last saw each other.

93
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,640
You're pretending to think of me

94
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,640
while you're not even taking care of a little thing.

95
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
My gosh.

96
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,640
I'm going to try to find out how things are going to turn out.

97
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,640
I'm going to meet Director Ko and say hello.

98
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,640
I'm going to see how you guys are doing.

99
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,640
When I'm done with this exhibition...

100
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Hello?

101
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Hello?

102
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Hello?

103
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Hello?

104
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Hello?

105
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Hello?

106
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Hello?

107
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Hello?

108
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Hello?

109
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Hello?

110
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Hello?

111
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
Hello?

112
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
Hello?

113
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
Hello?

114
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Hello?

115
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Hello?

116
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Hello?

117
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,640
The premium potato soup that was developed

118
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
to enter the 5-star hotel

119
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,640
will satisfy the needs of our diverse and luxury customers

120
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,640
100 percent.

121
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
I'm confident.

122
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,640
He has a different personality.

123
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,640
He's really sharp.

124
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,640
In addition to the name of the 5-star hotel and premium,

125
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,640
I've also prepared the best-selling

126
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640
and best-selling potato soup in the world,

127
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,640
the American potato.

128
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
I see.

129
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
I knew it.

130
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
I knew it was going to be a big deal.

131
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,640
I could feel the loneliness of a fighter

132
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
who was fighting death in the sun.

133
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
I knew it.

134
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,640
This is the fried rice that you can enjoy

135
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
after eating the potato soup.

136
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
Unlike the regular fried rice,

137
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
it's not raw fish roe.

138
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,640
It's fried with Russian caviar.

139
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
I've cooked it.

140
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Wow, my goodness.

141
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Fried rice with the precious caviar

142
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
that can only be found on the Russian table?

143
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,640
This is the high-class Korean food.

144
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,640
It's the world of Korean food.

145
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
My goodness.

146
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
You're pooping.

147
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
I'm pooping.

148
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,640
So how much is it?

149
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
The price...

150
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,640
It's the price of the premium and the 5-star hotel.

151
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
It's worth $18,000

152
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
for the Chinese currency.

153
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Darn it.

154
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Darn it.

155
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
$10,000?

156
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,640
I'm not sure if you know what I'm talking about.

157
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,640
The price of the Iberico and Russian caviar

158
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,640
is a bit high here.

159
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
What is potato soup?

160
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
It's the famous Korean food

161
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,640
that you can enjoy with little money.

162
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
That's potato soup.

163
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
It's cheap,

164
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
it's high in calories,

165
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
and it's so filling!

166
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
But what?

167
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,640
It's the best potato soup.

168
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,640
It's the best potato soup.

169
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,640
It's the best potato soup.

170
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
It's the best potato soup.

171
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Iberico caviar?

172
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Why would you buy a spade

173
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,640
when you're eating pork bones?

174
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,640
It's a poetic expression of taste.

175
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
You're pooping.

176
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
I'm pooping.

177
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
My goodness.

178
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,640
I'm not going to eat the spade

179
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
because you know it's too early for a drink.

180
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,640
It's a $20 million deal.

181
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
What?

182
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
Please, let's pay the money.

183
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
Pay the money!

184
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Gosh.

185
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
The local police will be waiting for you.

186
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,640
So there won't be any problems.

187
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,640
I'll leave as soon as the law is passed.

188
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
But...

189
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
That car...

190
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Who is it that is eating caviar by himself?

191
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
It's not a person,

192
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
but a Russian emperor.

193
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Oh, a Russian emperor.

194
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Then you could just say that.

195
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Why do you always speak English?

196
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
Do you want to look cool?

197
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
It's not English, it's Russian.

198
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
I know.

199
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,640
I know. I just said it.

200
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
It's a Russian emperor, so it's Russian.

201
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Do you think it's English?

202
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
I know the pronunciation.

203
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Car!

204
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,640
The pronunciation is Russian.

205
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,640
It's a car in English.

206
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
But...

207
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,640
Are you going to wear that watch?

208
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,640
You have to report it to the customs

209
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
and you're so obsessed with the expensive stuff.

210
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
You don't know?

211
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Everyone buys luxury goods to wear them.

212
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,640
Why would you spend so much money on a watch?

213
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
A cell phone watch is just too expensive.

214
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Yes.

215
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Look.

216
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Look.

217
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,640
You have to pay for a car to buy a watch.

218
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
Yes?

219
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Are you playing with money without me?

220
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
What are you talking about?

221
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Are you lending money to an art museum or a museum?

222
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
I never did that.

223
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Is money really that bad?

224
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Are you going to lend money to a museum?

225
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Then why would I send you a watch like this?

226
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,640
I just wanted to thank you for lending me money.

227
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
You're so annoying.

228
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
I don't know.

229
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
I think there's a problem.

230
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Don't break someone else's watch.

231
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Leave it to the secretary. I'll send it to her.

232
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Kim Manak, Gokgo, where are you?

233
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,640
You're not at work yet because you're taking a break, right?

234
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
What do you mean?

235
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
I'm at the airport.

236
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
I have a business trip today.

237
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,640
I'm signing a contract with the Netherlands.

238
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
Get rid of that business trip right now!

239
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
Get out of here!

240
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
Dad, dad.

241
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
The plane is leaving.

242
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
They want me to hang up.

243
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Hello? Hello?

244
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
What?

245
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
What?

246
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
Okay.

247
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
You punk!

248
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Get up!

249
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
You punk!

250
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
Gokgo, get up!

251
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
I'll be back after paying the bill!

252
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
You punk!

253
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,640
I'll pay you back!

254
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
What are you doing?

255
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Get out of here!

256
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
Get out of here!

257
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
The person you have called...

258
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,640
Why isn't he answering?

259
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
An art gallery?

260
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
It's not just an art gallery.

261
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,640
It's a clean place.

262
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
You know, right?

263
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
If you don't get invited to this party,

264
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
no matter how much you make,

265
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,640
you'll be ignored in this area.

266
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Why would a house like that lend me money?

267
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
If you're going to be so specific,

268
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
it's an investment.

269
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
How much money would it cost to sell

270
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
a painting that the owner of the house has?

271
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Would you be willing to lend us money?

272
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,640
Then sell the painting!

273
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
You punk.

274
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
How long are you going to be ignored

275
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
as the son of a potato stew restaurant?

276
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,640
What?

277
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,640
It's not just about money.

278
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,640
What we need is an identity.

279
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
That's why we need cleanliness.

280
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,640
So if we lend cleanliness money,

281
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
our identity will rise as a wealth?

282
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Who uses the word wealth these days?

283
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,640
It's called the inner circle.

284
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,640
That's how you build connections.

285
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,640
That's how you run a business.

286
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
That's how Korea is.

287
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
Forget it.

288
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
If you're going to talk nonsense, I'll get up.

289
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Are you saying I'm not your real brother?

290
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
Junsun.

291
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
If I were your father's real son,

292
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,640
I wouldn't ask you to do this.

293
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,640
It's because I'm a good dog.

294
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
What?

295
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,640
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

296
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

297
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
Whatever.

298
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
I lent you my money.

299
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
What are you going to do?

300
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
What are you going to do?

301
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,640
Call the general secretary and get all the business cards out.

302
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
The general secretary is on a business trip to the Netherlands.

303
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
I told you to get all the business cards out!

304
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Hurry up!

305
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
You told me to finish before the visitors come in.

306
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
What are you doing here?

307
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Ms. Hwang.

308
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Ms. Hwang!

309
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
It's beautiful, isn't it?

310
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,640
It's a reason why Park Bong-hye can survive here.

311
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,640
Do you prefer jajangmyeon or jjamppong?

312
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
Pardon?

313
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
What?

314
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
I mean lunch.

315
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
By the way, did you decide on your hand?

316
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,640
Then you're not watching a movie.

317
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Lunch menu is too difficult.

318
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
It's a problem of life.

319
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
In a way, you're a successful life.

320
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,640
The biggest problem of life is the lunch menu.

321
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Ms. Hwang, you haven't gone to work yet, have you?

322
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
I haven't.

323
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
I'm sorry.

324
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Hello?

325
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,640
This is Kim Nak-cheon.

326
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
What?

327
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Can you take responsibility for that?

328
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,640
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,640
Mr. Bong.

330
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Yes?

331
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
You're already at work?

332
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,640
You stayed up all night here?

333
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
I had something to take care of.

334
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
I'm sorry.

335
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
You don't have to do that.

336
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Thank you.

337
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
You'll get in trouble.

338
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
You're getting old.

339
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Did you take a break?

340
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
Of course.

341
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
You didn't take it.

342
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Go and take it.

343
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
That way, you can take your medicine.

344
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
If you're not feeling well, Dr. Han will ask me.

345
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
I'm not.

346
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
The worst part of a heart is stress,

347
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
overwork, and taking medicine.

348
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
You nag more than my daughter.

349
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,640
What's with the face?

350
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
What's with the drawing?

351
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Oh, right.

352
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Ms. Na Ru.

353
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,640
The art must be hung on the ceiling.

354
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,640
The weight of the exhibition room is 100kg.

355
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
The ceiling of the exhibition room.

356
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Can it withstand this weight?

357
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
Yes?

358
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
Ms. Han.

359
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
The artwork I got from New York yesterday was a bit weird.

360
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
I think someone did a hand-over.

361
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
What are you talking about?

362
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,640
I checked everything when I left work yesterday.

363
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,640
I had to check something yesterday,

364
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,640
so I went there and made a mistake.

365
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
The artwork is fine.

366
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,640
I think I just need to get the frame.

367
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
What did you check?

368
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
You made such a mistake.

369
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,640
As I got older,

370
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,640
I suddenly lost my legs.

371
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
I'll go and get it.

372
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,640
Will you?

373
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,640
Let's ask the Department of Safety

374
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,640
and think of a solution together.

375
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
Okay.

376
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
What's going on?

377
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Where did she go?

378
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Didn't you say you were going to the airport?

379
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,640
I just got a call that my mother collapsed.

380
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,640
I'm on my way to the hospital.

381
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Oh, no.

382
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Thankfully, she's in stable condition.

383
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
But Dolly,

384
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
I'll need you to go to the airport for me.

385
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
I can't.

386
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
You can't?

387
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
I'll call the police.

388
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
Okay.

389
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
I'll call the police right away.

390
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Okay, wait.

391
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
What should we do?

392
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
I know you can't be there,

393
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
but I have to go.

394
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
Okay, wait.

395
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
Wait.

396
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
I'm going to the airport for me.

397
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,640
Me?

398
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,640
The important guest today is Jin Hitenari, a world famous Japanese collector.

399
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Korean Japanese, I believe.

400
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,640
Anyways, his knowledge on art could give any expert a run for their money, so I can't trust anyone but you.

401
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,640
He has such great influence on the Arts Association that without him, there will be no exhibition for us this year.

402
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,640
You get how important he is?

403
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
Okay, don't worry about anything else.

404
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,640
Just kiss up to him. You know how crazy rich people are.

405
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Except you, of course.

406
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,640
Oh, gosh. Here's the keys to my car right there.

407
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Okay? Oh, but wait. You're not going to the party wearing that, are you?

408
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
Hey. I just got out.

409
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Well, I just slept a little.

410
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
What's going on?

411
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,640
Oh, come on.

412
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,640
It's a long way from here.

413
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,640
Yeah.

414
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

415
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,640
What's wrong with you?

416
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,640
What are you doing?

417
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
What?

418
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,640
What do you want?

419
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Okay. Okay.

420
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,640
I missed it. I didn't even get to do it.

421
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
Oh, no.

422
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
It's nothing.

423
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
Did you buy the shoes?

424
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,640
Don't worry. I brought some extra clothes to wear at the hotel.

425
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,640
But it's not like the party is fancy or grand.

426
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,640
You don't have to feel pressured because it's similar to the welcome party at the farm.

427
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
But you know, right?

428
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,640
You have to build a human sense of intimacy to make the contract easier.

429
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,640
A sense of intimacy?

430
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,640
That's my main dish.

431
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,640
By the way, where are you?

432
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,640
Oh, okay. I found it. See you tomorrow.

433
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
What's wrong with you?

434
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,640
Are you a crow or what?

435
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
Mr. Jin?

436
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Where's the car?

437
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
Over there.

438
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,640
You know how crazy rich people are.

439
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm sorry.

440
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,640
I'm Kim Dali, who is in charge of escort because of a sudden situation.

441
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Salvatore Dali and that Dali.

442
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
You know the designer candy, right?

443
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
Dad said that if you give him candy, he'll stop crying.

444
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
What time did you say the party started?

445
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,640
It takes about an hour and 30 minutes from here, so time is enough.

446
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
Did you enjoy the flight?

447
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
Are you serious?

448
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
Yes.

449
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Even if you're in first place, you only spend a lot of money.

450
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
There's no difference between economics and economics.

451
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Did I say Dali?

452
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Even if you succeed later, don't ride the first-class seat.

453
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,640
You'd rather buy a potato soup with that money and leave it.

454
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
What?

455
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,640
How many bowls of potato soup are there with that money?

456
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,640
The first-class seat is about 20 million won, and economics is 1 million won.

457
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,640
2 servings of potato soup is 30,000 won.

458
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,640
It's 633, take out the number.

459
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
What?

460
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,640
If you do it in one person, it's 1266 bowls.

461
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,640
I'm sorry. I didn't know that it was calculated.

462
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
No, no.

463
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
You're in a great position.

464
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,640
You have to have a habit of calculating everything at that time.

465
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,640
You don't have to be a ten-dollar bill.

466
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,640
Keep your mind at ease.

467
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,640
The guys who hit the back of your head are geniuses.

468
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
Genius?

469
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
Of course.

470
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,640
I heard that the association has put a lot of effort into this visit.

471
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,640
So everyone was looking forward to it.

472
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,640
There's a more naive corner than you think.

473
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,640
You're expecting me?

474
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
You're expecting money, right?

475
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
20 million won is your family name.

476
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,640
Everyone pretends not to be, but in the end, it's money.

477
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
This, this, and that.

478
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
That's how the world is.

479
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Yes.

480
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
The World of the Married

481
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,640
This is the party venue?

482
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
I heard it was a farmhouse.

483
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,640
It's a modernized reinterpretation of a farmhouse built in the 1700s.

484
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
It's really beautiful, right?

485
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Well, I spent some money.

486
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
The World of the Married

487
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,640
Are people from this field usually very luxurious?

488
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
Pardon?

489
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,640
Well, it's not a welcome party.

490
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
It's more like a money show.

491
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Why did you put on such a mental drama?

492
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,640
It's a bit bitter, but money and art are inseparable.

493
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
What a piece of art.

494
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,640
But there's a new model here today.

495
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
What?

496
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
What's going on?

497
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,640
Oh, darling, welcome.

498
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,640
What did you bring?

499
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Where have you been? You know I've missed you.

500
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,640
Have you heard about Director Ko's mother?

501
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,640
Indeed, I have.

502
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,640
I don't know whether to call it a relief.

503
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:05,640
But who's this handsome man?

504
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,640
Please say hello. This is Mr. Jin, Jin Hitonari from Japan.

505
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
He's the famous broncoster who held the party.

506
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Is this the famous Jin son?

507
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,640
How lovely to meet you. You know I've been wanting to meet you.

508
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,640
Who would have thought that the famous Jin Hitonari

509
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,640
would be this handsome young man?

510
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
Why have you been hiding your handsome face

511
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
this whole time, Jin son?

512
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,640
Jin son, what are you saying?

513
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,640
You're saying it's nice to meet you.

514
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Yes.

515
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
Silly me. Come along, Jin son.

516
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,640
I have so many people to introduce you to.

517
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

518
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
look who's here.

519
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,640
This is our mysterious collector, Jin Hitonari.

520
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,640
I've heard so much about you.

521
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
How about a coffee with Director Ko?

522
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
It's an honor to meet you.

523
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
It's my pleasure.

524
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,640
It's nice to meet you.

525
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,640
You're so sweet.

526
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,640
I'm going to give you a different line.

527
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
Do you have any free time tomorrow?

528
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,640
Do you have time tomorrow?

529
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
You're saying welcome.

530
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,640
It's such a pleasure.

531
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,640
So handsome.

532
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Okay, okay. That is quite enough, everyone.

533
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
You know it's not every day we get to invite

534
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,640
such a distinguished guest.

535
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
We must take this opportunity to hear

536
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,640
what he has to say about my collection.

537
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
Isn't that right, Jin son?

538
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,640
You want to hear about the works.

539
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
The works? Me?

540
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
All of a sudden?

541
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
Okay.

542
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
Feel free to say a few words

543
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
about the work you like.

544
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,640
You know, right?

545
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,640
You need to build up a sense of human intimacy

546
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,640
to make the contract easier.

547
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,640
I can't get used to this.

548
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
Okay.

549
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
Okay.

550
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640
All of the works here are big,

551
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,640
have a good color,

552
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
and are pretty.

553
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,640
Madame Brancour's bow is a fine collection

554
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,640
full of high-quality artworks

555
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,640
that are no less important than great collections

556
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
seen in galleries.

557
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
Really?

558
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
Among them...

559
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
The artworks are bold, imposing grand and majestic

560
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
with a dazzling fist of colors

561
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,640
capturing and exhibiting this sense of art.

562
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
Among them...

563
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,640
Which, in my opinion, clearly displayed

564
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,640
the sophisticated features of the collections owner.

565
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,640
Among them, my favorite work is...

566
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,640
When it comes to art, no work is greater than another.

567
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,640
However, the one that has caused a star in my heart is...

568
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,640
The picture of a pig.

569
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,640
What?

570
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
Me?

571
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Me?

572
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,640
Me?

573
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,640
Me?

574
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
Me?

575
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,640
Me?

576
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
Here.

577
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,640
White hair, long body,

578
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
saggy ears, and so on

579
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,640
are typical of the Land Race style,

580
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
but as you can see,

581
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,640
the back and legs are a bit fatter

582
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,640
than the Land Race style.

583
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,640
They are more likely to be the Dutch Land Race style.

584
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,640
The white bristles, long body, and the droopy ears

585
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,640
make you think that this was your typical Land Race print,

586
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,640
but if you look at the back and the thighs,

587
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,640
you'll see it's thicker than your common Land Race.

588
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,640
This means, I suspect,

589
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,640
it's a Dutch Land Race print.

590
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,640
There's something we shouldn't miss here.

591
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,640
A special aspect of this painting

592
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
that we should keep in mind

593
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
is the fact that the back of the pig

594
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
is a special aspect of this painting

595
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
that we must not miss.

596
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
This pig here

597
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
looks very helpless.

598
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
The other pigs are eating their food,

599
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
but he's lying down all alone.

600
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
And here,

601
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,640
there's a black spot around the anus

602
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,640
that's dirty and dirty.

603
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
That is,

604
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
anus...

605
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,640
Poop.

606
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
This...

607
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Poop.

608
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
Poop?

609
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,640
Proliferative enteritis.

610
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
When the experiment is in this thing like this,

611
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,640
it means it's in the brink of death.

612
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Die.

613
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,640
The owner must isolate this pig from the others

614
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,640
so it cannot infect the rest of them.

615
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,640
In that way,

616
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,640
the owner can minimize the damage.

617
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
That's all.

618
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,640
That's all.

619
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,640
I'm not very familiar with realism art,

620
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,640
but...

621
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,640
Is this a Malay painting?

622
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,640
It was painted by my grandmother.

623
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
As a hobby.

624
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,640
Oh my.

625
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Really?

626
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,640
Thank you.

627
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Thank you.

628
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
This...

629
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
This...

630
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
Oh my.

631
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
I'm sorry.

632
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
I shouldn't have ordered this.

633
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
No.

634
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
It's okay. I'll drink it.

635
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,640
I saw you drink a good wine.

636
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,240
Let's drink and go again.

637
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
I have to drive.

638
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,680
Drinking is the most expensive.

639
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
Okay.

640
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,520
Thank you, thank you. Bye.

641
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,080
Is this painting that good?

642
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,520
I'm not sure.

643
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,520
How much is this?

644
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,760
If it's real, it'll be at least $100,000.

645
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,840
Does that make sense?

646
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,340
How can this be worth $1,200,000?

647
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,240
No, it's not a source. It's a fee.

648
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,480
$1,200,000.

649
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,320
What?

650
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,480
$1,200,000?

651
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,880
If it's $1,200,000, I'll use it to pay off my debt.

652
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,320
I guess it's about $1,600.

653
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,120
$1,600?

654
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,560
What?

655
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,560
$1,600?

656
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
Dr. Jin!

657
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
Dr. Jin!

658
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,400
Are you okay, Dr. Jin?

659
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Are you okay?

660
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:32,640
The most exciting game on the line.

661
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,040
The mahjong is over.

662
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,640
The mahjong is over.

663
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,140
The queen of the prize pool.

664
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,840
The golden city of the treasure hunt.

665
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,840
The talented cat.

666
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,340
The gold captain.

667
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,840
The super high rate of compensation.

668
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
The reward frequency is high.

669
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,640
There are many opportunities to pay off your debt.

670
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,040
Hurry up and join.

671
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,040
The Macau New Beijing Entertainment Center.

672
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,200
My lovely honey.

673
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
Please let this be a dream.

674
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,040
$1,600?

675
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,540
The f*** world?

676
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,840
Do you know how much this costs?

677
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,080
You son of a b***h.

678
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,720
Just come here and do it!

679
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,520
Hey!

680
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,120
You're not getting my hands on you!

681
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,620
You're a bully!

682
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,720
Madam.

683
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,420
This painting is a fake.

684
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,420
What?

685
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,420
Nonsense. That can't be.

686
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,120
At first glance,

687
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,560
it looks like a painting by Modigliani.

688
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,960
But if you look closer, it appears to be...

689
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,860
No, it must be a forgery by Elmo Dehoi.

690
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,760
Absurd.

691
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,720
Do you have any idea how much I paid for this painting?

692
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,060
Did you purchase it illegally from a respectable dealer?

693
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,920
Of course I did. What do you take me for?

694
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,320
Why would I purchase it illegally?

695
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,960
I'm not buying it.

696
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,960
I'm just buying it.

697
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Then...

698
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,960
May I take a look at the back of the canvas?

699
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Like at the forgers,

700
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,960
Elmo always hid his signature on the back.

701
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,960
If this is an authentic Modigliani...

702
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,860
What are you doing?

703
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,260
You're not letting go?

704
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,560
Are you guys playing a game?

705
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,660
Hey.

706
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,460
Don't you know who I am?

707
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,460
You ruined my country's painting.

708
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,200
There's a lady here.

709
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,200
Darn it.

710
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,060
What?

711
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,260
You've ruined the reputation of Ma Dangdong.

712
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,260
If you were like us,

713
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,560
you could've just picked out your third or fourth...

714
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,160
Dali.

715
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,960
Dali, what do we do now?

716
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,160
Are we supposed to pay for everything?

717
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,060
We barely have any money left.

718
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,660
If you think about it,

719
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,160
it's not wrong to give away such an expensive painting

720
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,760
to a large number of people...

721
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,560
Dali.

722
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,360
It's not like you can get a cheap painting

723
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,160
even if you pay for it.

724
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,860
Hey.

725
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,760
Why are you so upset?

726
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,660
What does Dali have to do with this?

727
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,560
I was invited to the association today

728
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,260
and I lost my job.

729
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,660
Dali is just a client.

730
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:16,260
Dali has no reason to take responsibility for what happened.

731
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,060
Even if she takes responsibility, I lose.

732
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:18,560
So...

733
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,560
It's fake.

734
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,360
What?

735
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,860
The painting that you made is fake.

736
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,860
Then...

737
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,860
Wow!

738
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,460
Wow!

739
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,360
Mama mia colobia sara mia!

740
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,160
Wow!

741
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,560
You should've told me sooner.

742
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,160
You're making my heart race.

743
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,160
Come on.

744
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,060
But what's wrong with your face?

745
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,260
What's the problem?

746
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,160
I'm sure you don't mind,

747
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,060
but we lost our most powerful sponsor.

748
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,060
I'll tell you everything after the party.

749
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,160
I was going to tell you everything after the party,

750
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,160
but it suddenly got out of hand.

751
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,760
The wife of the Broncos

752
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,560
will never be able to stay still

753
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,360
because of the trade she received today.

754
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,260
Sponsor?

755
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,960
Do you get a scholarship from Yang Don?

756
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,660
Yang Don?

757
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,360
You're so stingy.

758
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,960
You're giving and taking away.

759
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,060
Don't worry.

760
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,260
I saved my life today,

761
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,960
so I'll support you with the scholarship

762
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,660
from Dondon F&B.

763
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,560
We do a lot of social work.

764
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,460
What do you mean by Dondon F&B?

765
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,260
What's Dondon F&B?

766
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,860
It's our company.

767
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,660
Dondon Gamjatang.

768
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,860
You must've heard of it.

769
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,660
You said Mr. Jin earlier.

770
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,260
I'm Mr. Jin since I'm a real-life student.

771
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,760
I heard you were invited to the association.

772
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,860
Yes, the Yang Don Association of the Netherlands.

773
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,160
Then you're Mr. Jin Hitonari...

774
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,660
I'm a real-life student.

775
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,760
Oh, no!

776
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,760
Oh, no!

777
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,660
Why won't you answer the phone?

778
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,260
Why didn't you check on me

779
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,060
and take me to that weird place?

780
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,960
If you had checked at the airport,

781
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,560
you wouldn't have had to do anything.

782
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
Who are you to take me to a party

783
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,760
when I'm not even a student?

784
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,860
If you ask me to take you to a party,

785
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,560
I won't let you take me anywhere.

786
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,960
I said I'm Mr. Jin!

787
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,260
I said I'm Jin!

788
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,960
I knew it. You said it was weird.

789
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,760
You said it was pig poop and pig's urine.

790
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,260
You're so clumsy.

791
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,060
Who said that?

792
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,560
You're a picture of a dead man.

793
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,560
You're a picture of a million or two million people.

794
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,860
How many bowls of Gamjatang do you think you have?

795
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,960
It's not a picture. It's an artwork.

796
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,260
How can you put the value of art

797
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,960
in the number of bowls of Gamjatang?

798
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,260
You're pooping!

799
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,260
What?

800
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,260
You said art was a fake.

801
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,560
You said it was fake!

802
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,360
Come on.

803
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,860
If you say it was a fake,

804
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,260
you almost gave the con man $1,600.

805
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,860
Anyway, just go across the water

806
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,060
and cross the $20 million contract.

807
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,960
I won't stand still.

808
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,060
Drive carefully.

809
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,460
I'm sorry.

810
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,660
I'm sorry.

811
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,960
I'm sorry.

812
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,260
I'm sorry.

813
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,260
I'm sorry.

814
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,760
Stupid idiot.

815
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,860
Stupid idiot.

816
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,560
Stupid idiot.

817
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,260
Stupid idiot.

818
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,260
Stupid idiot.

819
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,760
Stupid idiot.

820
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,260
I don't think you know how to curse.

821
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,660
Stop it and get up.

822
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,260
You're not even a kid.

823
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,860
You can't report missing.

824
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,360
You can't do anything.

825
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,260
What if something happens?

826
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,960
It's nothing. It's just a grown-up.

827
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,860
He must've waited to go to the hotel

828
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,860
or went to eat because he was hungry.

829
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,360
He'll call you.

830
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,360
You said he's a rich man.

831
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,660
He's a rich man.

832
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,960
He's a rich man.

833
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,460
He's a rich man.

834
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,160
You said he's a rich man.

835
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,860
Don't be so hard on him.

836
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,660
He's a man who spends a lot of money on a painting.

837
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,260
He can't make a single mistake?

838
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:01,960
That's not the attitude of a man who loves art.

839
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,460
What are you going to do now?

840
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,860
I'm sorry, but do you have another card?

841
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,660
Please give me a second.

842
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,660
Sure.

843
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,260
Mr. Jin.

844
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,860
I heard you can't get a credit card.

845
00:49:58,860 --> 00:49:59,860
What?

846
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,460
You can't get a credit card.

847
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,060
Oh, my.

848
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,860
What are you talking about?

849
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,860
I'm not going to get a credit card.

850
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,860
I'm not going to get a credit card.

851
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,660
I'm not going to get a credit card.

852
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,260
I'm not going to get a credit card.

853
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:17,460
What are you talking about? It's a black card.

854
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,960
Hey.

855
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,260
Black card. Black.

856
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,460
I'm sorry, but do you have another card, sir?

857
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,260
I mean, black card.

858
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,760
Do you have any other cards?

859
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,060
Oh, my.

860
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,660
That's really funny.

861
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,660
Here you go. Thank you.

862
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,060
Here's your black card.

863
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:58,260
What if I stop the credit card?

864
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,060
The real estate team will arrive tomorrow without any cash.

865
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,460
I know.

866
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,660
You should just leave me alone and go home.

867
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,260
Or else...

868
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,660
Chief Kim.

869
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,860
Chief Kim...

870
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,660
You little...

871
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,260
Is there a problem?

872
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,260
What?

873
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,660
What problem?

874
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:30,060
It's all solved, so you can go now.

875
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,260
You did a great job today.

876
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,860
Are you sure you're okay?

877
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,260
Of course.

878
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,660
Let's go.

879
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,660
Go.

880
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,060
You go first.

881
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,060
Okay.

882
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,460
Then...

883
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,860
Should I?

884
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,460
Good work today.

885
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,260
Let's go.

886
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,060
Good work today.

887
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,660
Good work today.

888
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,460
Oh, my.

889
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,260
Oh, my.

890
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:44,260
It's a bit far to walk to the airport from here.

891
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,660
I'm here to discuss the issue of the cafe.

892
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,760
I wanted to meet you,

893
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,060
but I'm sorry to bother you.

894
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:06,260
The cafe and the cafe are not the issue.

895
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,060
Please return the investment immediately.

896
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,660
What?

897
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,860
You know I lent you money, so you're in a mess.

898
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,660
You're wasting your money.

899
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:22,060
Why did you send me a useless credit card?

900
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,060
What do you mean?

901
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,060
Excuse me for a moment.

902
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,860
Where are you?

903
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,660
No.

904
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,460
Never, Father.

905
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,460
But I can't bury the truth.

906
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:08,260
If there's a problem, I'll get it out

907
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,460
and if there's something wrong, I'll kill you.

908
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,060
Hey.

909
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,060
I said it's okay.

910
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:43,860
You poor student who doesn't even have a liver.

911
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,060
This isn't it.

912
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,260
What is it?

913
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,060
My friend's wife went on a vacation, so it's a mess.

914
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,460
You live in a house.

915
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,460
I don't.

916
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,860
You can sleep here.

917
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,060
The bathroom is over there.

918
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,560
You can use the towel comfortably.

919
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,260
Do you need anything else?

920
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,460
It's okay.

921
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,660
But don't do this again.

922
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:13,460
Do you think I'm a stranger and you're being rude?

923
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,160
You don't even have a housekeeper.

924
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,760
Do you know how rough the world is?

925
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,660
You can't speak English and you don't have money.

926
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,460
You just leave someone who's stopped your credit card?

927
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,760
When you're being nice to someone,

928
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,360
just saying thank you is enough.

929
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,760
Who's being nice to you?

930
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,560
My father.

931
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,960
Your father is a great person.

932
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,560
Then...

933
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,560
Well...

934
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,960
Since you're full, let's have another one.

935
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,360
Aren't you hungry?

936
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,360
I ate something at the party earlier,

937
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,760
but you didn't eat anything all day.

938
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,760
Oh, right.

939
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,760
What?

940
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,160
What?

941
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,760
Is the owner the chef at the hotel?

942
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,160
Gosh.

943
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,760
Is there anything you can't eat or can't hide?

944
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,360
No.

945
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,160
You're not being chased by the owner, are you?

946
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,760
What?

947
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,360
Ms. Dal, the salt...

948
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,760
I'm worried about you.

949
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,360
Please leave a message once you hear it.

950
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,960
Gosh.

951
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,160
Ms. Dal.

952
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,180
Is Sinme back in Amsterdam?

953
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,460
Please wait a moment.

954
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,560
I hopeverbs 기상으로Excelsis smees de Zobell.

955
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,960
I'm Kim Nalli from the Saint Miller Museum.

956
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,800
I was supposed to meet you at the Skipper Airport

957
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,760
for the Jin Etonari Show this afternoon,

958
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,500
but I think I got lost because of an accident.

959
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,500
I couldn't reach you on the phone,

960
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,500
and you didn't come to the hotel where I was supposed to stay.

961
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,100
Could you contact me as a teacher?

962
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,800
Let's eat first.

963
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,640
You're saying we should eat and live

964
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,300
whatever we can to study and make money.

965
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,300
I'm sorry.

966
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,300
Whether you're a good guy or a bad guy,

967
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,200
a good guy or a bad guy,

968
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:22,840
you should be fair for three days a day.

969
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,600
You should eat well and don't miss a meal.

970
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,040
Here.

971
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,040
It's really good.

972
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,100
How can it taste like this?

973
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,440
Well...

974
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,440
You've been eating at the market since you were 11.

975
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,180
You should be humble.

976
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,480
You should've made a good living in my kitchen.

977
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,540
No, I'm doing a good job.

978
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,080
Are you studying at the art gallery?

979
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,540
Is that what you mean?

980
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,180
It's nice. You can look at paintings and make money.

981
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,740
Do you like paintings?

982
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,840
Well...

983
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,640
Of course.

984
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,840
Does anyone dislike paintings?

985
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:26,980
I hang a big and nice one in my living room

986
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,380
and look at it every morning and night.

987
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,580
What kind of work is it?

988
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:39,080
How can you live with just food?

989
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,180
You should live with the smell of money.

990
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,340
You're so pretty.

991
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,280
This is art. Art is nothing.

992
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,880
How many hours has it been?

993
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:01,280
I can't appreciate art.

994
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,180
I'm just being honest.

995
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,840
You probably don't know.

996
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:07,840
It's an oriental painting.

997
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,340
I majored in oriental art when I was in school.

998
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,240
Tell me what your work is.

999
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,740
Who painted it and how much it was.

1000
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:21,880
I think it's a great work if the viewer is happy.

1001
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,680
It's hard to go to your own standard

1002
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,880
without being influenced by the market or the market.

1003
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,080
You must really like that painting.

1004
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,580
Very much.

1005
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:36,080
If you're free after work,

1006
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,880
please visit our art gallery.

1007
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:41,480
It's small, but it has Go-eun, Sera, Sejeong, and Gogaeng.

1008
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,240
There are many works by Korean artists.

1009
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,440
Korean artists?

1010
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,880
My gosh.

1011
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,540
Not only Korean artists,

1012
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,180
but they're also very popular worldwide.

1013
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,180
Even if you're not busy,

1014
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,480
our cafeteria food is pretty good.

1015
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,880
If you're free, please come by. I'll take you there.

1016
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,740
An art gallery and a cafe...

1017
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,540
It's a date cafe.

1018
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,240
I'm sorry.

1019
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,740
I knew it from the beginning.

1020
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,040
You're really...

1021
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,640
I mean, you're a fun person.

1022
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,440
Me?

1023
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:33,440
You're good at counting the number of potatoes

1024
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,140
and counting the number of parties.

1025
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:38,840
Anyway, you're the funniest person I've ever met.

1026
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,840
Yes.

1027
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,240
Thank you.

1028
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,640
It's good, right?

1029
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,640
It's good.

1030
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,240
It's good.

1031
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,240
What?

1032
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,440
What is that?

1033
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,840
Ms. Kim?

1034
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,240
Ms. Kim?

1035
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:00,940
What is it?

1036
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,440
What's going on? Where are you?

1037
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,640
Ms. Kim?

1038
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,040
Ms. Kim?

1039
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,640
What is it?

1040
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,240
What's going on?

1041
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,740
Ms. Dal!

1042
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,740
Ms. Dal?

1043
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,840
Ms. Dal?

1044
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,440
Ms. Dal?

1045
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,840
Ms. Dal?

1046
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,040
Ms. Dal?

1047
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:15,940
Ms. Dal?

1050
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,400
That watch is really important to me.

1051
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,680
I'm going to sleep after this so you must wait for me.

1052
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,580
Even I'll drink?

1053
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,480
You, die!

1054
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,360
She wanted to divert all her assets

1055
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,460
that were borrowed from an art museum.

1056
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,240
Rip them apart!

1057
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,020
I'm here!

1058
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,060
Dang it!

1059
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,160
Did you want to find the watch?

1060
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,760
Did you want to find that woman?

1061
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,120
I can't do this.

1062
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,620
If I keep this up,

1063
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,260
I'll get hit in the head and hit again.

1064
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,000
Give me my money!

1065
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,360
Dr. Jin?
