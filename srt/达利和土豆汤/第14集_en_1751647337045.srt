1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,720
Luckily, thing just stayed the same.

2
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,100
Dr. Jin.

3
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:05,100
How did you get here?

4
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:18,460
Mr. Shin.

5
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,980
What's going on?

6
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,660
Why are you doing this?

7
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,820
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:34,820
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

9
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,100
Don't go anywhere.

10
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,420
Stay with me.

11
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,500
Mr. Shin.

12
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:57,580
I love you.

13
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:07,100
I love you.

14
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,020
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:21,100
I can't be with you anymore.

16
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:32,780
Between the rich and the poor.

17
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:40,940
I want to love you with dignity in a fair relationship.

18
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:50,940
I love you.

19
00:02:50,940 --> 00:03:00,940
I love you.

20
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,940
Thank you.

21
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,580
I'll be ready to exhibit so that I don't become a name for the writer.

22
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,140
I'm giving it to you because I'm scared of him.

23
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,820
It's not a dangerous road, but it's not going to be a big deal.

24
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,420
What if you get injured at the exhibition?

25
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,540
When did I...

26
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,140
But you two...

27
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,860
No, I'm the bad guy.

28
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:48,940
It's late, but let's call it slowly.

29
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:18,860
Come closer to me.

30
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:24,860
Love stays by my side.

31
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,860
With your clear smile.

32
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,860
It made me laugh.

33
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,860
It's my first time.

34
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:48,860
Even if we share beautiful stories like poems.

35
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,860
Your scent spreads gently.

36
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,860
All the world is pink.

37
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,860
It's my first time.

38
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,860
It's my first time.

39
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,860
It's my first time.

40
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,860
It's my first time.

41
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,860
It's beautiful.

42
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,860
It's going deeper.

43
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,860
It's weird.

44
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,860
Our meeting.

45
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:52,860
How did you fall in love at first sight?

46
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,860
It's not easy to say.

47
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,860
It's fate.

48
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:16,860
I'll give you this love.

49
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:30,860
I want to keep listening to your shy voice like music.

50
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,860
Do you know how I feel?

51
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:44,860
I'll come to you every day like it's the last day of the day.

52
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,860
It's weird.

53
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,860
Our meeting.

54
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:58,860
How did you fall in love at first sight?

55
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,860
It's not easy to explain.

56
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,860
It's fate.

57
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:16,860
I'll give you this love.

58
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:24,860
You're the only one I have in my heart.

59
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:32,860
I don't want you anymore.

60
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:40,860
Your eyes that look at me.

61
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,860
I can see everything about me.

62
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:56,860
I think I'll suffocate if I touch your lips.

63
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:06,860
I'll give you this love.

64
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:36,860
I'll give you this love.

65
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:06,860
I'll give you this love.

66
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:16,860
I'll give you this love.

67
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:26,860
I'll give you this love.

68
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:36,860
I'll give you this love.

69
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:46,860
I'll give you this love.

70
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:56,860
I'll give you this love.

71
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:04,860
Don't take it so hard.

72
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:12,860
Like a strawberry scent, they go away.

73
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:20,860
Don't need to be so hard.

74
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:28,860
Like a strawberry scent, they go away.

75
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:38,860
Don't need to try to turn back his mind.

76
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,860
Time will be on your side.

77
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:52,860
One day it'll be.

78
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,860
Time will be on your side.

79
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,860
You'll be to come and rise yourself.

80
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:14,860
One day it'll be.

81
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:44,860
Did you wake up because of me?

82
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:52,860
Get ready and come out.

83
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:02,860
I love you, love you, love you.

84
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:12,860
I think of you.

85
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:22,860
I think of you.

86
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,860
You've met my dad?

87
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,860
Then why don't you lend me money without looking at my face?

88
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:48,860
I'm going.

89
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,860
What's this?

90
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,860
A small shop.

91
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,860
That's why there's no customers at the museum.

92
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,860
It's not a place for an art museum to sell.

93
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:18,860
What's the big deal?

94
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,860
If you give me what I need, I'll pay you that much.

95
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,860
Then that's business.

96
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,860
You don't seem to like the painting.

97
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,860
I don't know about the painting.

98
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,860
People don't go to restaurants just to eat.

99
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,860
What?

100
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,860
They eat atmosphere, bluff, and show off.

101
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,860
Isn't that the era of proof?

102
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,860
SNS.

103
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,860
You don't know because it's a movie.

104
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,860
Anyway, it's a real experience to show off to others.

105
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,860
I can only do business with a good environment to show off and bluff.

106
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,860
But who are you?

107
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,860
Oh, you're the one who works here.

108
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:24,860
I'm Kim Nak-cheol, the art museum director who's not good at business.

109
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,860
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

110
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:38,860
I'm Jin Mo-hak from Dondong Gamjatang.

111
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:48,860
Let's eat.

112
00:14:48,860 --> 00:15:00,860
I'm sorry to have to go to you because I'm sorry.

113
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:06,860
You said you weren't a real connoisseur if you weren't invited to a party at Cheongsong.

114
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,860
Is that true?

115
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,860
That's what the connoisseurs made.

116
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Are you interested in that?

117
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,860
I'm just saying just in case. I refuse.

118
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,860
What?

119
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,860
So don't send me an invitation.

120
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,860
Don't ask me to sponsor a potato soup at the end of the year party.

121
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,860
Sponsor potato soup?

122
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,860
I don't think there's a free one in the world.

123
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,860
I'm sorry.

124
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,860
I heard that it's important to have connections or connections to run a business, but I didn't even come to the store with that.

125
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,860
I don't think I'll ever do that again.

126
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:57,860
And I don't know if there's a real connoisseur in Korea.

127
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,860
I'll borrow money from you because you asked me to do it.

128
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,860
You don't need anything else, and you just have to pay the bank interest accurately.

129
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,860
You can't be pushed back by the bank while saying,

130
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:17,860
What kind of convenience do you want me to see in the business and who do you want to introduce?

131
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,860
This is the contract condition. Would you be okay with that?

132
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,860
When can we have a meal together?

133
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,860
Can't you do that?

134
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,860
I want to hear more about the business you were talking about a while ago.

135
00:16:36,860 --> 00:17:03,560
I was thinking about it because I couldn't find the truth even though I was saying that I would lower the art hall's

136
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,260
Then I'll go in.

137
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:14,260
Oh, Director Jin, do you have a girlfriend?

138
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:22,260
There's a nice lady, and I thought she'd look good with Director Jin.

139
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,260
It's not because she's my daughter, but she's a really nice girl.

140
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,960
But he only knows how to study, so I wanted to make him meet a bright person like Director Jin.

141
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,660
Oh, yes.

142
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,660
Excuse me.

143
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:05,660
Of course, she looks like me and she's very pretty.

144
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,660
Is that a big brother?

145
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,660
I value my personality more than my face.

146
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,660
You don't have to mention your personality.

147
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,660
Anyway, there's a picture.

148
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,660
I'm a man with pride.

149
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,660
What?

150
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:31,660
Actually, I'm a man with pride.

151
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,660
I'm a man who seeks a natural meeting.

152
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,660
I'm sorry, but I refuse to meet you on purpose.

153
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,660
Oh, really?

154
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,660
Yes.

155
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,660
Then...

156
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,660
I can't do it.

157
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
No way.

158
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,660
My dad really did that?

159
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,660
Why would you lie?

160
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,660
Why would I lie?

161
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
I can't live because of my dad.

162
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,660
But why?

163
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,660
What's wrong with my dad?

164
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,660
What?

165
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
He was so handsome when he was young.

166
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
He had big eyes.

167
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,660
Who says that?

168
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
It's not my style.

169
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,660
You know that my style is different.

170
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,660
But I guess you really liked my dad.

171
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,660
You know that baby over there?

172
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,660
He put soybean paste in it.

173
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,660
You, Gang-dan!

174
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,660
What?

175
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,660
Oh, no.

176
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,660
I meant soybean paste.

177
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,660
It smells a lot.

178
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,660
That's a work by Kim Chang-ki from Hyeon-bok.

179
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,660
It's a work that my dad gives only to his favorite people.

180
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,660
My dad really likes it.

181
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,660
It's a work called Doja-gi.

182
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,660
My dad gave it to me, right?

183
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,660
Yes.

184
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,660
I'm a bit of a pushover to old people

185
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,660
because I'm a free pass for the day of the meeting.

186
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,660
Of course, I'm a bit of a pushover

187
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,660
to young women.

188
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,660
Eat up.

189
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,660
You too, Mr. Jin.

190
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,660
How long are you going to keep calling me Mr. Jin?

191
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,660
Why am I your teacher?

192
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,660
What did you teach me?

193
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,660
Then why don't you call me Mr. Jin?

194
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,660
Honey, darling, brother, you, honey.

195
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,660
There are so many nicknames in the world

196
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,660
that are so annoying and annoying.

197
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,660
Why do you have to be so romantic?

198
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,660
What teacher?

199
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
Then what do you like?

200
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,660
I just...

201
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,660
Tell me what you want.

202
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,660
I'll call you whatever you want.

203
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,660
Well...

204
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,660
Honey... Wow.

205
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,660
If you like me,

206
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,660
I'll call you too.

207
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,660
You like yourself too?

208
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Honey?

209
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,660
What are you doing?

210
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,660
It's all over.

211
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,660
They're being chased by the police.

212
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,660
Send them abroad.

213
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,660
But they're not allowed to leave.

214
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,660
I told you!

215
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,660
You can call them out or ask them to leave.

216
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,660
Why should I?

217
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,660
You don't know?

218
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,660
You're not going to tell me?

219
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,660
I'm going to tell you.

220
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,660
I'm going to tell you.

221
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,660
You don't know?

222
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,660
You're the only one I don't have.

223
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,660
If I open my mouth...

224
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,660
You know.

225
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,660
I don't know what you're talking about.

226
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,660
Do you think I'm seeing something?

227
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,660
Should I tell the world what happened that night?

228
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,660
Tell me what kind of person Jang Taejin is.

229
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,660
Should I go to the police right now?

230
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,660
Me.

231
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,660
What?

232
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,660
Do you want me to tell you?

233
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,660
I could report you here.

234
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,660
You punk!

235
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,660
Take this opportunity to commit suicide.

236
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,660
I'm going to finish the case because I'm bored.

237
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,660
You might end up having a bad dream.

238
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,660
What? A bad dream?

239
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,660
You have no witness or evidence.

240
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,660
But if you keep saying you saw something...

241
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,660
People will think that it was a delusion.

242
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,660
It could be a big deal.

243
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,660
But it shouldn't be a drug.

244
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,660
I'll compensate you enough for the treatment.

245
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,660
Whether it's a clean-up art gallery or a re-development work.

246
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,660
Director?

247
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,660
Director, are you there?

248
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,660
Yes.

249
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,660
Hey.

250
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,660
You have a relationship with Dahee.

251
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,660
You think I won't be able to see you?

252
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,660
Don't talk nonsense.

253
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,660
You should think of a way to save me.

254
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,660
I'm not going to go to the hospital or prison.

255
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,660
A delusion?

256
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,660
Someone will hear the delusion of a drug addict.

257
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,660
Let's see how long you can last.

258
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,660
Director, are you okay?

259
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,660
No.

260
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,660
It's a report.

261
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,660
It's nothing serious. Don't worry.

262
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,660
See you at work.

263
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,660
I'm sorry.

264
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,660
I took care of the CCTV and black box.

265
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,660
Of course.

266
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,660
You can't miss anything.

267
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,660
Don't worry.

268
00:24:49,660 --> 00:25:09,040
Even if you missed the

269
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:24,660
I have to turn people's eyes away.

270
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,660
There will be a deal between Dondon and Anseong.

271
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,660
Call a suitable group and file a complaint.

272
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,660
It's better to be noisy whether it's illegal political action or private door.

273
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,660
All right.

274
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,660
It's the age-old world.

275
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,660
What can I help you with?

276
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,660
My number.

277
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,660
Would you like to say it again?

278
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,660
It's not a joke. It's really important.

279
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
Please connect it.

280
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,660
If you don't connect it, you'll be in trouble later.

281
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,660
I'm busy.

282
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,660
Could you wait a minute?

283
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,660
How many hours are you telling me to wait?

284
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,660
Who's waiting for you?

285
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,660
It's nothing.

286
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,660
Are you going to work?

287
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,660
Did you make an appointment?

288
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,660
Pardon?

289
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,660
Yes, of course.

290
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,660
Tell me clearly.

291
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Our Dondon.

292
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,660
I'm going to go to the South Seodong Green Belt Development company.

293
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,660
I'll get the contract, I'll take the map, and I'll give you the proof.

294
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,660
You know that, right?

295
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,660
Of course.

296
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,660
Don't worry.

297
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,660
I'm going with you.

298
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,660
No, father.

299
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,660
Let me do it.

300
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,660
I'm Jin Ki-cheol.

301
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,660
Father's daughter, Jin Ki-cheol.

302
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,660
You go to work first.

303
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,660
Ki-cheol has something to see me.

304
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,660
Me? What?

305
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
Why?

306
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,660
Last time...

307
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,660
What last time?

308
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,660
Why?

309
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,660
Oh, that thing.

310
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,660
What's wrong with you?

311
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,660
What are you talking about?

312
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,660
I'm trying to go with Ki-cheol because I'm not going to the North Seodong Green Belt Development company.

313
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,660
You're getting more and more indifferent.

314
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,660
Go, go, go.

315
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,660
Go.

316
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,660
Go, go, go.

317
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,660
Why are you talking about that now?

318
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,660
I was afraid you'd go crazy if I knew.

319
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,660
We might really be kicked out this time.

320
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,660
My inspiration is very poisonous.

321
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,660
I just saw it.

322
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,660
No, it's not my mother-in-law in the drama.

323
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,660
Why did you grab the head and really...

324
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,660
Wasn't that girl doing well with the martial arts?

325
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,660
Why are you getting married to Jang Tae-jin?

326
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,660
I guess it was Yang Dal.

327
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,660
What if Jang Tae-jin doesn't stay still?

328
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,660
If he's a bird, he'll be really strong.

329
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,660
Should I just go and tell him I'm sorry?

330
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,660
Oh, that...

331
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,660
Don't worry.

332
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,660
Jang Tae-jin can't do anything to us.

333
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,660
How do you know that?

334
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,660
I'll make it happen.

335
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,660
But weren't you supposed to meet Jang Tae-jin?

336
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,660
Why did you come to Ahn Sang-tae's house?

337
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,660
We should know his phone number first.

338
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,660
Just stay still.

339
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,660
Hey, so you didn't even know his number

340
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,660
and you were going to save Jang Tae-jin?

341
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,660
I have my own car.

342
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,660
What do you have?

343
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,660
Oh, my. Hurry up.

344
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,660
Oh, my.

345
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,660
Wait, wait.

346
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,660
What are you doing?

347
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,660
You are...

348
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,660
I'm Ju Won-tak from Seongdong Police Station.

349
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:44,660
I have a question about the Cheongsong Art Museum drug case.

350
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,660
Please help me out.

351
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,660
Cheongsong?

352
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,660
What?

353
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,660
You know, I have an important meeting.

354
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,660
Ahn Sang-tae?

355
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,660
I should've sent you the official document

356
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,660
to get the cooperation from the congressman.

357
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,660
Just tell him that he's different

358
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,660
from his usual self

359
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,660
when Director Kim Nak-chun comes in.

360
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,660
It won't be hard.

361
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,660
Hey,

362
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,660
why don't you move on?

363
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,660
Seongdong Police Station, Ju Won-tak.

364
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,660
Who's the head of the department?

365
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,660
Who's the head of the department?

366
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,660
Hey, Detective Ju Won-tak.

367
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,660
Do you think I'm that easy?

368
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,660
Do you think I'm the next person

369
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,660
who gets pushed back?

370
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,660
How dare you come to Korea

371
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,660
without knowing how scary the people are?

372
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,660
Hey, Director Kim.

373
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,660
Yes, it's me, Ahn Sang-tae.

374
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,660
Do you know Ju Won-tak from Seongdong Police Station?

375
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,660
I think he's from the police department.

376
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,660
Hey, was the head of the department Kim?

377
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,660
Let's get going.

378
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,660
Yes, sir.

379
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,660
Where did you run off to with that guy?

380
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,660
Or did you already get caught?

381
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,660
When did you record

382
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,660
these things?

383
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,660
I'll wait for a wise decision.

384
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,660
Oh, right.

385
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,660
I heard you recorded

386
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,660
a lot of things.

387
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,660
I hope you're not upset.

388
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,660
Okay.

389
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,660
Bye.

390
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,660
Hwang Gyu-ho, it's me.

391
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,660
Isn't this a mess?

392
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,660
Those who live without

393
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,660
will get what they get

394
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,660
if I throw them away.

395
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,660
What kind of conscience

396
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,660
do you have to feed your conscience?

397
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,660
What's wrong?

398
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,660
What about the recording?

399
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660
Nothing.

400
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,660
You don't have to worry about it.

401
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,660
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

402
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,660
Please try again later.

403
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,660
Jang Tae-jin, you punk.

404
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,660
Are you already

405
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,660
trying to get rid of me?

406
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,660
What's wrong?

407
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,660
Did you break up?

408
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,660
I don't know.

409
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,660
It's clean.

410
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,660
It's very clean.

411
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,660
You have to work hard.

412
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,660
I'm sorry.

413
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,660
I'm sorry.

414
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,660
I'm sorry.

415
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,660
You have to work hard.

416
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Oh, right.

417
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,660
The cloud omelet that Pilgu

418
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,660
developed this time.

419
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,660
It's the official menu, right?

420
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,660
Yes.

421
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,660
Please give them a bonus

422
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,660
when they're like this.

423
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
It's pretty.

424
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,660
They're working hard.

425
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,660
Excuse me.

426
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,660
Didn't you clean up?

427
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,660
Clean up?

428
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,660
What kind of cleaning?

429
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,660
Director Jeongseon said

430
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,660
she was going to clean up.

431
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,660
Did you meet her

432
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,660
when you were going to the interview?

433
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
What did I say?

434
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,660
What's there to clean up?

435
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,660
How can you clean up

436
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,660
a person's mind just by cleaning up money?

437
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,660
I'm a?

438
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,660
I'm a civil servant.

439
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,660
You know that, right?

440
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,660
If you fall for me,

441
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,660
you can't get out of it.

442
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,660
A man of the devil.

443
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,660
What should we do?

444
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,660
Honey.

445
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,660
You're not weird, are you?

446
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,660
When can I get out of this

447
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,660
when I can't even

448
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,660
get a single grain of porridge?

449
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,660
A man of the devil.

450
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,660
Hello?

451
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,660
I think it's worth it to hold the exhibition

452
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,660
with a positive response

453
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,660
from both writer Du Jiyeon

454
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,660
and writer Park Hae and writer Yoo Yongsun.

455
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
That's a relief.

456
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,660
The police investigation will be announced soon,

457
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,660
so the other writers will also give us their answers.

458
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,660
I'll keep in touch.

459
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,660
What's going on with the big project?

460
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
Mr. Han Kyu?

461
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,660
As Director Jin told me,

462
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,660
the wedding, concert, photo studio,

463
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,660
and the direction of the project

464
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,660
are all set.

465
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,660
Director Jin suddenly left,

466
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,660
so I don't know what to do first.

467
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,660
I'm short of people.

468
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,660
Just take it.

469
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,660
I think it's urgent to keep coming.

470
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,660
Okay.

471
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,660
Take a break.

472
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,660
Then I'm sorry.

473
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,660
It's like Director Jin, right?

474
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,660
I looked up the information, but it didn't work.

475
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,660
I'm so tired of working.

476
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,660
Director Jin is an expert in business.

477
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,660
Our museum cafe is just like Director Jin,

478
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,660
but the number of people is increasing.

479
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,660
I think it's still green light.

480
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,660
What are you doing?

481
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,660
Don't you miss me?

482
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,660
I miss you.

483
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,660
Why aren't you answering?

484
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,660
Did something happen?

485
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,660
Say something.

486
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,660
Send me a picture of you.

487
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,660
I'm serious?

488
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,660
You didn't get kidnapped, did you?

489
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,660
Honey!

490
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,660
Honey, what's going on?

491
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,660
Why aren't you answering?

492
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,660
I called you an hour ago. What's going on?

493
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,660
Why are you being so nosy?

494
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,660
I miss you.

495
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,660
I can't help but think of you when I work

496
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,660
and when I eat.

497
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,660
I might get sick.

498
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,660
What should I do?

499
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,660
Will you like me?

500
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,660
Honey!

501
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,660
Let's get a divorce, Siyoung.

502
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,660
You can't run away like this.

503
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,660
Let's get a divorce and start over.

504
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,660
Why are you being so rude?

505
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,660
You didn't consider me as a person

506
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,660
even if I was your son.

507
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,660
So I wasn't even a person until today.

508
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,660
Did I do something wrong?

509
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,660
If I did something wrong,

510
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,660
I apologize.

511
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,660
It's too late.

512
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,660
Leave me and father.

513
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,660
Grandpa.

514
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,660
When did you come in?

515
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,660
A week ago.

516
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,660
Then why didn't you come here

517
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,660
and just stay there?

518
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,660
You're like a homeless guy.

519
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,660
Did you eat?

520
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,660
What should I do now, grandpa?

521
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,660
I'm just curious.

522
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,660
I got fired from school

523
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,660
and I can't even get a job.

524
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,660
I'm just curious.

525
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,660
I'm just curious.

526
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,660
I'm just curious.

527
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,660
I'm just curious.

528
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,660
I'm just curious.

529
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,660
I'm just curious.

530
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,660
I'm just curious.

531
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,660
I'm just curious.

532
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,660
I'm just curious.

533
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,660
I'm just curious.

534
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,660
I'm just curious.

535
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,660
I'm just curious.

536
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,660
It's okay.

537
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,660
Everyone can do something wrong.

538
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,660
You just don't have to do it again.

539
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,660
Father...

540
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,660
He said he didn't want to see your face

541
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,660
because you ruined the name of Cheongsong.

542
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,660
He said you're not my son anymore.

543
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,660
No matter how important the honor of Cheongsong is,

544
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,660
it's not more important than you.

545
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,660
You just have to start over.

546
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,660
Jiyeok...

547
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,660
There's no painting that can be completed

548
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,660
with just one brush stroke.

549
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,660
You have to paint dozens, hundreds,

550
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,660
no, thousands of times

551
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,660
to make one painting.

552
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,660
Life is the same.

553
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,660
Father...

554
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,660
You crossed the river that you can't return to?

555
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,660
You can't even imagine what I did.

556
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,660
I helped you.

557
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,660
No matter what you do, you're my son.

558
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,660
If you die, will you be able to do this?

559
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
He died because of me.

560
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,660
What?

561
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,660
I'm the one who killed him.

562
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,660
I...

563
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,660
You punk.

564
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,660
What are you talking about?

565
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,660
Father took good care of you.

566
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,660
I'm not a human being.

567
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,660
So...

568
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,660
You can't have a son anymore.

569
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,660
You should go.

570
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,660
Let's go.

571
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,660
Let's go.

572
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,660
Let's go.

573
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,660
Let's go.

574
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,660
Let's go.

575
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,660
Go away.

576
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,660
Get out.

577
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,660
Get out.

578
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,660
Let go.

579
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,660
Let go.

580
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,660
Let go.

581
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,660
Let go.

582
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,660
Let go, you punk.

583
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,660
Let go.

584
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,660
I love you.

585
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,660
Let go.

586
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,660
You punk.

587
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,660
You can't even do this.

588
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,660
I can't.

589
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,660
I can't.

590
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,660
Let go.

591
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,660
Honey.

592
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,660
Honey.

593
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,660
Honey.

594
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,660
Honey.

595
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,660
Honey.

596
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,660
Honey.

597
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,660
Honey.

598
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,660
Honey.

599
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,660
What did you just say?

600
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,660
What? Honey?

601
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,660
Well...

602
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,660
Well...

603
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,660
Who is your honey?

604
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,660
I'm your honey.

605
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,660
Who is your honey?

606
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,660
Well...

607
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,660
I'm your honey? Who is your honey?

608
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,660
You punk.

609
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,660
Did you eat your own ear?

610
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,660
When did I say I'm your honey?

611
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,660
I said over there.

612
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,660
If you don't like your ears, go to the ear doctor.

613
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,660
Don't be so mean.

614
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,660
Why would I go to the ear doctor

615
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,660
when I don't like my ears?

616
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,660
You haven't eaten yet, right?

617
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,660
You punk.

618
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,660
Why did you buy so much?

619
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,660
You're a big shot.

620
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,660
I didn't know what you liked.

621
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,660
What's so big about pizza?

622
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,660
You're rich.

623
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,660
I eat like this.

624
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,660
You're good.

625
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,660
Why did you buy so much?

626
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,660
One is...

627
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,660
Did you buy it

628
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,660
to give it to Dr. Jin?

629
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,660
Me?

630
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,660
Why would I do that?

631
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,660
I don't have enough food.

632
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,660
I bought it to eat it all.

633
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,660
I'm going to eat it all.

634
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,660
You're so good at eating.

635
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,660
You're active and exercise often.

636
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,660
You don't gain weight no matter how much you eat.

637
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,660
Just eat it.

638
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,660
Why would I have four chickens?

639
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,660
I eat five chickens as a basic meal.

640
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,660
I also eat three packs of instant noodles.

641
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,660
Three packs of instant noodles?

642
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,660
I eat three packs of instant noodles and two packs of gimbap.

643
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,660
I work in a food business.

644
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,660
How much do I eat when developing food?

645
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,660
Your food is so different

646
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,660
from what the average person eats.

647
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,660
I'm a police officer.

648
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,960
You're different from humans.

649
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,360
What are you talking about?

650
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,860
When we were in hiding,

651
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,860
we had to drink five bowls of jjajangmyeon,

652
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,500
three pieces of chicken, five hamburgers,

653
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,900
one shot of coke, and that's all we had.

654
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,440
Okay, okay.

655
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,100
You're the winner. You're the winner.

656
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,200
Is that enough?

657
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,440
You can't eat all that.

658
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,740
Darn it.

659
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,240
I'm so fed up.

660
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,320
Why does he keep coming to my house?

661
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,120
Doesn't he go to your house?

662
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,520
You have a house.

663
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,780
Why does he keep coming to my house?

664
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,320
Well...

665
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,260
What do you mean, that?

666
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,360
You're the owner of the house,

667
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,360
but you're my house while you're on a rent.

668
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,820
If you're in trouble, go home.

669
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,160
You're so shameless.

670
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,260
Let's eat.

671
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,360
Let's eat!

672
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,540
I'll buy you a meal, so go home and eat alone.

673
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,040
How can I eat alone?

674
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,340
Push him away.

675
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,700
Push him away.

676
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,080
Are you a beggar?

677
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,180
Let go!

678
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,500
Let go!

679
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,680
Let go!

680
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,000
Let go!

681
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Get out.

682
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,040
Let's go out!

683
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,240
What?

684
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,620
I'm going out with...

685
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,780
Jin Mo-hak.

686
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,480
Okay.

687
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,320
Hey, you...

688
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,900
Kim Dal-ri, are you crazy?

689
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,600
I was going to tell the art museum and father

690
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,620
but I thought I should tell you first.

691
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,020
But...

692
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,260
Isn't the poem the problem?

693
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,200
What?

694
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,560
Are you really going to be okay?

695
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,600
What?

696
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,400
Are you going to talk to me?

697
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,940
We get along very well.

698
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,280
The capital of India is India.

699
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,940
The people who built the Joseon Dynasty,

700
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,020
Lee Yong-gyu, Cheong-go, and Man-go.

701
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,720
They say the word that doesn't have a sound hurts.

702
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,980
If you use English for the word,

703
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:38,940
you pass.

704
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,080
You pass with English.

705
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,320
This is how you talk?

706
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,880
This is how?

707
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,520
You're good at everything but you don't have sense of humor.

708
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,020
You're so...

709
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,320
You're just making fun of me.

710
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,860
I don't have sense of humor.

711
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,400
I don't have sense of humor.

712
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,160
That's what you're saying?

713
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,060
It hurts.

714
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,620
You're so cute.

715
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,020
Isn't this the cutest?

716
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,020
Isn't it cute?

717
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,820
Isn't it cute?

718
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,560
Isn't it cute?

719
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,100
Hey.

720
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,040
If only he could do that to us.

721
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,380
Won-tak, what's wrong?

722
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,060
What?

723
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,660
Let's do that.

724
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,540
Wow, it's so nice.

725
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,540
It's so nice.

726
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,940
It's nice, right?

727
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,020
It feels nice, right?

728
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,020
Yes.

729
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,160
It feels nice.

730
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,060
You might be laughing now,

731
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,560
but you're the beginning of happiness and hell.

732
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,640
If you make Dal-ri upset,

733
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,240
you'll die.

734
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,380
If you make Dal-ri worry, you'll die.

735
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,340
If you make Dal-ri cry, you'll...

736
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,040
You'll really die.

737
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,640
I'm going to die.

738
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,240
Do it right. If you don't want to die,

739
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,680
you can just...

740
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,920
Gosh, that's so annoying.

741
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,620
How many times are you going to kill me?

742
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,460
I'm a cop.

743
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,260
Don't worry.

744
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,660
That won't happen.

745
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,380
What?

746
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,980
Si-young?

747
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,740
He's totally different from last time.

748
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,020
All the lawyers are already hired,

749
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,980
but he's refusing to meet his father.

750
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,960
Even if he's trying to prove it, he won't do it.

751
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,660
He keeps asking for Jang Tae-jin.

752
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,760
Tae-jin?

753
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,960
Yes.

754
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,400
Were you two close?

755
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,100
We're both the same age, we're close in the same neighborhood,

756
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,200
and we went to the same school,

757
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,740
but we weren't close,

758
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,600
but we were in completely different fields.

759
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,540
Really?

760
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,480
So what did Tae-jin say?

761
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,980
Can a person like us contact

762
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,080
a world-class group of people?

763
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,780
I put the report in the library to get a reference.

764
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,860
I'll have to wait.

765
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,540
In a way,

766
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:05,360
when a person gets caught,

767
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,400
it's normal to bring out the strongest of them.

768
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,700
I don't know.

769
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,860
What if I get the wrong feeling?

770
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,860
What?

771
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,160
If it's about organizing,

772
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,860
it means someone is giving orders.

773
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,260
Senator An Sangtae

774
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,060
is just a nobody.

775
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,960
The one who gets the biggest profit from this project

776
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,360
is someone who has the power

777
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,460
to influence the public, the system,

778
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,060
the media, and the law.

779
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,160
But he's someone who's so smart

780
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,560
that he can't show himself.

781
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,560
Dali.

782
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,260
Please save our Cheongseong.

783
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,060
You're the only one.

784
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,360
Taejin and...

785
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,060
We can't start over.

786
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,160
I won't let you get away with it

787
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,260
even if you have to pay for it.

788
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,260
The director will tell you the truth.

789
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,460
So...

790
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,860
You should never give up.

791
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,560
You know that, right?

792
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,860
I'll always be behind you.

793
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,160
My goodness.

794
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,360
An Chaki from Mond from the gallery is here.

795
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:17,060
Our CEO wants to hold a Basquiat exhibition

796
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:19,560
for the new art gallery.

797
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,160
What do you think, Chaki?

798
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,060
What?

799
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,860
You must've seen the proposal.

800
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,560
Do you think this Basquiat exhibition

801
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,560
will suit the new art gallery?

802
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,760
I don't know why the money

803
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,160
is coming out of nowhere

804
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,960
when it's something that's just a waste of money.

805
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,360
Don't worry about the money.

806
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,360
Our CEO is rich.

807
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,160
The money is money,

808
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,460
but my father worked hard for this exhibition.

809
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,760
He went to find the right owner.

810
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,160
I don't know about the money.

811
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,060
I'm not going to hand it over.

812
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,060
You won't understand.

813
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,160
I'm so pretty, but I'm dumped by a useless guy.

814
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,460
I saw the paintings on the world group.

815
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,960
I heard you selected them all.

816
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,260
Why do you think you're a fallout

817
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,560
when you have such a good sense of pride?

818
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,860
Don't fallout people usually hide that fact?

819
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,460
If you're just trying to get away from

820
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,260
the possibility of being a father,

821
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,060
then you shouldn't have done that.

822
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,960
What do you know about me?

823
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,660
You're not that good.

824
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,660
We'll slowly get to know each other.

825
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,760
We have to meet a few more times

826
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,660
before the contract is signed.

827
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,260
Hello?

828
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,560
Hello?

829
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,560
Yes?

830
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,260
Director, we're in trouble.

831
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,860
What?

832
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,060
What's going on?

833
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,460
Come on in.

834
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,060
Darn it!

835
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,660
What are you doing?

836
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,560
What are you doing?

837
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,560
Let go of me!

838
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,160
I'm going to kill you!

839
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,660
I'm going to kill you!

840
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,160
The district office of the NIS

841
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,460
and the head office of Dondon FMB

842
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:24,160
have been searched for.

843
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,760
The NIS has been accused of

844
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,160
using illegal money from Dondon FMB

845
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,460
for the remodeling of the green belt

846
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,560
and the reconstruction of NIS.

847
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,560
Dondon FMB has been receiving donations

848
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,760
through the split fund.

849
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,960
They're in the remodeling business.

850
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,660
It was nice to meet you.

851
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,860
Let's talk while we eat something delicious.

852
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,260
Sure.

853
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,160
Are you really going to marry Director Jang Taejin?

854
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,360
What?

855
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,560
You must've heard about

856
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,460
the rumor that he bought the ring.

857
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,360
Well...

858
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,160
You should reconsider.

859
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,760
You're the one who thinks of him...

860
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,060
Director!

861
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,660
Director!

862
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,160
I'm in trouble!

863
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,360
This is definitely Jang Taejin's doing.

864
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,560
I don't know what it is,

865
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,360
but my dad and Jang Taejin were planning something.

866
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,460
I don't know if it's a misunderstanding,

867
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,660
but the police came to my house.

868
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,260
The phone call between Jang Taejin

869
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,960
that was always connected suddenly went off.

870
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,160
We completed the process as you requested.

871
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,260
Even if it's for your political life,

872
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,760
you can never tell others.

873
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:29,480
So the

874
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,500
Then why does it have to be me?

875
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,860
Is it bad?

876
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,760
Is it that I'm too flaky?

877
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,360
so don't push it too hard.

878
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,160
You should open up a place

879
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,700
where you can re-re-evaluate.

880
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,160
Okay.

881
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,100
Then, what about the money?

882
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,400
I'll sell it.

883
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,400
So I can't re-re-evaluate it.

884
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,100
Isn't it life to evaluate food?

885
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,460
Talk to the cyber-mode team properly.

886
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,400
Mr. Oh.

887
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,460
Chomsok Western Arts Hall.

888
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:09,660
Kim Danae at Chomsok Academy Please come in.

889
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,240
What are you doing here?

890
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,540
Are you coming?

891
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,300
For what?

892
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,300
To get the money.

893
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

894
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,400
Sit down.

895
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,400
Let me go right now.

896
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:46,400
Well, what are you talking about?

897
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,400
What you're getting in is an art museum.

898
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,400
Isn't it because of the re-development business

899
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,400
that Siyeong and An Sang Taewon are?

900
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,400
Let him go.

901
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,400
Why are you dragging him into something that has nothing to do with him?

902
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:03,400
Why is there no front or back to you?

903
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,400
What's Siyeong's name and what's An Sang Taewon's?

904
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,400
What's the re-development business?

905
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,400
You're saying it's not?

906
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,400
So you need to know what you're talking about

907
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,400
to know if it's true or not.

908
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,400
So what do you mean by what you want to say?

909
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,400
What evidence do you use to say it?

910
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,400
You must be confident.

911
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,400
Evidence, witness,

912
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:32,400
is it all in your hands?

913
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,400
If you're going to keep saying things

914
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,400
that the other person won't understand,

915
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,400
go back.

916
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:43,400
I'm busy.

917
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,400
This is Jang Taejin.

918
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:57,400
I sent you a video, so let's check it out.

919
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:07,400
But you can't bury the truth.

920
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:37,400
I'm sorry.

921
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,400
Who's killing us?

922
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,400
What's the reason?

923
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,400
Find out everything you can.

924
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,400
We're not cheap dolls.

925
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,400
Won't you pay us?

926
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,400
Wait.

927
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,400
Eat up.

928
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,400
I think I'll sell it right away if I eat one more bite.

929
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,400
You're cheap.

930
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,400
I'm not cheap.

931
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,400
I'm not cheap.

932
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,400
I'm not cheap.

933
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,400
I'm not cheap.

934
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,400
I'm not cheap.

935
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,400
I'm not cheap.

936
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,400
I think I'll sell it right away if I eat one more bite.

937
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,400
It's cheap.

938
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,400
Is it that good?

939
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,400
That day, I'm sure you saw something there.

940
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,400
This is the last one.

941
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,400
I'll order it.

942
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,400
What happened that day.

943
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,400
Eat it.

944
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,400
Eat it.
