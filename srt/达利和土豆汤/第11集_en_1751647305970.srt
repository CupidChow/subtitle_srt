1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
1. When will Won Tak come?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
2. When will Won Tak come?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
3. When will Won Tak come?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, my.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, my.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When will Won Tak come?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It will take 2-3 days.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There is no research in this area.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, my.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll clean this up.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can do the recycling over there.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
do you want to sleep at my place tonight?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, it's not because I have other intentions.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Like last time, I'm the owner of the house, so I can sleep in the living room.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can sleep in my bed.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I just want to be with you.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm serious. I won't do anything.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I won't touch you, so don't worry.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If you won't do anything, why would you sleep at Mr. Jin's place?

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What?

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Why won't you touch me?

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You seem to be conservative.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, I mean...

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's okay. There's nothing to rush.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There's nothing to rush, right?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
When you feel better and ready,

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
please let me know.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I can wait.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Who says I'm not ready?

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm totally ready.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I just feel...

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
comfortable.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There's nothing to wait for.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Here.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Wait a minute.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Wait a minute.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Why is she leaving?

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Cha Ki.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What's wrong with your face?

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Did something happen?

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's so bad in your neighborhood.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I was in a taxi and it was so hard to get here.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What?

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why is she here?

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Are they...

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
living together?

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What do you mean?

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There's a reason.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
She's staying in my rooftop room.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What reason?

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You don't know.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What's wrong with your face?

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Did you get hit?

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Can I sleep a few days?

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hey, where are you going?

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hey, where are you going?

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Gosh.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There's ramen.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm hungry.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why would she eat ramen...

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
in someone else's house?

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What's wrong with you?

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Who did this?

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Tell me.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What's wrong?

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I had a fight with a girl at the mart.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I picked the remaining grapefruit first.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
She said she picked it first.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
She's so annoying.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What?

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't worry.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I won.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
She has a nosebleed.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You went to the mart like this?

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You did?

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Then why would I wear a suit at the mart?

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Where's the grapefruit?

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well...

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I saw the coffee, so I should let her have it.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
She gave it to me.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What's all this?

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What were you going to do?

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What?

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What?

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What?

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What?

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Hey.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What do you mean, hey?

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I was just...

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Me?

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, us?

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No.

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
No.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No, I...

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't know.

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I didn't want to do anything.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But why did you follow me?

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The revenge chance is high.

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hurry up and join.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
AOMG New Peking Entertainment City 772772, Kong.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm afraid your parents will be worried.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I wonder if you can stay with a man

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
who has a bloody nosebleed.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Your parents will be worried if they find out.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't think so.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't know what's going on,

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
but why don't you stay with me in the rooftop room?

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Just the two of us.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I think that would be better.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't want to.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm going to stay with you.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's why I'm here.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm going to stay with you.

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Come on out.

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm telling you to come out.

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What?

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Why did I have to sleep in the room?

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I was so ready.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Get ready for surgery.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Darn it.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I don't feel like sleeping with my face in the light.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll sleep in the room with a TV in the room.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I...

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Well...

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Do you want to die?

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
As you can see,

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm the type of person who sleeps very well.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I can't sleep in a hard place.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay?

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Darn it.

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Do you want to die?

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Darn it.

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Darn it.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Here...

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You're a real brother.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're not doing that in a bed

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
that doesn't even have a owner, are you?

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's not like you're a real man.

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What are you doing?

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You said you weren't doing this in a bed

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
that doesn't even have a owner.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I have a disc on my waist.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Darn it.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Wait.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I was so nervous yesterday and today.

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Should I be the only one?

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I want to catch anyone passing by

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and make them my victims.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Should I be the only one?

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So just sleep like you're dead.

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't even breathe.

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Just hang on to me.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What? What?

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What are you going to do?

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
How can you sleep without a sound?

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Are you sleeping?

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Good night.

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Good night.

165
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This is all because of that punk.

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Who else but your sister?

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How would she have found out about that information?

168
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
She said she helped you with the exhibition

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and the delivery business.

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know.

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Maybe they're going to be blinded.

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Anyway, I can't let this go.

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I've worked so hard for this.

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't have much time and money.

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm going to make a big deal out of this.

176
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know.

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It doesn't matter to you what happens to her.

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
She's not even blood.

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What do you mean?

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Why are you doing this to him?

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What are you going to do to him?

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You're not good enough.

183
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What are you doing as his son?

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You're not even getting a place

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
because of the connection between you and him.

186
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You said you liked a dumb guy,

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
so you just let him go.

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You can't even catch him and make things worse?

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You made him a student, a job,

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and a job.

191
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If you had made him look like a fool

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
with all that money,

193
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
you should've asked him nicely!

194
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Did you make him for me?

195
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What?

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You made him to run a daughter business.

197
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Not because of me, but because you want to

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
make him look like you're his daughter!

199
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
In-yeon...

200
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Who would like someone like her?

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Even my parents don't treat me like this.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Who would like and love someone like her?

203
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But In-yeon...

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
In-yeon!

205
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
In-yeon!

206
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
In-yeon

207
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you really not going to work?

208
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Then you should at least call me

209
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and tell me you're sick.

210
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Everyone's going to worry.

211
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,520
I'm fine with a

212
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,000
lousy job. No one cares.

213
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You're a good girl.

214
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Get up. I'll take you home.

215
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No.

216
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's a car key.

217
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I said I'm not going.

218
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I said I'd stay a few days.

219
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You made my dad like that

220
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and you can't do this?

221
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Dad.

222
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Did you...

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
do this because of me?

224
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Because of your father?

225
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Honey.

226
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
In-ju...

227
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
My dad is a bad person.

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He's a corrupt politician and a double-boss.

229
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm right.

230
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But I'm the one who's a father.

231
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Did you even think about me once?

232
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Did you even think about my face for a moment?

233
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's who I am.

234
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
My dad.

235
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You're crazy.

236
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You said you couldn't fool me.

237
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You're An Sang-tae's daughter?

238
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Anyway,

239
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I wouldn't have been beaten up.

240
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm An Sang-tae.

241
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I prepared for this.

242
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Anyway, I made time.

243
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What happened to Si-young?

244
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
He disappeared?

245
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Literally.

246
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He already knew we were coming.

247
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He left all the stuff in the dormitory.

248
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Nothing will happen, right?

249
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Hey, come here.

250
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Hey, hey.

251
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Hey, hey.

252
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Hey, hey.

253
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Hey, hey.

254
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Hey, hey.

255
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Hey.

256
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Hey.

257
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Hey.

258
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Hey.

259
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I can't dance.

260
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Hey.

261
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm Si-young.

262
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm Kim Si-young, the cleaner and the boss.

263
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Huh?

264
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Who is this?

265
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's An Sang-tae.

266
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh.

267
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You came to get me out of here.

268
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
365 days.

269
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
An Sang-tae is in good shape.

270
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Please pick me, An Sang-tae.

271
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You're not in good shape at home.

272
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What?

273
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Do you know that you found the stuff?

274
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I did?

275
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Where? Who?

276
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The police are going to arrest you.

277
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Your eyes are red.

278
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Of course, I won't let you go.

279
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Will you just disappear like this?

281
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Or will you do as I say?

282
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'll call you around 2 o'clock.

283
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let me cool off and wait until then.

284
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Okay.

285
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What do you think?

286
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
If we do this, we can turn the heat on

287
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and close the art museum.

288
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The most important thing in all this is

289
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
that we can't let Dali get hurt.

290
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Think of another way.

291
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Think of another way.

292
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You don't know one thing,

293
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
but you don't know the other.

294
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's a struggle and a setback

295
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
to make a man and a woman get along.

296
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
This is your chance.

297
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Show Dali the world you're in.

298
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And the only person who can protect you

299
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
is you, Jang Taejin.

300
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That's the only thing you can do.

301
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That way, you won't be afraid of this time again.

302
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
How dare you?

303
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
How dare you touch Han Sangtae?

304
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
In Korean art,

306
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
there are desires like waterfalls or northern movies.

307
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So depending on the material,

308
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
the meanings are different.

309
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The yellow flower means northern movies,

310
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and the pomegranate means the self-portrait.

311
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What about ducks?

312
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The marriage of the couple.

313
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The marriage of the couple?

314
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
In art, the bird means peace and marriage.

315
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So it's a pair of two.

316
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Then...

317
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Who are you trying to make a ghost?

318
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Are you done now?

319
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You're in the house, right?

320
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You're so mean!

321
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Hey!

322
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
How could you do this to me?

323
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I asked you to do this.

324
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
How could you hit my back?

325
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What are you talking about?

326
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What?

327
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I know you passed the information to Kim Dali.

328
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I told you to do this!

329
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You took the money from him!

330
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Are you saying this because you're not a good artist?

331
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
How could you do this to me?

332
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Who's supposed to be angry?

333
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Sir.

334
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I told you to take the money from him.

335
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So what?

336
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You don't even know how I got the money?

337
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I passed the information to Kim Dali?

338
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Who told you to do this?

339
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Why should I?

340
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm a housekeeper.

341
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
A housekeeper who only knows money!

342
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You're building a house, making a piece of paper,

343
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and trying to make a mess of it.

344
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You're going to keep saying that?

345
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Are you serious?

346
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I said no!

347
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
No, sir.

348
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
There are no other houses except the housekeeper.

349
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I looked up the information, but...

350
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Jang Taejin knows too.

351
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
What?

352
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You bought two people's land without telling me.

353
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You took over the construction company.

354
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Did you hear everything from Jang Taejin?

355
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Is it true that the secret deal was held?

356
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Or how did Taejin know about it?

357
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Sir.

358
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You can't trust him.

359
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm serious.

360
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You came to our store and caught me.

361
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
How can I trust you?

362
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You told me not to dream.

363
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You're a woman and an artist.

364
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Is this still me?

365
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm not that jerk.

366
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What happened to you?

367
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I said no, sir!

368
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Jang Taejin...

369
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It can't be.

370
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Who's the one who's on top of Ahn Sangtae?

371
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What?

372
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Who's the one who's the top?

373
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You need to know that to know how to settle this.

374
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That's...

375
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You're saying it's not true, right?

376
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I said it's not true!

377
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
If you don't say anything,

378
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
you'll be kicked out of the empty body.

379
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You'll be separated from Dongdeon forever.

380
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Can you promise me that?

381
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Do as you please.

382
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Kim Giseol.

383
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yes, father.

384
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Do you really have something on your mind?

385
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yes, of course.

386
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I said I could settle Ahn Sangtae's case quickly.

387
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm not going to let you go.

388
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm not going to let you go.

389
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm not going to let you go.

390
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm not going to let you go.

391
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The Grim Beat is not over yet, father.

392
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
If you really get it wrong this time,

393
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
it's not just Dongdeon.

394
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's over between you and me.

395
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Kim Giseol will be Oh Giseol again.

396
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Get it?

397
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yes, father.

398
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
What?

399
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
What is Jang Taejin thinking?

400
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What are you going to do later?

401
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Just tell me the truth.

402
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Find out who Ahn Sangtae meets.

403
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What?

404
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Just in case, find out if Jang Taejin and Ahn Sangtae

405
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
are connected.

406
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Jang Taejin and Ahn Sangtae?

407
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
The board of the Cheonga University

408
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
must be posted by our director, right?

409
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
How can he kick the ball so hard?

410
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It must be a few times the price of the land.

411
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Then is it better for Han Kiyoon to go into the apartment

412
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
without the museum?

413
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
The museum can be built somewhere else.

414
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Somewhere else?

415
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Where?

416
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Where would be good?

417
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Somewhere where you can go on weekends

418
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and weekends freely.

419
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Somewhere with a good restaurant

420
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
that you can go around in the meantime.

421
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Somewhere where you can go on the subway

422
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
and bus, where there are more squirrels

423
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and birds than tourists.

424
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Somewhere?

425
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm just thinking about the director's position.

426
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Wouldn't that be better?

427
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Honestly, with that money,

428
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
the son would be able to play with it.

429
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Do you understand?

430
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I honestly don't understand.

431
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That's why blood is thicker than water.

432
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
He's the father's daughter.

433
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
How can he be so close to the director who died?

434
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
This is a strategy to hold on.

435
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's not like the land is falling apart.

436
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The more you hold on, the higher the land price will go.

437
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What?

438
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
If not,

439
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
are you trying to create a new world

440
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
by marrying the man who moved in?

441
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I think the director likes the real thing

442
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
more than the real thing.

443
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
The real thing?

444
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
The real thing?

445
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
The real thing.

446
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The real thing.

447
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Did you see the two of them

448
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
playing with the electric billet

449
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
at the frog restaurant?

450
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
They were so close.

451
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You can't get close to the director

452
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
because you have nowhere to go.

453
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You're so funny.

454
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Director Kang is so funny sometimes.

455
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm sure they look good together.

456
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Where did they go?

457
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
They look good together.

458
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Really?

459
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Do I look good with Mr. Jin?

460
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
This is an idea for an art museum.

461
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And this is a revised plan for the exhibition.

462
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I've tried different things.

463
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Please check it out.

464
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I was just being rude to you.

465
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You're not upset, are you?

466
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Why would I be upset?

467
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I heard you look good with a good person.

468
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I think you're upset.

469
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Mr. Jin is a good guy,

470
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
he's nice and gentle,

471
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and he's popular with women.

472
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm not that good compared to him.

473
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Director,

474
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
being too humble is a curse.

475
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
If Mr. Jin hears this,

476
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
he'll be so upset at you.

477
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm so happy.

478
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Can I post the new intern recruitment ad today?

479
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yes, please do.

480
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Ms. Cha.

481
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I told you I'd take good care of it,

483
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
but you should check it out again.

484
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's a lot more than I thought.

485
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You're right.

486
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Is there a way to get it done?

487
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I'll have to look it up.

488
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Why did you touch the Grand Belt?

489
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I was in a hurry.

490
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
The bank will be even higher because of this.

491
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
If you don't have a solution,

492
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
you might get into a auction.

493
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
What?

494
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'll look around,

495
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
but you should ask for help

496
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
from your family,

497
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
whether you're going to take over or not.

498
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You don't think I'd do that?

499
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Okay.

500
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Okay.

501
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Hey, use the idol fashion company's bank account

502
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and follow me.

503
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Kim Heungcheon?

504
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I heard your brother's relationship

505
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
has been broken to the point

506
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
that he couldn't attend your funeral.

507
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
He's the head of the art department.

508
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Director Kim Dali did a great job this time.

509
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
He's like a descendant of the Cheongsong family.

510
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
A descendant of the Cheongsong family.

511
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm Song Changuk, a reporter from the Newspaper Department.

512
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I know Kim Siyeong well.

513
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I think you have a lot to say.

514
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Feel free to say it.

515
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
We left 30 minutes ago,

516
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
so we'll be here soon.

517
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We've contacted the reporters,

518
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
so the press will be here soon.

519
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
We'll go back to work.

520
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
What's this?

521
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Kim Heungcheon?

522
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Kim Dali from the Cheongsong Art Hall

523
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
is not the son of the former director Kim Nakcheon.

524
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
He's adopted by the family.

525
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Are you watching this video?

526
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I knew it.

527
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
The heavens are on our side.

528
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
We didn't abandon this baby.

529
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
How dare you be so arrogant about adoption?

530
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Please stop right now.

531
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
What do you mean?

532
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I said stop.

533
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You have to get hit right

534
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
so you can never look up again.

535
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You thought you were adopted,

536
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
but you didn't understand her.

537
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Turn the car around!

538
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I can't.

539
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Why not?

540
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm just going to turn it around.

541
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
What?

542
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
What's this?

543
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Tell them to make a new article.

544
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Whether it's a shocking article or a sketch,

545
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
do whatever you want.

546
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yes, sir.

547
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Where's Kim Heungcheon?

548
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
When did she come back?

549
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
That's...

550
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The Smokers

551
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The Hamilton Smokers are impossible to get.

552
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'll make sure to get all of them.

553
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Okay.

554
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
The market is in a bad shape, so it's not a big deal.

555
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
We have to pay the rent and pay for the debt.

556
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Where's Shin Sangho's work?

557
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Shin Sangho's work?

558
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You bastards.

559
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Be careful.

560
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Okay.

561
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You have to be really careful.

562
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Please take this.

563
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Okay.

564
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You have to be careful.

565
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Be careful not to scratch it.

566
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Be careful of the corner.

567
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Be careful of the corner.

568
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
What are you doing?

569
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
What are you doing?

570
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm just going to get rid of the alzabeg.

571
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
That's a work that can't be reimbursed with money.

572
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Can't you stop right now?

573
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Father.

574
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Who's your father?

575
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You're just a big shot.

576
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
You're trying to steal our clean assets.

577
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
What are you doing?

578
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Put it back.

579
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Hurry up.

580
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
This...

581
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I've made up my mind.

582
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
If you take this, you'll all be dead.

583
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm sure of it.

584
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
The clean world?

585
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You can't get out of here.

586
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Not even a single pencil.

587
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Did you know that Mr. Song Kyun is working here?

588
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
He's working here.

589
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
How did he hide it all this time?

590
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Then what's going to happen to this place?

591
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Who's going to be responsible for this?

592
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Oh, my.

593
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Can you hear me?

594
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You're the head of the art museum.

595
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Do you think you're a real man?

596
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Even a beast who can't speak

597
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
will be grateful for what you've done.

598
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
How long has it been since you died?

599
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You're so stubborn.

600
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Now you're even working for the art museum.

601
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You're not even a sick person.

602
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It's not that, Father.

603
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
If you raised this much

604
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
with this worthless body,

605
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
you should at least be a human.

606
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You don't know how much you've done

607
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
to get your father sick.

608
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
You're still a human

609
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
because you found yourself

610
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
a human being.

611
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That's why blood is important.

612
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
That's why I objected.

613
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Giving you a dog

614
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and giving you a dog

615
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
is a way to give them to their parents.

616
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
If you weren't so unlucky,

617
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
you would've lost your parents.

618
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
What's so good about you

619
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
after you married him?

620
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You went to a faraway place

621
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and became famous for being a good husband.

622
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You're worse than everyone else.

623
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You have one more

624
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
art museum left.

625
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You...

626
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You're a good friend

627
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
but you kneeled down to Taejin.

628
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Have you ever said anything

629
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
that made you feel bad?

630
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You kneeled down

631
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
in front of that scumbag

632
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
who didn't even have a son.

633
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Because of a scumbag like you,

634
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'll never forgive you.

635
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
If you have a conscience,

636
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
you should know that.

637
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Don't make our Cheonsong

638
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and the other people

639
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
look down on you.

640
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
What's with all the people?

641
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Is he really your brother?

642
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You said you'd kill people.

643
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
How could you take them for a visit?

644
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
That's why money is scary.

645
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
What's the reason? It's all about money.

646
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Is he okay?

647
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Excuse me.

648
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Who is it?

649
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Hello, Ms. Kang.

650
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Hello?

651
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Hello?

652
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
What should we do? He's not here.

653
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
He's on a job interview.

654
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Hello?

655
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'll call you later.

656
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Okay.

657
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Don't do this.

658
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Look at me. I'll push you.

659
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Please.

660
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Can you really do what I ask?

661
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I can.

662
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Anything?

663
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Anything.

664
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Then...

665
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Be reborn.

666
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
You're the real Cheonsong's daughter.

667
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'm sorry.

668
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
The number you have dialed...

669
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

670
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,500
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

671
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,140
It's me. Don't worry.

672
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,240
I'm trying to get things sorted out.

673
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,640
Dali.

674
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,940
No matter what anyone says, you're father's daughter

675
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,640
and a pure-hearted person.

676
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,240
I'll make sure you're like that.

677
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,900
I'll get you no matter what you do.

678
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,940
Don't hide and answer the phone.

679
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Dali.

680
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I'm trying to get you no matter what you do.

681
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

682
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Hello?

683
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,400
The car you're boarding?

684
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Yes.

685
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,600
What's the car number?

686
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,200
Oh, really?

687
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,900
Could you send me the CCTV footage you got?

688
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,200
Thank you. Have a nice day.

689
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,400
Darn it.

690
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,800
Where is it?

691
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,200
Did you see it?

692
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,700
Did you see it?

693
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,900
What?

694
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,000
I think the cleaner will be severely injured.

695
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,900
What? Did you know about Detective Ju?

696
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,500
The one that Kim Dali adopted.

697
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,000
She didn't look like she was from a orphanage.

698
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,800
She had a head injury.

699
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,300
She had a head injury?

700
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,200
Hey, I'm sorry.

701
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,800
I was just talking nonsense.

702
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,500
What do you mean, a head injury?

703
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm sorry.

704
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,500
Take it.

705
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,800
She's not in the art gallery.

706
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,600
I think she left her phone behind.

707
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,200
I don't want to come here.

708
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,400
It's true that you don't have a father.

709
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,200
But I have nowhere else to go.

710
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,400
Where's your mom?

711
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,600
Did you meet her?

712
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,900
Hello.

713
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,000
Hey, I'm here.

714
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,600
I'm here.

715
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,400
Here you are.

716
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,700
There you go.

717
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,300
Baby, let's have a bite.

718
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,700
You can't eat it.

719
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,900
It's been days since we last saw each other.

720
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Let's read the book later.

721
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,900
No.

722
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,800
You can't take the book.

723
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,400
It'll be ruined.

724
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,900
Are you okay?

725
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,400
Thank you.

726
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,600
Thank you.

727
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,300
Thank you.

728
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,700
It was fun.

729
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,900
Thank you.

730
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,200
We need one more baby.

731
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,800
One more baby?

732
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,900
Why?

733
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,500
Are you scared of the monster?

734
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,900
Do you want me to take it off?

735
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,100
No!

736
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,300
Don't do it!

737
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,400
I feel sorry for him.

738
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,300
No one...

739
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,400
can take him.

740
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
No one can take him.

741
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,900
No one can take him.

742
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,900
I don't love him.

743
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,900
Like I do.

744
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,500
I can't talk.

745
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,300
I can't talk.

746
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,900
I can't talk.

747
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,700
There are many people who say

748
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,100
that the food is fresh and not fishy.

749
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,900
I think it was important to change the broth.

750
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,100
Let's try to find a side dish

751
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,700
that will be good for the family.

752
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,900
Okay.

753
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,900
I should wear a diaper and have a meeting.

754
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,500
Why are there so many things to talk about?

755
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,300
Who talks the most?

756
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,900
I didn't see it earlier.

757
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,300
Ms. Kim.

758
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,300
Ms. Kim.

759
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,900
Was it Lee Byunga?

760
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,500
No wonder he was acting strange.

761
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,300
Why?

762
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,900
Rumor has it that he removed Jang Taejin from Cheongsong.

763
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,900
It turned out to be the opposite.

764
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,500
It's not true.

765
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:21,900
I know.

766
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,100
It's not right to let Lee Byunga be my daughter-in-law.

767
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,700
Of course.

768
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,700
This is too sweet.

769
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,300
You're so mean.

770
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,100
You're so mean.

771
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,900
I'll eat as you give me.

772
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,500
Why are you doing this again, Father?

773
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,500
It's not the first time I've seen you like this.

774
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,300
You're really a woman.

775
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,100
I'm not a woman.

776
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,100
I'm not a woman.

777
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,100
I'm not a woman.

778
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,300
Then how did you end up in this situation?

779
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,100
Did you get a divorce from Cheongsong?

780
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,900
No.

781
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,500
It's not that I'm not your daughter-in-law.

782
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,100
The court acknowledges it.

783
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,900
Of course!

784
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,100
Even if I didn't get a drop of blood,

785
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,300
I'm still your son.

786
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,700
If you know Lee Byunga,

787
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,900
you'll be so embarrassed to eat us.

788
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,100
But isn't it a bit embarrassing to do something?

789
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,300
You're so mean.

790
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,100
You don't even think of a person to give you rice cake.

791
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,700
I'm sorry.

792
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,500
Yes, ma'am.

793
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,300
Did you go to the care center today?

794
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:11,900
Yes.

795
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,500
If you find her, please call me.

796
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,900
Okay.

797
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,500
What is it?

798
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,700
Is it a different story?

799
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,100
Why are you curious?

800
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,300
Why haven't you contacted me since you left the art gallery?

801
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,700
If you don't, forget it.

802
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,500
You're acting like you're worried.

803
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,700
What?

804
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,700
When are you going to throw it away?

805
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,500
Why are you so desperate?

806
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,300
Why isn't there anyone who's worth it?

807
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,900
Are you sad that you threw it away?

808
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,900
Did you think I'd wait for you

809
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,700
as if I were waiting for you to come back?

810
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,300
Did you think I'd wait for you?

811
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,100
Don't get the wrong idea.

812
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,300
We'll take care of our own business.

813
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,100
So pay attention.

814
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,700
Then you do your job.

815
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,100
I'm going to do mine.

816
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,300
Dali is my job.

817
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,500
That jerk.

818
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,100
Should we bring him to his house?

819
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,100
Let's clean up one last time.

820
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,700
I don't want to surprise you

821
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:17,700
with my soft heart

822
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:28,700
But I guess I love you

823
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,700
It's a sad day

824
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:38,300
But I have a dream

825
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:46,500
That you can't love me

826
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,900
Dali.

827
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,900
Dali.

828
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,300
I know you're here. Come out.

829
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:08,300
I can't touch this sad heart

830
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,700
Dali.

831
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:17,700
I want to tell you

832
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,900
everything about me

833
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,300
I'm going to the bathroom.

834
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,500
Dali.

835
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,300
Where did she hide?

836
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,900
Dali.

837
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,900
What is it?

838
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,700
You haven't been in touch all day.

839
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,700
You're so angry,

840
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,700
but you're trying to see who's upset?

841
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,100
Dali.

842
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,100
Dali.

843
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,100
Dali.

844
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,100
Dali.

845
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,100
Dali.

846
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,100
Dali.

847
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,100
Dali.

848
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,100
Dali.

849
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,100
Dali.

850
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,100
Dali.

851
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,100
Dali.

852
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,100
Dali.

853
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,100
Dali.

854
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,100
Dali.

855
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,100
Dali.

856
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,100
Chaki is just a friend.

857
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,100
It's not a guy or a girl.

858
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,100
She just came to see me because she had something to do.

859
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,100
I can't tell you now, but I'll tell you later.

860
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,100
It's not that I can't tell you because I have something bad.

861
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,100
She's a private.

862
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,100
It's real.

863
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,100
I swear.

864
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,100
I'm really innocent.

865
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,100
You didn't see the news today?

866
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,100
News?

867
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,100
The inheritance?

868
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,100
You don't have to worry about that.

869
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,100
She has a daughter.

870
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:34,100
How can she have the right to have an inheritance without a daughter?

871
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:39,100
It's just that it took some time, so I don't have to worry about it.

872
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,100
It's not that.

873
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,100
I...

874
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,100
Did something happen again?

875
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:55,100
You didn't hear about Lee Byung-ah?

876
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,100
I heard.

877
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,100
Are you okay?

878
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,100
Should I say I'm okay?

879
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,100
Actually, my brother is not my real brother.

880
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,100
He's the son of the person who lives with my father.

881
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,100
But he's my brother.

882
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,100
I'm not going to tell you.

883
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,100
But if you adopt,

884
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,100
Isn't Dal-ri Dal-ri?

885
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,100
Did you not answer the phone today just because of that?

886
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,100
What is it?

887
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,100
You're making me nervous.

888
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,100
Dal-ri.

889
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,100
I was young.

890
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,100
I prayed every day for my dad to die for me instead of my mom.

891
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,100
Come here.

892
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,100
Boss.

893
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,100
How long are you going to keep me waiting?

894
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,100
Let's go to Namsan after school today.

895
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,100
Where are you going?

896
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,100
You're so mean.

897
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,100
I'm going to Namsan.

898
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,100
Where are you going?

899
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,100
You're so mean.

900
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,100
Don't do that.

901
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,100
I'll buy you a bag.

902
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,100
I'll give you a luxury bag.

903
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:34,100
A father who is successful in society and respected

904
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,100
hit his daughter.

905
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,100
What do you mean?

906
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,100
Why did you do that to your brother?

907
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,100
And some son

908
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,100
even though his father is doing fine,

909
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,100
he changed his last name to become a rich family's son.

910
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:03,100
You know how hard I worked to become a real father's son, right?

911
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,100
As soon as I changed my family law,

912
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,100
I applied for a legal change of my name.

913
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:12,100
Do you know what it was like to be a loser in the 5th period?

914
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,100
That was

915
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,100
denying my identity.

916
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,100
Your daughter

917
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,100
threw her life away

918
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,100
for her dead father.

919
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:34,100
Can you sell your father?

920
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:37,100
No matter how much money you have,

921
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,100
are you going to sell your father?

922
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,100
The art gallery is my father.

923
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,100
My father.

924
00:58:55,100 --> 00:59:01,100
There are as many parents and children as there are paintings in the world.

925
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,100
That's what I mean.

926
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,100
You have to share your blood

927
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:11,100
so that it doesn't become an ideal relationship between parents and children.

928
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:22,100
And I expected it to be something like that.

929
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,100
How?

930
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,100
I mean,

931
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,100
I'm really sorry

932
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,100
for the person who died,

933
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,100
but this is not right.

934
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,100
There should be at least one place that looks like you.

935
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:47,100
No matter how lonely you are, you have to have this conscience.

936
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,100
I'm sorry.

937
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,100
I'm sorry.

938
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,100
I'm sorry.

939
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,100
I'm sorry.

940
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,100
You should have had this conscience.

941
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:00,100
No matter how lonely you are, you have to have this conscience.

942
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,100
This is not right.

943
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,100
Oh, my.

944
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,100
You're still a kid.

945
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,100
I'm sorry.

946
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,100
Get in the car.

947
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,100
I'm sorry.

948
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,100
But looking at you crying,

949
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,100
I think you look a little like me.

950
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,100
Do as planned.

951
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,100
Go ahead.

952
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,100
I'm sorry.

953
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:27,100
Was the exhibition this big?

954
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,100
Why? Why?

955
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,100
Are you a human being?

956
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,100
I just...

957
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,100
Didn't you think that the owner of the art gallery cafe

958
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:38,100
had something more powerful than him?

959
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,100
I can turn this situation around at any time.

960
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:44,100
Who are you to spray water on my son?

961
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,100
I'm sorry.

962
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,100
I'm sorry.

963
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,100
I'm sorry.

964
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,100
I'm sure I'm a warning to you.

965
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,100
What do you mean?

966
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,100
Will it be a comfort?
