1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Yes or No?

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,800
What the heck?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What is this?

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What is this?

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What is all this?

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What is this?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hey!

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Dal-rae?

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Right here...

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Are you okay?

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You scared me.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How could you come in without a sound from someone else's house?

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry. I just...

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The door was open.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But what's going on?

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why are you here?

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What's going on inside the house?

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I thought the thief came in again.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's okay.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's okay now.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What's going on?

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He just killed his family without a sound.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Did someone just play a prank on him?

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He said the owner came in and ran away.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We'll get going now.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay. Good luck.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's because a cat just came out.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll go to bed after I get my clothes on.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Are you okay?

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I know you're investigating,

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
but I don't know if you're going to do it right because you don't have any damage items.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Do you know anyone who lives here?

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
An art employee?

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
An art employee?

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't know anyone.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Really?

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why?

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Nothing.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Actually, I'm not sure if you're going to do it right.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm just curious.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's nothing.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Look again to see if there's anything missing.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There's nothing.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What?

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What...

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Did you search so hard?

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is Bang Ju-ri not coming?

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I didn't tell Wontak because it was an emergency.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I was worried about him.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Then let's clean up and go to my house.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We have to eat dinner.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Just bring the necessary accessories.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
No, I'm fine now, so you can go in.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
How can a girl who's crazy about a broken house

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
leave a girl he likes alone?

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You're so selfish.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's not be stubborn and go together.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I have to go and clean up.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The bare foot has a special age sense.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Did you clean up and do the dishes?

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Same as I do today.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hairstyle to show off

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
High-profile, please.

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm looking forward to the hair and makeup

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
& cool-looking color beard!

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Please listen to it really...

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,400
I almost died.

91
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,160
You said you were going to a meeting

92
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,100
and that you were going home.

93
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,060
Stop it.

94
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,400
What is it that you're doing?

95
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
It can't be a lump of gold that looks like a stamp.

96
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,100
No way.

97
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,900
Father.

98
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,400
If I've committed a sin,

99
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,300
I'll pay for it.

100
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,600
No, Father!

101
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,100
It doesn't matter what happens to us.

102
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,300
What about the museum?

103
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,000
What about my family?

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,100
I'm going crazy.

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I can't have let that go.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
You're crazy.

107
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,800
You did it.

108
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,200
Wait.

109
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,900
Why are you looking for that at the chief's house?

110
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
What did you do to him?

111
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,300
What are you talking about?

112
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
This is all your father's doing.

113
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,400
You should've been more determined.

114
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,200
You son of a bitch.

115
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,500
Darn it.

116
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,800
What are you doing? You're not answering my calls.

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
Hey.

118
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,100
Did you take any money?

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,900
You crazy jerk.

120
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,700
I'm telling you.

121
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,300
I don't know what you did,

122
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,500
but it has nothing to do with me.

123
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,100
Call me again.

124
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,200
I'll go to the police station right away.

125
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,300
Hey.

126
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,200
Hey!

127
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,800
You're crazy.

128
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Hey.

129
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,500
Hey!

130
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,200
What did you say you were doing?

131
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,700
Going somewhere?

132
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,900
You're a piece of shit.

133
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,100
You think I'm just saying anything?

134
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,900
Should I go right now?

135
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,800
Should I listen to the drunkard or the weak?

136
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,200
Should I test it?

137
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,600
You little...

138
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,600
You're a piece of shit too.

139
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,900
You...

140
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
You're not even a human.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,700
What do you want?

142
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,700
What do you want from me?

143
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,900
You can wear these.

144
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,900
What are you doing? You're not coming in?

145
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,900
Then...

146
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
I'll take off my shoes.

147
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,700
Okay.

148
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,600
Oh.

149
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,000
They said they'll be repairing the door tomorrow morning,

150
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,400
so don't worry.

151
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,200
They said there's no food that can cover it, right?

152
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,400
Yes.

153
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,200
It's late, so I'll make it simple.

154
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
Yes.

155
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll hang a big and nice one in my living room,

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,200
and watch it every day.

157
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,800
In the morning and in the evening.

158
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,600
That's right.

159
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,000
The same movie you mentioned.

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,600
Oh.

161
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Sit down. The ceiling won't collapse.

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,200
Okay.

163
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,400
That's just a doenjang jar.

164
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,200
It's not like a Korean white tea jar.

165
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
We don't have that at home.

166
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
But the wallpaper and curtains

167
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,500
are the best quality interior design.

168
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,200
Is there anything special about art?

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
Why did they send you

170
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
a yo-kang jar like this at the art museum?

171
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,800
I asked them and they said they were grateful

172
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,400
for your help.

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Yo-kang jar?

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,800
What?

175
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
What?

176
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,000
Doenjang jar?

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,400
It smells a lot.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's hot.

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's hot.

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's hot.

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's hot.

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's hot.

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's hot.

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's hot.

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's hot.

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's hot.

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's hot.

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's hot.

189
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Didn't you say you'd make it simple?

190
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's simple.

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There's no platter, no braised ribs,

192
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and no octopus omelet.

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Eat it before it gets cold.

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're doing this because of the promise

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
you made with your mother, right?

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What?

197
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You were worried about your son

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
who was going to grow up without you.

199
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You were worried that he'd get sick.

200
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's why you always take care of him.

201
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Why do you remember that?

202
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It must've been hard for you

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
to be an adult when you were 10.

204
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
My father always said

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
that you have to take care of yourself

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
to become an adult.

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I ended up sending him away

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
without being an adult.

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's what I like the most.

210
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Thank you.

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
How much can an adult's child

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
be in front of his parents?

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We're all children.

214
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But we're all going to grow up

215
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
as we bump into each other.

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You'll be rooting for us.

217
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You said you'd always be watching us.

218
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You finished your meal.

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Eat up.

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Mr. Jin.

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance

222
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
that I'm staying with Wontak.

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I know what you're worried about.

224
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I know you won't mind...

225
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What am I worried about?

226
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What?

227
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What am I worried about?

228
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Electricity bills.

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Water bills.

230
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You know well.

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You saved them for yourself.

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Don't go around

233
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
with the lights on.

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Of course.

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Don't worry.

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Have you ever heard

237
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
that I'm tactless?

238
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No.

239
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Goodness.

240
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The beginning and the end of a dish

241
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
are from the ingredients to the dishes.

242
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I can't help but be relieved

243
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
when I do this.

244
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
How about you?

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'll sleep in the bedroom.

246
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You're the owner of the house.

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll be right back.

248
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You're the owner of the house.

249
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You should sleep in the living room.

250
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Okay.

251
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Sure.

252
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm so considerate

253
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
that I can't even watch TV

254
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
while I'm sleeping all day.

255
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
TV is my priority.

256
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Thank you for thinking of me

257
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and being so considerate.

258
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Okay.

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Oh, and I changed the sheets

260
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and the pillows.

261
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Have you ever

262
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
washed the dishes?

263
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Of course.

264
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Washing the dishes is no big deal.

265
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I just need to wash them

266
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and rinse them.

267
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, no.

268
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm so sorry.

269
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Wait.

270
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I think

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I should use a towel.

272
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's why I can't stop worrying.

273
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I still don't know what to do.

274
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Pick up the phone.

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You've been ringing for a while.

276
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm done.

277
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm really fine.

278
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't worry about me.

279
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Okay.

280
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Okay.

281
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Okay.

282
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Okay.

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Okay.

284
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Okay.

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay.

286
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
A free food train.

287
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
50% off for the first anniversary.

288
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's see.

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
A free potato stew.

290
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
50% off for the first anniversary.

291
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Congratulations.

292
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Thank you.

293
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,860
Turn it up!

294
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,520
Take one more group photo!

295
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What is it?

296
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Isn't it?

297
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't like art, so protect me.

298
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What day is it?

299
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What day is it?

300
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:47,000
No.

301
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
No.

302
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
No.

303
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
No.

304
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
No.

305
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
No.

306
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
No.

307
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No.

308
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What's wrong?

309
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Are you okay?

310
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I heard you laugh when I knocked.

312
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I think you woke up because of me.

314
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Are you okay?

315
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
No.

316
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm not okay.

317
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm not okay.

318
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll apologize for the last mistake I made.

319
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Thank you for your heart, but I can't take it.

320
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Is it because I'm ignorant?

322
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You're a wise man.

323
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Did you hate it because it was a gift that only revealed money?

324
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You're the one who's grateful for helping our museum.

325
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's not a gift.

326
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Then what is it?

327
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Is it because of Jang Tae-jin?

328
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I can't say no.

329
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't know how far you know, but I don't know if you've ever been in a war.

330
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm afraid to love someone again, give my heart, and dream of something together.

331
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's said that loving is a risk that can't be rewarded for love.

332
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm not confident in taking that risk.

333
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't know such complicated and difficult words.

334
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So you're saying there's no other man.

335
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's not that I'm starting again with Jang Tae-jin.

336
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't hate it or get goosebumps or get a cramp.

337
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Mr. Jin.

338
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Then it's okay.

339
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I don't know what kind of danger I have to take when people like people.

340
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I got it.

341
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You still haven't got all the scars, have you?

342
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm not a sick person.

343
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Let's just be the one who's a good-natured, good-natured person.

344
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Mr. Jin.

345
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's still a long way to find me.

346
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Sleep more.

347
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Don't be a nightmare this time.

348
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'd like you to know this one thing.

349
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You're much braver than you think.

350
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm not the kind of person who gives up because I'm afraid of something.

351
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But if the reason is because of the person who hurt you, it's not Kim Dal-ri.

352
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Good night.

353
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Why are you putting love at risk?

354
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Love...

355
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Why are you putting love...

356
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Love...

357
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Love...

358
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Go eat this sandwich.

359
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
No, it's okay.

360
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I don't know.

361
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I couldn't sleep all night, but I'm afraid I'll have to work until morning.

362
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Wontak.

363
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:32,000
What are you two?

364
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Oh, no.

365
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So nothing happened?

366
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yeah.

367
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
What about the hurt?

368
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
No.

369
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You're upset because I just showed up, right?

370
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
What is this?

371
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm sure everyone will come in.

372
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
If you're a thief, you'll take responsibility.

373
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
What do you think you're stealing in the rooftop room?

374
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You don't even get a human rights fee.

375
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What did you say?

376
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Don't worry.

377
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's okay.

378
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Your face is a security system.

379
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm not a thief.

380
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm a human rights activist.

381
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm a human rights activist.

382
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
What did you say?

383
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Don't worry.

384
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's okay.

385
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Your face is a security system.

386
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
No, did anyone know that Kim Dal-ri lives here?

387
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And why are you so insincere?

388
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I don't have the time.

389
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
If it doesn't work once, it'll work twice.

390
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
If it doesn't work twice, it'll work three times.

391
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You have to ask me to change the door until it works.

392
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Why do you only say it once?

393
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I know who Ha-neul is.

394
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
If you had a scar on your body,

395
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'd have been smelling you in the air.

396
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Why are you doing this to Mr. Jin?

397
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
He kept helping me last night.

398
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Let's get out of here.

399
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
This isn't a simple thing.

400
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
What?

401
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
If you had a criminal record, you'd be able to get it.

402
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The owner of the F&B house is right below here.

403
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And you left that behind and went to the rooftop?

404
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And you looked for something special.

405
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You searched the whole room.

406
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But there's nothing missing.

407
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You're talking about this house that's been robbed,

408
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and that's been broken down.

409
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You're talking about a laptop and a cotton bag.

410
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
But you left that behind.

411
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Do you think this is something natural?

412
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So what is it that's not a simple thing?

413
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I think it's a will.

414
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
A will?

415
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm sure it's a will.

416
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You have a lot of things you want because you're a cop, right?

417
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Me?

418
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Find out if there's a woman you want

419
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
among the recent ex-convicts.

420
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I ran into her for a second, and she looked like a woman.

421
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Maybe it's a will.

422
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
A will.

423
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What?

424
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Are you crazy?

425
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I should move to the corner of the house.

426
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Can't you just rest for today?

427
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You must have been very surprised.

428
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You said you couldn't sleep.

429
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I have an important meeting.

430
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Oh, right, my cell phone.

431
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
What's this?

432
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Oh, my.

433
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
What's wrong with your ear?

434
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I have a little inflammation because of my earrings.

435
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Be careful.

436
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:42,000
You have to take good care of it.

437
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Are you okay, Ms. Gong?

438
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yes, thank you.

439
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
White bookcase, right?

440
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Pardon?

441
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I think I always use this perfume.

442
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's a common perfume.

443
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's not common.

444
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It's your perfume.

445
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I gave up on buying one because it was too expensive.

446
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'll buy you one.

447
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
The one that suits you.

448
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You're so bad at talking.

449
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That's enough.

450
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I have to print out the meeting materials.

451
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:00,000
What's wrong?

452
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
What's wrong with you?

453
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
What kind of person is Princess Na?

454
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Pardon?

455
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Everyone else has a personal record, but only Princess's.

456
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Oh, that's...

457
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
My father?

458
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You mean, my father hired Princess Na himself?

459
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
All employees were supposed to be hired publicly.

460
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It was quite an unusual thing.

461
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And I told him that it was all about education and experience.

462
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
He said he'd take care of it.

463
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
He said he'd let me and the director know for a while.

464
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I think he has a sense of humor, so teach him well.

465
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
He even asked me to do a special favor.

466
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
When the children arrive, they will watch the exhibition with the Docent.

467
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
We will do the experience learning that Mr. Han Kyu prepared.

468
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,000
The prepared experience learning includes clay crafts and paper folding.

469
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Is it yours?

470
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It will be held for two hours at the outdoor park.

471
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:35,000
All schedules will be completed at the end of the Frog Restaurant program.

472
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
We've been doing it every day and night, and we're a little busy because we're reducing the program to the party.

473
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
The schedule is a little tight.

474
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
The kids are a little tired.

475
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Then why don't we set up the kids in the art hall garden?

476
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I think it would be nice to have a camping atmosphere.

477
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It's not as easy as it sounds to do a one-day tour at the museum.

478
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Of course, it's dangerous because they're kids.

479
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
They don't know where to turn on.

480
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Are you okay, Gwangju?

481
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Pardon?

482
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
What should I do?

483
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Let the kids sleep in the art hall.

484
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I think there will be opinions as the manager of the Frog Restaurant.

485
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But...

486
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The safety issue and the rain issue.

487
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Unfortunately, this year...

488
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
What about a hotel stay?

489
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Please sit down.

490
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'd like to have a spoon on our table.

491
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Don't you have any shame?

492
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
What about a hotel stay?

493
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I thought it would be nice to go to the city since the kids are coming to Seoul.

494
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Of course, all additional costs will be burdened by the world.

495
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Can't I?

496
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Manager Kim Dali?

497
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
To make such a suggestion, you have to take the official procedure.

498
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You can't just come in to the meeting room.

499
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's not a hole in the wall, it's a book.

500
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I didn't think you'd refuse.

502
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Why would I refuse?

503
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
What?

504
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It's just...

505
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Last time, it was just a personal problem between you and me.

506
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I was so embarrassed that I couldn't tell the difference between the public and private affairs.

507
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You didn't expect anything and suggested this, did you?

508
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I didn't think much of it.

509
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
If you're upset, I'll apologize.

510
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Oh, that's the one, right?

511
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:17,500
The

512
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
You don't have any friends.

513
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,500
You're okay with Sejak, too, right?

514
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Sure.

515
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:39,500
I like everything you cook for me.

516
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Yeah, that's good.

517
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
My thoughts don't change.

518
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,500
It's over.

519
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Yeah, I'll control the speed.

520
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,500
I went back to the relationship that worked out like a book.

521
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
I was in a hurry.

522
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,500
Brother.

523
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:04,500
But I hope it comes out of Won Tak's house.

524
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Should I go in?

525
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
You're not laughing.

526
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:24,500
I was just kidding.

527
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
What?

528
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Did Jiyoung disappear?

529
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:47,500
What about the stuff?

530
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
I saw you dragging the money to the subcontractor.

531
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Isn't that you?

532
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,500
Then where the hell did it go?

533
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,500
I'd rather be dead.

534
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,500
We're done when we're alive and we're on the road.

535
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Everything's empty.

536
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Before the rice is finished, you have to sleep.

537
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:27,500
No matter what.

538
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:34,500
Excuse me while I eat this.

539
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Did you hear any bad news?

540
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
I know.

541
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:49,500
Unlike before, the color is a little...

542
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,500
You're as white as snow.

543
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,500
It's not easy to clean up and take care of this.

544
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,500
I heard that the subcontractor is still in the public opinion that one of the assholes is gone.

545
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
Oh, assholes?

546
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Oh, my.

547
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:12,500
You're a lot of work.

548
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:18,500
Let's keep talking about what we were talking about earlier.

549
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:24,500
I think the government will announce it sooner than I expected.

550
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,500
The public's interest in real estate is usually hot.

551
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,500
If it's announced, it's worth calling.

552
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Should I transfer the money to the art gallery?

553
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:44,500
So this is the state of the art gallery that came to the chairman's house?

554
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Go to the lawsuit.

555
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
A lawsuit?

556
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,500
A lawsuit?

557
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,500
There's a lawsuit against the big money.

558
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:58,500
Send the content certificate, bet the interest, bet everything you can bet and fall.

559
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:08,500
If you shake the curtain and make me lose my mind, then we'll throw rice cakes to buy them.

560
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,500
The bullets are ready, right?

561
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Yes, if it's only one thing.

562
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Of course.

563
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
You're a man of your word.

564
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Bullet loading complete.

565
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,500
Here.

566
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,500
This is the construction company my relative knows.

567
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,500
If it's announced, it'll be right after the business.

568
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,500
When do you set up a company, build a company, and participate in the opening?

569
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:53,500
First of all, you take over the company and divide it into six.

570
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Shouldn't we have this kind of equipment to have trust in each other?

571
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:04,500
There are so many people who are hitting their backs these days.

572
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Of course.

573
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,500
The company is a big company.

574
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,500
It's a big company.

575
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
It's a big company.

576
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
It's a big company.

577
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
It's a big company.

578
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
It's a big company.

579
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
It's a big company.

580
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
It's a big company.

581
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,500
It's a big company.

582
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
It's a big company.

583
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
It's a big company.

584
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
It's a big company.

585
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:17,500
You're so considerate.

586
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,500
I'm not considerate.

587
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,500
I'm leaving.

588
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:33,500
You go in, too.

589
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
You're saying you don't have money?

590
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Are you sure?

591
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
What?

592
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:46,500
No, it's not like what you said.

593
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
That's right.

594
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,500
What you see isn't everything.

595
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,500
And it's like you're looking for a specific item.

596
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,500
I've been looking all over the room.

597
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,500
A specific item?

598
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:11,500
What could that be?

599
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:21,500
I'm sorry.

600
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
Hello.

601
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
Hello.

602
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
Hello.

603
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
Hello.

604
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Hello.

605
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Hello.

606
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
Let's go in.

607
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Fill up your pockets.

608
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
Come on in.

609
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,500
Who is this?

610
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:46,500
If you don't know anything, ask me.

611
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,500
Thank you for joining us.

612
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,500
It's hard to do it even if you want to.

613
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,500
Good job today.

614
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,500
You must be mistaken.

615
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:09,500
I'm the supervisor and you're the sponsor.

616
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,500
I should be the sponsor.

617
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:19,500
Thank you for the money.

618
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,500
You're a funny person.

619
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:28,500
I'm the one who's humorous.

620
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,500
Are you here?

621
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,500
Yeah, Halli.

622
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,500
Fortunately, the weather is nice.

623
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,500
Are you here, Mr. Jin?

624
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,500
Yeah.

625
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,500
You're so cute.

626
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,500
You've had a hard time.

627
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,500
What?

628
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,500
Please tell me if you need anything.

629
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,500
I have everything here.

630
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,500
The kids are looking forward to it.

631
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:58,500
Welcome to the Three Frogs Restaurant.

632
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,500
Can you see the silver tray in front of you?

633
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,500
Yes.

634
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,500
This is a fantastic and artistic dish

635
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,500
that Gabinchi developed himself.

636
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Are you curious about what kind of food is in it?

637
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,500
Yes.

638
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Are you curious?

639
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,500
Yes.

640
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,500
If you're curious, you can order it.

641
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,500
Darn it.

642
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,500
Let's check it out.

643
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,500
If I say one, two, three,

644
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,500
you can say cheers and get out.

645
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,500
Okay?

646
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,500
One, two, three.

647
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,500
Cheers.

648
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,500
What?

649
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,500
What?

650
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,500
What's this?

651
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,500
It's anchovy, an Italian anchovy sauce.

652
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,500
It smells a bit, but it tastes good.

653
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,500
If you're curious, you can try it.

654
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,500
How is it?

655
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,500
Try it.

656
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,500
Is it good?

657
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,500
Is it good?

658
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,500
Yes.

659
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,500
Really?

660
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,500
It's really good.

661
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,500
It tastes like anchovy.

662
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,500
You're too much.

663
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,500
You're giving me anchovies just because I'm hungry.

664
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
If you were born in this day and age,

665
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,500
you'd be a star right away.

666
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,500
The restaurant is ruined.

667
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,500
Here.

668
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,500
Since we're not going to eat anything with just one anchovy,

669
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:37,500
let's cook and eat it with a good taste and a full stomach.

670
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,500
Is that okay?

671
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,500
Yes.

672
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,500
I've organized the recipe for the leonardo.

673
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Please re-interpret it to suit your taste.

674
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
Chef Yumyeong would like it more.

675
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,500
Let's not do that and let the kids cook themselves.

676
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,500
What?

677
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,500
The fantastic food that Chef Yumyeong cooked is good,

678
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,500
but wouldn't it be better to help them solve their own problems?

679
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,500
Whether it's good or not,

680
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,500
everyone has to cook themselves.

681
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,500
Now, you need help to cook.

682
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,500
Who here is the worst cook?

683
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,500
Manager Kim Dali has been selected.

684
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Let's go, Dali!

685
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,500
Applause!

686
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,500
Dali! Dali!

687
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
What are you doing?

688
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,500
The restaurant's cooks are waiting for you.

689
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,500
Dali! Dali!

690
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,500
Kim Dali! Kim Dali!

691
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,500
Please add the oil to the frying pan.

692
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
I'll add the potatoes.

693
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,500
I'll add the anchovies and the anchovies.

694
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,500
While the teachers are frying the anchovies,

695
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,500
the students will fry the eggs.

696
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,500
The eggs are ready.

697
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
The eggs are ready.

698
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
The eggs are ready.

699
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,500
It's easy.

700
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,500
Put the eggs in the pan.

701
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
It's easy.

702
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,500
Mix it well.

703
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,500
Like this.

704
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Let's go!

705
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
Let's go!

706
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,500
Let's go!

707
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Let's go!

708
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,500
Everyone.

709
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,500
We will all become adults one day.

710
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,500
Some will be early,

711
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,500
and some will be late.

712
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:18,500
There will be a time when you have to stand up

713
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,500
on your own, without anyone's help.

714
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,500
What's the time?

715
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,500
Food!

716
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:33,500
You can't miss out on meals.

717
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,500
You have to know how to take care of yourself

718
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,500
to become a true adult.

719
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,500
Here.

720
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,500
You all worked hard today.

721
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,500
Good job.

722
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
Thank you.

723
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Here.

724
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,500
Let's go.

725
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,500
You're not eating?

726
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
Let's go eat.

727
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,500
Let's eat!

728
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,500
Let's eat!

729
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,500
Let's eat!

730
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,500
Let's eat!

731
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
Let's eat!

732
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,500
Let's eat.

733
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,500
Let's eat.

734
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,500
Thank you.

735
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
Thank you.

736
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,500
Thank you.

737
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,500
Thank you.

738
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,500
Thank you.

739
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
Thank you.

740
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
Let's go.

741
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,500
We should go too.

742
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,500
What?

743
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,500
No one's following us to the art museum.

744
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,500
We should make sure they're the people.

745
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500
Okay.

746
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,500
I'll just say goodbye.

747
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,500
Wait for the staff.

748
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,500
We have to leave now.

749
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,500
Let's go.

750
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,500
You go first.

751
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,500
I'll follow you.

752
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,500
Thank you.

753
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,500
Good job.

754
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
Gongju?

755
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,500
He's not a person I can't contact.

756
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,500
Was he having a hard time preparing for the restaurant?

757
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
I'm sure he is.

758
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,500
He's from a rich family.

759
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,500
He's not here. He's not here.

760
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,500
I think the owner of the restaurant left it.

761
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,500
It seems like there's a kitchen knife and a sauce container.

762
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,500
Give it to me.

763
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
I'll come find it if I need it.

764
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,500
You'll need it for work.

765
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,500
Okay.

766
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Is this Ahn Sangtae?

767
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,500
Why is Ahn Sangtae in my house?

768
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,500
I don't know, but the head of the department is busy these days.

769
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,500
I don't know what the legal team is saying.

770
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,500
The legal team?

771
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
Watch your back.

772
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,500
Someone's going to hit you.

773
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,500
Watch out!

774
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
Watch out!

775
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
Honey,

776
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,500
this dress code and color are totally my style.

777
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,500
I have a crush on someone, so don't wear it.

778
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,500
Kim Dali?

779
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Yes.

780
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,500
What? Who says I like someone?

781
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,500
I'm not.

782
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,500
What do I do?

783
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,500
Kim Dali thinks she likes him.

784
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,500
Really?

785
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
Really?

786
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,500
So?

787
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,500
It's a lie.

788
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,500
Dali.

789
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,500
What kind of person is that?

790
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,500
She did all that.

791
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
Why are you avoiding me?

792
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,500
Why would I?

793
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,500
I won't answer your call.

794
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,500
You disappeared without a word in the opening.

795
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,500
Do you know how many times I called you?

796
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,500
Do you know how worried I was?

797
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,500
I've been busy lately.

798
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,500
You're here to eat, right?

799
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,500
Get up. I'll buy you something delicious.

800
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,500
Do you want to go to bed?

801
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,500
Hey, I'm sorry.

802
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,500
I was surprised to hear something weird all of a sudden.

803
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,500
Are you okay?

804
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,500
Is it weird to ask you to sleep while you're dating?

805
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,500
Did we date?

806
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,500
When?

807
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,500
I told you I liked you.

808
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,500
You introduced me to your dad.

809
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:47,500
Hey, if we dated like that, I'd be...

810
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,500
I'm already in a bad situation.

811
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,500
The king of chairs.

812
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,500
I know.

813
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,500
Don't notice it, but finish me off.

814
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,500
I'm not curious.

815
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,500
I'd say 14 is too much.

816
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,500
So don't do anything crazy.

817
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,500
Why did you date me?

818
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,500
Didn't you ever think about

819
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,500
kissing me and sleeping with me?

820
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,500
I never thought about that.

821
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,500
You and I are so...

822
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,500
You and I have a line that we can't cross.

823
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,500
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

824
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,500
Then...

825
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,500
Do you like me?

826
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,500
No, no, it's fine.

827
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,500
Don't say anything.

828
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,500
Wake up in five minutes.

829
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,500
I'll kill you if you follow me.

830
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Geez.

831
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,500
Joon-kyu.

832
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,500
Hey.

833
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,500
Geez.

834
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,500
I don't know how I...

835
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,500
I don't know how I made you misunderstand,

836
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,500
but if I did, I'd apologize. I'm sorry.

837
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,500
And just in case you misunderstand,

838
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,500
I'll make it clear.

839
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,500
There's someone I like.

840
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,500
So don't ever do this again.

841
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,500
You jerk.

842
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,500
Did you have to say that in front of me?

843
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,500
I told you not to say it.

844
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,500
I told you to wake up in five minutes.

845
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,500
I told you not to say it.

846
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,500
Don't you know that even if you don't want to hear it?

847
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,500
You should have at least been aware of it.

848
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,500
Since when did you start to work so cleanly?

849
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,500
Do you have to make me miserable like this?

850
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,500
Did you grow up so well?

851
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,500
I'm sorry.

852
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,500
What did I say?

853
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,500
What did I say?

854
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,500
Okay.

855
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,500
What did I say?

856
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,500
What did I say?

857
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,500
What did I say?

858
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,500
Hey.

859
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,500
Today?

860
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,500
It's the place where we sponsor the art gallery.

861
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,500
Of course I have to go.

862
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,500
I'm sorry.

863
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,500
Why?

864
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,500
You eat this kind of food well.

865
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,500
This kind of food?

866
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,500
I thought I'd need it

867
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,500
to feel good sometimes.

868
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,500
It's a good restaurant.

869
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,500
What about the others?

870
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,500
They said something happened all of a sudden.

871
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,500
They said they'll get back to work when they're free.

872
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,500
I'm the only one who's here

873
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,500
because I'm the only one who can tell you this.

874
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,500
Clean up the studio.

875
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,500
There are eight of us. I think two or three of them will be here.

876
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,500
The meal is ready.

877
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,500
Thank you.

878
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,500
Thank you.

879
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,500
Thank you.

880
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
How much is the potato?

881
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,500
It's the second-rate.

882
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,500
You have to put in a lot.

883
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,500
Aren't you going in?

884
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,500
Where?

885
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,500
The art gallery director is here.

886
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,500
He's not a good guy.

887
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,500
The color...

888
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,500
The potato in the potato soup

889
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,500
isn't the potato we eat.

890
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,500
Did you know it's called bone-cut?

891
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,500
Really? I didn't know.

892
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,500
I didn't know.

893
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,500
They say it started with the pork bones

894
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,500
that were thrown away in the US military when they were in prison.

895
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,500
I see.

896
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,500
It's a food that goes well with a person like Jinmoo.

897
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,500
What?

898
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:04,500
It's a great ingredient that almost turned into a trash.

899
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,500
I think he's a great person.

900
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,500
He has a lot to learn.

901
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,500
From the bottom...

902
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,500
To this degree of success,

903
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,500
we probably have made many choices

904
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
that we can't even imagine.

905
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,500
Whether you want it or not,

906
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,500
you're taking someone's blood and tears.

907
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,500
What do you want to say?

908
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Dondon's F&B

909
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,500
is buying the art gallery's land illegally.

910
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,500
Do you know?

911
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,500
What?

912
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,500
After your father died,

913
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,500
they're buying the land that doesn't matter

914
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,500
whether it's the location or the price.

915
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,500
They're even buying the construction company

916
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,500
that's been destroyed by the war.

917
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,500
Dallae.

918
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,500
You...

919
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,500
treat others as your friends

920
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,500
because you treat them as your friends.

921
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,500
Do you know a lot about Jinmoo?

922
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,500
Can I trust you?

923
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,500
You're a good person.

924
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,500
You're right.

925
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,500
The fried rice is here.

926
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,500
Thank you.

927
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,500
Why didn't you answer my call?

928
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,500
Did you think I did something bad

929
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,500
to make an excuse?

930
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,500
Are you saying you're going to give up that money?

931
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,500
Princess Na, I guess it wasn't a simple thing.

932
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,500
What's wrong with you?

933
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,500
Why are you looking for me so desperately?

934
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,500
This is all I can say to you.

935
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,500
I'll be working for a while.

936
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,500
Don't you know who's on your side?

937
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,500
Why aren't you going to touch me?

938
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,500
I'm ready.

939
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,500
Why aren't you going to touch me?

940
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,500
Tell me when you're ready.

941
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,500
Who says I'm not ready?

942
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,500
I'm totally ready.

943
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,500
I feel at ease.
