1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
You are so guttural.

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,380
What do you mean by money?

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,060
What's having all this trouble?

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,520
It's all about money.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,220
Was it not for you?

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,480
You throws away the false image

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,180
You threw away the mess,

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,080
and even ran to the hotel to run away from it.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,280
You came running from the morning

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,780
and pretended to be worried.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,280
It's all because of money.

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,380
Isn't it?

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,380
Isn't it?

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,380
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,380
I'm not good at it.

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,780
Then why would I come to your house?

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,380
I only have money that was given to you by Kim Dal-shik.

18
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,580
So don't make the rich feel bad.

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,980
Please protect yourself

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,280
and yourself.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,180
Don't risk your life for money.

22
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,880
You're a very expensive woman.

23
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,780
You're not even a celebrity.

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,280
You don't know who you're dating,

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,780
where you're sleeping, or what you're doing.

26
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,880
I'm telling you again.

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,780
Don't even touch a hair until you pay me back.

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,480
I won't stay still then.

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,880
How can you just let this go?

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,180
The writer will be furious if she reads this.

31
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,780
What's the deal with this reporter, Min Sook-an?

32
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,380
What's wrong with you?

33
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,280
What's the point of writing this ridiculous article?

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,780
It's not wrong to read it.

35
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,780
What?

36
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,980
I mean,

37
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,580
she must've written it because she thought

38
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,180
she could make it up without the reporter.

39
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,080
By the way, who's the guy who can't be in this newspaper?

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,280
It's not Jang Taejin.

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,980
It's the guy who was with Min Sook-an

42
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,480
when she was in prison.

43
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,380
That's not what a man who's in trouble says.

44
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,380
Why can't you say that?

45
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,180
It's been so long since he was injured.

46
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,880
He's been in the death row.

47
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,080
And he's a very urgent man.

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,280
He's the head of the General Secretary.

49
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,580
What's the use of a hotel?

50
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,880
Was he that urgent?

51
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,980
Mr. Song Kyu.

52
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,580
Yes.

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,480
Yes, Ms. Han.

54
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Is there anything you need me to do?

55
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,280
The banner and poster for this exhibition are out, right?

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,780
Yes, but we still need to fix it.

57
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,180
You can continue with the fix.

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,980
And print out a few copies of the ones that are out.

59
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,580
It doesn't matter how complete they are.

60
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,180
All you need is the space logo and the image.

61
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,280
Why do you need that?

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,380
I need to open up a press conference.

63
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,780
What?

64
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,880
I'll send you the email myself.

65
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,680
Send me the email address of the press.

66
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,480
Yes, ma'am. But...

67
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,080
Will you be okay?

68
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,180
What do you mean?

69
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,780
Because of the article that came out today...

70
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,480
I think you'll be more involved in your personal life

71
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,180
than the exhibition.

72
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,880
You should do it after you calm down.

73
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,280
That's why I'm doing it.

74
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
What?

75
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
I want to make it look like

76
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,280
you need a creative and unique idea.

77
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,380
The poor cleaner's bad luck.

78
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,580
I think this will be enough to get you into trouble.

79
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,580
It's also...

80
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,080
Very selective.

81
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,580
Seungi, you were in such a hurry.

82
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,380
Did you hear that?

83
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
What?

84
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,780
When did you get here?

85
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
A little later.

86
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,280
I ran here because I was worried about the article.

87
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,080
I was waiting for you because you were a good customer.

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,080
I don't have to worry about you.

89
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,480
You know how much I liked the art gallery at this hour, right?

90
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,980
You said that.

91
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,080
The time when the paintings woke up and slept well is the most brilliant.

92
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,880
It was a privilege to enjoy you in love.

93
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,580
It's been five years.

94
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,880
Then take your time and look around.

95
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Let go of this.

96
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,780
I'm just passing by you and acting like I'm passing by.

97
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,380
I don't have time to be a nuisance.

98
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,580
What should I do for you?

99
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,180
Should I pay you back the bank?

100
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,380
Should I make that reporter my boss?

101
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,880
If you get caught,

102
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,180
I'll never be able to see the sunlight again.

103
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,180
Just tell me.

104
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,580
Can you really do all that?

105
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
Do you think I'm just saying that?

106
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
No.

107
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,880
I think I can do it.

108
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,280
That's why I look so great.

109
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,180
It's a little strange.

110
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,680
I said I'd do anything for you.

111
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,480
Then do it for me.

112
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
Okay.

113
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,680
So many people are here.

114
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,380
The views have gone up.

115
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,880
Are you sure about the purpose?

116
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,880
It's only been a day or two since we started.

117
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,280
But don't you feel a bit nervous?

118
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,180
It's a press conference about the exhibition,

119
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,180
so I thought you'd do noise marketing.

120
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,080
You didn't even put up posters.

121
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,380
Are you giving up the exhibition?

122
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,880
I'm Kim Dali, the new director of the Cheongsong Art Gallery.

123
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,480
I'm sorry to bother you

124
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,880
who have been loving our gallery

125
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,680
because of the recent incident.

126
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,780
As the article says,

127
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,080
after my father passed away,

128
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,380
I had a hard time with the Cheongsong Art Gallery.

129
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,480
But the difficulty of the art gallery

130
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,980
is not something that happened yesterday.

131
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,280
I'm doing my best to sort out my mistakes

132
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,780
and make things right.

133
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,480
And the great people around me

134
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,280
are helping me a lot.

135
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,680
From now on, the Cheongsong family

136
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,080
will make the art gallery

137
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,480
as peaceful as they dreamed.

138
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,280
I promise I'll do my best.

139
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,980
I heard you were raped. How are you feeling?

140
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,180
I'm fine.

141
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,580
Please take off your sunglasses.

142
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,880
Who was with you at the motel?

143
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,180
I don't think I have any reason to question

144
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,880
your privacy.

145
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,580
Were you hurt by the man you were with?

146
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,580
I'll say no comment.

147
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,380
If you're going to do this,

148
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,980
why did you bring up the reporter?

149
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
What's going on?

150
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,280
What?

151
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Hey!

152
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,680
You're alone!

153
00:10:50,980 --> 00:11:15,680
What...

154
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
Thank you.

155
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,180
Thank you.

156
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,620
Excuse me.

157
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,180
Where is this place?

158
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,580
It's a photo card.

159
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,700
Is this a

160
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,220
photo card?

161
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,660
They're so pretty.

162
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,000
Are they really pretty?

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,760
Isn't there a store?

164
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,860
I love it.

165
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,060
Sir.

166
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,700
Did you see this?

167
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,780
From 1st to 10th, it's all clean.

168
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,220
It's not a dream, is it?

169
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,880
Is it a dream?

170
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,180
What's wrong?

171
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,920
It's not a dream.

172
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
It's not a dream.

173
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
It hurts so much.

174
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
It hurts.

175
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,260
What if we go crazy

176
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,660
at this exhibition?

177
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,100
We'll know when we try.

178
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,600
What do you mean, we'll know?

179
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,800
You can't fool me.

180
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,700
This is no ordinary day.

181
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,700
I hope you can work all day long.

182
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,180
Can I change the spelling?

183
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,080
Of course.

184
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,880
If you tell me what you want,

185
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,680
I'll give it to you in a week.

186
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
No.

187
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,420
Please do it in two hours.

188
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,120
With the ring and the earring.

189
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,420
What? In two hours?

190
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,260
One, two, one, two, three, four.

191
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,220
We'll end it here today.

192
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,420
Thank you.

193
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,380
We'll end it here today.

194
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,520
Thank you.

195
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
Thank you.

196
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
Okay.

197
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Thank you.

198
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,200
You did a great job today.

199
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,840
Did we do anything?

200
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,400
You did a great job.

201
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,500
How did the audience react?

202
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,740
It's a mess.

203
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,040
It's the first time that our museum

204
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,680
has ranked us so high for an exhibition.

205
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,680
Maybe.

206
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
It'll be two days if we wait.

207
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,720
It won't end with a simple fake.

208
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,380
There's something that can lead people

209
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,640
to be happy.

210
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,540
Don't worry.

211
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,940
If we end the start well and

212
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,740
finish the exhibition without any problems,

213
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,780
it'll be a problem if it gets on the news.

214
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,380
You have to be so good to know.

215
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Ms. Song.

216
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,320
What are you doing here?

217
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
The work is just coming in.

218
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,120
You're too busy.

219
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,960
I was just about to leave.

220
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
Ms. Song.

221
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,360
The reporter...

222
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,420
You can't even write an article?

223
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,420
What?

224
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,060
Okay. I'll sort things out and go in.

225
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,060
Ms. Kim.

226
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,840
You have to get your act together.

227
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,340
She's not a simple woman.

228
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,000
She was just a coward and got caught.

229
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
She's just lucky.

230
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,700
You're right.

231
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,640
Ms. Song.

232
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,300
I'm hoping you're not leaving yet.

233
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,440
I'm sure you have a story you want to tell me.

234
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,180
Instead of what the reporters talk about,

235
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,560
you brought up a case

236
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,220
containing an Mansourianย exhibition.

237
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,960
This was made to promote this project.

238
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,500
It's very broad.

239
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,100
You don't have to go to the lawsuit.

240
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,700
Please stop by when the exhibition opens.

241
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,300
I'll guide you then.

242
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,700
As you wish.

243
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,400
Excuse me.

244
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm just passing by.

245
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,000
Without a lawsuit.

246
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,300
Of course. Don't worry.

247
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
By the way,

248
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,200
please call me when you write an article next time.

249
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
You shouldn't get in trouble again

250
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
because of the wrong reporter.

251
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,200
Okay. Let's do that.

252
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,000
Darn it.

253
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,000
Darn it.

254
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,600
Ma'am.

255
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,100
Did you see this?

256
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,800
What is it?

257
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,000
It's a mess.

258
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,300
Kim Dali's necklace, Kim Dali's dress, Kim Dali's ring.

259
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,500
It's all about Kim Dali.

260
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,200
Thanks to that, the exhibition is going well.

261
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,400
What's wrong with everyone?

262
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,300
How can they see the girl's photo

263
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,400
and the necklace and the dress?

264
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,200
They're not psychopaths.

265
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Didn't you order this?

266
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,700
What?

267
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,100
You went to the art gallery in the morning.

268
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,000
You're right.

269
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,100
The flow has changed in less than half a day.

270
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,600
It means there's a new technology.

271
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,700
Who would think that if it wasn't you?

272
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,400
It's hard to think that

273
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,200
you're not getting paid.

274
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,600
Do you think I'm that trash?

275
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,300
I'm the one who's standing in front of the camera

276
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,800
and counting the money.

277
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,700
I'm sorry for listening to you.

278
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,400
What I meant was

279
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,400
that you're in a desperate situation.

280
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
And you're the one who's...

281
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,700
Okay. Go and do your work.

282
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,900
But...

283
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Yes?

284
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,400
Isn't something strange?

285
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,900
The article in the morning.

286
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,000
You're evaluating the quality of the art gallery

287
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,900
because it's been so long.

288
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,200
You've been trying to save money,

289
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,100
get a job, and even die.

290
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,700
The bank and the collaborators too.

291
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,700
I was fine when I lent them $2 million.

292
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,500
I got a good credit rating.

293
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,700
I mean, I thought something was strange too.

294
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,700
It's been a long time since I got a credit.

295
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,000
I've been in so many places.

296
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,700
There were so many rumors

297
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,800
that I'd be in the auction soon.

298
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,000
But after looking into it,

299
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,300
nothing has changed in terms of the actual amount.

300
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,400
For a murder art gallery,

301
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,000
I was still a generous fan of Cheongsong.

302
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,600
But as soon as Chief Kim Nakcheon passed away,

303
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,200
the attitude of the bank and collaborators

304
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,400
had changed 180 degrees.

305
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,400
It was like a promise.

306
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,200
They've been trading with Cheongsong

307
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,100
for 10 to 20 years.

308
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,000
Who's playing a prank on me?

309
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,100
Come in.

310
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,500
Hello, sir.

311
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,400
Hello. Come in.

312
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,500
This way.

313
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,800
Hello.

314
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,200
Politicians are so busy with their work.

315
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,300
They have to hide even when they're about to eat.

316
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
They don't even listen

317
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,500
when they're about to say a word.

318
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,000
This is...

319
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,200
Yes, that's right.

320
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,200
How can the moral standards

321
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,000
be different from the political standards?

322
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,000
This is discrimination too.

323
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,700
Korea is still far away.

324
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,400
It's so far away.

325
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,200
By the way, when will the green belt be released?

326
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,600
What?

327
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,100
What do you mean by the green belt?

328
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,300
What is that?

329
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,100
You're a man who only knows

330
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,500
the belt and the leather belt.

331
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,800
How dare you try to catch me?

332
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,300
I'm sorry. I think I was wrong.

333
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,800
You're so annoying.

334
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,600
I'm sorry.

335
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,300
Gosh.

336
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,200
I've never sold potato soup before,

337
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
so I don't know much about it.

338
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,000
Think of it as a lesson to me.

339
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,100
What's different about construction?

340
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,300
A soldier who's about to go to war

341
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,300
can just take care of his bullets.

342
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,200
A man who has to do something big...

343
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,600
Can't be too small.

344
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,700
You understand what I'm saying, right?

345
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,300
Of course.

346
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Here.

347
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,600
It's an honor.

348
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,800
Gosh.

349
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,300
The area I'm running on

350
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,100
is in a state of 365 days.

351
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,700
Oh, my.

352
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,500
How's the area going?

353
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,700
Oh, yes.

354
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,600
Eunhong.

355
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,500
Yes.

356
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,700
What happened?

357
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,600
You were busy writing all day long.

358
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,200
Did you get a sense of art?

359
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Don't say that.

360
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,700
I'm going crazy.

361
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,700
What about the item?

362
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,900
I don't think

363
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,100
I missed anything.

364
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,500
Nothing special.

365
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,400
It doesn't even have a name on it.

366
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,300
You think you'll come here again

367
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,200
if you don't have one?

368
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,400
I won't tell you.

369
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,500
What will you do if you get caught by the police?

370
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,900
If you get caught,

371
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,700
you're the one who's going to die.

372
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,100
You should know that.

373
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
What?

374
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,700
Are you kidding me?

375
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
Do you think I'm the only one who's going to get hurt?

376
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
Do you think I can see anything?

377
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,200
Who are you to tell me

378
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,600
to clean up my mess?

379
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,900
That's why you should look for it.

380
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,600
Why are you so angry, you lowly scumbag?

381
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,900
Let's find a way.

382
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,900
Forget it.

383
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,200
We just have to make her give up on art.

384
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Don't you think so?

385
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,900
What?

386
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,900
Are you here?

387
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Please eat.

388
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,700
What?

389
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,900
You're a loser!

390
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,500
What's wrong with being a loser?

391
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,400
You can't get a yellow wig if you're just a developer.

392
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,800
You're all the same.

393
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,900
It's not easy to get a spoon.

394
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,900
Isn't that right, Ki Cheol?

395
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,500
Of course.

396
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,500
It's a secret, so it's not well known.

397
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,900
But it's much bigger than I expected.

398
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,700
You're going to do that without my knowledge?

399
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,000
That's not possible.

400
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,200
If you ask me and I say it's okay...

401
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,800
You scumbag!

402
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,300
Are you the president of the financial department?

403
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,400
You're just a potato soup maker.

404
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Why would you ask me about the construction?

405
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,900
Now that Ki Cheol is in power,

406
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,000
the head of the company will be turned upside down.

407
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,500
What did I do wrong?

408
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,800
I told you that I wanted to show Ki Cheol

409
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,700
to An Sangtae's daughter.

410
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,900
But he just let a dumb girl out and got kicked out.

411
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,800
What?

412
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,200
Did I say something wrong?

413
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,500
If he had done well

414
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,200
and had just married An Sangtae's daughter,

415
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,400
things wouldn't have been this hard.

416
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,600
He would've been a loser.

417
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
That's not what I meant.

418
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,700
I don't know!

419
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,600
If you don't push Ki Cheol out of the hospital,

420
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,900
I'll divorce him and split the assets.

421
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,000
I'll split the assets and push Ki Cheol

422
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,900
with that money.

423
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,500
What do you mean?

424
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,200
Push him out?

425
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,300
What are you...

426
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,400
What?

427
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
What?

428
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
What?

429
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,900
What do you mean?

430
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
I'm pushing him out.

431
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,100
You're still not old enough to take a bath.

432
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,700
Go take a bath now!

433
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,300
I'm taking a bath.

434
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,800
I'm taking a bath.

435
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,300
I'm taking a bath.

436
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,000
By the way, what's going on?

437
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,000
Father said

438
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,600
that there are more than one or two places

439
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,200
that aim to open a clean-up museum.

440
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,600
What did he say?

441
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,800
It looks delicious.

442
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,700
What?

443
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,600
Did I say that?

444
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,900
I'm sure you heard that because

445
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,000
you're so lazy.

446
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What can I say if I'm just asking for money?

447
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,800
Right?

448
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,100
Of course.

449
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,400
Of course.

450
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Of course.

451
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,300
There must be something.

452
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,100
It's really good.

453
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,900
Did he eat something?

454
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,200
I should know where he lives to find out.

455
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,300
Eat slowly. You'll get drunk.

456
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,200
Eat some soup.

457
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,400
Didn't you have lunch?

458
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,600
I don't have time for that.

459
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
I ran around looking for reporters,

460
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,200
took pictures, and did interviews.

461
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,400
I set up the set for the drama.

462
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,200
I was so busy.

463
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
I was so busy.

464
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
I was so busy.

465
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,200
I set up the set for the drama.

466
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,500
I was so busy.

467
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,700
But the problem is...

468
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,300
I'm going to get busier.

469
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,200
Do you think the exhibition will be a hit?

470
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm glad. I was worried.

471
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,700
Worried?

472
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,000
It's not easy to be exposed to the public.

473
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,900
You were being rude to me.

474
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,600
And I saw the footage of the incident.

475
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,600
You don't have to be rude.

476
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,000
And I realized that this was the right thing to do.

477
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,800
I look so good in pictures, right?

478
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,100
You looked ugly.

479
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,100
I'll stop eating.

480
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,900
I have a small appetite.

481
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,200
I'm done.

482
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,300
This place is good.

483
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,300
It's a small house.

484
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,300
It's like a four-person house.

485
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,300
Oh?

486
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,700
It's Don Don Potato Soup. I know this place.

487
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,200
You're talking nonsense.

488
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,300
How do you know this place?

489
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,700
I'm serious. I know this place.

490
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,700
By the way, aren't you mad?

491
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
What?

492
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,800
I know you didn't catch the criminal.

493
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,200
You said you got the phone.

494
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,100
Why would I be mad?

495
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,300
I should be thankful,

496
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,000
but I'm just pretending not to know because I'm shameless.

497
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,200
I can't even pay you back.

498
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,300
Hey.

499
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,300
I lent you money because I had a small amount.

500
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,500
Don't be too hard on yourself.

501
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,100
If you catch the criminal, I'll pay you back.

502
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,600
Oh.

503
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,400
You're so reliable because you're a Korean public official.

504
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,000
I'll clean this up.

505
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,200
No, no. Do you want to?

506
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,000
No.

507
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,700
I don't have much time.

508
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,800
No, no, no.

509
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,300
This isn't right either.

510
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,500
Don't you have anything?

511
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,700
You're not thinking at all,

512
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,300
and then you just...

513
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,700
You just think of it for a moment and just...

514
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,700
You just throw it like this.

515
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,200
I...

516
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,000
Dalri.

517
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I like you.

518
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,000
Oh, my.

519
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,300
This isn't right.

520
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,300
I almost got in trouble.

521
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,000
I like you.

522
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,400
I like you, Dalri.

523
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,400
What do I do?

524
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,700
Hey, calm down.

525
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,000
It's okay.

526
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,600
You can overcome this.

527
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,800
Here.

528
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,800
I'm still shy.

529
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,700
Oh, no.

530
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,500
Why?

531
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,600
What should I do?

532
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,300
What is it?

533
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,500
Why isn't she replying?

534
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,800
Am I sleeping?

535
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,300
At this hour?

536
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,700
What should I do?

537
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,400
Oh, no.

538
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,200
Is she really into him?

539
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,400
Oh, my.

540
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,200
Is she crazy? Why would I like her?

541
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,000
She's a princess.

542
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,200
Oh, no.

543
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,600
No problem.

544
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,800
Oh, no.

545
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
What?

546
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
What?

547
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,240
My gosh.

548
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,280
What are you doing? You're not answering my calls.

549
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,480
I'm working on something important.

550
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,320
Just try to get caught. I'll get you out of here.

551
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Mr. Cha,

552
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,220
hey tree!

553
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,180
What is this.

554
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,900
Thank you.

555
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,380
I like you, Dalri.

556
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,980
I'm missing the fish sashimi.

557
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,520
Fish sashimi?

558
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,780
You know it's a fish cake, right?

559
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,680
It's real.

560
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,420
You could ask me that in one night.

561
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,780
It's not a national secret that I like fish sashimi.

562
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,060
Are you sleeping?

563
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,060
I'm not a weirdo.

564
00:34:51,800 --> 00:35:01,800
I want to give it to you.

565
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Oh, why?

566
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,080
Use this for a while.

567
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,440
What's this?

568
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,760
You said your credit card was blocked.

569
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,240
You should at least live your life.

570
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,800
It's okay.

571
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,140
I found out that the minimum living expenses

572
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,500
are saved and put together.

573
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,440
I don't know what will happen, so just leave it.

574
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,480
What's your limit?

575
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,720
What?

576
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,220
Are you really going to be okay?

577
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,060
You're a Korean civil servant,

578
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,120
but I'm not the type of woman who goes shopping for luxury goods.

579
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,160
I buy shoes for the living expenses of a family of citizens.

580
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,440
Are you really going to be okay, Detective Ju Hantak?

581
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,440
Whatever.

582
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,740
Just do what you want.

583
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,140
Should I stayf tener until I die?

584
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:28,440
What?

585
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,240
What is it?

586
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:48,240
You said you were going to the exhibition the day after tomorrow.

587
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:58,440
What?

588
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Oh, my.

589
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,440
How much is this?

590
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,440
The museum is running well.

591
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:15,440
Oh, my.

592
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
Hello, sir.

593
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
Hello, Mr. Shin.

594
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
Hello.

595
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
Hello.

596
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Nice to meet you, too.

597
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:34,440
Hello, Mr. Shin.

598
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:44,440
Hello.

599
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Let's go.

600
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:44,440
Mr. Shin.

601
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Why are you here?

602
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:56,440
What?

603
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:06,440
Oh, my.

604
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:12,440
No matter how angry people are, they're not like that.

605
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,440
Do you know what makes me feel the worst when I text?

606
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,440
It's my work schedule.

607
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
You texted me yesterday, right?

608
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,440
I checked too late and couldn't contact you.

609
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Did you wait for me?

610
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Did you wait for me?

611
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,440
No, I'm not a person who has nothing to do.

612
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,440
Why would I wait for that?

613
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,440
I like fish and I can ask you during the night.

614
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,440
My food is not a national secret.

615
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,440
I don't think you're a weird person.

616
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,440
Did you answer?

617
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,440
Yeah, well, yeah.

618
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,440
But why did you sleep here?

619
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,440
I fell asleep while I was working early.

620
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
I couldn't sleep last night.

621
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Why?

622
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,440
That's because...

623
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,440
The upstairs was so noisy.

624
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,440
I heard the noise from the floor was serious.

625
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:47,440
There are people who are not considerate of the community.

626
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,440
Are you okay?

627
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,440
What do you mean?

628
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,440
I think it was a long day yesterday.

629
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,440
I'm sorry about yesterday.

630
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
You came running because you were worried,

631
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,440
but I just got angry.

632
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,440
I guess you're more comfortable with me now.

633
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,440
You're not so grumpy.

634
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,440
I apologize.

635
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Well, you can do that in life.

636
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,440
Why do you have to apologize?

637
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,440
You can call me anytime. I'll take it all.

638
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,440
It's not like you're making money.

639
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
What?

640
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,440
What?

641
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,440
Sir, we're in trouble.

642
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,440
I think you should go with us.

643
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Sir, we're in trouble.

644
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,440
I think you should go with us.

645
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
You're driving me crazy.

646
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,440
I can't even get a car for you.

647
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,440
Who took this truck?

648
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
You're driving me crazy.

649
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
I hope the ghost doesn't come.

650
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,440
Where is it?

651
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,440
It's not here.

652
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,440
It's not here?

653
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,440
I'm so sorry.

654
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
I'm sorry.

655
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,440
Gosh.

656
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,440
How could he take only his work?

657
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,440
It's a series of dead and alive.

658
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,440
It's the most famous one here.

659
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,440
It's the Biennale award.

660
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,440
Is there a basement or a secret room?

661
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,440
Yes, I checked.

662
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,440
It's a famous work, so no one can answer.

663
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,440
Someone must have done it.

664
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,440
They did it to ruin our exhibition.

665
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
Gongju.

666
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
Yes?

667
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,440
What did the security guard say?

668
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,440
He said it earlier.

669
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
Yes.

670
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,440
He said there was no other evidence.

671
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,440
He said he was on patrol as usual

672
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,440
and didn't see anything suspicious.

673
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,440
What should we do?

674
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,440
The writer will be here soon.

675
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,440
They're good.

676
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,440
They're good.

677
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,440
The tail of the museum is very sharp.

678
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,440
When do you all stop doing art

679
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,440
and stop taking care of your work?

680
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,440
You all say you're a famous writer.

681
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,440
You say you're an art that's unrecognizable

682
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,440
and that you can't be paid for.

683
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,440
Our youngest chef who cooks gamjatang

684
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,440
doesn't care about the ingredients.

685
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,440
He's a good cook.

686
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,440
He doesn't care about the ingredients.

687
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,440
He checks the expiration date every hour

688
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,440
and checks if the freezer is locked

689
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440
two or three times.

690
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
Are you all that professional?

691
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,440
How can you say you're paying for it?

692
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,440
Excuse me.

693
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,440
Why don't we check the CCTV?

694
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,440
I've done a good job.

695
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,440
Okay.

696
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,440
What are you doing?

697
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,440
What are you doing?

698
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,440
What's wrong?

699
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,440
It's you. It's you, right?

700
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,440
What's wrong?

701
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,440
I was helping my daughter

702
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,440
because the museum was so messy.

703
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,440
How can you leave trash at the exhibition

704
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,440
in a museum?

705
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,440
You can't even understand what I'm thinking.

706
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,440
This is just trash.

707
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,440
Why are you asking me?

708
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,440
Why do you keep asking me

709
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,440
if this is trash or art?

710
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,440
Am I the only one who's weird?

711
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,440
Am I the only one who's disgusting?

712
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,440
Mister, you know how I feel, right?

713
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,440
Tell me.

714
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,440
Do you think this is art too?

715
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,440
No, it's not that.

716
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,440
Why can't you say that trash is trash?

717
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,440
What trash?

718
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,440
Trash?

719
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,440
Why is there a Vienna sausage here?

720
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,440
You're amazing. I'm so frustrated.

721
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,440
This is called an object.

722
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,440
Don't you know what art is?

723
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,440
Didn't you hear what I said?

724
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,440
You should've stayed quiet.

725
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,440
You should've paid for it.

726
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,440
You're so annoying.

727
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,440
Mister.

728
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,440
I don't know anything else,

729
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,440
but I can't stand you insulting art.

730
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,440
How could you throw yourself into the water

731
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,440
and get yourself into the water?

732
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,440
Hold on.

733
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,440
They're the worst at pooping.

734
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,440
What?

735
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,440
Mister.

736
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,440
Is this what art is?

737
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,440
Is this what art is?

738
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,440
If I'd thought art was this easy,

739
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,440
I shouldn't have cooked potato soup

740
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,440
but made art.

741
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,440
No, it's not.

742
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,440
No, it's not.

743
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,440
No, it's not.

744
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,440
Come to think of it,

745
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,440
I was doing art when I didn't know.

746
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,440
There are a lot of things like that.

747
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,440
Tearing clothes, torn sneakers,

748
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,440
and a bone left over from eating.

749
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,440
Do you want me to make one for you?

750
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,440
You saw art, right?

751
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,440
Do you want me to make one for you again?

752
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,440
Do you want me to clean your poop?

753
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,440
Why? Can't you poop?

754
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,440
Please stop.

755
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,440
I'm sorry, sir.

756
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,440
Something that shouldn't have happened

757
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,440
was not my fault.

758
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,440
I have to do something about this...

759
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,440
Don't touch.

760
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,440
Yes, sir.

761
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,440
I can't believe it's clean.

762
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,440
Wait.

763
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,440
Wait.

764
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,440
Wait.

765
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,440
Sir!

766
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,440
Please.

767
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,440
Please let me go.

768
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,440
How should I apologize?

769
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,440
I know you won't be able to calm down,

770
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,440
but please think of our relationship.

771
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,440
Ms. Kim Dalri.

772
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,440
Yes?

773
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,440
I really liked your father.

774
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,440
He held my first exhibition here in Cheongsong.

775
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,440
He introduced my work abroad.

776
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,440
He was your father.

777
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,440
Even if it wasn't a personal relationship,

778
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,440
among the people who are busy

779
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,440
with the name of artists in our country,

780
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,440
none of them didn't see your father's work.

781
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,440
So you waited for me

782
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,440
for another month

783
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,440
without saying a word

784
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,440
even though the exhibition was delayed.

785
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,440
I know that.

786
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,440
Yes!

787
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,440
There are always changes when the exhibition is held.

788
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,440
But don't you think this is really wrong?

789
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,440
What?

790
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,440
What?

791
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,440
A chicken that's eaten by a chicken?

792
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,440
A chicken that's pooped?

793
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,440
I think I've been insulted

794
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,440
more than once in my life.

795
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,440
Don't say anything.

796
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,440
Don't say anything.

797
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,440
My blood-like works are more precious

798
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,440
than my life.

799
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,440
I'll send them back to you as they were yesterday.

800
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,440
If you touch any of them,

801
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,440
I'll make sure you can't open the exhibition!

802
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,440
Ms. Kim.

803
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,440
Don't do this!

804
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,440
Ms. Kim.

805
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,440
Ms. Kim.

806
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,440
Ms. Kim.

807
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,440
Ms. Kim.

808
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,440
Ms. Kim.

809
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,440
Ms. Kim.

810
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,440
Ms. Kim.

811
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,440
Please!

812
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,440
Please help Ms. Kim!

813
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,440
Please help Ms. Kim!

814
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,440
Mr. Kim!

815
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,440
Mr. Kim!

816
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,440
Mr. Kim!

817
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,440
The World Department Store

818
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,440
has become a place where Kim Dali's fans live.

819
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,440
They're saying that we should sign

820
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,440
a contract with Jewelry.

821
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,440
You're saying no?

822
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,440
Of course.

823
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,440
And the loan shark I mentioned earlier.

824
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,440
It's not a loan shark.

825
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,440
It's Don Don F&B,

826
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,440
a franchise store that's quite large

827
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,440
and a real-life representative.

828
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,440
Don Don F&B?

829
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,440
It's famous for its sweet potatoes.

830
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,440
It's growing rapidly and expanding its business.

831
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,440
Don Don F&B 25th Street

832
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
By the way,

833
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,440
don't garden the Law Kyong familiarization.

834
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,440
What?

835
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,440
We spoke up for Dali,

836
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,440
but we can't call that aged.

837
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,440
I heard Ms. Song wrote that

838
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,440
Ms. Im is the new secretary.

839
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,440
I'm guessing something's up.

840
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,440
Is it something that should be watchful?

841
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,440
Wait!

842
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,440
Stop, please!

843
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,440
I'm sorry.

844
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,440
I was too obvious.

845
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,640
I'm An Chakki from the gallery.

846
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,280
She's An Sangtae's daughter.

847
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,480
Please get the car ready,

848
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,080
and you can leave.

849
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,280
Please sit.

850
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,240
I'm sorry.

851
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,240
I'm the only one who can help you meet the director.

852
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,780
I had to show my only ability to meet you.

853
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,640
Your only ability?

854
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,580
You say meeting your parents is an ability too.

855
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,280
When I say I'm the daughter of a congressman,

856
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,880
they don't stop me.

857
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,180
It means that the employees are not at fault.

858
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,080
You're brave, but you're also a child.

859
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,840
What's your condition?

860
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,240
I have a contract left,

861
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,440
and I want to know why you suddenly quit.

862
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,740
Is it because of the gallery?

863
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,440
Or is it because you're not related to my father?

864
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,940
Why do you keep dragging your father into this?

865
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,140
The reason I signed the contract with the gallery

866
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,840
was because of my father.

867
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,980
Who said that?

868
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:56,940
That...

869
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:57,980
That line...

870
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,140
Did you say Chakki?

871
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,080
Do you know how dangerous it is

872
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,240
to make the person who says Chakki is the only one?

873
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,440
I'm just trying to change the concept of the opening.

874
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,740
The gallery doesn't have a place for that.

875
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,640
And...

876
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,940
This has nothing to do with you.

877
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,740
Okay?

878
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,740
If that's what you want, then it is.

879
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,880
If you don't mind,

880
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,640
can I ask you about the next contract?

881
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,340
I think the business is over.

882
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,780
Are you...

883
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,040
A sex worker?

884
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,540
I don't know. Why...

885
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,640
You're Kim Dali, right?

886
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,540
No, it's not that...

887
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,340
The jewelry you wore at the press conference

888
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,840
was a world-famous brand.

889
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,340
Are you two starting over?

890
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,240
Oh, is that why?

891
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,640
No, it's not that yet.

892
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,540
Why not?

893
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,140
Is it a bit too much for you?

894
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,240
Well, it's not...

895
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,640
That's weird.

896
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,540
That's a green light.

897
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,440
Green light?

898
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,640
I don't know anything else,

899
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,740
but I'm really fast in love.

900
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:18,140
Women don't like men...

901
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,440
I mean, I don't even look back.

902
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,740
The fact that you wore a world-famous jewelry

903
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,740
is a huge green light.

904
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,940
Green light?

905
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,640
I told you.

906
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,240
So don't give up and just get in.

907
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,240
Please.

908
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,440
Women don't have a business to get in.

909
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,840
I feel like you're not cheering for me.

910
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,540
You're cheering for yourself.

911
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,540
So what if I'm cheering for someone?

912
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,440
I just have to take over the company

913
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,840
and take over the company.

914
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,040
Good luck.

915
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,640
Green light.

916
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,640
Green light.

917
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,840
You're not picking up?

918
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,440
That's the writer's fault.

919
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,540
Leave it.

920
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,940
I'll be the only one who gets hurt if I don't.

921
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,540
Who's going to look after the trash?

922
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,540
I'll be the only one who gets hurt if I don't.

923
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,740
Who's going to look after the trash?

924
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,740
I'll be the only one who gets hurt if I don't.

925
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:56,740
Mr. Jin.

926
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,740
Yes?

927
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,940
I heard that...

928
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,340
you find out who's on your side after you hit the ground.

929
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,040
I thought about it for a while.

930
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,840
I thought about whether this was the ground

931
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,840
or whether this was the ground.

932
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,340
But I guess I still haven't reached the ground.

933
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,340
I don't know who's on my side or not.

934
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,640
You said that, right?

935
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,640
You need to have something to eat to be friends and family.

936
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,240
You're going to lose your food bowl,

937
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,840
but who's going to be there for you?

938
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,440
That's what people think.

939
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,640
That comforted me.

940
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,140
That's how the world is.

941
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,340
But you were there for me.

942
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,040
In fact,

943
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,540
no matter what the author's name was,

944
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,040
the only person who asked me to save the museum

945
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,340
was you.

946
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,640
But I really don't know anymore.

947
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,240
I don't know if you're on my side or not.

948
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,440
No.

949
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:15,640
I didn't know that well earlier.

950
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,040
Hello?

951
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,040
Get in. I'll take you on the way.

952
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,540
It's okay.

953
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,640
Get in.

954
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,940
The car is behind you.

955
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,940
I'll take my leave then.

956
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,440
What are you doing?

957
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,540
Where are you going?

958
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,340
I'm going to the museum.

959
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,840
Where are you going?

960
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:08,340
Please go to the southern police station.

961
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,540
Thank you.

962
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,740
I'll take care of the museum myself,

963
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:40,240
so don't worry too much.

964
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,740
Who are you worrying about?

965
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:59,340
I'm worried about you.

966
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,740
I'm worried about you.

967
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,140
What are you doing?

968
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,840
I'm not the one.

969
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,240
I'm not the one!

970
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,040
Be quiet.

971
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,040
Are you the police?

972
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,540
Do you have any evidence?

973
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,040
What are you doing?

974
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,240
Shut up, you punk.

975
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,740
Is it okay for the police to do this without evidence?

976
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,540
Be quiet.

977
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,740
Where are you?

978
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,140
Where are you?

979
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,640
Hey.

980
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,840
What's going on?

981
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,940
Hey, you punk!

982
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,240
You punk!

983
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,740
Kang Gwon!

984
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,240
You're going to get your ass kicked!

985
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,740
What?

986
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:43,040
I'm going to play a game and see who's the boss!

987
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,640
I'll show you who I am!

988
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,340
I'm the new guy. If you get caught,

989
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,140
I'll kill you!

990
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,740
Look at me.

991
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,540
What did you say?

992
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:00,940
What did you say?

993
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,640
Don't do it, Mr. Jin!

994
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:03,840
Don't do it.

995
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:11,340
You should've killed him back then.

996
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:02,340
I'm not a kid who grew up in a work of art.

997
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:04,640
You're really pooping!

998
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,540
Ms. Kim Dalri,

999
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,840
you're not as bad as you think you are.

1000
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,140
Why are you putting this on?

1001
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:09,840
Our Won Tak.

1002
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:10,740
Look at me.

1003
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:13,040
He keeps bothering me.

1004
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,140
If you get too much,

1005
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:17,940
that's not goodwill, but a goal.

1006
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,440
You're right about what you said.

1007
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,240
I'm not the one.

1008
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,840
I'm not the one.

1009
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,340
I'm not the one.

1010
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,840
I'm not the one.

1011
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,340
I know what you're saying is right.

1012
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,840
I'm here to clean up.

1013
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,940
I came here to see you happy.
