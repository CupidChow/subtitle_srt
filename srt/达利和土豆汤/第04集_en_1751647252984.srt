The Best Cooking Secrets

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It hurts! Let go of me!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm the boss, so I should let go too.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It hurts.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's talk.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Talk.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is an art gallery.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let go of me!

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
How much is this?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Who are you?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What are you doing?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Me?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm the new art gallery director.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What?

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How much do you have to pay for this?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Mother, here.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
$3,450. $280. $690.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What?

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You can pay for everything!

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's not the new art gallery.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
$1,550.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
$1,300.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
$4,500.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
$1,200.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's nice.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
As expected, the car is...

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a boy car.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's an all-grey car.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Last time, I saw you not liking a boy car.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
All-grey?

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You must be joking.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The new art gallery director.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm not joking.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I told you I'm a serious and quiet person.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Especially when it comes to money,

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I never lie.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What right do you have to be the art gallery director?

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You said you'd do whatever you wanted.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You said you'd accept any conditions.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You don't have to think it hard.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm just saying I'll earn my own money and take it.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Have you heard of temporary management?

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If the company becomes difficult,

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the book club will hire a professional entrepreneur.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I earn a lot of money.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The art gallery is not a place to earn money.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If you don't want to, give me $2 billion.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You don't have a lot of money,

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
so you're making a deal with people.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Do you have a book store?

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You don't have to set up an office.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll just use this.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll use this only. I won't touch anything else.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay?

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You look good.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What?

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Why won't you earn money?

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're a genius.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Anyway, I'm still full.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What are you trying to do?

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Do you think the chairman will stay put?

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Is there another way?

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He humiliated me and asked me to pay off his debt.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No, that's too ignorant.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's not my way.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's exactly what you do.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll pay off the debt.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's my way.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Then where are we going now?

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The new captain and others have a high rate of compensation.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The reward rate is high.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There are many opportunities to pay off the debt.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hurry up and join the Macau New Peking Entertainment City 772772.com

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What's going on?

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You can go to work at the restaurant from tomorrow.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Restaurant?

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I heard everyone was fine a few days ago.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't know why it's suddenly that day.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There are pictures on social media.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Everyone must have figured out the situation.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Anyway, will I get my monthly salary this month?

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I need to get it.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Can't you ask the world to help you?

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What are you talking about?

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Gong-ju.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What?

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I heard you were almost married.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Why are you talking about hypnosis?

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's worse than falling for a cheat.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
How did you get this art gallery?

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If I were a daughter,

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I would've begged my ex-husband for it.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I asked him to spare me once.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're saying that because you don't know

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
how much you've suffered because of the world?

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No matter how hard it was,

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
you couldn't even get the world's support.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Even if Director Jang Taejin came to beg,

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
you didn't even let him in.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
How could you say that after seeing all that?

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's not like what happened then and now.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I shouldn't have gotten the salary if I wasn't capable.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Ms. Kim, why are you standing there?

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Come in.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why are you all standing there?

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Come in.

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What is it?

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
About the Basquiat you mentioned last time...

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How much will the fee be if you cancel it?

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Cancel it?

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You think I'll let you?

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If you want to start with the urgent fee,

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
that's the only option.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Never.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The only thing that can be sold in Korea

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
is the pavat, and the Basquiat.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You can get a good deal without paying the promotion fee,

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and you can easily get a sponsorship.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It would be a huge deal to sell goods and streetwear.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You want me to give up on this?

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm starving right now.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't do that.

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
At least start looking for sponsors with me.

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You know all about our situation,

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and you've been in a relationship with Cheongsong.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You can't just ignore it.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Then hand over the documents about the Basquiat to me.

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We'll check how far it's been and then decide.

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
By the way, did Siyeong go to work?

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you want to go out for a drink with me?

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Why are you getting mad at me when I'm looking at you?

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't call me Siyeong.

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He's not a beggar. He's always out drinking.

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Hey, let him go. He's a real beggar.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He's right.

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He's right.

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
His grandfather is dead.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What?

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He gave his father money to his son who gave up?

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And he bought him a car.

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's what he did.

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's what his grandfather did.

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He was a complete A-team.

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm jealous.

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He's been making money from the police.

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He's been in a lot of trouble.

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Wait.

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
If he's the police chief, he's a thief.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What?

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What did you do to my poor Siyeong?

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're a real beggar.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You should've told me if you were going to die.

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's why my Siyeong is like this.

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're a real bastard.

159
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I guess he drank with his friends and got a few.

160
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He sent his friends to Thailand,

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
so they won't go to jail.

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But he came here for nothing.

163
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Siyeong.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Siyeong.

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Siyeong.

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What?

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Siyeong.

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You're so loud.

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What?

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Siyeong.

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Siyeong, wait.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Wait.

173
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Darn it.

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Where are you taking me?

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Sorry.

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Did you hear the message?

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I called and texted you.

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So?

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What did you want to say?

180
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No.

181
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I was going to discuss the art museum.

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But you're not feeling well, so let's do it next time.

183
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Are you making fun of me?

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What do you mean?

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You didn't care if your father was cooking or dying.

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You were just a Japanese who was a good man.

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And now you're in charge of the museum.

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What's wrong with you?

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hey.

190
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Listen carefully.

191
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I have only one opinion.

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Get lost.

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Go back to where you were.

194
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Sure.

195
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Get your bankalyst's bank forgive and top it up.

196
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
All of this?

197
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Then you're Cap embargoing my $2 billion?

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That &G coexist of all the news markets in Korea.

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And the one that made the most money.

200
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
How dare you!

201
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What are you up to?

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,340
What now?

203
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,600
What now?

204
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,000
You're the real criminal. You're a criminal.

205
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,700
You didn't take the money you received

206
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,300
and now you're a criminal.

207
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,940
What are you talking about?

208
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,440
Mr. Chairman, let go of me.

209
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,840
You said you went to get the money

210
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,140
for the cleaning or the TV show.

211
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,440
Why did you go up to the roof and throw money at me?

212
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,540
Let me get my act together.

213
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,780
You can throw money at me.

214
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,540
I'll show you how to throw money.

215
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,140
I'll throw it back at you.

216
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,580
Ouch!

217
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,340
Move, move, move!

218
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,740
Move over there!

219
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,380
You're such a crazy thing!

220
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,940
It's your property, so be careful.

221
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,580
Come here, come here.

222
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,440
Move, move, move!

223
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,540
Move! Move!

224
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,280
Come here, come here.

225
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Make a right angle.

226
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,180
Be careful.

227
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,380
Come here, come here.

228
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,980
Darn it.

229
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,880
What is this?

230
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,380
Why are you walking into someone else's office?

231
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,240
You didn't pay for it, did you?

232
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,880
What are you talking about?

233
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,880
The cultural asset was drawn by me.

234
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,880
The cultural asset?

235
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,980
Give me back the money!

236
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,680
Gosh, Gye-ok.

237
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,180
Who says money is a waste?

238
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,640
You're doing this to stop me from paying, aren't you?

239
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,140
Here.

240
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,440
There's something called a deposit.

241
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
Our company's money is

242
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,540
right here, right here.

243
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,940
Right here, right here, right here.

244
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,080
Right?

245
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,500
He's so strong that he's

246
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,140
going to break the company's money.

247
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,080
He's not moving at all.

248
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,000
If you don't pay him back,

249
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
you'll forget about the new business

250
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,640
and the money you earned.

251
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,840
He'll even hurt your health.

252
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,940
What?

253
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,040
You're talking nonsense.

254
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,240
What?

255
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,960
Have you ever been wrong about Dr. Kim?

256
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,840
He's right about the $2 million fraud.

257
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,860
Right.

258
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,760
Who was the fraud?

259
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,040
I heard someone died recently.

260
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,540
Is there anyone who knows who died?

261
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,840
No?

262
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,180
Oh, my. Are you okay?

263
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,040
What's wrong?

264
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,300
It's nothing.

265
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,780
So you think it'll be okay if I hang that painting?

266
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,280
Sure.

267
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,780
He said it'd be nice to hang a water painting

268
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,300
to soothe his money and his affection.

269
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,680
He said it'd be nice.

270
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,220
I paid him a lot of money,

271
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,480
so you can't take it away, okay?

272
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,920
I don't need it. You can hang it in your office.

273
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,720
Right, right. You must not like it.

274
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,320
You can put it in my room.

275
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,320
You're wearing too high heels.

276
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,020
Here.

277
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,320
What's wrong?

278
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,620
My goodness.

279
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,080
Hey, you're going to get in trouble tonight.

280
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,780
Do you know what that is?

281
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,280
What? It's expensive and nice.

282
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,720
I'm a con artist.

283
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,920
You're not going to hang a painting

284
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,320
in someone else's room with a son who's four times as rich?

285
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,820
Who do you want to hang it on?

286
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,020
Then why?

287
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,820
You're too proud to do anything.

288
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,020
I hung it up to lock it up in the pond.

289
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,420
It's to keep it from getting caught.

290
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,720
My goodness.

291
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,720
Did you hear what I asked you?

292
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,980
What did Dr. Kim say?

293
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,420
You can expand your business in architecture.

294
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,580
Right.

295
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,080
I heard you found a gold mine.

296
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,780
That's amazing.

297
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,020
Really?

298
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,980
What? Is there something?

299
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,480
What is it?

300
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,720
No, I don't know yet.

301
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,280
I'll tell you for sure.

302
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,980
I'm sorry.

303
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,180
I'm not sick of potato soup.

304
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,820
Samgyetang, galbitang,

305
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,320
lobster, menbosha, octopus, and grilled corvina.

306
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,280
There are so many things you can enjoy in the world.

307
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,820
But potato soup is always the best.

308
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,120
You're still so young,

309
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,920
but you still have two dishes.

310
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,220
I'm not going to spend all my money.

311
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,620
You don't have much time left to spend.

312
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,320
You should be a master of your own business.

313
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,660
You're so dirty.

314
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,260
So what's your plan?

315
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,460
What plan?

316
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,260
Why don't you just take over the art gallery?

317
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
What?

318
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,620
Didn't you give me money to do that?

319
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,020
I wouldn't have wasted money on a ghost.

320
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,660
Well...

321
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,660
I have a good idea.

322
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,320
It's not like I can't do it.

323
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,660
If we can find a developer,

324
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,860
it'll be worth it.

325
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,460
We can make $2 million.

326
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,760
The daughter of the developer

327
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,260
only studies here.

328
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,660
She doesn't know anything about the world.

329
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,960
She's been to many places.

330
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,960
You should make a good living.

331
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
I'm sorry.

332
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,800
It's so good.

333
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,760
I get sick of it as I eat it.

334
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,060
The daughter of the developer

335
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,500
only studies here.

336
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,260
She doesn't know anything about the world.

337
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,660
She's been to many places.

338
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,560
You should make a good living.

339
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,060
We should start the project, The Space,

340
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,800
that was postponed because of Jang Yensik.

341
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,900
The writer has a schedule next time.

342
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,660
She said she can't wait any longer.

343
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,560
I guess she waited a long time for this.

344
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,100
Are we done?

345
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,900
That was an easy one.

346
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,320
You did a great job.

347
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,300
Go on.

348
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,100
Well, the work is already out,

349
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,600
so we need to get the delivery done by the end of this month

350
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,980
to get the opening date.

351
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,380
Oh, and...

352
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,820
The goods and the money...

353
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
What?

354
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,900
I guess only rich people live here.

355
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,580
I'm the only one left.

356
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,840
How much did I pay? Oh, and...

357
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,380
The goods and the money are already in order.

358
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,460
The space?

359
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,960
Well...

360
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,660
I think it's a bit too early to promote it.

361
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,100
Yes, so...

362
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,660
I'm thinking of a creative and unique idea

363
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,900
that can be a temporary gift.

364
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,200
Are they famous people?

365
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,300
Mr. Joon!

366
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,500
I can't even unbutton it?

367
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,380
You may not know this because you're not a culture expert,

368
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,640
but they're all famous artists

369
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,880
who are active in Korea.

370
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,780
They have a lot of experience in the water...

371
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,040
I don't understand.

372
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,020
The space will also start an art camp

373
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,220
for children of Hope Nursery.

374
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,420
This camp will be about the theme of

375
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,960
the Three Frogs' Dairies...

376
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,160
I know this one.

377
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,200
The Three Frogs' Dairies.

378
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,760
Right? I told you about it.

379
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,940
Who was the owner of the restaurant?

380
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,740
He was a famous chef

381
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,980
and he created the food

382
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,220
based on Da Vinci's recipe.

383
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,820
Da Vinci! Da Vinci!

384
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,020
Yes, that's right.

385
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,100
I heard he was the owner of the restaurant.

386
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,460
Oh, yes.

387
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,940
By the way,

388
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,600
why would the owners of the restaurant

389
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,200
hire a famous chef to set up a camp?

390
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,900
It's hard to set up a camp

391
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,980
even if it's cheap.

392
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,780
The chefs who once showed their faces on TV

393
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,380
are really rich.

394
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,180
They're different from the past.

395
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,120
It's a free training program

396
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,180
for children of the art community

397
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,420
called the Cheongsong Art Camp.

398
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,060
You're not getting paid for this?

399
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,540
Out of the way.

400
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,640
It's a free training program.

401
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,660
What?

402
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,020
Free?

403
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,000
free?

404
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
He's madly in love with Cheongsong?

405
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,300
What?

406
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,780
What are you doing, Dr. Jin?

407
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,380
What are you trying to do?

408
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,980
You want me to be free?

409
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,080
And you want me to be in a court

410
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,780
for three times?

411
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,460
You're not a courtesan.

412
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,900
You're a legal monk.

413
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,400
The Cheongsong Art Camp is the most important

414
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,600
educational program of our art gallery

415
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,140
that has been run by my grandfather and father.

416
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,700
It's a rare opportunity for children

417
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,340
who are culturally neglected to experience art.

418
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,240
Do you know how much the children are happy about it?

419
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,780
They can't increase the number of programs,

420
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,020
so they want to cancel it.

421
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,620
Good.

422
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,220
Good. I like everything.

423
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,820
Don't you know who's good?

424
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,160
It's great that you're helping children

425
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,420
who are art and culture-less.

426
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,700
I respect you.

427
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,360
But what money are you going to use?

428
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,500
Do you have money?

429
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,540
Did you use my money to get in the way?

430
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,480
I should look for a sponsor from now on.

431
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,180
What?

432
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,320
You're going to use someone else's money?

433
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,220
Gosh.

434
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,260
You said you were the representative of Korea.

435
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,560
Now I see you're just a thief.

436
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,620
Mr. Shin.

437
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,660
What?

438
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,120
You're a thief who uses someone else's money

439
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
to get in the way.

440
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,900
You don't know that it's your money,

441
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,960
so you're a chef who's famous for being free

442
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,840
and using your own money.

443
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,040
Do you think others are doing business on the ground?

444
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,980
That's why you're ruined.

445
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,380
Your father's shit is making you

446
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,480
run a business, run a bank, and you can't sleep.

447
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,280
You're a poor man.

448
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,320
How can you think of a free art camp?

449
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,880
You're being too harsh, Mr. Shin.

450
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,120
Hey, Kim Dali.

451
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,920
Are you still not getting it?

452
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,320
Don't you know your place?

453
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,460
You're no longer a poor man's colleague

454
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,760
who's a famous artist who's got a good reputation.

455
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,400
You're a poor man who can't even afford

456
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,860
to buy shoes.

457
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,700
You're a poor man who's got a lot of debt.

458
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,000
Who are you trying to help?

459
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,500
If you want to help others,

460
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
you should help them by making money yourself.

461
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,060
Don't scold them for being a poor man.

462
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,500
I'll pay you back.

463
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
What?

464
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,100
You can pay me back.

465
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,740
Your money.

466
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,880
I'll pay you back within a week.

467
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
If you can't pay me back.

468
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,960
Then I'll do as you say.

469
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,200
Ms. Song,

470
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,900
please pick some works that can be paid for.

471
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
What?

472
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,300
How's the art market these days?

473
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,640
Mr. Han Nam-dong said he was interested in your work.

474
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,140
Is he still interested?

475
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,980
As you know, art can't be sold for free.

476
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,860
The art market isn't doing well either.

477
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,900
There are works that haven't been registered.

478
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,700
There are quite a few works that I've made.

479
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,780
That's true, but...

480
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,480
How much money do you have left?

481
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,180
What do you mean by money?

482
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,420
I don't even have any employee pay this month.

483
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
What?

484
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,360
I know the situation isn't good, but 1 in 3?

485
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,880
That's when the deal was made very fortunately.

486
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,240
The seed was dry for six months.

487
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,620
1 in 3?

488
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,180
I didn't know that.

489
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,860
You're like a thief.

490
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,420
Chairman Choi will definitely help.

491
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,500
At the high school reunion,

492
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,100
the head of the medical department

493
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,960
who was on the national council committee

494
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,760
stepped out and even sponsored the meeting.

495
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,440
You're not a person to ignore something.

496
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,720
This weeks crash course...

497
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:18,320
You can

498
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
I'll be right back.

499
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,760
I'll be right back.

500
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,760
I'll be right back.

501
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
Wait.

502
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Wait a minute.

503
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
Please read this.

504
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Look at the kitchen.

505
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
What?

506
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
Everyone's full, right?

507
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
I'm full.

508
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
When did you clean the kitchen?

509
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
I clean it every day.

510
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
I clean it every day.

511
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
The oil pan is this long?

512
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
No, it's not that.

513
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
I was going to grill some omelettes for the kids.

514
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
Omelettes?

515
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,760
No, it's not that.

516
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
When family guests come,

517
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
they say the kids are cute.

518
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,760
I heard that

519
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
the omelette is called a cloud omelette.

520
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
I heard that

521
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
the omelette is called a cloud omelette.

522
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
I heard that

523
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
the omelette is called a cloud omelette.

524
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
It's a cloud omelette.

525
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
It's a product developed by Pilgu.

526
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
It's so soft.

527
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
There are so many customers

528
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
who ask for this these days.

529
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
Did you report it to the headquarters?

530
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
No,

531
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
I was going to report it

532
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,760
when the recipe was done.

533
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Then,

534
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
you sold the food

535
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
that wasn't even finished.

536
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Hey,

537
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
why are you running a franchise?

538
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,760
You're running a private business.

539
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,760
No matter how good the menu is,

540
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
you have to get inside the system

541
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
to get the idea.

542
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,760
There's a new menu competition every month

543
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
and the development team is opening

544
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
an idea warehouse.

545
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
How can you tell a restaurant

546
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,760
to follow the rules?

547
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
I'm going to report it to the headquarters.

548
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
No, it's not that.

549
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
I'm sorry.

550
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
Darn it.

551
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
You should've just been careful.

552
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
You didn't even say hi.

553
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
You're being too much.

554
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
What?

555
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
I'm sorry.

556
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
If you start to be

557
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
so stubborn,

558
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
the system will collapse.

559
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
You should've caught him.

560
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
What?

561
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
It's a Dutch case.

562
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
Dutch?

563
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
The killer detective.

564
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
The watch thief.

565
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
That's probably what happened.

566
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
Did you forget?

567
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,760
The watch that the director

568
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
stole from the police?

569
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,760
Aren't you going to pay?

570
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
Forget it.

571
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
You're just spending money on the search.

572
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Call the Dutch detective

573
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
and tell him to stop.

574
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
I gave you so much money.

575
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
You should stop now.

576
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Let's just forget about it.

577
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
Then...

578
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,760
Should we call it Interpol?

579
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Interpol?

580
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
It could be an international scam.

581
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
You're just trying to get money.

582
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
You should catch them all

583
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
and put them in a cell

584
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
and feed them with beans.

585
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Stop it!

586
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
You're so stubborn.

587
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Who are you to say I'm stubborn?

588
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
Wait.

589
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,580
I'm not a

590
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,580
pervert.

591
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760
You need to get used to

592
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,760
this kind of stuff.

593
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
Jaesu.

594
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,760
Dali?

595
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
What brings you to our company?

596
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Good thing you came.

597
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
I came because of the exhibition.

598
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,760
I was worried about something

599
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
that might be wrong.

600
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
I could help you.

601
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,760
You're not a pervert.

602
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,760
What?

603
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,760
I heard that Siyeong

604
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,760
is borrowing money from people.

605
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
You're not like that either.

606
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,760
Don't bother the people who work hard.

607
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,760
Make money with your own money.

608
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,760
Or ask them to lend you some money.

609
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
What exhibition?

610
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
Is your company really okay?

611
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,760
What?

612
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
You're a second-hand

613
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,760
person who doesn't know

614
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
the concept of culture marketing.

615
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Oh, right.

616
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
I told you that I was

617
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,760
borrowing money from my sister.

618
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
No.

619
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,760
I said no.

620
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
The house is ruined.

621
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,760
That's ridiculous.

622
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
It's ridiculous.

623
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,760
We need to fix this.

624
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
We need to fix this.

625
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
What's wrong with you?

626
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,760
What's the schedule of the

627
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
writer, Im Seunghyun?

628
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
I'm arranging it.

629
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,760
Get it done in six hours.

630
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
Did you do something on your face?

631
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,760
What?

632
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,760
Everyone's been up all night

633
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
to do their makeup.

634
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
I had my arms and legs

635
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,760
all stretched out.

636
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
Only you.

637
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,760
Only you have a shiny face.

638
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
What?

639
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
Is it the water glow

640
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,760
celebrities use these days?

641
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,760
What's the point?

642
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
We stayed up all night.

643
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
I guess

644
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
it's good to be young.

645
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,760
I'll put it on secretly.

646
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Hello?

647
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
I'm here.

648
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
I'm here.

649
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
I'm here.

650
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
I'm here.

651
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
I'm here.

652
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
I'm here.

653
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
I'm here.

654
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
I'm here.

655
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,760
I'm here.

656
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,760
I'm here.

657
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Excuse me.

658
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
I'm here.

659
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Give me a drink.

660
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
$10?

661
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
What?

662
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
$10.

663
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
What ice americano?

664
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,760
Wait a minute.

665
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Okay.

666
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
My gosh.

667
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,760
Can I get a cash receipt?

668
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Okay.

669
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,760
Why did I get a gold powder?

670
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
Why did I get a 10-dollar receipt?

671
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,760
What's wrong with him?

672
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,760
Why is the chair so bent?

673
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
The chair is bent.

674
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,760
How much is the daily market here?

675
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
It depends on the day.

676
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,760
Do you have any foreign customers?

677
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
Well...

678
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
What about the CEO?

679
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
He doesn't come out often.

680
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
Here.

681
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
Have some of this.

682
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
Thank you.

683
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,760
I didn't know that Chairman Choi

684
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
would do that to me.

685
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
No.

686
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,760
He even stood in front of me when he was getting married

687
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,760
and even stopped me when I almost fell.

688
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,760
How long has it been since he passed away?

689
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,760
I haven't been able to help him.

690
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
I'm sorry.

691
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,760
Of course you are.

692
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
This is a big deal.

693
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Let's not do this and just...

694
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
No.

695
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,760
It's nothing.

696
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,760
It's already this late.

697
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,760
It's time for you to go to the hospital.

698
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
I'll go get up first.

699
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
Okay.

700
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
Thank you for your hard work.

701
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
You're welcome.

702
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
I'm sorry.

703
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,760
I'm sorry.

704
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,760
I'm sorry.

705
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,760
I'm sorry.

706
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
I'm sorry.

707
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
I'm sorry.

708
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
I'm sorry.

709
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
I'm sorry.

710
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
I'm sorry.

711
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
I'm sorry.

712
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,760
I'm sorry.

713
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
I'm sorry.

714
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
I'm sorry.

715
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
I'm sorry.

716
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
I'm sorry.

717
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Should we meet up with her and get closer

718
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
so that we can be more silent?

719
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,760
We can be more silent on the surface,

720
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,760
but we have people from the police department

721
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,760
and we have a prosecutor from the U.S. Embassy.

722
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
You must go this time.

723
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
What?

724
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,760
What's the point of being silent?

725
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
It's perfect.

726
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Hi, Dal.

727
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
Yes, tell me.

728
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Yes, I'm free.

729
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
I'm fine.

730
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
I don't have a big schedule.

731
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,760
I'm glad you're okay.

732
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
Let's go to Seongbuk-dong.

733
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,760
Okay.

734
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,760
Hi.

735
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Am I late?

736
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
I came early.

737
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
I told you I was nearby.

738
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
I'd like a meal.

739
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,760
I ordered it myself. Is it okay?

740
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
Sure.

741
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,760
The new Beijing Entertainment City,

742
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,760
772772, Kong.

743
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Why can't you eat?

744
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
You have a weak stomach.

745
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
I'm eating.

746
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
I should've made you more food.

747
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
So the steamed octopus is good.

748
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
I'm eating.

749
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,760
You should eat too.

750
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,760
Okay.

751
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,760
Here.

752
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
I went too far in the department store.

753
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
It's because you care about me.

754
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Thank you for being so polite.

755
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,760
Excuse me.

756
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Hey.

757
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,760
Yes?

758
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
Excuse me.

759
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,760
Well...

760
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
What did you say?

761
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,760
I'm fine.

762
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,760
I'm fine.

763
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
I'm fine.

764
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,760
I'm fine.

765
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,760
Thank you.

766
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
What?

767
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,760
Thank you for helping me at the funeral.

768
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
Is that so hard to say?

769
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
I guess I did a lot of things.

770
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
It's hard to say thank you.

771
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,760
So did you get over the fact that you did?

772
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,760
What?

773
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,760
I'm not like before, but I'm still close to you.

774
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,760
So...

775
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,760
I want to go back to the time when we were on good terms.

776
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,760
I want you to stay by my side.

777
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,760
I don't want you to want anything right now.

778
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,760
I just don't want you to think you're left alone.

779
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,760
So when you're upset, upset, or having a hard time...

780
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,760
Or when you need help...

781
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,760
I'm here by your side.

782
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,760
Okay?

783
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
Okay.

784
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,760
Why aren't you answering?

785
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,760
Okay?

786
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,760
Okay.

787
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,760
I'm sorry.

788
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,760
I'm sorry.

789
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,760
I'm sorry.

790
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
I'm sorry.

791
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,760
I'm sorry.

792
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,760
I'm sorry.

793
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,760
I'm sorry.

794
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
I'm sorry.

795
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,760
I'm sorry.

796
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,760
I'm sorry.

797
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,760
I'm sorry.

798
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,760
I'm sorry.

799
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,760
I'm sorry.

800
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,760
I'm sorry.

801
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,760
I'm sorry.

802
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,760
I'm sorry.

803
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
I'm sorry.

804
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,760
I'm sorry.

805
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,760
I'm sorry.

806
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,760
I'm sorry.

807
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,760
I'm sorry.

808
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,760
I'm sorry.

809
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,760
I'm sorry.

810
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,760
I'm sorry.

811
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,760
I'm sorry.

812
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,760
I'm sorry.

813
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,760
I'm sorry.

814
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,760
I'm sorry.

815
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,760
I'm sorry.

816
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,760
I'm sorry.

817
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,760
I'm sorry.

818
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,760
I'm sorry.

819
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,760
I'm sorry.

820
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,760
I'm sorry.

821
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,760
I'm sorry.

822
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,760
I'm sorry.

823
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,760
I'm sorry.

824
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,760
I'm sorry.

825
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,760
I'm sorry.

826
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,760
I'm sorry.

827
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,760
I'm sorry.

828
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,760
I'm sorry.

829
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,760
I'm sorry.

830
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,760
I'm sorry.

831
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,760
I'm sorry.

832
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,760
I'm sorry.

833
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,760
I'm sorry.

834
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
I'm sorry.

835
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
I'm sorry.

836
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,760
That's a bit harsh.

837
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,760
I'm sorry.

838
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,760
I'm sorry.

839
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,760
I'm sorry.

840
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,760
I'm sorry.

841
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,760
I'm sorry.

842
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,260
I should've exercised more.

843
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,460
Did you eat?

844
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,100
Isn't it funny?

845
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,500
This is the dinner you made for me.

846
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,020
I ate.

847
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,420
I got my cheeks and cheeks.

848
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,740
I ate my Myungho family.

849
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,400
And had some acai my dad loved.

850
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,600
They made some acai.

851
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,740
And after...

852
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,880
We got married.

853
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,180
And we...

854
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:37,760
Yes.

855
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:07,760
I...

856
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
You've had a hard time.

857
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,760
Yes, you've had a hard time.

858
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:20,760
I can't keep this or throw it away.

859
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:28,760
It's the most painful thing I've ever had when I was young.

860
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,760
Thank you.

861
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:39,760
Oh, of course.

862
00:48:50,760 --> 00:49:00,760
You have such a clear face, so this jacket is perfect.

863
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:06,760
Oh, is there anything else that's a little more sophisticated?

864
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,760
It looks luxurious and cool.

865
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,760
Oh, really?

866
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,760
You didn't like that.

867
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,760
You just found out that I'm a luxury.

868
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,760
When did I?

869
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,760
Then...

870
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:33,760
Welcome.

871
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:42,760
Is this also possible?

872
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,760
Oh, are you going to sell this?

873
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,760
Yes.

874
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,760
Then what about this style?

875
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,760
This is what idols wore, and we bought it cheaply.

876
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,760
Avangar and elegant.

877
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:08,760
I'm going to eat.

878
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:38,760
I'm going to eat.

879
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:08,760
I'm going to eat.

880
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:38,760
Where is it?

881
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:48,760
I'm going to eat.

882
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:58,760
Where is it?

883
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:08,760
Where is it?

884
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:14,760
Do you want a hint?

885
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,760
Yes.

886
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:40,760
What kind of person runs outside?

887
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:50,760
Wow, it's candy.

888
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:20,760
I thought you were working overtime, but you're drinking alone.

889
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:26,760
Mr. Jin.

890
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,760
No, I mean...

891
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,760
Did you cry?

892
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,760
No, I didn't cry.

893
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,760
Why not? Why?

894
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,760
Why are you crying alone in a place like this?

895
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:49,760
This isn't crying.

896
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,760
Me.

897
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:59,760
Did you even yawn if you didn't cry?

898
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:07,760
I'm trying to control the world's activity.

899
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,760
What is it?

900
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,760
It's said that human emotions are the product of tears.

901
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:20,760
But actually, it's more effective in protecting the eye.

902
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:28,760
So without tears, the eye function gets worse and the eyes get stiff.

903
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:35,760
The vision gets blurry and everything will get worse.

904
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:43,760
So you're saying that you were crying to protect your eyes?

905
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,760
It's similar.

906
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:51,760
Well, let's say that.

907
00:54:51,760 --> 00:55:01,760
How did you know I was here?

908
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,760
I told you I was the director of the Food and Drug Association.

909
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,760
Sometimes I go around the city to check on the hygiene.

910
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,760
Like a cancer doctor.

911
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:20,760
Oh, cancer doctor.

912
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,760
What's this?

913
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,760
You're not running away, are you?

914
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,760
The house was sold.

915
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,760
But I can't pay for your debt.

916
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,760
Then where do you live now?

917
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:44,760
I mean, I don't care.

918
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,760
You didn't decide where to go and sold the house?

919
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:56,760
I guess I'll have to stay at a hotel for a while.

920
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:10,760
It's a hotel even if you die soon.

921
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,760
I'm not crying.

922
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:20,760
I'm protecting my eyes.

923
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:30,760
No, that's how smart you are.

924
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,760
That's how strong you are.

925
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,760
I think I've got a seat in the Netherlands.

926
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,760
I heard you sold the museum.

927
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,760
Didn't you think about organizing everything and leaving?

928
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:50,760
I heard it's pretty good if you sell the museum.

929
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,760
Oh, my God.

930
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,760
You money ghost.

931
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,760
What?

932
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,760
Money ghost?

933
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,760
Can you sell your father?

934
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,760
What are you talking about?

935
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:09,760
I'm going to sell your father because I have a lot of money.

936
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,760
Why would my father...

937
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,760
The museum is my father.

938
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,760
It's my dad.

939
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:25,760
Where would you be if you didn't have an art museum?

940
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,760
Like me?

941
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:40,760
You have to have an art museum to see art even for people who don't know Da Vinci like you.

942
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,760
Poor people.

943
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,760
People who haven't learned.

944
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,760
People who have money but are in a bad mood.

945
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,760
If you don't have an art museum, you can only look at books.

946
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,760
Why?

947
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,760
Because people who have a lot of money.

948
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,760
I'm not as poor as you are.

949
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:11,760
A lot of people.

950
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:17,760
They're going to hide it in their safe.

951
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,760
I'm only going to look at them.

952
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,760
Did you know?

953
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:39,760
This Da Vinci doesn't know.

954
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:49,760
But he's still handsome.

955
00:58:49,760 --> 00:59:02,760
That's what my dad said.

956
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,760
No.

957
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,760
Mr. Shin?

958
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,760
Just one thing.

959
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,760
You can call me teacher.

960
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:19,760
Can I do it?

961
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:35,760
Can I protect the museum?

962
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:43,760
You can't, can you?

963
00:59:43,760 --> 01:00:03,760
What if I help you?

964
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:09,760
I didn't drink.

965
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,760
Mr. Jin.

966
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,760
Mr. Jin.

967
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,760
You're in the Blanche Hotel in Samsung-dong, right?

968
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:31,760
No?

969
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,760
I'll come to you every day.

970
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:01,760
It's weird.

971
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,760
Our meeting.

972
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:11,760
How did you fall in love at first sight?

973
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,760
It's not easy to explain.

974
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,760
It's fate.

975
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,760
What should I do?

976
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,760
It's okay.

977
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,760
You can go now.

978
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,760
I'll walk you to the room.

979
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,760
No matter how much it costs, I'm alone.

980
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,760
It's okay.

981
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,760
I said it's okay.

982
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:42,760
Mr. Jin.

983
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,760
I'm sorry.

984
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,760
I didn't think about that.

985
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,760
Okay, then.

986
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,760
Thank you.

987
01:01:51,760 --> 01:02:04,760
Goodbye.

988
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,760
Welcome.

989
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:14,760
Oh, yes.

990
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,760
Is there a room?

991
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:31,760
Yes, wait a minute.

992
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:39,760
Can I use the phone?

993
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,760
You just checked in, right?

994
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,760
The one with curly hair.

995
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,760
You didn't check in.

996
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,760
What?

997
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:57,760
You asked me where the back door was and went over there.

998
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:07,760
Thank you.

999
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:37,760
I'm sorry.

1000
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:07,760
I'm sorry.

1001
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:37,760
I'm sorry.

1002
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:07,760
I'm sorry.

1003
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:37,760
I'm sorry.

1004
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:07,760
I'm sorry.

1005
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,760
Where are you, Kim Dal-ri?

1006
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,760
What?

1007
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,760
What?

1008
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,760
Who said I like who?

1009
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,760
No, it's not.

1010
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,760
Is he your boyfriend?

1011
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:23,840
It's like a private

1012
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,920
I know how stupid and pathetic I am.

1013
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:33,920
Don't hurt me until you pay me back.
