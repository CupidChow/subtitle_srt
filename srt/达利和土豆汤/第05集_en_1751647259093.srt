00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,440
Hello.

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,340
Jun-taek.

3
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,600
Do you remember this?

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,300
I didn't remain silent on the telephonealter.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,340
I'm so sorry.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,280
Did he...

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,980
Yun Jungoe

8
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,260
Daegu Hakjin

9
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,480
Are you inside?

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,340
baÄŸ seeds

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,140
It's me

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,660
Where are my book bags?

13
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,700
I really knew this would happen.

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,680
Some where, it felt strange.

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,920
What are you doing here in the middle of the night?

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,320
They took you to a hotel?

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,220
I mean...

18
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,220
You don't have a hotel fee?

19
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,520
You said you sold your house.

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,420
Well...

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,700
I have work to do.

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,160
I have to fix the exhibition,

23
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,660
the proposal for the agency,

24
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,460
and the sponsorship.

25
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,340
I have a lot to prepare for the sponsorship meeting.

26
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,100
Do that at the hotel.

27
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,540
What?

28
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,100
If you work here all night,

29
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,640
will you pay the electricity bill?

30
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,220
The electricity bill?

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,680
Even if the museum is under your name,

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,860
the electricity bill and the capital bill

33
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,460
are all spent on the museum's operating expenses.

34
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,620
Why do you have to spend your money

35
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,420
on things you couldn't do during your work hours?

36
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,360
This is what you call private use.

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,660
Private use.

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,940
Private use?

39
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,440
You can't tell what's real from what's real.

40
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,800
Pack up and come out.

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,200
I'll take you to the hotel.

42
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,240
No, Mr. Jin.

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,500
I have something to do today.

44
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,300
The students who couldn't study

45
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,660
were forced to work all night

46
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,900
and the people who couldn't work

47
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,060
were forced to work late.

48
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,300
You should show your skills to the manager

49
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,300
instead of working late.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What?

51
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,840
They weren't even on the lights?

52
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,620
How could a person be so scary?

53
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,820
Mr. Jin.

54
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,620
I just have to take this, right?

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
Well...

56
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,900
Were you...

57
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,200
trying to stay here?

58
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,600
To save on the hotel bill?

59
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,100
No.

60
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,700
I have money.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,480
What are you doing? Let's go.

62
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,520
What?

63
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,480
How did you know I was at the art gallery?

64
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,580
Is there a place you can go to if you're not at the gallery?

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,780
You don't have a friend to drink with.

66
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,040
I don't think you have a relative.

67
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,080
Give me your number.

68
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
My number?

69
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,880
I thought about it and I was wrong.

70
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,480
The owner of the book doesn't even know

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,220
the phone number of the owner.

72
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,020
What are you doing?

73
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,540
Here.

74
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,720
Press the call button down there.

75
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,620
Don't erase it.

76
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,800
Save it well.

77
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,460
It'll be a mess if you call.

78
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,100
It's not because I have other intentions.

79
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,520
You're doing this because you're afraid you'll run away.

80
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,260
As Mr. Jin said, I don't have friends

81
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,460
and I don't have relatives to take care of.

82
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,100
Where can I go?

83
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,700
You don't have to worry.

84
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,700
When my father is alive, I have a lot of friends

85
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,340
and I have relatives.

86
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,100
The world is like that.

87
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,100
There's something to eat.

88
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
There's something to eat.

89
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,100
There's something to eat.

90
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,100
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,100
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,100
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Why are you standing next to me?

101
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,100
You might lose your food if you do something wrong.

102
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
Why are you standing next to me?

103
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
Don't think too much.

104
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,100
So on a day like today,

105
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
don't just sleep in an expensive room

106
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,100
and think about anything.

107
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,100
You've already made billions of dollars.

108
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
You can't even get a hotel room.

109
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
How can you be so stingy?

110
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,100
You can get me a drink, pay me,

111
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,100
take me to a fancy hotel,

112
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,100
and even get me a last-minute service.

113
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
You're so stingy.

114
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Anyway, you're the most expensive girl in the store.

115
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Don't leave a drop and drink it all.

116
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,100
You can go now.

117
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,100
You should see yourself going in.

118
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
What if you come out again?

119
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
I'm not going to let you go.

120
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
I'm going to see you go in.

121
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
I'm going to see you go in.

122
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,100
I'm going to see you go in.

123
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,100
You should see yourself going in.

124
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
What if you come out again?

125
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,100
Then...

126
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,100
Okay.

127
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,100
Good night.

128
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,100
I said I'd pay for the hotel.

129
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,100
Tomorrow is the employees' payday.

130
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
How should I tell you?

131
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,100
Reward?

132
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
Please.

133
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Please.

134
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,100
I'm going to see you go in.

135
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,100
I'm going to see you go in.

136
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,100
I...

137
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
I'm going to eat all day.

138
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,100
$50?

139
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
$50?

140
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
You can go to room 205.

141
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Honey, honey.

142
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,100
What's our room number?

143
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Room 203.

144
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
I'm going to sleep.

145
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Are you sleeping?

146
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,100
No, not yet.

147
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
What is it?

148
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,100
I'm going to sleep.

149
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
Hello?

150
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,100
If you're not sleeping, open the window.

151
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
The window?

152
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
You don't know it's raining, do you?

153
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
You should see the night view before you sleep.

154
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
I paid you a lot of money, so you should get the money.

155
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Are you watching this?

157
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Yes.

158
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
Isn't it amazing?

159
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,100
That hotel is famous for its night view.

160
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
It's a place where you can see the night view.

161
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,100
No, I didn't catch you there.

162
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,100
I was at a party with the people who were running the store.

163
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
That's why I know you.

164
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Why would I sleep at a hotel after I left my house?

165
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
How much is the money?

166
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,100
No, you can sleep.

167
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
You have nowhere to go after you moved.

168
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,100
So what I'm saying is...

169
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,100
Don't think about things like sleeping well and all that.

170
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
Good night, Mr. Jin.

171
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
Okay, then.

172
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
I'll hang up.

173
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
You idiot.

174
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
What is this?

175
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
No, no.

176
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
That money, no.

177
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
That money, no.

178
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
No, no.

179
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Hurry up.

180
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Darn it.

181
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
No, no.

182
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
No, no.

183
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
No, no.

184
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
No, no.

185
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
No, no.

186
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
Please, please.

187
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Are you building the clean-up facility?

188
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,100
I know.

189
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,100
I think the payment for the business was a bit off.

190
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
I heard that the private business

191
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
had some weird people with their own

192
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
and it was really noisy there.

193
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
Did you hear that?

194
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,100
How did the clean-up facility end up like this?

195
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Don't be ridiculous.

196
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,100
What?

197
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
What's wrong?

198
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
I just heard that too.

199
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
What?

200
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Hello?

201
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Yes, is this Detective Ju Won Tak's phone?

202
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,100
Yes.

203
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
Then do you know Kim Dal Ri?

204
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,100
Who?

205
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Dal Ri.

206
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,100
You...

207
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
I'm Kim Dal Ri's guardian.

208
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,100
I heard you were a motel employee.

209
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,100
I'm not an employee.

210
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
I heard you worked part-time for a few days.

211
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
My gosh.

212
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
But thankfully, you remember my face

213
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
and we're investigating the scene,

214
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,100
so you'll be caught soon.

215
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
But I'm glad you said that.

216
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Why don't you go home

217
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,100
and get your body treated first

218
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,100
and then come out?

219
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
What do you mean, I'm fine?

220
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,100
My whole body is bruised!

221
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,100
Hold on.

222
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,100
I'll be right back.

223
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
Do you have to break down

224
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
and kill someone to be nervous?

225
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
You're so reckless.

226
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Aren't you being held up because you're so reckless?

227
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
How did you manage to get the order

228
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
to hold you up?

229
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Are you really being held up?

230
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,100
And when will you investigate the scene?

231
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Let go of me.

232
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
Are you okay?

233
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
I'm sorry.

234
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Why are you doing this to us?

235
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Let go of me!

236
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100
Let go of me.

237
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,100
I'm sorry for making you work so hard.

238
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,100
I heard you need to put it in your bag

239
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,100
to get out of the hospital, so I took it.

240
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Did you call because of the hospital bill?

242
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,100
Or did you not call?

243
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
What?

244
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
You and the director

245
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
keep making me a fool.

246
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Hey, you and the director

247
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,100
were the first people to give me a job.

248
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
You and the director were the only ones

249
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,100
who didn't give up and waited for me.

250
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
So I don't think I'm alone

251
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,100
when I'm angry, happy, or lost.

252
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
I think of you first.

253
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,100
Why do you think that?

254
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Why?

255
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,100
How could you not tell me

256
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,100
until you're done with your work

257
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,100
and you're in a situation where you can't do anything?

258
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
Get in.

259
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Okay.

260
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,100
I know you're here,

261
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
but I can't say it's better than a motel.

262
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,100
But it'll be safe at least.

263
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,100
So for now...

264
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,100
For now?

265
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,100
What?

266
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
Can't you use it more?

267
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,100
It's too rough for now.

268
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,100
Just for a while.

269
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Just get in.

270
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,100
Okay.

271
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Okay.

272
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,100
I'll kill you if you get caught.

273
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Good morning.

274
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
Good morning?

275
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,100
You just came back from the clothes shopping.

276
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Is time important?

277
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Good morning to me now.

278
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Why?

279
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Because I just got back from work.

280
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
Okay.

281
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,100
Why is the music camp in elementary school

282
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
so expensive?

283
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
World-class pianists give you lessons.

284
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
That's cheap.

285
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,100
You need a professor's recommendation

286
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
to get in.

287
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,100
No one can get in.

288
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
That's right.

289
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
How do you know the public school?

290
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,100
I went to the art camp when I was young.

291
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
I knew it.

292
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
She's a different person

293
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
because she's a child.

294
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,100
It must be hard to get a good salary.

295
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,100
Eunhye, you quit your job

296
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,100
and you're still working?

297
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,100
I have to work hard to get a second job.

298
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,100
So...

299
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,100
You'll get your pay today, right?

300
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
I can't just stay here.

301
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,100
I don't care about the money.

302
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
The art camp staff here...

303
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,100
They're very economical.

304
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,100
I really like that.

305
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,100
Whether the art camp closes down

306
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
or the director sells the house

307
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,100
to stop it,

308
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
it doesn't matter.

309
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,100
As long as I get my pay,

310
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
it's a big deal.

311
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
I'm so proud of you.

312
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,100
You're great.

313
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,100
You're great.

314
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
You're selfish.

315
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
You're shameless.

316
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
You're very human.

317
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100
You're beautiful.

318
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100
You're artistic.

319
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100
Don't you think so, Mr. Han?

320
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,100
I didn't mean to say that.

321
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,100
No.

322
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,100
But...

323
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,100
Do we really close down the art camp?

324
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Why are you asking me?

325
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
You should ask the director.

326
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,100
Where is Kim Dali?

327
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,100
She was...

328
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,100
You don't know?

329
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Didn't she go to work today?

330
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
I called because of the meeting.

331
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,100
She didn't answer.

332
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,100
Is that all?

333
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Yes.

334
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,100
If she doesn't answer, you should call her.

335
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Why don't you call her again?

336
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Okay.

337
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
The number you have dialed is busy.

338
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,100
Her phone is off.

339
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,100
Try again.

340
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Forget it. I'll try.

341
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
Excuse me.

342
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,100
Excuse me.

343
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,100
Excuse me.

344
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
I think it's the director.

345
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Who is that man?

346
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Is he your boyfriend?

347
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
No.

348
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
I was late because I had an outside meeting.

349
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
I was going to ask you about the exhibition.

350
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
It's not urgent. Let's hold the meeting next time.

351
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
Then...

352
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,100
See you later.

353
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,100
Are you going somewhere again?

354
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,100
No.

355
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
Is something urgent?

356
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
What's wrong?

357
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,100
If there's something urgent, just cancel it.

358
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
This is my case. It's very urgent.

359
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
Let's have a meeting tonight.

360
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,100
Mr. Jin.

361
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,100
You said you'd pay me back in a week.

362
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
Are you going to pay me back?

363
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,100
Tell me.

364
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,100
Hey!

365
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,100
A proposal for the management of the art museum.

366
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,100
What are you doing?

367
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
What?

368
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Aren't you taking off your sunglasses?

369
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,100
Well...

370
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,100
I think it's a good idea.

371
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,100
What?

372
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
I need a proposal.

373
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,100
It's about the management of the art museum.

374
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
I don't think it's right to just

375
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,100
look at the important details and hand them over.

376
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,100
I'll take them and carefully review them.

377
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,100
I won't miss a single word.

378
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
We can just do it here.

379
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
Then this is the end of today's meeting.

380
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,100
But...

381
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,100
This is a bit strange.

382
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,100
No medicine, no cell phone charging,

383
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,100
and no use of toilet paper in the bathroom?

384
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,100
There's this too.

385
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,100
When there are no customers, you can use the exhibition room.

386
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
This is...

387
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,100
This is a proposal for the management of the art museum.

388
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
Are you serious?

389
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
I'm serious.

390
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,100
Well,

391
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,100
I guess the management will be normal

392
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
because you saved your money.

393
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
I had fun with the proposal.

394
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
At least,

395
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,100
half of the employees will be fired.

396
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,100
The other employees will be fired from their jobs.

397
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,100
The pay will be reduced to the level of pain.

398
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,100
That's how you can cut the bones.

399
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,100
Isn't that right, Mr. Han?

400
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
I cut too many bones.

401
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
You're still a minor.

402
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Why are you cutting down on the number of employees?

403
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,100
I have to squeeze out the dried up ones too.

404
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,100
What dried up ones?

405
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
It's a towel, right?

406
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,100
I'm sorry.

407
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
You just have to squeeze out the towels and the ones

408
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,100
that are dried up.

409
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,100
Stop it, Mr. Jin.

410
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
The art museum employees

411
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
should know the situation.

412
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
You're running away from work...

413
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
I'll check it.

414
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,100
I'll check it in detail

415
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,100
and make a decision by tomorrow.

416
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Is that okay?

417
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,100
Whatever.

418
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,100
Do you want to go?

419
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,100
I'll make sure to use the locker.

420
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,100
I forgot to tell you.

421
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,100
What are you doing?

422
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
I'm sorry.

423
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,100
I didn't see anything.

424
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
What's wrong?

425
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,100
I'm sorry.

426
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,100
I'm sorry.

427
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,100
I'm sorry.

428
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
I'm sorry.

429
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
I mean...

430
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
I think I need a certificate of admission

431
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,100
to work in earnest.

432
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,100
If I want to come to both the art museum

433
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,100
and the potato soup restaurant,

434
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
I'll have to go to work early.

435
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,100
Everyone can come home after work.

436
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
I'll tell Gong Ju.

437
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,100
Let's mix mine and Yeo Bi's.

438
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,100
Okay.

439
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,100
If you don't have anything to do, then stop.

440
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,100
Did something happen?

441
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,100
No.

442
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
Your phone was broken.

443
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
It broke, so I had to repair it.

444
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,100
It was fine until last night.

445
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
I dropped it this morning.

446
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
Isn't that frustrating?

447
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
It's because of personal reasons.

448
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
If you're done with your work, then stop.

449
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,100
Do you see personal reasons?

450
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,100
Isn't it because you don't have to tell me

451
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,100
why it's personal

452
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,100
or because you don't want to reveal it?

453
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,100
I'm sorry.

454
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
You wanted it?

455
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,100
I want to stop working now.

456
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,100
Don't you look for a place to live?

457
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
You can't stay at a hotel forever.

458
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
That's why I looked for a place.

459
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,100
I found one.

460
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,100
When?

461
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,100
This morning.

462
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,100
Where?

463
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,100
At my friend's place.

464
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
Who's your friend?

465
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,100
Do I have to tell you?

466
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,100
You said you don't have a friend.

467
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
I do.

468
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,100
A girl?

469
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
A guy?

470
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,100
Who's a guy?

471
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
The girl who walked me to the front...

472
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
Mr. Jin.

473
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,100
As a book author...

474
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
You know your job, your contact information,

475
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,100
and your temporary address?

476
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
It's like a personal life.

477
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
What do you mean personal life?

478
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
The world is so rough and cruel.

479
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,100
I'm just doing it to protect my assets.

480
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
Do you want to interfere with someone's life?

481
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,100
If something happens to you,

482
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
how am I supposed to pay you back?

483
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,100
Are you going to take responsibility?

484
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,100
Is it something you can trust?

485
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,100
I'm working.

486
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,100
Is it something you can trust?

487
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,100
I can tell you that.

488
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,100
Is that also a personal matter?

489
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,100
It's something I can trust.

490
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
It's not something you can trust.

491
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,100
I'm so into this stupidity that I can't trust anyone.

492
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,100
What did you say?

493
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,100
I...

494
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,100
What did I say?

495
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,100
Didn't you go to ask who that guy was?

496
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,100
You went in there like you had a boyfriend

497
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
and you were in love with a girl you liked.

498
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,100
Who?

499
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,100
Me?

500
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,100
Who?

501
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,100
No.

502
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,100
I'm Jin Mua Gi.

503
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,100
I'm not just anyone.

504
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,100
I'm a loser who has billions of debt.

505
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,100
You're talking about that girl with a billion dollar debt?

506
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,100
Did you eat something wrong?

507
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,100
If not, it's fine.

508
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,100
What?

509
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,100
What do you mean by that?

510
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,100
I just checked it out.

511
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,100
What do you mean?

512
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,100
You two are like that.

513
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,100
What do you mean?

514
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,100
You have to explain it in words.

515
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,100
You can't explain it in words?

516
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,100
I mean...

517
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Well...

518
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,100
What? What did you say?

519
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Say it louder.

520
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,100
I can't hear you!

521
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,100
Cha Ki.

522
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,100
I have an appointment.

523
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Can you go to the art award ceremony alone?

524
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
Seeing how we're getting along

525
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,100
even after our first meeting,

526
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,100
I think we're meant to be.

527
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Where should we meet next?

528
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Excuse me.

529
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,100
Cha Ki.

530
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Cha Ki?

531
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,100
Oh, my.

532
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,100
Do you know her?

533
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,100
Cha Ki.

534
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,100
Do you really think we get along well?

535
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,100
What?

536
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,100
I can't even understand half of what you say.

537
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,100
I understand you bragging about your hard work

538
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,100
and trying to make it sound difficult.

539
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,100
But isn't it a etiquette to brush your teeth

540
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
after your first meeting?

541
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,100
Why does your breath smell like the bathroom?

542
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,100
It's delicious.

543
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Start!

544
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,100
No.

545
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,100
Cha Ki.

546
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,100
Ms. Song Bokdong isn't picky,

547
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
so you just need to find the right spot.

548
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
The director will take care of everything.

549
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,100
Cha Ki.

550
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,100
Okay.

551
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
We're leaving at 3, so we can come before then.

552
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,100
Cha Ki.

553
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
I'm on my way, so come out.

554
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
What's wrong with you?

555
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
You're busy. Eat alone.

556
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,100
It's a problem with the Seongsong Art Museum.

557
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
Seongsong Art Museum?

558
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,100
Seongsong Art Museum? Why?

559
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,100
What's wrong with the Seongsong Art Museum?

560
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
What's wrong?

561
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
What's the relationship between the Seongsong Art Museum

562
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
and the Seongsong Art Museum?

563
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,100
What?

564
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,100
You were the bully of the Seongsong Art Museum.

565
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,100
I'm not a bully.

566
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
It's just a business problem.

567
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,100
I'm just a bit involved. It's nothing.

568
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,100
It's a business, not a part-time job.

569
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,100
Why are you working at a hotel with Kim Dali?

570
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
Do you know Kim Dali?

571
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Who doesn't know Kim Dali,

572
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
given who works here?

573
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,100
Does she have a boyfriend?

574
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Is she that famous?

575
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,100
Why are you asking me why I'm working at a hotel with her?

576
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,100
I'm not asking you.

577
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,100
I just gave her a drink because I was drunk.

578
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,100
How do you know that?

579
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,100
I was at the hotel at that time.

580
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,100
Then why didn't you pretend you knew her?

581
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,100
What?

582
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Are you really not in a relationship with her?

583
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,100
What does it have to do with you?

584
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,100
Did you call a busy person to ask that?

585
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,100
You're just asking me to come here.

586
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,100
You know that I'm really quick-witted.

587
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,100
Really?

588
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,100
I like someone who likes someone and who goes out with someone.

589
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,100
I like a variety show host, but he likes a girl.

590
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,100
I know him very well.

591
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,100
That's why he gives me a lot of dating advice.

592
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,100
If you had that talent, you should go to a marriage information company.

593
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,100
You don't even know the 8 letters of the word.

594
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,100
You go to a gallery and get bullied.

595
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Give me an apple.

596
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,100
I found out from you at the hotel that you can't wash your hair.

597
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,100
I've been curious about something.

598
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,100
Why can't a monk wash his own hair?

599
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,100
Why?

600
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,100
You can ask me if you're curious.

601
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,100
You can ask me if you're curious.

602
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
I need to have hair to wash my hair.

603
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
I don't have hair, so how can I wash my hair?

604
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,100
So?

605
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,100
That's not important. Are you stupid?

606
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,100
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

607
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:59,100
I'm telling you that I like you, who has nothing to do with money.

608
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,100
You're so ignorant, so ignorant, and you're doing all sorts of things.

609
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,100
You don't even know how to read a dictionary.

610
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,100
But I still like you, you fool.

611
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Hey, honey.

612
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,100
Honey.

613
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,100
I'll convince my dad no matter what.

614
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,100
He'll never hurt you.

615
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:20,100
So don't ever show up at the hotel with another woman.

616
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,100
I have to go.

617
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,100
What's wrong with her?

618
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
She's so annoying.

619
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,100
What?

620
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,100
What?

621
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,100
You want me to lend you art supplies?

622
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,100
Dal-ri, did you leave money at our bank?

623
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,100
If I leave real estate supplies, the price will go up.

624
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Art supplies are only a waste of money for me.

625
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,100
And it's not easy to manage.

626
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,100
Money is money.

627
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Why is she so clueless?

628
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,100
I'm sorry.

629
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Hello, I'm Dal-ri.

630
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
You remember me, right?

631
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
It's been a while since I last called you.

632
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
I'm not Dal-ri.

633
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,100
I'm Mr. Kim.

634
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,100
Hello, I'm Kim Dal-ri.

635
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
I'm not sure if you remember me.

636
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,100
I'm not Dal-ri. I'm sorry.

637
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,100
Are you going?

638
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,100
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

639
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,100
I'm fine.

640
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,100
I was thinking about something else.

641
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,100
Here.

642
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,100
Thank you.

643
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,100
You're welcome.

644
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,100
Is that a problem too?

645
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,100
Yes. It's too old.

646
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,100
The office and the warehouse

647
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,100
are all over the place, so I can't help but worry.

648
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,100
Why is the CCTV so messy?

649
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,100
I checked the documents.

650
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,100
I think we should replace it with a new one.

651
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,100
Yes, we should.

652
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,100
I have something to tell you.

653
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,100
Please come to my office.

654
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,100
And you, too.

655
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,100
Me?

656
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,100
What? You're going to pay me?

657
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,100
No.

658
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,100
I'll go to the bank right now.

659
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,100
The horse is down.

660
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,100
The horse is down.

661
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,100
The prize-winning queen.

662
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,100
The treasure-seeking golden city.

663
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,100
The talented cat.

664
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,100
The prize-winning captain.

665
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,100
The super high pay rate.

666
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,100
The reward rate is high.

667
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,100
There are many opportunities to pay back.

668
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,100
Hurry up and join.

669
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,100
Aomensin Peking Entertainment City 772772.com

670
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
Is it just me?

671
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,100
Am I the only one who's a day older?

672
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,100
Please talk to her.

673
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,100
You're a nurse, so you should pay me more.

674
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,100
I'm sorry.

675
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,100
I'm not good enough.

676
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,100
I'll try to get it done as soon as possible.

677
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,100
I'm sorry.

678
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,100
Are you sure you don't have money?

679
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,100
What?

680
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,100
No.

681
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,100
It's not like what you think.

682
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,100
Geumju.

683
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,100
The clothes and sunglasses that you're wearing,

684
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,100
shoes, and bag...

685
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
You know that our employees' monthly salary

686
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,100
is left behind even if we calculate it.

687
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,100
What?

688
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,100
Monthly?

689
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,100
You're wearing luxury goods all over your body,

690
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,100
but you don't have the money to pay us back.

691
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,100
I don't have money.

692
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,100
Are you telling me to believe you?

693
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
You're really overreacting.

694
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,100
I think you have some misunderstanding.

695
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,100
I won't lie to you.

696
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,100
These clothes and bags...

697
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,100
They're all from years ago.

698
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,100
I wouldn't have to pay you back.

699
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,100
And those shoes...

700
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,100
They're from this season.

701
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,100
They're from our country's three stores.

702
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,100
Those shoes...

703
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,100
The money that's not even worth a single shoe

704
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,100
is what our families have to eat, wear, and raise

705
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,100
for a month.

706
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,100
We save up for that and save up for our savings.

707
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,100
It's our lifeline.

708
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,100
It's so sad.

709
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,100
Eunju.

710
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,100
Eunju.

711
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,100
Look behind the Cheongsong Art Museum.

712
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,100
It's a development-oriented area.

713
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,100
Since five or six years ago,

714
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,100
the business has been going well.

715
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,100
Here and here and here.

716
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,100
Do you know whose land this is?

717
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,100
They gave it back as a name,

718
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,100
but they say it's all An Sangtae's land.

719
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,100
An Sangtae?

720
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,100
You know, the house where Mugak and Seonbo live.

721
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,100
They had a house that was built to protect Mugak.

722
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,100
Mugak built it himself?

723
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,100
What?

724
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,100
Anyway,

725
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,100
Lee Angban has been working in the country for seven years.

726
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,100
Why did he buy the land that was tied to the development

727
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,100
and why did he buy it so tightly?

728
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,100
What?

729
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,100
That'll help me get my mind off things.

730
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,100
Bingo!

731
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,100
Really?

732
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,100
It'll help me get my mind off things?

733
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,100
You can't tell anyone yet.

734
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,100
If you keep this a secret, you'll be in trouble.

735
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,100
You can't even sit on Mugak.

736
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,100
This isn't a land market

737
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,100
that's just a piece of art.

738
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,100
It's a company.

739
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,100
We have to build a construction company

740
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,100
and get involved in this project.

741
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,100
But even if we get this over with,

742
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,100
we won't have a place to stay.

743
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,100
They'll probably have already figured it out.

744
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,100
If not,

745
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,100
we can build it.

746
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,100
What?

747
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,100
I'll make the place,

748
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,100
so you just have to prepare the bullets.

749
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,100
For now, just you and me.

750
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,100
But I can't bury the truth.

751
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,100
What?

752
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,100
Chairman Kim?

753
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,100
I told you to wait in the room.

754
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,100
Why are you here?

755
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,100
I was going to pull out your hair

756
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,100
when I let you go.

757
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,100
You'll have to pay for this.

758
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,100
I'll just...

759
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,100
I mean, what do you mean?

760
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,100
I'm in the middle of something.

761
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,100
I know.

762
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,100
What are you doing that you're so confident?

763
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,100
Well...

764
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,100
No.

765
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,100
It's too much. It's dangerous.

766
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,100
I'll tell you when I'm done.

767
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,100
What is it?

768
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,100
I told Dr. Kim to write a talisman.

769
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,100
I'll give him a good treatment.

770
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,100
Okay?

771
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,100
Okay!

772
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,100
Talisman?

773
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,100
Okay!

774
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,100
You were good at night watch for me.

775
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,100
You should go home after you say something.

776
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,100
Where did he go?

777
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,100
I can't reach him.

778
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,100
Let go of me!

779
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,100
Are you sure you found him?

780
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,100
Where else would he be if he wasn't at home

781
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,100
and in the art gallery?

782
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,100
He'd be in there by now.

783
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,100
If you can't believe it, look for him yourself.

784
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,100
What the...

785
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,100
I'm going to quit the art gallery.

786
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,100
The director isn't here. Why are you here?

787
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,100
I don't even have my pay.

788
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,100
You don't have your pay?

789
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,100
I mean, stop bothering me with documents

790
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,100
and finding them yourself.

791
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,100
I'm sorry.

792
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,100
I'm sorry.

793
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,100
I'm sorry.

794
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,100
I'm sorry.

795
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,100
I'm sorry.

796
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,100
I'm sorry.

797
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,100
I'm sorry.

798
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,100
I'm sorry.

799
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,100
I'm sorry.

800
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,100
Who told you to quit?

801
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,100
You're still in the dark before I cut you off.

802
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,100
Don't be so arrogant.

803
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,100
Who are you?

804
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,100
Me?

805
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,100
Do you know what kind of a woman you are

806
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,100
and what kind of a man you are?

807
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,100
Are you kidding me?

808
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,100
I thought you were a real curate

809
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,100
working at an art gallery.

810
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,100
I thought you were a curate.

811
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,100
Should I tell the world what you've been doing

812
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,100
since you were a virgin?

813
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,100
You're the one who told me to do all that.

814
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,100
Well,

815
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,100
would people believe a woman who's a drunkard

816
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,100
who doesn't have a father or a mother?

817
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,100
Or would a virgin and her eldest son believe me?

818
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,100
My gosh.

819
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:18,100
You must have seen the world through your eyes.

820
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,100
Why did you use your experience

821
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,100
as a lesson?

822
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,100
Excuse me.

823
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,100
What's going on?

824
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,100
Are you okay?

825
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,100
I don't have anything to do with you,

826
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,100
so I'll just go.

827
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,100
Why doesn't it matter?

828
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,100
You're an employee of our art gallery, right?

829
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,100
Our art gallery?

830
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,100
I'm going crazy.

831
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,100
You're such a jerk.

832
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,100
Darn it!

833
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,100
This is a cheap shirt,

834
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,100
but you're still a jerk.

835
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,100
Are you okay?

836
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,100
If you're scared,

837
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,100
I'll walk you to the ground.

838
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,100
I'm fine.

839
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,100
Where did you put it?

840
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,100
I'm going to let you go!

841
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,100
Oh, Mr. Song!

842
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,100
Sim Dahee will arrive this week.

843
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,100
I'll be there.

844
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,100
I'll be there.

845
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,100
She'll arrive this week.

846
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,100
Just bear with it even if it's uncomfortable.

847
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,100
I'm not uncomfortable at all.

848
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,100
I'm fine.

849
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,100
You look very uncomfortable.

850
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,100
How long are you going to be using that?

851
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,100
But if I sleep here, where do you sleep?

852
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,100
I sleep in the living room or in the car.

853
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,100
In the car?

854
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,100
I work overtime and night shift.

855
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,100
I sometimes change my clothes.

856
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,100
I don't have to worry about it.

857
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,100
Then I'll sleep in the living room.

858
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,100
Hey!

859
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,100
I pay the rent,

860
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,100
but I have to sleep in the TV room.

861
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,100
Don't you have any conscience?

862
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,100
But what would the landlord say?

863
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,100
What do you mean?

864
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,100
It's my house until the contract ends.

865
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:51,100
Last time, it seemed a bit tricky.

866
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,100
Tricky?

867
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,100
Anyway, he's a bit mentally ill.

868
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,100
He's not old either,

869
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,100
but he needs to get a electric shock and a water shock.

870
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,100
Anyway, it's not normal.

871
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,100
Why?

872
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,100
I mean,

873
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,100
he looks a bit like someone I know.

874
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,100
Is there someone like that around you?

875
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,100
Yes.

876
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,100
What?

877
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,100
Get out of my way.

878
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,100
What is this?

879
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,100
I wanted to give you more of it

880
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,100
because you're the child.

881
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,100
I'm sorry.

882
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,540
The culprit is caught.

883
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,780
What?

884
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,140
You should've figured out the identity sooner.

885
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,820
Otherwise, you wouldn't have caught him until you used up all the money.

886
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,480
Did you see that?

887
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,220
This is the class of a police officer in Korea.

888
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,500
Why aren't you saying anything?

889
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,600
Run.

890
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:04,820
What's wrong?

891
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,020
What?

892
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,620
It's because I like you.

893
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,460
I'm so glad you're not angry.

894
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:35,560
I

895
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,240
because she got made weak.

896
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,180
But...

897
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,060
You really did so well.

898
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,320
You're really fortunate, aren't you?

899
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,100
I'm sorry.

900
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,820
Aren't you tired of it?

901
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,160
I think it's time to change.

902
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,800
Oh, yes?

903
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,360
Don't change the place the executives go.

904
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,100
The lobby and the staff lounge.

905
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,460
The staff should enjoy it too.

906
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,700
I'll tell the gallery management.

907
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,000
I told you I'm tired of it.

908
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,840
What?

909
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,240
If you want to change the atmosphere,

910
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,040
you should start with the person you choose.

911
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,980
I think cleaning will be fine.

912
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,760
What is it?

913
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,240
Why is this here?

914
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,240
Didn't you send it to Dali?

915
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,140
I think she moved out.

916
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,380
Moved out?

917
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,660
Did she take your luggage?

918
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,760
Where did she go?

919
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,420
Well...

920
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,560
You don't know?

921
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,500
The power was off all day.

922
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,800
The power is off.

923
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,800
Please try again later.

924
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,280
What's going on?

925
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,080
I'm sorry.

926
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,080
I'm sorry.

927
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,040
She said she was going to work normally.

928
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,180
I'm sure she's fine.

929
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,520
And the guy she met at the department store

930
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,280
that you told me to look for.

931
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,600
I think he's the one who caused a scene

932
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,960
at the art gallery.

933
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,920
Are you saying he's following the gangsters?

934
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,660
But nothing happened?

935
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,000
I don't know.

936
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,800
What does Dali have to do with you

937
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,000
whether you move or move out?

938
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,540
Mind your own business when you say nice things.

939
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,540
Why are you worrying about me?

940
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,340
You jerk.

941
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,960
What?

942
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,420
The collapse of Cheongsong Art Gallery?

943
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,900
The Cheongsong Art Gallery,

944
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,540
which was the symbol of Korean art,

945
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,940
was put on the record of disbandment

946
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,340
after the sudden death of Director Kim Nakcheon.

947
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,840
The accumulated financial pressure

948
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,140
was a cause of chaos for the private sector

949
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,380
and the exhibition owners.

950
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,000
The situation was so dire

951
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
that they couldn't even pay their employees.

952
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,500
The problem was that Director Kim Nakcheon

953
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,180
was in a critical situation.

954
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,040
The former director of Kim Nakcheon,

955
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,580
the daughter of Kim Dali,

956
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,340
didn't recognize the situation

957
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,380
and secretly...

958
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,320
He stole the art gallery's property

959
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,820
and is now selling luxury goods.

960
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,620
He's now in a motel that's in a relationship with a man.

961
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,960
He's now in a motel that's in a relationship with a man.

962
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,260
That's what reporter Kang said.

963
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,360
What?

964
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,460
Reporter Kang?

965
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,220
What?

966
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,980
For the sake of blood,

967
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,980
can I leave the murder gallery to a lowly successor

968
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,460
who has no ability or will

969
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,260
to support the blood of the people?

970
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:14,760
I'll think about the future of Korean culture and art.

971
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,820
Okay.

972
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,680
Hello?

973
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,140
Is this Kim Dali?

974
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:58,940
Yes, it is.

975
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,940
This is the Southern Police Station.

976
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,600
I called because of the motel robbery case.

977
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,900
You're supposed to come to the office today

978
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,360
and take over the case.

979
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,640
What?

980
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,700
I heard the culprit was caught yesterday.

981
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,240
I can't even take over the case.

982
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,040
How can I catch the culprit?

983
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,940
Where did you get that call?

984
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,800
Were you going to stay here?

985
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,500
To save on the hotel bill?

986
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,060
I didn't tell you about this.

987
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,140
What are you doing without knocking?

988
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,240
I'm sorry.

989
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,100
You don't have to tell me the reason.

990
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,480
You're just telling me this is your personal matter.

991
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,080
Isn't it because you don't want to reveal

992
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,180
or can't reveal the reason?

993
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,360
I told you to knock when you came in.

994
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,480
Is that true?

995
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,020
What do you mean?

996
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,020
What's wrong?

997
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:21,240
I don't want to talk about work.

998
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,780
You sold the house.

999
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,300
You sold it for a very expensive price.

1000
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,100
You had money.

1001
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,140
I took you to the hotel. Why?

1002
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,340
Stop it.

1003
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,840
I know

1004
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:41,220
how stupid and pathetic I am.

1005
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,420
What kind of money is that?

1006
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:47,420
You look like a beggar at that time.

1007
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,660
You realize how low I am

1008
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,260
day by day.

1009
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,600
So even if you don't pay me back...

1010
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,340
What's that money?

1011
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,640
Just give it to me.

1012
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,200
What's that?

1013
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,080
What's that money?

1014
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,520
Shouldn't you at least live?

1015
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,420
Do you know how dangerous it was?

1016
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,280
You could have died.

1017
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,920
Why doesn't a smart person know that?

1018
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,320
If your father saw this,

1019
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,560
he would be so upset.

1020
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:28,540
What do you mean, money?

1021
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,600
What did all this happen to?

1022
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,940
It's all because of money.

1023
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,480
Isn't it you?

1024
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,620
You threw the mess away

1025
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,420
by putting it on the floor of the exhibition room.

1026
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,420
You even followed me to the hotel

1027
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:47,420
in case I would be a thug.

1028
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,020
You came running from the morning

1029
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,220
and pretended to be worried.

1030
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,500
It's all because of money.

1031
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,160
It's all because of money.

1032
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,160
Isn't it?

1033
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,220
Isn't it?

1034
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,920
Do you know how I feel

1035
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,760
when I hear your voice?

1036
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:36,560
I'll approach you every day

1037
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,740
as if it's the last day of the day.

1038
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:43,040
It's strange, isn't it?

1039
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:48,080
How did our first meeting

1040
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:54,580
turn out to be so obvious?

1041
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,580
Did he eat something?

1042
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,080
Did he eat something?

1043
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:05,480
What should I do for him?

1044
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,320
Isn't something strange?

1045
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,020
The way he treated us was 180 degrees.

1046
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,020
Who would do that?

1047
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:12,860
He's the one who manages the work.

1048
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:15,860
You said it's a work that can't be reimbursed with money.

1049
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:18,220
It's all because of you.
