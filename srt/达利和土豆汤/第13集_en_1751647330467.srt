00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
Welcome to Jiamnock Village.

2
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,960
If Jaehee is active on the day you add the new composition,

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,900
just tell me that you've changed.

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,860
It won't be hard.

5
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,340
This is ridiculous.

6
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,500
I even got a tattoo.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,600
Darn it.

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,380
It's a case.

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,580
A case?

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,040
Darn it.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
Where are you going?

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,180
You punk!

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,440
Hey!

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,380
Are you going to report the deceased?

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,220
It's obvious that you'll be fired,

16
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,820
so you'll just keep it quiet

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,780
and end up with a divorce.

18
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,120
That's it.

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,420
Why would you do that?

20
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,160
Siwon is the culprit.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,660
The court wants you to be quiet.

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
What?

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,860
This is a disgrace to the family.

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,360
You're not the only one in the court.

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
You even got a video of it.

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,400
You're a child.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,140
You can't even take a step.

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,640
You thought you were a child

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,140
because of your old man's illness?

30
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,840
It's better to just let it go quietly.

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,100
That's right.

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,740
Anyway,

33
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,080
we're talking about the cleaning department and the higher-ups.

34
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,240
So just let it go.

35
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,940
Let's have a drink.

36
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,940
Okay.

37
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,940
Hey.

38
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,020
This is a snow flower.

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,660
It's the best-selling phone among all the products.

40
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,120
It's worth $3.5 million...

41
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,060
No, it's worth $500 million.

42
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,620
You're saying you got fired because of your old man's illness?

43
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,700
You're talking nonsense.

44
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,900
Hey, let go of me.

45
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,100
When was the video taken?

46
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,460
What?

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,280
Where did you say the video was taken?

48
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,840
Why did you...

49
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,480
What is it?

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,820
Mr. Won.

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
Hello.

52
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
Well...

53
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
Ms. Song.

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,820
What are you doing here?

55
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,160
I...

56
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,320
Why are you dressed like this?

57
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,000
I always dress like this except when I go to work.

58
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,660
Really? I've never seen you before.

59
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,740
Well...

60
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,440
Have some rice.

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Thank you.

62
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,540
Thank you.

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,080
thank you.

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,680
When I go to the shooting day abroad,

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,620
I say that your behavior was suspicious.

66
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,300
That's the only thing.

67
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,600
A re- Schulen championships in an art museum

68
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,140
will be held there.

69
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,000
And my mother, Yoo Yeongheun...

70
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,920
She said that she wanted to anime

71
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,140
with us and give us location

72
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,120
to be the curator at the National Center for Arts.

73
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,760
Why, Mr. Kim?

74
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,660
Why did you...

75
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,000
Did you have any complaints against him?

76
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,000
Last time,

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,760
Mr. Kim Dalin

78
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,440
filed a petition against the Cheonga University

79
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,040
for real estate issues.

80
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,540
Maybe that's why he's so suspicious.

81
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,940
Isn't it too much to call him suspicious?

82
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,780
He's a member of the National Assembly,

83
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,220
so he's thinking ofressing Bu thank you

84
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,420
in his own way.

85
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,040
Do you have any preventive measures

86
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,740
to prevent locations from重 camper shake,

87
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,660
leakage, or anything else from normal gay couples?

88
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,520
Before we ever apartment or random agendas,

89
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,460
he went on his wash and test.

90
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,900
Wait...

91
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,100
Probably because

92
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,700
his cell phone's also a pesky phone.

93
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,700
Okay.

94
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,240
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

95
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,780
No way.

96
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,220
Why is our director here?

97
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,680
Does the director wish to see you

98
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,020
in person when you're working abroad?

99
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,420
No. That's not possible.

100
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,420
We can't just ignore it.

101
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,160
When a work is released overseas,

102
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,700
three curators will report it to the press.

103
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,300
Because the scratch may be damaged

104
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,900
as the work is released.

105
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,000
The most exciting PG game on the online market

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,640
on the new Beijing Entertainment City 772772.

107
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,040
The mahjong is over.

108
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,640
The mahjong is over 2.

109
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,140
The prize-winning queen.

110
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,800
The treasure-seeking golden city.

111
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
The talented cat.

112
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,440
The prize-winning captain.

113
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,880
The high rate of compensation.

114
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,880
The high rate of reward.

115
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,680
There are many opportunities to get revenge.

116
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
Hurry up and join

117
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,040
the new Beijing Entertainment City 772772.

118
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,700
It's that day.

119
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,540
The day before the director dies.

120
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,440
Yes?

121
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,340
Director,

122
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,880
I found something strange in New York yesterday.

123
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,520
I think someone's been here.

124
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,760
What are you talking about?

125
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,920
I checked everything when I left work yesterday.

126
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,020
Wait.

127
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,960
Where did you come from?

128
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,020
New York?

129
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,080
The New York in the US?

130
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,020
Yes, the US is in New York.

131
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,260
So it's not in China or Southeast Asia?

132
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,900
Yes, it's in the US.

133
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,440
Find it.

134
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,400
Find the missing person.

135
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,540
Find the person.

136
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,880
This is it. Here.

137
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,820
The writer, Cindy Guston, right?

138
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,120
Yes, that's right.

139
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Yes, the frame.

140
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,060
Is it the same?

141
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,340
I think it's the same.

142
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,640
I don't think it's the same.

143
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,140
It's different.

144
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,780
atau

145
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,120
Horrying.

146
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,000
Tissue?

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,300
I can't start over with you.

148
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,340
I can do that for my family.

149
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,300
Right?

150
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,300
You're a member of our family too.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What?

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,800
Do you know what your mother did to Dali today?

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,300
Was it your mother?

154
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,100
I don't know what to do because we're a family of beans.

155
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,300
Right. Why do you keep hitting me?

156
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
You should be hit harder.

157
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,500
You're a loser.

158
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,200
How can you let a guy come into your house?

159
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:48,300
I want to tell you everything about me.

160
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:58,300
I heard that someone who lives with my father went to see you.

161
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:11,300
Are you okay?

162
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,300
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,300
I hope this never happens again.

164
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
Excuse me.

165
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,300
I'm a little tired.

166
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
I want to rest.

167
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,300
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,300
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,300
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,300
I want to rest.

175
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,300
Really?

176
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,300
I'll go up there and do something simple.

177
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,300
No.

178
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,300
I'll just sleep.

179
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:06,300
I don't need anything.

180
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:18,300
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:53,300
What do you want me to do?

182
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:18,300
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:48,300
Kim Si-young, that bastard.

184
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,300
He was a customer at the store I worked at.

185
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
What store?

186
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Ouch!

187
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,300
Of course, I knew my resume was fake.

188
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:15,300
At first, he pretended not to know, but later on, he threatened to blow it all up if I didn't listen to him.

189
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:23,300
What did you do?

190
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:32,300
I told him to take out the painting from the warehouse.

191
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,300
You took out the painting registered in the museum?

192
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,300
No wonder.

193
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,300
I felt like I was in the warehouse.

194
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:47,300
So what does this video have to do with the fact that you took out the painting from the warehouse?

195
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,300
I changed the picture in the video.

196
00:13:52,300 --> 00:14:00,300
How to take out the painting from the warehouse.

197
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:11,300
I knew it would be a quick hit if I just took it out, so I changed it to a fake one.

198
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:21,300
But what was different from the other time was that Kim Si-young told me to bring the painting.

199
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:31,300
And bring back the fake picture that the director ruined.

200
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,300
What did the director say?

201
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,300
Did he say anything?

202
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,300
He said the frame was broken.

203
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
You're not looking for me?

204
00:14:52,300 --> 00:15:00,300
Yes.

205
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,300
Why aren't you saying anything?

206
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:10,300
But why are you telling me to put this back?

207
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Aren't you going to sell it?

208
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
Do what I told you to do.

209
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Don't be interested in useless things.

210
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,300
What's wrong with you?

211
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,300
You told me to put the original picture back in place?

212
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:32,300
If you're going to do it as it is, why did you do such a complicated thing?

213
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:40,300
If you look at the time, Kim Si-young made a fake painting with a real one, and the director took a video of him looking for it.

214
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,300
After taking the video, he changed the picture back to the original.

215
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Is that right?

216
00:15:53,300 --> 00:16:03,300
So the video was the purpose.

217
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:33,300
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:53,300 --> 00:17:03,300
I'm sorry.

219
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:33,300
I'm sorry.

220
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:43,300
Hey.

221
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,300
What's going on in the morning?

222
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:55,300
Let's talk on the way.

223
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,300
I don't have time.

224
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,300
I don't have time.

225
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,300
Get in.

226
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:12,300
Don't get in.

227
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Don't get in.

228
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
Take my car.

229
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,300
I'll take care of you, so get in my car.

230
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,300
Mr. Shin.

231
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Talk to me first.

232
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,300
You have something to talk to me about.

233
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,300
Let's talk while eating breakfast.

234
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:36,300
I have something to talk to you about.

235
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:43,300
How long are you going to listen to this nonsense?

236
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
I'll call you after work.

237
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:55,300
I have something to tell you, too.

238
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:25,300
I'm sorry.

239
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:52,300
I've been managing the gallery model for you, but the contract period is almost over.

240
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,300
You take care of it.

241
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:01,300
You can rent the art gallery's possessions or buy new ones if you need them.

242
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,300
Decorate it as you like.

243
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Excuse me.

244
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,300
This one.

245
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
Cheneua Collection?

246
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,300
These days, the art gallery is less childish than the luxury exhibition.

247
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,300
You can't empty the exhibition hall with the exhibition removed.

248
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,300
But wouldn't it look a little weak to fill it with the collection?

249
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,300
You have to show me the cleanliness.

250
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Exhibitions aren't so childish.

251
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,300
I'm done talking to Cheneua.

252
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,300
You just have to decide.

253
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Brother.

254
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
What about the lawyer?

255
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,300
I think it's better to choose a lawyer specialized in this area than a lawyer.

256
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:46,300
You said you met your father.

257
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:56,300
Is that what you think?

258
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,300
I don't know what your father said, but don't mind it.

259
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,300
I'm confused because the situation is not good.

260
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,300
I don't care.

261
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,300
That's a relief.

262
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:17,300
I'll just talk to you and me.

263
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,300
I'm sorry.

264
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
I'm sorry.

265
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,300
Brother.

266
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:29,300
I should have said that when I met you again.

267
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:39,300
I'm sorry.

268
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:49,300
I'm sorry.

269
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,300
I didn't think of anything.

270
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,300
I'll pray for the life and the deceased.

271
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
I knew then.

272
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,300
You're the only woman in my life.

273
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,300
It's the same in the past and now.

274
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,300
It will be forever.

275
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,300
Why are you saying that?

276
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,300
So the more I look like I'm going crazy.

277
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
I was young.

278
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,300
I was in a dangerous position in the group at the time.

279
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,300
I was afraid to face the prejudice of our society that values ​​blood.

280
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,300
Even if you give me an excuse,

281
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,300
I can't forgive myself for making an irreversible choice.

282
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
Jung-ae.

283
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:44,300
But now I've decided to stop blaming myself and regretting it.

284
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,300
Give me a chance.

285
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:54,300
I'll regret it for the rest of my life by your side.

286
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:59,300
I'll live by giving you a reason.

287
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,300
And now you should stop coming into my shadow.

288
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,300
What you want to protect.

289
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,300
Cleaning, your father, the art gallery.

290
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,300
Protect it in front of me.

291
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:21,300
I'll make sure no one ever touches you again.

292
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:31,300
Let's get married.

293
00:23:51,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Are you okay?

294
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:16,300
You know what kind of danger our director is taking and passing this data, right?

295
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,300
If you take advantage of him and throw him away, you're a really bad person.

296
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,300
You'll be punished.

297
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Hey, you bitch.

298
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Who do you think you are to cheat on someone's son?

299
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,300
You're a good-looking woman.

300
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:39,300
What kind of woman do you think you are?

301
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:44,300
How am I supposed to work if I take out my computer hard drive?

302
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
What do I do about the next exhibition?

303
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,300
I went through all my receipts and my business card.

304
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,300
And I went into the lunch menu.

305
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
Why did I go into the menu?

306
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,300
Why are you emptying the office without saying anything?

307
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,300
What kind of interrogation did I and the director get?

308
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:10,300
Director.

309
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,300
You're having a hard time, but you're worried about us.

310
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,300
I'm sorry. You were worried, right?

311
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,300
I'm sorry.

312
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,300
What happened?

313
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:27,300
I heard you were moving to another art gallery.

314
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
That's...

315
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:35,300
That's...

316
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:55,420
How could you do that to your grandfather with a

317
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,300
I'm sorry.

318
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
No, it's not.

319
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,300
I'm sure it would have been hard to break up under such a circumstance.

320
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:09,300
Thank you for your support.

321
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:14,300
I have something to tell you, too.

322
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:21,300
I have something to ask for your understanding.

323
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:33,300
I'm going to move to another art gallery before Basquiat.

324
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:40,300
I know you've worked hard to prepare the exhibition, but I'm not good enough.

325
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:47,300
I'm sorry I had to make this choice.

326
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:52,300
I'll look for an art gallery to give up.

327
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:58,300
I'll take Basquiat if I have to.

328
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:06,300
And I'm going to take the works that I'm going to auction at the auction house.

329
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:12,300
My grandfather filed a lawsuit.

330
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:20,300
Sir, if it's because of our salary, I think we can last a few more months.

331
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:27,300
Yeah, we're all art artists. We should share our pain.

332
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,300
No, we have to get ready for the next exhibition.

333
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:37,300
We need extra money to start a profit business.

334
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,300
We have to cut the money.

335
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,300
Are you going to clean up the money?

336
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,300
Then are you going to say bye to Jin Sung-moo and us?

337
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
Who are you?

338
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,300
Huh?

339
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,300
No, you're not the money cook.

340
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,300
Oh, right.

341
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:06,300
Oh, yes.

342
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Are you okay?

343
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,300
I'll call you after work.

344
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:32,300
I have something to tell you.

345
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,300
You're like a potato soup.

346
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:46,300
If you get close, it gets dirty and smells.

347
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,300
What is it?

348
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:15,300
Let's go.

349
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
Enjoy your meal.

350
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Thank you.

351
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,300
Let's eat.

352
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,300
Let's eat.

353
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:34,300
Eat.

354
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,300
Eat.

355
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:48,300
You have to eat to fight or anything.

356
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,300
Why?

357
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,300
Every time our employees get in the way because they don't like it,

358
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,300
that's what the director said.

359
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:05,300
He even cooked for us.

360
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,300
It's because of Jang Tae-jin, right?

361
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,300
What does he say?

362
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,300
Does he want you to give up?

363
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,300
It's not like that.

364
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,300
If it's not like that...

365
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,300
Why are you looking for a dog that's been hit by rain?

366
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:25,300
Why are you looking for a dog that's been hit by rain?

367
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,300
What's wrong with you?

368
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,300
What is it?

369
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,300
You're the one who's in the mood.

370
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
We're the money.

371
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,300
What's wrong with you?

372
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,300
What's wrong with you?

373
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,300
Oh, my God.

374
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,300
Look at his face.

375
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,300
I can't live.

376
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
I'm really sorry.

377
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,300
I'm really not doing this for anyone.

378
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,300
I'm really not doing this for anyone.

379
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,300
I'm really not doing this for anyone.

380
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,300
Look at me.

381
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Open your eyes.

382
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,300
Neck, too.

383
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
Oh, my God.

384
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:02,300
Why are you wrinkling?

385
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,300
From a woman's point of view,

386
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:10,300
our director has enough competitiveness.

387
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,300
He's so strong.

388
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,300
He's strong.

389
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,300
He's strong in his life.

390
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,300
He's not feeding me.

391
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,300
He's a good man.

392
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,300
He's a good man.

393
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,300
He's a smart...

394
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,300
He's a smart man.

395
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:35,300
How much does he know about smartness?

396
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,300
Let's watch a drama this morning.

397
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,300
Even if you meet a rich man,

398
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,300
you'll only get a blackout.

399
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,300
You don't treat a woman like that because you have money.

400
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
You know what?

401
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,300
A man who's going to be a mother-in-law

402
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,300
will be beaten up by a water bottle.

403
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:58,300
He'll shake his head and hit him.

404
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,300
If you're treated like that,

405
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,300
you'd better just get a little bit of a good man.

406
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,300
I'm right.

407
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Oh, my God.

408
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Eat first.

409
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,300
Huh?

410
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,300
Mother-in-law.

411
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,300
Mother-in-law, I'm sorry.

412
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,300
I'm right.

413
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,300
Mother-in-law.

414
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:28,300
Oh, my God.

415
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,300
Hey, Moon-hwa.

416
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Oh, my God.

417
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:43,300
Hey, Moon-hwa.

418
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,300
Hey.

419
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:53,300
You're calling me.

420
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,300
What did you say yesterday?

421
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Father, you're looking for your father to live with.

422
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,300
You're looking for you to live with.

423
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:04,300
You're going to stop dating with us now?

424
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,300
Huh?

425
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,300
Is family a thing that breaks up when you see it?

426
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,300
If that's the case, I'd like to.

427
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,300
So what does that mean?

428
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,300
You don't like the son of a potato soup restaurant?

429
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,300
Take the construction company with your father.

430
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,300
I'll take care of the rich potato soup.

431
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:29,300
But who's the rich F&B?

432
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,300
Huh?

433
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,300
The chairman is my father and the director is me.

434
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,300
You're the first-class executive.

435
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:42,300
Then you know that the first-class executive is mine.

436
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,300
What?

437
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,300
Potato soup.

438
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,300
When do you do that when others ignore you and say you smell?

439
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:58,300
I'm telling you, I'm going to give you construction money to separate you from the family.

440
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Wake up, you punk.

441
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:10,300
Do you think you'll get along with Kim Dal-ri because you're doing this?

442
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,300
You know who Kim Dal-ri is, right?

443
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:20,300
I went back and forth at the art museum, so I guess you noticed.

444
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,300
What?

445
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,300
No.

446
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,300
I can't.

447
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,300
This doesn't matter to the family or the construction company.

448
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,300
I'll just talk as an older brother.

449
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,300
Don't touch Jang Tae-jin.

450
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
If you touch him, we can't handle it.

451
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,300
Our money?

452
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,300
It's going to collapse in a moment.

453
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,300
Are you the first-class executive Jang Tae-jin?

454
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,300
What?

455
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,300
What's the deal with you holding on to Jang Tae-jin?

456
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,300
Did you do something wrong?

457
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,300
What are you talking about?

458
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,300
What do I do?

459
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Oh, my God.

460
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,300
It's a world.

461
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,300
If it's a political, judicial, and legal world, don't you know you're going to get mixed up?

462
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,300
What's good for a small company like us to get in touch with a big company?

463
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,300
That's why I'm saying this.

464
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,300
Yeah, that's why.

465
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,300
Wait a minute.

466
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,300
It's already time.

467
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,300
I have a meeting.

468
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:31,300
I'll go.

469
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,300
I definitely warned you.

470
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:44,300
I'm not going to quit.

471
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,300
I want it to be a little more special, but not this common design.

472
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Oh, you don't like it?

473
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,300
Then...

474
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,300
It's a diamond from Square Mixed Cut.

475
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,300
A rare design as a wedding ring.

476
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,300
Then could you wait a minute?

477
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:32,300
I'll get another wedding ring.

478
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
It's a wedding ring.

479
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,300
Wow, that's a big one.

480
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,300
How much?

481
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,300
How much is the whole apartment?

482
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,300
Who's the bride?

483
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:46,300
I'm so jealous.

484
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,300
The frog restaurant was fun, too.

485
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,300
I'm so lucky.

486
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,300
You can go to the exhibition whenever you want.

487
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,300
I went to the workshop.

488
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,300
But we don't have a director.

489
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
But we don't have a director.

490
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,300
Why?

491
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,300
You didn't even notice.

492
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,300
Our director is doing that at the art hall.

493
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,300
That time?

494
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,300
That time?

495
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,300
That's pretty.

496
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,300
So I fought with Jang Tae-jin.

497
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:22,300
At first, I organized all of our directors in the hall.

498
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,300
I didn't even see the director's face.

499
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,300
I don't know what our director is going to do.

500
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,300
If you don't see his face, you don't know how he feels.

501
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,300
Jang Tae-jin already got a wedding ring.

502
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,300
It's a dream come true.

503
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,300
Who gets what?

504
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,300
Oh, my God.

505
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
What did you just say?

506
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,300
What did you just say?

507
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:55,300
Other writers are so arrogant that they're going to watch the investigation results.

508
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,300
I didn't even get to talk to them.

509
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:03,300
But Yoo Young-sun, Park Hee-eun, and Bu Jae-eon will meet up with them.

510
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,300
And if I tell you what's going on, I think you'll make a work.

511
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,300
Then let's do what we can do right now.

512
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,300
Then Yoo Young-sun and Park Hee-eun's studio is in the countryside.

513
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,300
I and Song Kyu are going there.

514
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,300
We have a car.

515
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,300
It's hard to go to the studio without the director.

516
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,300
Who are you trying to clean up?

517
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:37,300
If you clean up as you please, it's organized.

518
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,300
You felt it, too, right?

519
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,300
That's not just my eyes.

520
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,300
It's the eyes of a couple.

521
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,300
I think so.

522
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,300
I think you're right.

523
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,300
What?

524
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,300
I just ran to the exhibition room with Jin Sang-woo.

525
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,300
It was so powerful.

526
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,300
Do you know what I said to the director?

527
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,300
Director Hwang is the director. I'm Jin Sang-woo.

528
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,300
Here he is.

529
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,300
Who are you trying to clean up as you please?

530
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,300
If you clean up as you please, it's organized.

531
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,300
You're pooping.

532
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,300
I'm not going to clean up.

533
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,300
Right? Like that.

534
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,300
You're so annoying.

535
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,300
It's not like this.

536
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,300
Can you hear me well?

537
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,300
What's the rush in the art gallery?

538
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,300
I suddenly got kicked out of the exhibition.

539
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,300
Is this the time?

540
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,300
I'm going to the VASCAYA exhibition.

541
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,300
You can turn it around.

542
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,300
I'll give you the collection.

543
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,300
If I could, I would have done it earlier.

544
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,300
There must have been a reason why you didn't.

545
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
It was because of my greed.

546
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,300
What?

547
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,300
Greed that I don't want to give the work for free.

548
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,300
Greed that I want to open a good exhibition at our museum.

549
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,300
Because of that greed,

550
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,300
I couldn't think of the damage you caused.

551
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,300
I was busy delivering food on the street.

552
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,300
I spent a lot of money with my small hands.

553
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,300
When I think of you, who would have been ordered again,

554
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,300
it breaks my heart.

555
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,300
So unlike other people's money,

556
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,300
I feel your money is heavy.

557
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,300
What do you mean?

558
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,300
I've been too selfish.

559
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,300
I only thought about my situation.

560
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,300
I didn't consider your position.

561
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,300
You suffered a lot of financial damage because of me.

562
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,300
You must have been in trouble at home and at work.

563
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,300
I want to return the investment.

564
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,300
I've already made up my mind.

565
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,300
I made the choice.

566
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,300
You did what you had to do.

567
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,300
Is it because of the person who lives with my father?

568
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,300
No, it's not.

569
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,300
Then is it because of Jang Taejin?

570
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,300
Mr. Jin.

571
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,300
I heard that she's looking for a ring to propose.

572
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,300
Is it because of that?

573
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,300
No.

574
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,300
Then keep being selfish!

575
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,300
Whether you consider my position or not,

576
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,300
don't make me feel anxious

577
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,300
because of the money I'm in trouble with.

578
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,300
I'm the one who's paying for the damage.

579
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,300
Even if you don't make the first move,

580
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,300
I'll be the first to fall when I think of the main event.

581
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,300
So until then,

582
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,300
you can't go anywhere.

583
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,300
Oh, my.

584
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,300
This is a bit early, right?

585
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,300
The person who likes money is in trouble with money.

586
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,300
Why did she do that?

587
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,300
I don't know.

588
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,300
She's paying you back, but she's in trouble too?

589
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,300
I think I know what she's thinking.

590
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,300
What?

591
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,300
It's the only string that's connected to the director.

592
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,300
I'm anxious because she's going to lose that string.

593
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,300
Even if she loses that string,

594
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,300
if it continues, that's real love.

595
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,300
It's strange, Ms. Hwang.

596
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,300
I know.

597
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,300
She was so good.

598
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,300
Why did she live alone?

599
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,300
She's a fake.

600
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,300
She must have been tortured.

601
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,300
Hello.

602
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,300
I think we can make a bigger picture of this.

603
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,300
What is this?

604
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,300
Here.

605
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,300
Here too.

606
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,300
What is this?

607
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,300
I'm sorry for not telling you last time.

608
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,300
I'm sorry. I won't do that again.

609
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,300
Oh, this is that, right?

610
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,300
Chakki's skin secret.

611
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,300
Give it to me.

612
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,300
No, I'll do it.

613
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,300
Oh, my.

614
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,300
Don't spread the word.

615
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,300
Don't spread it. Let's spread it among ourselves.

616
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,300
So that we can be pretty.

617
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,300
I don't know.

618
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,300
Oh, right.

619
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,300
They gave out the Basquiat Jeon for cleaning.

620
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,300
Basquiat Jeon?

621
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,300
It would be a hit if they opened it. Why?

622
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,300
Why would they? It's going to be a pressure.

623
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,300
Did the case get out of hand?

624
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,300
Isn't that the art museum that you went to

625
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,300
after marrying Jang Taejin?

626
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,300
I heard that the wedding ring was a big hit.

627
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,300
So you got the gallery cancelled

628
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,300
and left it to Cheongsong for the painting.

629
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,300
I guess Segi is the chairman of the parliament.

630
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,300
What do you have?

631
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,300
How long are you going to keep touching it?

632
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,300
Don't you know that it's going to be a hit?

633
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,300
You're going to beat An Sangtae.

634
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,300
Whether you hit him or beat him to death,

635
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,300
you should see the solution.

636
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,300
I'm also looking at the time, father.

637
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,300
So when is that time?

638
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,300
After you split up the business and the business?

639
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,300
After you became the head of the construction company?

640
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,300
Or after I died?

641
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,300
No, that's...

642
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,300
You're so sensitive.

643
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,300
You thought you could take my back?

644
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,300
What did you do in my family?

645
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,300
Do you know how much I spent on your two sons?

646
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,300
Father.

647
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,300
What?

648
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,300
Do you think I'm laughing?

649
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,300
You thought I was just saying

650
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,300
that I was going to end it with money?

651
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,300
Get out of here.

652
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,300
If you can't do it, I'll do it.

653
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,300
Let's go to An Sangtae's house.

654
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,300
Do you think I'm doing this because of An Sangtae?

655
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,300
What?

656
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,300
If you were that much of a coward,

657
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,300
you wouldn't have even started.

658
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,300
Oh, my.

659
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,300
Why is the clock ticking so fast?

660
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,300
Is something wrong?

661
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,300
Hey.

662
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,300
A wedding ring?

663
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,300
With Kim Dal?

664
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,300
What are you doing?

665
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,300
What the heck?

666
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,300
The clock.

667
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,300
You should go.

668
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,300
Go.

669
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,300
So...

670
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:48,300
You should think about how to handle this situation.

671
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,300
I won't just sit here.

672
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,300
You must have some kind of misunderstanding.

673
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,300
Get lost!

674
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,300
Gosh.

675
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,300
What if he really wants something?

676
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,300
What are you going to do?

677
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,300
He hit me because he thought he could.

678
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,300
He's dead.

679
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,300
How can he just sit there?

680
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,300
Hello?

681
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,300
Let's go.

682
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,300
Why are you already here?

683
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,300
Did something happen at work?

684
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,300
No, it's nothing.

685
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,300
I don't think it's nothing.

686
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,300
Don't worry.

687
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,300
Everything will be solved soon.

688
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,300
Our boss, Jin Ki Cheol, decided to solve it.

689
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,300
Ki Cheol is finally paying for his meal.

690
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,300
Right, Ki Cheol?

691
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,300
Of course.

692
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,300
You punk.

693
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,300
I'll go wash up.

694
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,300
Dad, you did a great job today!

695
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,300
What's wrong?

696
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,300
What's wrong?

697
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,300
What's wrong?

698
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,300
It's ridiculous that he passed the US airport search.

699
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,300
He searched for x-ray images of every work,

700
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,300
but he couldn't find a 100-gram drug?

701
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,300
That's all a film camera.

702
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,300
Who in the US brings a film camera?

703
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,300
If what Princess Na said is true,

704
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,300
it wasn't a picture, it was a frame.

705
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,300
It was a video of the boss looking for drugs in a frame.

706
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,300
If this gets caught, we can't even get a bad box.

707
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,300
I know.

708
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,300
But why is Kim Si Young...

709
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,300
Why is An Sang Tae...

710
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,300
Why is he trying to kill the art club employees?

711
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,300
We should ask Kim Si Young.

712
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,300
Kim Si Young.

713
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,300
What if it's already exposed?

714
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,300
There was a pile of drugs.

715
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,300
Darn it.

716
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,300
Darn it.

717
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,300
I'll kill you!

718
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,300
Hey, Kim Si Young.

719
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,300
What?

720
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,300
Darn it.

721
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,300
Kim Si Young!

722
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,300
Kim Si Young!

723
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,300
Darn it.

724
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,300
Darn it.

725
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,300
It's time to go home, so the bus will leave.

726
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,300
Go to Yeoncheon by bus,

727
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,300
and call a taxi there.

728
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,300
You should come into my shadow now.

729
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,300
I'll protect you.

730
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,300
I'll protect what you want to protect.

731
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,300
The cleaning, your father's art club.

732
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,300
Protect it by my side.

733
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,300
I'll make sure no one ever touches you again.

734
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,300
Let's get married.

735
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,300
I know that's already over.

736
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,300
Marry me.

737
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,300
I have someone I love.

738
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,300
I understand.

739
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,300
I made a mistake.

740
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,300
I can be rebellious.

741
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,300
If things get tough,

742
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,300
I want to lean on you.

743
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,300
This is not the time to talk about this.

744
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,300
I was going to wait for you with patience.

745
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,300
But I'm getting anxious.

746
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,300
I'm trying to be patient.

747
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,300
Jihun.

748
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,300
You'll marry me anyway.

749
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,300
So make a wise decision.

750
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:09,300
The more you clean up, the harder it gets.

751
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,300
I'm sorry.

752
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,300
I'm sorry.

753
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,300
I'm sorry.

754
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,300
I'm sorry.

755
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,300
I'm sorry.

756
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,300
I'm sorry.

757
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,300
I'm sorry.

758
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,300
I'm sorry.

759
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,300
I'm sorry.

760
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,300
I'm sorry.

761
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,300
I'm sorry.

762
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,300
I'm sorry.

763
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,300
I'm sorry.

764
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,300
I'm sorry.

765
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,300
Hello?

766
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,300
I'm at the rooftop. Are you home?

767
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,300
Yes.

768
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,300
Can you check if Dalli is home?

769
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,300
I think she's home. Her phone is off.

770
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,300
What's going on?

771
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,300
Kim Siyeong is on the phone.

772
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,300
I can't tell you because it's a private investigation.

773
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,300
Kim Siyeong became a suspect in the case.

774
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,300
He's a very unusual guy.

775
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,300
Dalli.

776
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,300
Dalli.

777
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,300
Dalli.

778
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,300
Dalli.

779
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,300
It's me.

780
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,300
You know the cleaning art museum's contact information, right?

781
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,300
The director?

782
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,300
He's at the office to meet the writer.

783
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,300
There's still time.

784
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,300
I'll try to contact the writer.

785
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,300
I was worried about him because

786
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,300
he was supposed to be here a while ago.

787
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,300
Dalli, I'm home.

788
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,300
I'm not home.

789
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,300
I'm going to talk to Quaddurup.

790
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,300
He's at the office.

791
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,300
I'm sorry about this, Dalli.

792
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,300
I'm going to talk to Quaddurup.

793
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,300
Dalli.

794
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,300
Dalli, are you home?

795
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,300
Dalli, I'm home.

796
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,300
I'm going to talk to Quaddurup.

797
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,300
Quaddurup.

798
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,300
Dalli.

799
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,300
Dalli.

800
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,300
Dalli.

801
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,300
Dalli.

802
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,120
Bae maneuvers to start a fight

803
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,000
If only we could keep her on, she would have gone away

804
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,520
She would've stayed be it is with a cab

805
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,260
Let's add bell pepper marks!

806
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,140
Except for the red one,

807
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,240
She did grow up to look a little using domestic products a lot.

808
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,140
I knew she could $ kangkong soup well,

809
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,340
That's why I was wondering if she'd have a son of her own.

810
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,680
I was neatening up Caps th,

811
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,640
Then I picked a rather moist mix.

812
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,780
But it's a little strange.

813
00:56:50,080 --> 00:57:00,180
Why are you channeling my

814
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,120
whine-whied contrived truth

815
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:11,120
I'm sorry.

816
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,120
Sir!

817
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,120
Sir!

818
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,120
Sir!

819
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,120
Sir!

820
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,120
Sir!

821
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,120
Sir!

822
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:21,120
What's wrong with you?

823
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,120
This is yours, right?

824
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:34,120
This is yours, right?

825
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,120
I'm sorry to surprise you.

826
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,120
Then you should go home safely.

827
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,120
Thank you.

828
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,120
Hey, driver.

829
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,120
Where should I go to get a new wedding?

830
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:53,120
I heard it was where the brick factory used to be.

831
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,120
It's not good for you to go alone at this hour.

832
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,120
You have to call a taxi.

833
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,120
I'll be right there.

834
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:07,120
Stupid idiot, stupid idiot, stupid idiot.

835
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:17,120
Stupid idiot, stupid idiot.

836
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:33,120
I'm sorry.

837
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,120
Get in my car.

838
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:33,120
I'm sorry.

839
00:59:53,120 --> 01:00:03,120
Mr. Jin.

840
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:13,120
How did you get here?

841
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:23,120
Mr. Shin.

842
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,120
What's wrong?

843
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:29,120
Why are you doing this?

844
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:33,120
I'm sorry for everything.

845
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:40,120
I'll do what you want.

846
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:46,120
Don't go anywhere.

847
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:50,120
Stay with me.

848
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:54,120
Mr. Shin.

849
01:00:54,120 --> 01:01:06,120
I love you.

850
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:14,120
I love you.

851
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:18,120
I'm sorry.

852
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:30,120
I can't be with you anymore.

853
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:40,120
Between the rich and the poor.

854
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:48,120
I want to love you warmly in a fair relationship.

855
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:58,120
I love you, too.

856
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:09,120
How did you fall in love at first sight?

857
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,120
It's not easy to explain.

858
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,120
It's fate.

859
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:26,120
I'll give you this love.

860
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:33,120
You're the only one I've decided on.

861
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:43,120
I can't live without you anymore.

862
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:49,120
Your eyes that look at me.

863
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:57,120
I can't live without you anymore.

864
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:01,120
How long are you going to be Mr. Jin?

865
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:05,120
Then what do you like?

866
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,120
Honey!

867
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,120
I keep wanting to see you.

868
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,120
Honey!

869
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,120
Should I tell the world what happened that night?

870
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,120
It's all dust.

871
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,120
But it's also a star.

872
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,120
There will be a deal between the rich and the poor.

873
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,120
The louder, the better.

874
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,120
I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble.

875
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,120
Stop right now.
