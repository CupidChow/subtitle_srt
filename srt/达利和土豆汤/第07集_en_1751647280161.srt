1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Next Day

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,500
It's a hole.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,000
Where is this place?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hey, hey, hey.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hey, you punk.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What are you doing?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,500
You're going to hit me.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,000
What?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,700
I'm going to eat a game of chess

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,500
and live a happy life.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,800
I don't care who you are.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,500
I'm going to kill you

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,000
if I ever catch that woman again.

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Get off me.

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,000
Look at me.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
What did you say?

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What did you say?

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,500
Mr. Ji, no!

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,000
Don't do it.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,500
I should've killed you back then.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,500
No.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Please don't do anything.

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Oh, no.

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Oh, no.

26
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Oh, no.

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm in trouble.

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Did you all see that?

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,000
I won't get along with you.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,500
The camera is rolling.

31
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,500
You guys do it.

32
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
I'll call the police.

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,000
Jang Jingu, you punk!

34
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm telling you.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Whenever you say one more word,

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
your sentence will increase.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But that's...

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You've been in the rapist's prison

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,500
for three years, six months, and seven years.

40
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,000
And you were in prison last year.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You were punished for raping a rapist

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,500
and you've been a criminal for three years.

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,000
You're sentenced to 10 years or more.

44
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
The camera you like was clearly captured

45
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
at the crime scene.

46
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,500
You have DNA from your family.

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
There's a reason to capture you.

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Nevertheless,

49
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,000
you know that the victim's brain is a negative.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I know a lot of doctors who are unhappy.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And depending on how you behave from now on,

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,500
the diagnosis will change a lot.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,500
I'm explaining again in case you don't understand.

54
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,000
But depending on what I say,

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
you might never see the sun again.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Do you understand?

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Where's my money?

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,500
You're going to use it up, right?

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But that's...

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,500
Did you use it all up?

62
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Yes.

63
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Even if you came home a minute late,

64
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,000
the next round was the quarterfinals.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You saw it too, right?

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The quarterfinals in my hand.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you two work together,

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
it's a perfect three-final.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's what's called art.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,500
You're so stupid.

71
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Hey!

72
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
You punk!

73
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,000
Let go of me!

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,500
Let go of my kid!

75
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Let go of my kid!

76
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,000
Let go of my kid!

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,500
Let go of my kid!

78
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,000
Let go of my kid!

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,500
Let go of my kid!

80
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,000
Let go of my kid!

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,500
I know you're mad,

82
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
but that's not how it works.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If you're a jerk, you get a beating.

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you get a lawsuit from the National Human Rights Commission,

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,500
you'll get a fine.

86
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,000
Thank you.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,500
You and your boyfriend

88
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
are so annoying.

89
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,000
My boyfriend?

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The one who kicked you out earlier.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,500
No, my boyfriend.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,500
Your boyfriend?

93
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,000
No.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And you're not even a boyfriend.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,500
You're not even a boyfriend.

96
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
You're just a cop, and you're making a scene?

97
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,000
You're such a big-time bully.

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Just kill Seungjae and live.

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,500
Go inside.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,500
Were you a cop?

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's nice to see you here.

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,500
What's your relationship with him?

105
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,000
Is it a habit or a job disease

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,500
to cut off everything and ask questions?

107
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,000
What kind of relationship is that?

108
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,000
What's your relationship with Dali?

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,500
Dali?

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They're all my friends if they're famous.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Byunghun, Wooseong, and Bin are all my friends.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
When will our So come in?

113
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We have to eat together.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,500
Aren't you going to tell me?

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're really...

116
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,000
Kim Dali, you're not someone to talk back to.

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Won'tak.

118
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay. Are you done?

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes.

120
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
But how do you know our Won'tak?

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Our...

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Our Won'tak?

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,500
You two knew each other?

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,500
What do you mean we knew each other?

125
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
We're living together...

126
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm the owner.

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,500
I own the roof of my house and the building.

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,500
Weren't you living alone?

129
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,000
We can live alone. What does it matter?

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,500
That's...

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The upstairs is so noisy.

132
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,000
I heard the noise from the floor is serious.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,500
Someone who doesn't care about the community...

134
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,000
I told you. The downstairs owner is crazy.

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Why are you putting this on? It's so messy.

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I see. You're the owner of Won'tak's house.

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,500
I look forward to working with you.

138
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
He's so full of blood.

139
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Did he use a bed?

140
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
I told you he did.

141
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
That's why he can't sleep.

142
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
What nonsense.

143
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
That house is so messy.

144
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,000
He's sorry. He's warning you next time.

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
When did he...

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,500
You're done introducing yourselves, right?

147
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's go now.

148
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,000
You've worked so hard, too.

149
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,000
Take care.

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with him?

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,500
Be quiet. I'll explain everything at home.

152
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,000
It's a secret. You and I are living together.

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,500
You and I are living together.

154
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
I said be quiet.

155
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,000
Where are you going?

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes?

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,500
Are you going to an art museum?

158
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Why won't you open an exhibition?

159
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
You have so much to do.

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,500
Oh, right.

161
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,500
Won'tak, it was nice to meet you. I should get going.

162
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't know where you live,

163
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
but I'll see you the next time you...

164
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,000
Be careful with your handkerchief.

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What?

166
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,500
Hey, Dal...

167
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What?

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What's your relationship with Won Tak?

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What?

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't think it's a normal relationship.

171
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Well, it's not a normal relationship.

172
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,000
It's a little long to explain.

173
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,500
I guess it's a stronger relationship than 3,000.

174
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Maybe 5,000?

175
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
6,000? 7,000?

176
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Excuse me.

177
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Won Tak is a very nice and nice guy.

178
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,500
He's very determined, he's very law-abiding,

179
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,000
he's very reliable, and he's a powerful detective.

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So he's not a thief.

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,500
So he's not giving money to the security company.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,500
He's a good fighter.

183
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
He's very reliable when he's with you.

184
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,000
How reliable is he?

185
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,000
Does he have bodyguards?

186
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,000
He's not that big of a guy in three-dimensionality.

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He often works at the same place, and he has a lot of work to do.

188
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,000
He's so easy-going that he washes well.

189
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So how nice is that?

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He doesn't have to pay electricity or water bills.

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,500
I think we live together.

192
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
What?

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What?

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,500
How can you be so good at joking?

195
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,500
I'll tell Won Tak about the noise.

196
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

197
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll take care of the bill.

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,500
Can't you stop talking about Won Tak?

199
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,000
He's going to bleed.

200
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
I'm sorry.

201
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Are your hands okay?

202
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,000
It's nothing.

203
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,000
I should've beaten him up.

204
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
He dragged me from behind.

205
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
What?

206
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
I was surprised.

207
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
It's because there are so many people.

208
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
He didn't drag you, he just stopped you.

209
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
He didn't want things to get worse.

210
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
He's driving me crazy.

211
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,000
He's driving me crazy.

212
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Why are you coming back to the singer's house?

213
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
That's...

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's...

215
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,500
I'm going to ask about the restaurant.

216
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
What?

217
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,000
There's a restaurant near the police station.

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm going to ask about it.

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,500
Would I be worried about you?

220
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,000
And even if it's not the police station,

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
you can't do that.

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,500
Do you know how bad they are?

223
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,000
I do.

224
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What?

225
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,000
You can't imagine how cool they are now,

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
but when Won Tak was in a car accident,

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,500
he went to the police station with his dad.

228
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,000
That guy, Won Tak.

229
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,500
He met all kinds of criminals,

230
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
from the police to the gangsters.

231
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
I bet they all sighed more than I did.

232
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
You're looking at my growth process

233
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,500
because I look so terrible.

234
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Don't you remember the tiger tattoo

235
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,000
that was all over my body?

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,500
I even got...

237
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
That's a sticker.

238
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Who said that?

239
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I saw a few tiger teeth

240
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
and my claws got erased.

241
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Don't you remember?

242
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
When we were in the Netherlands...

243
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
When we were in the Netherlands?

244
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
You said you forgot everything.

245
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
You must remember everything.

246
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Of course, I couldn't have forgotten.

247
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
It's a statue of a walking statue.

248
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,000
A statue?

249
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,500
What's the meaning of that smile?

250
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,000
I didn't smile.

251
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,500
I heard you.

252
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
It must be your mood.

253
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
What?

254
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
What?

255
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
A statue?

256
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
A statue?

257
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,500
A statue?

258
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
No, a...

259
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
A statue?

260
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Aren't you smiling too much?

261
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
I keep getting in the way.

263
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
We're in a corporate situation now,

264
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
but we're in a very poor position

265
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
to be hanging around in the market.

266
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
The father and the stepmother

267
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
are all poor families

268
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,500
who only make money.

269
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
They're all in need of money,

270
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
so you don't have to worry.

271
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,500
How much did you get from your wife?

272
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I heard it was $2.5 million.

273
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
I heard it was $2.5 million.

274
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
$2.5 million?

275
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
You can't even see the difference

276
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
between $2.5 million and a father's heart?

277
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
You're so ignorant.

278
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Don't you know the world?

279
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
It's not something you should worry about.

280
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
It's not like that.

281
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Ms. Jin?

282
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
What are you doing here?

283
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
You have to pay for this.

284
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,500
How did she get this much money

285
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
to run around the market?

286
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
She's been doing everything by herself,

287
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
but she's like a cat stuck in a tree.

288
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Make yourself at home.

289
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
You're meeting this person?

290
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Thank you.

291
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
There's a problem with the ship.

292
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
It's been delayed.

293
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
I think we should do a search.

294
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
You won't find catering services, right?

295
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
The person who attended the meeting is not exact.

296
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Did you check the VIP attendance?

297
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Well...

298
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Hello.

299
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Are you attending the opening?

300
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
You haven't had a schedule yet?

301
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
What?

302
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Mr. Choi?

303
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,500
I called to check if you were attending the opening.

304
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
You're on a business trip?

305
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
When will you be able to check?

306
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Maybe because of the article that came out last time.

307
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
They're asking if anyone is attending.

308
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
They're asking if you're going to attend if you're attending.

309
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
They're asking about each other.

310
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
It would be great if the building that Jang Taejin bought

311
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
could be a little more popular.

312
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
They're going on a business trip that day.

313
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Well...

314
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
I mean...

315
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
The celebs should come and give us some information

316
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
so that people can gather at the exhibition.

317
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Please proceed with the plan as planned.

318
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
We can't make any decisions without the guests.

319
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Okay.

320
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Move it!

321
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Oh, my!

322
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Mr. Kim!

323
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
What's wrong with you?

324
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
I was the one who spit first!

325
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
What?

326
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,500
You're the one who spit first when you're not the owner.

327
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Move it!

328
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Oh, my!

329
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Wait.

330
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Wait.

331
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
What are you doing?

332
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
This is the section of the public relations.

333
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
You said you were on leave.

334
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Leave?

335
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Honey, can't I be the one to do this?

336
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
This is the main exhibition spot.

337
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
I can't just hang any artwork.

338
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
And the size of the artwork is similar.

339
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
What do you mean?

340
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Is the size of the artwork a big deal?

341
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
It should be representative.

342
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
That's why it's a masterpiece.

343
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
It's not an international masterpiece.

344
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
It's a work of art.

345
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Work of art?

346
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Work of art?

347
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Ms. Yang, how many private games did you play?

348
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Who would give you money for private games?

349
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Mr. Kim, did you get an invitation for Biennale?

350
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
What?

351
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Oh, my.

352
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
You really didn't get an invitation.

353
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Everyone got an invitation.

354
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
You really didn't get an invitation.

355
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Oh, my.

356
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Oh, my.

357
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Are you sure you're okay?

358
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Yes.

359
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,500
We'd be happy if you could install Ms. Kim's artwork here.

360
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
But the wall color and the artwork are the same.

361
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
So the artwork will get stained.

362
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
We need to paint it again.

363
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Tomorrow is the opening.

364
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
How can we paint it now?

365
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Then I'll do it.

366
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Ms. Yang, I'd appreciate it if you could install yours here.

367
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,500
But right next to it...

368
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Oh, my.

369
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Is this the right place?

370
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Yes.

371
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Are you going to the exhibition?

372
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Yes.

373
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Dad.

374
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
They're really nice people.

375
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
But they're sensitive about the exhibition.

376
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Is Mr. Hong still here?

377
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Ms. Song is leaving.

378
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
But I haven't heard from him yet.

379
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Why don't we look for him somewhere else?

380
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Where did Mr. Hong say his studio was?

381
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
His studio?

382
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,500
What's with all the trash?

383
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm here to clean up the trash.

384
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
What kind of trash is this?

385
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
My poop. My pee.

386
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
What?

387
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,500
I clean up the poop I pooped with my own hands.

388
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
That's my original intention.

389
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
You're pooping.

390
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
You're pooping.

391
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Ms. Song.

392
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,500
What's going on?

393
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I have to open the door to make a suggestion.

394
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,500
I was standing outside for three hours and came out.

395
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Come to think of it, I came empty-handed.

396
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I wanted to buy some fruit.

397
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
What?

398
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
You're coming here now?

399
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
We have to solve this in two hours.

400
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
We don't have any other alternatives.

401
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Yes.

402
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
The End

403
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Actually, there's something

404
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,500
that made you so angry.

405
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
The first one is the death of the deceased.

406
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,500
It's a work that portrays the mother of the deceased.

407
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
What?

408
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,500
How can someone so ignorant

409
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
be a piece of shit?

410
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,500
I'm so sick of this.

411
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Ms. Song.

412
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
The accident that happened this morning...

413
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

414
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,500
and I'm not being honest.

415
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
I know everything, so let's get to the point.

416
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
What did you bring with you?

417
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
What?

418
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,500
The famous New Chief's funeral

419
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
and the first battle of Cheoncheon.

420
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
You made such a huge mistake

421
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
and came empty-handed.

422
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,500
I'm curious about what you brought with you.

423
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
We'll make up for the damage

424
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
that was caused by the accident...

425
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
The insurance company will take care of that.

426
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Do you have any interest

427
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
in the residence program

428
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
that the Hamilton Foundation has?

429
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
I'm sure it's possible

430
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
because we have a full schedule by next year.

431
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
I'm sure you'll be able to do it.

432
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
I see.

433
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
I see.

434
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Then what about the individual exhibition?

435
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
After the exhibition,

436
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,500
we'll go straight to the artist's exhibition.

437
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
It might be difficult right now,

438
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
but we'll buy your work

439
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,500
and make it the best of the best.

440
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
We'll do it next year.

441
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
I'm sure you'll be able to do it.

442
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Is there a next year in Cheongsong?

443
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,500
I thought this would be the last time.

444
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Ms. Kim.

445
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,500
I'll open it within a year.

446
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
If you allow me,

447
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
I'd like to prepare for your next exhibition

448
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,500
with my own hands next year.

449
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
In Cheongsong.

450
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
I see.

451
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
I saw you kneeling down

452
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,500
when you were doing this.

453
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
You're a tall lady with a high nose

454
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
so your knees must be expensive.

455
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Ms. Kim.

456
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,500
If I kneel down,

457
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
will you allow me?

458
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,500
It's a negotiation, not a request.

459
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500
You don't like this kind of stuff.

460
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
What's wrong with you?

461
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Ms. Kim.

462
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
If you can calm down,

463
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
I can't stand this.

464
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,500
I'm really sorry about what happened today.

465
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Ms. Kim, don't be like this.

466
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Ms. Kim.

467
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Forget it.

468
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
I'm just joking.

469
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
They must have arrived.

470
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
What kind of magic did you use

471
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
to break Ms. Hong's heart?

472
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
You're amazing.

473
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
I'll hold it for you.

474
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
I'm sorry.

475
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
No, no.

476
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
It's okay.

477
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
What is it?

478
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
Ms. Kim, help me.

479
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
The dead and the living.

480
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Seul-i has arrived.

481
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
Aren't you going?

482
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Thank you so much, Ms. Kim.

483
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
I didn't do it to get an official letter.

484
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
If we close the Cheongsong door,

485
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
only our writers will be able to see us.

486
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,500
So I want you to remember

487
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
that promise.

488
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
Next year, my second year,

489
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
and after that,

490
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
I promise to keep opening my exhibition

491
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
in Cheongsong.

492
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Then I'll be honored.

493
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
Ms. Kim.

494
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
You're the best.

495
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Oh, my. Let's hurry.

496
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
We need 24 hours

497
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,500
to finish the installation before the opening.

498
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Oh, right.

499
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,500
What is that trash doing this morning?

500
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
It's not a bad person

501
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
because he made a mistake.

502
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
He's a good person

503
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
who's paying for our Cheongsong.

504
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
That's interesting.

505
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,500
You asked what I do,

506
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,500
and you asked if I'm a good person?

507
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
I don't like you.

508
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
I like you.

509
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
How cool he is.

510
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
This is Department of Martinums,

511
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
��터 burdensome 425511, office.

512
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
What?

513
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,300
Where is he?

514
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,300
Jang Taejin?

515
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,600
If you call me whenever you want,

516
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,200
I'll meet him.

517
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,500
You want to meet him?

518
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,500
He wants to talk about the money you gave me.

519
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,100
I guess I'm right, right?

520
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,900
What did you expect?

521
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,900
I told you before.

522
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,100
I thought I'd get your money back from the world.

523
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,900
What is it?

524
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,300
I'm getting a job.

525
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,500
I'm buying a flat with money.

526
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,800
I can't afford to spend $2 million in the world.

527
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,300
The head of the company, Kim Nakcheon,

528
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,000
has passed away, and $2 million is nothing.

529
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,300
I'm a poor woman.

530
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,600
Thanks to him, we can get married.

531
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,400
It's great, right?

532
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,800
When should we do it? As soon as possible?

533
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,000
Tonight?

534
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm busy.

535
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,700
Then tomorrow?

536
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,500
I'm busy tomorrow too.

537
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,700
Then what?

538
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,300
I'm busy.

539
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,800
I don't have time to meet him.

540
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,400
And if you want to meet him, tell him to come.

541
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,800
Why should I be so arrogant?

542
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,400
Does anyone have money?

543
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,500
But it's not an easy opportunity.

544
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,700
Okay.

545
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,700
What is this?

546
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,100
This is the work of the dead

547
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,000
by writer Hong Jangin,

548
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,800
who the head of the company bought.

549
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,100
Is this all?

550
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,100
The whole thing?

551
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,900
The work description and the production process

552
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
are all explained in there.

553
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,300
And the work of the dead

554
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,100
is not allowed to be exhibited anywhere

555
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,100
without the permission of the head of the company.

556
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,100
So the head of the company is now a collector.

557
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
The head of the company is now a collector.

558
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,300
Is that a head watch?

559
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,300
How much is that?

560
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,700
I...

561
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,100
I...

562
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,100
I bought this kind of trash!

563
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,100
What's going on?

564
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,000
Someone called. Are you not picking up?

565
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,900
Who is it?

566
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,100
Uncle...

567
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,500
No, wait. Uncle Gup? Gup? Gup?

568
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,100
Oh, right.

569
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,300
This is Jinmok.

570
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,900
Jinmok.

571
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,300
It's here.

572
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,500
Thank goodness it was solved.

573
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,100
You were worried, weren't you?

574
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,700
Oh, yes.

575
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,300
Well...

576
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,100
There must be other worries.

577
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,500
You're worried about me too.

578
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
What if I worry?

579
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,900
You're worried about me.

580
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,500
I can't talk to you.

581
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,700
Good work.

582
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,300
I'm sorry I'm late.

583
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,700
I...

584
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,600
What about the opening tomorrow?

585
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,900
I have to go.

586
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,700
I'll go to two different places, so wait.

587
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,900
Okay.

588
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,900
I don't know what you're thinking.

589
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,900
I thought you wouldn't change your mind.

590
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,700
By the way,

591
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,000
will the writer do the opening performance himself?

592
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm sure he will.

593
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,900
We can't find him because we're running out of time.

594
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,300
Hey, mister.

595
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,900
What? What? What?

596
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,100
Why is everything dead?

597
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
Let go. Let go.

598
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,500
Oh, my. Everything is dead.

599
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,700
It's still there.

600
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
That's not it.

601
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,100
I'm the one who's making the problem.

602
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,900
I'm the one who's making the problem.

603
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,500
You're mistaken.

604
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
No, but...

605
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,700
Please line it up well.

606
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,800
Please line it up well.

607
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,400
No, it's too close.

608
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,300
Please move it a little bit.

609
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,600
Who's in charge here?

610
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,300
Please press me.

611
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,200
I'll set up three tables for each.

612
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,700
Please go over there.

613
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,500
I think it's going to be a bit hard.

614
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,900
This is it.

615
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,100
You have to go to the back.

616
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,300
Let's put it down again.

617
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,700
Director.

618
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,000
Are you ready?

619
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Yes.

620
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,100
Director.

621
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,700
Will the VIPs come?

622
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,500
If you can't attend,

623
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,300
you'll send someone else, right?

624
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,700
Don't worry too much.

625
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,000
It'll be fine.

626
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,600
We can open the door.

627
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,800
I didn't think I'd be able to do this.

628
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,600
Then you can go in.

629
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,900
Everyone worked hard.

630
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,100
It'll be fine.

631
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Gosh.

632
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,500
Did they promote it or not?

633
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,800
Why is it so soft?

634
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
But...

635
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,100
Can you drink at this moment?

636
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,000
Isn't it weird?

637
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,000
Let's go home now.

638
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,200
It's already dark.

639
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,800
What?

640
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,600
No one's here.

641
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,900
How is this possible?

642
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,400
You said you don't have to use drugs.

643
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,200
That stupid person will be so stupid.

644
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,800
Why can't I see the bag?

645
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,500
This won't do.

646
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,000
Everyone, call them.

647
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,900
Hey...

648
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,900
Hey, hey.

649
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,200
What is this?

650
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,500
Everyone, get back to your seats.

651
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,900
Let's go.

652
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,600
Hurry up.

653
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,400
Hurry up.

654
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,800
Hurry up.

655
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Let's take a picture.

656
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,100
Let's take a picture.

657
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,400
Hurry up.

658
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,000
Thank you for your help.

659
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,200
Thank you.

660
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,700
Gosh.

661
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,300
Thank you.

662
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Thank you.

663
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,400
Thank you.

664
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,700
Thank you.

665
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Let's take a picture.

666
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Hello.

667
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,500
Hello.

668
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,800
Hello.

669
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,200
Hello.

670
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,800
Hello.

671
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,700
Hello.

672
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,200
Hello.

673
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,000
Hello.

674
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,200
Hello.

675
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,900
Let's take a picture.

676
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Yes, this way.

677
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,000
Please take a picture.

678
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,600
Let's take a picture.

679
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,500
Please take a picture.

680
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,800
Hello.

681
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,200
Hello.

682
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,600
We look forward to your cooperation.

683
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,100
Thank you.

684
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,300
Thank you.

685
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,400
Thank you.

686
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,400
What is this?

687
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,200
Why is my clothes so dirty?

688
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,800
Hey, bring me a straw.

689
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,200
Bring me a straw!

690
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,800
This is a work by Sejong.

691
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,500
It's a work by Sejong.

692
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,600
If you look here,

693
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,800
it's a work by Song Hwa Young.

694
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,000
It's a work by Song Hwa Young.

695
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,200
This is a work by Hyesoo.

696
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,500
Alice, Alice, Alice.

697
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,000
It's an idol.

698
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,600
Han Hyunji is here too.

699
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,700
I think she has over a million followers.

700
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,500
Did we send Alice and Han Hyunji

701
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,000
an invitation?

702
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,400
We're just giving them an invitation.

703
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,800
Right.

704
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
I saw that on TV.

705
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Who was it?

706
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
I don't know.

707
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,400
It's an actor.

708
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,200
She's not a singer?

709
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,600
I've never seen such a fancy opening.

710
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,200
The director is so happy.

711
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,000
I think it's going to be a hit.

712
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,200
I think it's more about Director Jang Taejin.

713
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,500
He's young and handsome.

714
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,000
He's a great successor to the world's best.

715
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,600
He's also a do-sing singer.

716
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,200
Not only does he have a lot of money,

717
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,900
but his parents are also very rich.

718
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,000
Okay.

719
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Let's go.

720
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,800
Hello.

721
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Hello.

722
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,100
I'm the curator of Chung Song Mi's art.

723
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,400
Hello.

724
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
You look so pretty.

725
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Thank you.

726
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
Hello.

727
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
I'm here for the overseas season.

728
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
Okay.

729
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,200
I heard you have an overseas business trip.

730
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,400
How did you get the time?

731
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,200
I pushed it to next week.

732
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,000
I was pushed because of your situation.

733
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,600
You don't think I pushed it because of you, do you?

734
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,000
No.

735
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,000
I know how to tell the difference

736
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
between public and private matters,

737
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,000
even if I'm out of my mind because of you.

738
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,600
Let's go over there.

739
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
We'll be dealing with them from now on.

740
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,000
Keep an eye on them.

741
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Director!

742
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yes.

743
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Director!

744
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yes.

745
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
Us?

746
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
I'm Kim Dali, the new director.

747
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,800
I'm Choi Youngman, the CEO of CNC Ventures.

748
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm the director.

749
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

750
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,600
They're well-known artists,

751
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,300
so they'll be a great sponsor.

752
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,400
Oh, right.

753
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,000
You threatened to never come back

754
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,800
if you don't attend the show,

755
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,600
but you're even paying for it now?

756
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,400
Isn't this just a joke?

757
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,200
It's not a joke. It's a romantic story.

758
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,400
You even pushed the business trip

759
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,000
to attend the show?

760
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
What?

761
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,200
No, it's not that.

762
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,400
I didn't push it.

763
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,800
I pushed it because of you.

764
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,200
Because of Director Hyun.

765
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
Oh, I must have made a mistake.

766
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Oh, my.

767
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Mr. Kim.

768
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,600
Mr. Kim from Lux Hotel is here.

769
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,800
I'll go say hello.

770
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Let's go.

771
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
Mr. Kim.

772
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
What are you doing?

773
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,400
I'm Director Kim.

774
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,000
He's Mr. Kim from Lux Hotel.

775
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Did you talk to him?

776
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,200
I'm here.

777
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,400
Why? Why?

778
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,600
Why?

779
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,600
Since when did my family go to the art museum

780
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,400
after seeing the exhibition?

781
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,000
How much did you put in to make that?

782
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,200
And you're not even paying for the show.

783
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,400
And you should go to parties too.

784
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,400
It's not a party. It's an opening.

785
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,200
Is it a company dinner? Not a party?

786
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,400
What's the big deal? It's a party.

787
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,000
This is when you get paid.

788
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Dad, I saw on social media

789
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
that a lot of people attended.

790
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,600
They even gave me a small gift.

791
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,400
You're lucky.

792
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,600
Let's go and stop the time.

793
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Okay.

794
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,000
Anyway, don't pretend to know me

795
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,200
when you go inside the museum.

796
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,800
It's a game for everyone.

797
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,000
Let's go.

798
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,200
I just got here.

799
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
I told you I paid for the clothes.

800
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,800
I said I got it.

801
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Okay.

802
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,800
The Entertainment City 772772, Kong.

803
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
What?

804
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,600
Why are you here now? I've been waiting.

805
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
Seokhui, what are you doing here?

806
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,000
It's a surprise that a galleryist is coming to the exhibition.

807
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,200
It's a given, right?

808
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
I told you I was going to the gallery.

809
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,000
Look at me.

810
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,800
What are you doing?

811
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,000
Stay still. I have someone to introduce.

812
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Introduce? Who?

813
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,600
Gold juice.

814
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,640
Subscribe.

815
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,560
pana 完成

816
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,560
You know you look the best when you're with me, right?

817
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,660
Stop it. What are you doing?

818
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,860
Stop saying hello and don't say anything.

819
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,960
I'll take care of everything. Let's go.

820
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,760
Where are you going?

821
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,860
Where did she go again?

822
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,760
Let's go.

823
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,360
How can you drive so quietly?

824
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,660
You're driving so fast.

825
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,760
Dad.

826
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,960
Hey, Chaekyung.

827
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,560
I'm An Sangtae, a 365-day-old man

828
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,960
who runs around the neighborhood.

829
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,560
By the way, who are you?

830
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,560
You know me, right?

831
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,860
I'm a big fan of Dondon.

832
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,260
My dad also pays a lot of political aid.

833
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,060
Sir.

834
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,560
Hello.

835
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,860
He's my father.

836
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,060
Oh, yes.

837
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,560
It's an honor to meet you.

838
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,760
Chaekyung!

839
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,760
Who are you?

840
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,360
Hey, you!

841
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,560
Excuse me.

842
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,960
Thank you.

843
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,960
Mr. Jin.

844
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,960
So?

845
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,960
I'm Jang Taejin from Segi Group.

846
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,960
I called you to meet you, but you refused.

847
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,360
That report system is a mess.

848
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,360
I didn't refuse to meet you.

849
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,760
If you have the right to meet, don't be so arrogant.

850
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,960
I'm not here to meet someone who has the right to meet.

851
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,160
That's what I heard.

852
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,760
I was just being considerate in case you'd have a hard time.

853
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,260
If you felt uncomfortable, I apologize.

854
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,260
You're considerate.

855
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,360
Well, that's that.

856
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,760
Do you have something to tell me?

857
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,260
I heard that Dalli is paying for it.

858
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,860
I should've solved it sooner.

859
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,760
But there was a personal problem between us,

860
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,360
so I was late.

861
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,360
Between us?

862
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,160
Personal?

863
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
So?

864
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,460
So?

865
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,160
So I'll solve it after the cleaning is done.

866
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,260
Who are you?

867
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,360
Why are you meddling in my business?

868
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,360
I can't stand a scumbag like you anymore.

869
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,360
Men who are tattooed are buried in the art gallery,

870
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,060
and they destroy the art,

871
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,360
and they are watched and chased.

872
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,760
You've been raised in the art of books and art.

873
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,060
You're different.

874
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,160
You're a responsible and responsible child,

875
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,160
but can't you see that you're struggling?

876
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,560
You should stop now.

877
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,760
Is that so?

878
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,160
That you're struggling because of me?

879
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,760
You never said that to me.

880
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,760
And you, Kim Dalli.

881
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,160
You're not the kind of scumbag you think you are.

882
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,560
Can't you see that you're doing well?

883
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,560
Why are you making a fool of a smart woman?

884
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,760
You're just a few dollars short.

885
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,660
And if you get too nosy,

886
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,960
you're not being kind, but you're being purposeful.

887
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,960
Why?

888
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,360
Can't you solve this problem, Jang Taejun?

889
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,360
Hello?

890
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,360
I know. I'm on my way.

891
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,160
I'm a bit busy.

892
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,560
You said you like money.

893
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,560
I just need to get paid, right?

894
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,160
I'm a crazy guy about money,

895
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,960
but I don't take any money.

896
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,360
I'm a loser.

897
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,160
I'm sorry.

898
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,860
This is the third work

899
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,560
in the series of The Dead and the Living.

900
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,560
As you can see,

901
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,360
the work is made up of the waste

902
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,560
that the living create.

903
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,360
The dead can't make any more trash.

904
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,960
Is living a good thing?

905
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,960
Is dying a terrible thing?

906
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,360
What is the difference between living and dying?

907
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,360
The writer said

908
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,560
he only found out about his mother's death

909
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,960
after a month had passed.

910
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,660
There was a mother's order

911
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,560
to not disturb her daughter's important exhibition.

912
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,060
For a month,

913
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:32,560
was his mother a living or a dead person?

914
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,760
The Dead and the Living

915
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,360
This work was made to give you

916
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,760
a chance to question these questions

917
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,960
while you experience it.

918
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,760
What's going on?

919
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,960
What's going on?

920
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,760
You crazy jerk!

921
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,760
Why did you go into the museum?

922
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,360
You're making fun of my mother, right?

923
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,060
How could you do this to me?

924
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,960
What's wrong with you? This is how it is.

925
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,360
The writer told you to do it.

926
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,160
You're a pervert!

927
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,160
That's right.

928
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,560
This is part of the work

929
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,160
that was made based on your suggestion.

930
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,360
You chose a special model today.

931
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,160
From tomorrow, you'll get a chance

932
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,960
to experience it among those who applied.

933
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,560
Again.

934
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,760
Shall we move on to the next work?

935
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,760
Please go.

936
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,760
Okay.

937
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,960
Let's go.

938
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,960
What?

939
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,360
He's a work of art.

940
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,160
I thought no one would come,

941
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,360
but he just went in at once.

942
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,960
I was so happy when you came.

943
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,760
You're so cruel.

944
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,360
You took everything from me.

945
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,160
I thought you'd change your work

946
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,960
and run it without a model.

947
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,160
I know.

948
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,360
I was surprised that the model was him.

949
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,560
I didn't see anyone who would do that.

950
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,160
He's just a cheap jerk.

951
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,560
He can't do that.

952
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,760
You're so...

953
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,360
What about you, sir?

954
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,160
He wants us to leave first.

955
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,360
It's the first exhibition he held after his father died.

956
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,360
He's so busy like today,

957
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,160
but he suddenly comes to mind about you.

958
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,560
Will you take care of your daughter?

959
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,560
Dad!

960
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,960
Dad!

961
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,160
The art gallery is a place of talk.

962
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,160
There are so many things you want to say,

963
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,760
but you're afraid.

964
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,760
So you have to walk quietly in the gallery

965
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,160
and listen to what I say.

966
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:08,160
I'll do anything for you

967
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,760
Mr. Jin.

968
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,560
Look at this. It's torn, right?

969
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,160
What about the umbilical cord?

970
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,560
The umbilical cord?

971
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,360
I said no!

972
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,560
Didn't you hear the sound of the bat?

973
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,160
It's more dangerous to not bleed

974
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,760
when you see something that's white.

975
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,360
Look at it.

976
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,360
Is it dizzy or has a mask on?

977
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,960
Is it fluttering?

978
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,760
Is it?

979
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,560
What?

980
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,960
Anyway,

981
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,360
isn't this too much?

982
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,760
I forgot to put someone in the coffin.

983
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,360
I thought someone would fall asleep in the coffin.

984
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,560
Seriously.

985
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,560
I'm sorry.

986
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,360
I guess you used a good grape.

987
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,760
I always do that when I drink expensive wine.

988
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,160
You did a great job.

989
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,560
It must've been hard.

990
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,360
Well,

991
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,760
it was better than I thought.

992
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,760
Actually, I felt uncomfortable

993
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,560
being in the coffin.

994
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,360
It was cold,

995
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,760
dark,

996
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,560
damp, and scary.

997
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,760
But when I lay down,

998
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,960
it felt warm,

999
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,160
soft,

1000
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,560
and cozy.

1001
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,160
The perfume smelled nice.

1002
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,760
I feel like

1003
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,360
I can feel something.

1004
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,160
It was comforting.

1005
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,360
My mom passed away on a cold day.

1006
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,560
Oh, my.

1007
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,960
I'm sorry

1008
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,960
to say this to someone

1009
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,560
who passed away recently.

1010
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,160
Can I ask

1011
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,160
how old you were?

1012
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,960
That's no secret.

1013
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,560
You passed away when you were 10.

1014
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,560
You must've been very sick.

1015
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,160
You must've been very sick.

1016
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,960
You must be very happy

1017
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,160
to see me doing so well.

1018
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,960
No.

1019
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,560
I don't want to be like that.

1020
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,760
People say

1021
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,360
they'll protect you

1022
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,560
because you have a soul.

1023
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,960
They say they'll protect you as a star.

1024
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,360
They say they'll protect you.

1025
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,160
They say they'll meet again someday.

1026
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,560
I hope death is the end.

1027
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,360
Literally the end.

1028
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,160
Just the end.

1029
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,360
I hope so.

1030
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,360
My mom...

1031
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,560
was very sick.

1032
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,560
She suffered all her life.

1033
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,560
Every day,

1034
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,960
she was sick.

1035
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,560
Her body was sick.

1036
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,160
I'm the reason

1037
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,960
why she was sick.

1038
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,760
Eat.

1039
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,560
Eat up.

1040
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:41,360
Did you eat?

1041
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:42,960
Yes.

1042
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,760
Don't starve yourself.

1043
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,360
Even if you're not here,

1044
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,960
you must eat, okay?

1045
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,160
Eat.

1046
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,360
Eat.

1047
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,760
Why did it have to be me?

1048
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,760
It was so cold the day I died.

1049
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,360
I was in a coffin.

1050
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,160
The ground was frozen.

1051
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,360
I was so cursed by the aunts.

1052
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,760
How can a person's life be so boring?

1053
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,160
It's enough if you suffered.

1054
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,560
Why are you worrying about me even after you died?

1055
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,760
Let's go.

1056
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,560
You must've been watching me.

1057
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,760
All this time.

1058
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,160
You didn't miss a single moment.

1059
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,960
You cheered for me and were worried.

1060
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,760
You didn't go anywhere.

1061
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,760
You grew up so well.

1062
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,760
You'll be happy now.

1063
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,760
It's getting colored.

1064
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,760
My heart is getting deeper.

1065
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,360
It's strange.

1066
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:25,360
Our meeting

1067
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:32,560
was so bright at first sight.

1068
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,760
It's not easy to explain.

1069
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,760
It must be fate.

1070
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,760
I'll only give you

1071
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:49,760
this love.

1072
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,560
Like the calm music,

1073
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,760
I kept turning around

1074
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,960
and wanted to listen to you.

1075
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,160
Your shy voice

1076
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:16,960
makes me want to cry.

1077
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,560
Like today's last day,

1078
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,160
I'll come to you every day.

1079
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:24,960
No.

1080
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,160
What's this at the museum?

1081
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,560
A kiss cafe?

1082
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,760
Why did they do that?

1083
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,560
You can't ignore the open bar.

1084
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:36,360
It's the true treasure of our museum.

1085
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,160
How did you know my house was here?

1086
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,960
Why did you have to clean up the mess?

1087
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,760
Let's go.

1088
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,360
I've never forgotten you.

1089
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,560
Let's start over.

1090
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,160
Mistake.

1091
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,360
I never make mistakes.
