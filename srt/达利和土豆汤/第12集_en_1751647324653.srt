00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
To behhh

4
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,060
I think we look a bit similar

5
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,200
when I see her crying

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,360
ChenERO.

7
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,520
Please be what you plan

8
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,800
and go ahead.

9
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,760
This is bad news?

10
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,040
That the patients were given battleünüzup!

11
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,440
You'll know when you see the audience.

12
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,040
The show will be selected

13
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,140
for the most popular and popular show.

14
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,740
It's so hard to find two rabbits

15
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,740
with the same taste and taste.

16
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,540
It's a big hit.

17
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,040
Deng Dara,

18
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,440
the art gallery is going to be a hit.

19
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,440
It's a great place to go on a date.

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,540
It's even on the magazine.

21
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,740
What?

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,040
Is this the second best art gallery in the world?

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Let's make a hit

24
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,540
and make a hit on the next show.

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Hold on.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,740
What?

27
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,840
One, ten, one hundred, ten thousand, ten thousand, ten million.

28
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,540
Again.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,440
One, ten, one hundred, ten thousand, ten million.

30
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,240
Did you lose some money?

31
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,840
No.

32
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,540
7, 5, 6, 6 million.

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,640
7, 5, 6, 6 million?

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,840
Is this really right?

35
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,640
I think so.

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,040
Is this a hit?

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,440
Is there a problem?

38
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,840
No.

39
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,440
You haven't slept for months.

40
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,440
You're planning and preparing.

41
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,140
Let's say the labor cost is like that.

42
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,440
The insurance, shipping, installation cost.

43
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,240
The promotion cost I paid is 7, 5, 6 million.

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,940
Is this a hit?

45
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,940
It's a hit.

46
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,340
Yes, it's usually about 80,000 a day.

47
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,840
Well,

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,840
it's because you don't know the reality of this gallery.

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,140
There are many times when no one comes in.

50
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,740
Then why do you do this?

51
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,040
There's no one who knows or pays.

52
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,640
You'll pay now, right?

53
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,140
I mean...

54
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,240
I mean...

55
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,040
This is what art is.

56
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,840
It's not a field where input and output match.

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,240
I mean...

58
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,840
It's a field of thought

59
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,040
that can be used to

60
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,640
create a single seed

61
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,440
from the many seeds that are blown by the wind.

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,740
You're pooping.

63
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,040
Mr. Jin.

64
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,040
Poop again?

65
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,140
You're pooping.

66
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,940
I have constipation.

67
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,940
I'm a constipated person.

68
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,640
Why do you always say I poop?

69
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,240
Do you know I poop?

70
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,140
Poop!

71
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,540
Did I say something wrong?

72
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,440
You're a genius for trying to

73
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,540
get the art gallery to close.

74
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,740
You're trying to get the art gallery to close?

75
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,040
You're trying to get the art gallery to close?

76
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,240
When are you going to get my money?

77
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Why?

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,440
It's because you have money.

79
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,940
You're trying to get the art gallery to close.

80
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,340
Did I help you with the food?

81
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,540
Did I help you with the food?

82
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,040
Did I help you with the food?

83
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,340
What did you do?

84
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,940
You're a bastard.

85
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,540
I'm going to kill you.

86
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,140
You bastard.

87
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,940
Look at the end of the world.

88
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,940
You bastard.

89
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,940
You bastard.

90
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,440
I'm going to kill you.

91
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,940
You bastard.

92
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,940
You bastard.

93
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,340
You bastard.

94
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,340
You bastard.

95
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,340
You bastard.

96
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,340
You bastard.

97
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,340
You bastard.

98
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,340
You bastard.

99
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,340
You bastard.

100
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,340
You bastard.

101
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,340
You bastard.

102
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,340
You bastard.

103
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,340
You bastard.

104
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,340
You bastard.

105
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,340
You bastard.

106
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,340
You bastard.

107
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,340
You bastard.

108
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,340
I'm going to burn you.

109
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,340
Yum.

110
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,940
You bastard.

111
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,100
All right.

112
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,780
All of you go to service.

113
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,940
God bless.

114
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,940
Then who is there?

115
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,140
Who is that man?

116
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,140
Who is existing?

117
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,740
You said you liked him.

118
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,540
You didn't follow me?

119
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Are you angry?

120
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,540
Mr. Jin did what he did.

121
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,740
But from this month,

122
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,940
the law will be improved

123
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,940
for the profit business.

124
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,940
Mr. Jin will try to pay the price soon.

125
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,540
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,540
Why are you asking me?

127
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,740
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
Please forgive me.

129
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,140
Mr. Song, Mr. Han, Mr. Han,

130
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,140
they are all the people

131
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,340
who protect the art gallery in difficult situations.

132
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,540
They are not rich

133
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,540
and they don't know anyone.

134
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,140
But they are doing it

135
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,140
because they like it.

136
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,940
They are working for their mission.

137
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,540
They are also doing it.

138
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,940
Okay.

139
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,540
You're scared because I'm angry.

140
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,340
I'll think about it

141
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,940
and tell you when I tell you next time.

142
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,140
I'll listen to other people's words.

143
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,340
I'm not angry.

144
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,740
You're not angry.

145
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,140
I'm not angry.

146
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,740
I'll be angry no matter what.

147
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,140
I'll apologize

148
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,940
to you.

149
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,340
Will you forgive me?

150
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,940
Why?

151
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,540
Because you're pretty.

152
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,340
You should do it properly.

153
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,540
You don't have kids.

154
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,540
Relax.

155
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,740
Relax.

156
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,540
I must have done this for too long.

157
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,940
That scoundrel is really...

158
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,340
He's so low-class.

159
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,540
I'm so embarrassed.

160
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,940
He's not even a day or two old.

161
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,140
Why are you doing this?

162
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,540
Don't you want to get Song Kyo?

163
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,540
Yes, Song Kyo is a bad person.

164
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,540
What did you do to him?

165
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,940
What did you do to him?

166
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,340
I must have seen it wrong.

167
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,540
You did.

168
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,140
Wait.

169
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,940
He's trying to get the head of the department

170
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,140
to do something bad.

171
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,340
He must have been very upset

172
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,540
about the adoption.

173
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,540
Are you going to do this again?

174
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,540
I don't think this is right.

175
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,340
This is really not right.

176
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,540
Let's go.

177
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,140
He's in the department.

178
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,340
No, don't hit him.

179
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,340
Don't fight.

180
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,540
What's wrong with you?

181
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,940
What's wrong with you?

182
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,740
Are you okay?

183
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,140
He's not my enemy.

184
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,340
He's trying to get away from me.

185
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,740
What's wrong with you?

186
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,940
What's wrong?

187
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,140
Are you still a human being?

188
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,140
Let go of me.

189
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,540
How could you say that to Song Kyo?

190
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,340
Let go of me.

191
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,140
Apologize.

192
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,140
I said, apologize.

193
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,340
I can't stand it anymore.

194
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,740
Let go of me.

195
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Director.

196
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,140
Let go of me.

197
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,340
Director.

198
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,540
Let go of me.

199
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,740
I'm fine.

200
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,940
I...

201
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,140
I'm fine now.

202
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,340
I'm fine now.

203
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,740
I'm fine now.

204
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,340
What did you do?

205
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,940
Why are you doing this?

206
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,940
What?

207
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,740
I just...

208
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,340
Do something right.

209
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,140
I can't stand it anymore.

210
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,540
I can't stand it anymore.

211
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,740
You're the one who can stand it.

212
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,340
I should've been patient.

213
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,540
I can't stand it anymore.

214
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,740
You should be patient.

215
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,140
How can you live your life like this?

216
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,940
I've been through this many times a day.

217
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,940
I can't stand it anymore.

218
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,740
I can't stand it anymore.

219
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,940
Director Jin.

220
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,940
Apologize to Director Jin.

221
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,540
And...

222
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,940
Tell him to calm down.

223
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,340
Earlier,

224
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,540
I...

225
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,740
I...

226
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,740
I didn't do anything...

227
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,140
I didn't do anything wrong.

228
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,540
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,340
I'm so sorry.

230
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,140
You're sorry, right?

231
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,540
Yes.

232
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,740
I feel relieved.

233
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,540
I'm here to celebrate the exhibition.

234
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,940
I'm going to have a dinner party.

235
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,140
Why?

236
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,340
You really like dinner?

237
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,540
After Director Jin's resignation,

238
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,140
I've never had a dinner party.

239
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,140
That's right.

240
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,140
I have a day off today.

241
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,940
I know a good restaurant.

242
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,340
That's good.

243
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,740
Thank you.

244
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,140
Thank you.

245
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,140
Is this your restaurant, too?

246
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,340
Yes.

247
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,140
Are you going to conquer the whole world?

248
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,940
We're having a lot of experiments.

249
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,540
Please enjoy and rate it.

250
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,540
Okay.

251
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,740
Please enjoy.

252
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
Thank you.

253
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,740
Thank you.

254
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,140
Wait.

255
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,340
Not that.

256
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,340
Put it down.

257
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
Eat this.

258
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,740
You're the one who should be watching.

259
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,340
You should eat the unpopular part first

260
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,340
and give the good part to the staff.

261
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,540
Thank you.

262
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,540
This is the best part.

263
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,340
Thank you, Director Hwang.

264
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,340
Please enjoy.

265
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,940
Sure.

266
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,140
The skin looks delicious.

267
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,740
I like it.

268
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,140
This is...

269
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,940
This is for you.

270
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,140
Here.

271
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,340
The bone...

272
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,340
The bone is the best part.

273
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,740
This is for you.

274
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
Thank you.

275
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,740
This is the best part.

276
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,540
The toenail.

277
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,540
How did you know?

278
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,740
I like toenails the most.

279
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,940
I can take a picture of it.

280
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,940
Excuse me.

281
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,140
Can I have a soda drink?

282
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,340
You're on a diet these days.

283
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,740
You're not drinking soda.

284
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,340
I'm sure I'm on a diet.

285
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,940
What are you doing? Eat up.

286
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,940
I'm joking.

287
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,740
The dried tofu is delicious.

288
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,940
It's so delicious.

289
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,540
It's really delicious.

290
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,340
Thanks to Director Hwang,

291
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,740
we can have a good meal.

292
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,740
It's delicious.

293
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,140
It's delicious.

294
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,540
Eat some white rice when you're eating spicy food.

295
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,540
Sure.

296
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,140
Isn't that Director Kim?

297
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,540
What?

298
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,540
Drug?

299
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,340
Our director?

300
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,940
I'm sorry to bother you.

301
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,140
Director.

302
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,140
Director.

303
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,740
Director.

304
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,740
Director Hwang.

305
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,740
Oh, my.

306
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,740
You bastard.

307
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,340
Hey, what are you doing?

308
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,340
Are you a boss?

309
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,140
Are you a prostitute?

310
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,140
Where did you get this?

311
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,140
Are you still a human being?

312
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,540
Are you a human being?

313
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,940
Mr. Kim is here as a reference, not a victim.

314
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,740
If you act so recklessly,

315
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,340
I can't cooperate.

316
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,540
A reference?

317
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,740
Who is a reference?

318
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,140
If you call the reporters and say

319
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,140
my uncle did it,

320
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,940
you're a criminal reference.

321
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,940
You called the police in Korea

322
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,540
and made a video of the crime scene.

323
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,740
Remember.

324
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,740
This is not a deal.

325
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,740
This is the last chance we give you.

326
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,740
No.

327
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,340
This is not a deal or a last chance.

328
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,340
This is a fight between me and Dali.

329
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,340
A fight between a prostitute

330
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,340
and a real cleaner.

331
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,340
It was useless to stop me from doing it.

332
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,340
That's why I filmed it.

333
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,740
To persuade my uncle.

334
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,540
I was so desperate

335
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,740
that I couldn't even make it.

336
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,740
I feel bad too.

337
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,340
But what can I do?

338
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,140
Do you think I'm just being a coward

339
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,740
for the sake of my late uncle?

340
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,940
Do you think it's what your uncle wants

341
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,340
to bury the truth?

342
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,940
No.

343
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,940
To make justice,

344
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,940
no matter how much blood you shed,

345
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,540
you have to pay back the money.

346
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,140
That way, all the people will respect you

347
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,940
and be able to return to their old ways.

348
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,740
I made it like that.

349
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,540
I'm the real descendant of the old ways.

350
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,340
My uncle...

351
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,140
He will be waiting for that.

352
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,740
Look at your husband.

353
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:46,140
Director fixer,

354
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,340
What?

355
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,660
You...

356
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,100
What a shame.

357
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,260
I'm a fan of Brazilian waxing.

358
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,140
Do you want to go?

359
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,500
I'll call you.

360
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,060
Let's go.

361
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,820
He's wearing the right color, hair color, and waxing.

362
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,900
You thief!

363
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,100
You came to the police station with your own feet!

364
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,260
Are you crazy?

365
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,700
You scumbag.

366
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,220
How dare you touch my dad?

367
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,940
I'll sue you for assault if you don't put this in.

368
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,020
It's the law not to touch your family.

369
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,020
You're not going to stay still when you're

370
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,940
being bitten by your father?

371
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,820
That's what you learn?

372
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,340
You should be punished for assault.

373
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,340
Come on.

374
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,140
Come on.

375
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,340
You scumbags!

376
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,180
You're a monster.

377
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,620
You're out of the cleaners.

378
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,220
I'll make sure you're out of the cleaners.

379
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,340
Wait here.

380
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,620
You are...

381
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,820
You're going to have your turn.

382
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:31,940
Don't.

383
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,000
What is this?

384
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,000
What is this?

385
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
This...

386
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,900
Is this really you?

387
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,700
The evidence has already been sent to the police.

388
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,700
It's only a matter of time before it gets leaked to the press.

389
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:17,760
That's all.

390
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:27,280
To live in Australia

391
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,920
Dad

392
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,940
Please want your son to be well-to-do

393
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,780
during yourTOYOTA trip

394
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,680
when really going home

395
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:43,640
It's baby

396
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,480
Turn over

397
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,740
Turn over

398
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,440
Will you be able to come tomorrow VDO

399
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,940
No, I would never do that.

400
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,360
Even ifGoerold run fromINAUDIBLE,

401
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,600
no one would have dared to buy

402
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,060
the collection sold by Raeng top artist.

403
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,660
Who created that?

404
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,860
It's CHOMSONG's crisis.

405
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,340
According to specializing families,

406
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,540
they use their artist's collection

407
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,040
If the fact that my husband

408
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:26,960
wasThey are all

409
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,900
won't they be exposed as❤️

410
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,460
In order to continue снова

411
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,040
We are afraid that

412
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,460
there might be anything we can do

413
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:42,480
to save the person

414
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,880
in this S-Day

415
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,560
But once they entrepreneurs

416
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,360
I'm talking about Professor Kim.

417
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,760
What do you mean by drugs?

418
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,160
What nonsense are you talking about?

419
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,960
Ms. Song, I've been thinking.

420
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
Isn't the day you were in New York strange?

421
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
That day?

422
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,560
There's a day like that.

423
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,360
Ms. Song,

424
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,160
the work I saw in New York yesterday was a bit strange.

425
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,960
I think someone was wrong.

426
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,760
Yes.

427
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,360
I went to check on something yesterday.

428
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,960
I made a mistake.

429
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,760
What did you check?

430
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
Why did you make such a mistake?

431
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,560
I'm getting old.

432
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,560
My legs are weakening.

433
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,960
You're saying that...

434
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,360
I'm not the type to make such mistakes.

435
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,960
I'm not.

436
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,560
What are you thinking about?

437
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
You're so annoying.

438
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,760
Hello?

439
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
Yes?

440
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,360
Please wait.

441
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Hello?

442
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,160
Yes, I'm Han Byeong-se.

443
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,560
Please wait.

444
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,760
I met you often when I was in the school.

445
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,960
Now you're a doctor.

446
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,160
How long have you been in the hospital?

447
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,160
Over 20 years.

448
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,560
But the reason you asked me to meet you...

449
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,160
Is because I want to know

450
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,760
if you're doing well in school.

451
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,160
I heard that your son is a great pianist.

452
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Yes.

453
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,160
Children are the future of the country.

454
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,760
I'm sure that you can't tell me.

455
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,760
If you want,

456
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,760
I can introduce you to a program that supports studying abroad.

457
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,760
I'd be grateful if you could do that.

458
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,960
But why are you...

459
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,360
Mom, hold this.

460
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,360
It feels so good.

461
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,560
Mom, you look so happy today.

462
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,160
I'm glad to have you here.

463
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,160
I'm going to have a proper exhibition

464
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,960
with you.

465
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,560
The head of the museum

466
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,160
is the official seat of the museum.

467
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,160
I heard that you want to be the second

468
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,960
founder of the talent that God gave you.

469
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,560
Is that wrong?

470
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,160
If you're going to be the head of the museum,

471
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,960
you can just tell me that you're different.

472
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,760
There's nothing difficult about it.

473
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,160
Let me see the yearbook.

474
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
It's Oops, your onions.

475
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,360
Why did you pack so many in this presumed duration?

476
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,360
I wanted to give this story a fresh start.

477
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,960
Oh.

478
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,160
Did you contact any of your Fay Lang school friends?

479
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,560
Are all your studies in Korea

480
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,600
desarrollée donate?

481
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
You're here.

482
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
I heard that you were caught by Jaesoo,

483
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
too.

484
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
You were caught in Korea.

485
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
I heard that you were...

486
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
He went abroad.

487
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Yesterday.

488
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
What?

489
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
All the friends you told me about.

490
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
It's like you made a promise.

491
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Gong Ju.

492
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
Gong Ju knew something.

493
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
I went to see her once.

494
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
She already left her phone.

495
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Kim Siyeong.

496
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
She has no hair on her body.

497
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
She has no urine test.

498
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
She didn't even have a warrant.

499
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
But she was tested voluntarily.

500
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
She must have been prepared for it.

501
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
I can't say it's a case of investigation.

502
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
But I can tell you that

503
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
she even sent a video.

504
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Don't worry.

505
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
No matter how hard she tries,

506
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
she can't hide the truth.

507
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
She said she was naive and didn't know what to do.

508
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
There's only one way.

509
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
For example,

510
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
by bringing up the rumors

511
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:23,200
that Gu Siyeon

512
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,600
was able to fool properties esta messed up in the negative.

513
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,260
You know,

514
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,600
I've dealt with some major corruption cases.

515
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,200
I'm your uncle's son.

516
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,480
If you had died suddenly, you would have been a prosecutor.

517
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,040
Can't you do that?

518
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,480
Did you tell him or not?

519
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
I want to spend the day comfortably.

520
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,600
The chief of the family didn't want me to be a prosecutor.

521
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,480
Then what about Sisi?

522
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,680
She put on makeup.

523
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,480
Isn't it strange?

524
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,280
She didn't come as expected.

525
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,680
She didn't put on makeup and didn't put on makeup?

526
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,840
I shouldn't have thought about it.

527
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,280
You're right.

528
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,600
I didn't put on makeup.

529
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,200
Are you succeed to seduce my uncle?

530
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,800
I'm still like a child.

531
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,440
Why did I say that?

532
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,600
Why don't you go back home?

533
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,000
Don't even think about coming in before you catch Kim Si Young.

534
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm going to change your password.

535
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,000
Me?

536
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,400
Why?

537
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,000
I'm going to stay here a little longer.

538
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,600
Why?

539
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:39,800
Why?

540
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,400
Don't fight.

541
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,800
Why?

542
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,400
Why?

543
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,400
Why?

544
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,400
Why did you keep the phone?

545
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,000
I really...

546
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,000
I thought you were Dalin's friend.

547
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Let's do one thing.

548
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,600
A favor?

549
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Please take care of Dalin.

550
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:00,800
Hey.

551
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,400
Dalin is also involved in the case.

552
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,400
I don't think I can contact him.

553
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I only have you.

554
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,200
I don't have anyone to ask for help.

555
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Dalin, even if it's hard for me, I won't show my true colors.

556
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,400
If I focus on something,

557
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,200
I'll forget about eating.

558
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,000
Seriously.

559
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,400
Why are you so stubborn about the obvious?

560
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
Don't worry.

561
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,400
My girlfriend...

562
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,600
I'll take care of the reason why she's with me.

563
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,400
You just focus on the investigation.

564
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,000
I'll pay you back.

565
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Please.

566
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,000
No.

567
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
What's going on?

568
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,000
What are you doing?

569
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,200
It's not like that!

570
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,000
Seriously.

571
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,200
What do we do?

572
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,000
We found evidence and video footage.

573
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,500
He's so...

574
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,800
What?

575
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Just think of it as a truce.

576
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,700
If not, he won't be able to get away.

577
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,000
Please.

578
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,300
I'm leaving.

579
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,400
Let's go.

580
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,300
Okay.

581
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,800
Don't call me.

582
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Okay?

583
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,100
What's going on?

584
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,800
They didn't even call me.

585
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,200
They're not the type of people to do this.

586
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,200
Are you two having an affair?

587
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,500
Be careful. It's a serious matter.

588
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,000
Pack your bags.

589
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,400
Pack your bags.

590
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,400
What are you doing?

591
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,000
Hurry up.

592
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,400
We only have this.

593
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
What time is it?

594
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,300
Mr. Jang. Mr. Kim.

595
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,000
Mr. Jang. Wait.

596
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,800
There are people watching. What are you doing?

597
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,500
You're removing the work that's on display.

598
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,000
We can't leave our work

599
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,800
on the hot spot of drug trafficking.

600
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,600
What will people say?

601
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
We could be misunderstood.

602
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:36,800
What?

603
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,000
Everyone, stop.

604
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,000
Put it down.

605
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,000
What's going on?

606
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,300
We're from Seongdong Police Station.

607
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,100
This video has been posted on July 13

608
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,800
by the Dept.87, after which

609
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,300
the Etér Queron撮較en in Annabelle Park.

610
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,600
Please leave.

611
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,900
What is going on?

612
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,300
You think they will fire on me?

613
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,100
Let's go and close up this place.

614
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh

615
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh

616
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh

617
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,460
Hello

618
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,860
It's a brand that just came in recently

619
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,660
Would you like to test it?

620
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,400
Is there any product that can erase your memory?

621
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,340
What?

622
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,340
If you apply it like this,

623
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,620
it will make your wrinkles look weak

624
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,180
I hope your memory will also become weak

625
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,060
Oh, that product is not yet...

626
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,300
Give me ten

627
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,820
You should erase your wrinkles instead of your memory

628
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,820
Yes

629
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,320
The phone you have dialed is superintendent's

630
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,480
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable

631
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,980
Why are you always coming here when you have a cold?

632
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,320
If you are cold on the phone when you come here,

633
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,460
why would you wear that type of shoes?

634
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,600
I feel it's a waste of talent

635
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,960
A waste of talent?

636
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,600
I'm the one who's in the corner.

637
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,160
It's so hard to get away from you.

638
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,920
Why did you hide it with your sneakers?

639
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,400
You should show off.

640
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,000
Don't laugh.

641
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,760
I'm still angry.

642
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,760
Did you go back home?

643
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,160
You're pretending to be worried.

644
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,240
I was worried.

645
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,800
I'm still worried.

646
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,840
What does it mean to be single at home?

647
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,880
It's not like you'll be alone before you die.

648
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,400
Maybe I'm the hate speaker

649
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,640
because I'm the one aeng Apareil main shifts to.

650
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,520
She thinks getting support from my side

651
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,560
can hurt her working day off.

652
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,200
She thinks it's a waste.

653
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,560
If you need help,

654
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,560
I'm willing to give it to you.

655
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,400
I can help you.

656
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,300
Then love me.

657
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,960
You're so nice.

658
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,400
If you don't, don't go overboard.

659
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,300
Everyone envies you for your house,

660
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,500
your car, your designer clothes, your luxury bag.

661
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,300
Do you think everyone enjoys it?

662
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,800
It's okay to get hit by someone.

663
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
Do you know what they call

664
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,200
success from the bottom of the sea?

665
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,000
God's kingdom.

666
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Why?

667
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,000
Most people are impossible.

668
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,140
I'll just think that I was hit by a lottery

669
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,800
because I met capable parents.

670
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,500
I'll think that the rest of the misfortune

671
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,240
is worth it.

672
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,540
There's no happiness that can be enjoyed

673
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,840
when you're right.

674
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,340
What's the point of the rest?

675
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
I'm sorry.

676
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,540
Wow.

677
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,740
They're going to the art gallery.

678
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,940
I heard the artists are also going to be removed.

679
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,600
I don't think it's time to worry about me.

680
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,140
I think there's someone else who's really unhappy.

681
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,940
The number you have dialed is busy.

682
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,140
Please try again later.

683
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,140
Okay.

684
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,140
Thank you.

685
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,140
Bye.

686
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,140
You're home.

687
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:27,140
Anything just to be with you.

688
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,140
You're home.

689
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,140
You're home.

690
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,140
Yeah, you're home.

691
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,140
I'll do anything for you.

692
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,140
There were one problem in your eyes.

693
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,140
It's a second whisper.

694
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,140
It's time that I called your name

695
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:02,140
I can still feel you near me

696
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,140
And every bit of you

697
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:11,140
My life feels brighter just by knowing

698
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:16,140
You

699
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,140
Yeah, you're home

700
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,140
Anything just to be with you

701
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,140
You're home

702
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,140
Yeah, you're home

703
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:35,140
Anything just to be with you

704
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,140
You're home

705
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,140
I can't think of anything.

706
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:55,140
You're home

707
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:00,140
You're home

708
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:05,140
You're home

709
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,140
Chorong.

710
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,140
You should go to work after drinking.

711
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,140
You're going to be taken away by a useless guy like him.

712
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,140
Yes, madam.

713
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,140
Yes.

714
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,140
Yes.

715
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,140
Yes?

716
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,140
Is it a contract?

717
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,140
I can't trust you.

718
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,140
I can't be with you anymore.

719
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,140
What are you talking about?

720
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,140
How much money did you spend?

721
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,140
Hello? Hello?

722
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,140
Madam! Madam!

723
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
What are you talking about?

724
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,140
A contract?

725
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,140
You guys.

726
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,140
What do you think you're doing?

727
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,140
Chorong.

728
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,140
Madam! Madam!

729
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,140
This can't be happening!

730
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,140
What kind of relationship are we in?

731
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,140
Madam!

The mahjong is over.

735
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,140
The mahjong is over 2.

736
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,140
The prize-winning queen.

737
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,140
The treasure hunt in the golden city.

738
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,160

high-paying rate.

740
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,160
The high-paying rate.

741
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,160
There are many opportunities to pay back.

742
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
Hurry up and join.

Aomenshimpujing Entertainment City 772772.com

744
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
What are you doing?

745
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,160
Are you really going to do this?

746
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,160
What are you doing with this car?

747
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,180
Wow!

748
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,180
Mom!

749
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,180
Mom!

750
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,180
Is this the right place?

751
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,180
What happened? Did you see the meeting?

752
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,180
Oh my goodness.

753
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,180
I didn't see it for half a day.

754
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
If you keep doing business,

755
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
you might get a good job or not.

756
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
What kind of job is this?

757
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,200
Oh my goodness.

758
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
Oh my goodness.

759
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
I'll go see you tomorrow, dad.

760
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Who are you?

761
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
Do you know me?

762
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Pardon?

763
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Oh, you're Oh Ki-chul.

764
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,220
Are you the one who was in the car?

765
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,220
Dad.

766
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,220
It's Oh Ki-chul.

767
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,220
It's not Jin Ki-chul.

768
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,220
It's Oh Ki-chul.

769
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,220
You're so old-fashioned.

770
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,220
But Ki-chul,

771
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,240
let's just drink one more drink.

772
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,240
You should go home now.

773
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,240
You've done a lot today.

774
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,240
Oh my goodness.

775
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,240
But thanks to you,

776
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,240
I was able to get a job.

777
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,260
I'm sorry.

778
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,260
Mr. Song and Mr. Han...

779
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,260
I'll keep calling them.

780
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,260
And you should go home now.

781
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,260
You should go home.

782
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,260
I'll go home too.

783
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,260
Where's Kim Dal-yi?

784
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,260
Where's Kim Dal-yi?

785
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,260
What's wrong with you?

786
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,260
Get out of here!

787
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,260
Mr. Jin's mother...

788
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,260
Hey, you!

789
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,280
What are you doing?

790
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,280
You're so mean to your son.

791
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
You're so good.

792
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,280
How could you do this to Ahn Sang-tae?

793
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,280
I'll kill you.

794
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,280
Oh, please.

795
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,280
You're the son of Oh Kang-hee.

796
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,280
You don't like me?

797
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,280
I'm your daughter.

798
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,280
Why do you hate me?

799
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,280
You're so good.

800
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,280
Come here.

801
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,280
Go to Ahn Sang-tae and beg him.

802
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,280
Kneel down and beg him.

803
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,300
What are you doing?

804
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,300
You bastard!

805
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,300
You bastard.

806
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,300
You should go.

807
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,300
Go.

808
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,300
You should think about how to handle this.

809
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,300
I won't let you go.

810
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,300
I think you're mistaken.

811
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,300
Get out!

812
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,300
I'll go.

813
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,300
I'll go.

814
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,300
Please don't go.

815
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,300
I think you're mistaken.

816
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,300
Yes.

817
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,300
What's going on?

818
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,300
I heard from the master.

819
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,300
He said the pieces were taken away.

820
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,300
What?

821
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,300
I heard from the master.

822
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,300
He said the pieces were taken away.

823
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,300
What?

824
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
He said the pieces were taken away.

825
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,320
You're so shameless.

826
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,320
You're so arrogant in front of him.

827
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,320
How can you handle this?

828
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
You're doing well just by holding on.

829
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,320
About Si-young...

830
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,340
I'm not the only one who believes you.

831
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,340
You believe me too, right?

832
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,340
Of course.

833
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,340
I'm collecting evidence to prove it.

834
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,340
I'm looking for the school Si-young went to.

835
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,340
And I'm following the footsteps of the other people.

836
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,340
I think it's not easy for you to find out.

837
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,340
I'm investigating in a different route than the police.

838
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,360
They'll call me.

839
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,360
It's a small company.

840
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,360
Really?

841
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,360
I'll do anything to get the lion's honor.

842
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,360
The chief's confession will be revealed soon.

843
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,360
So...

844
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,360
You should be strong and never give up.

845
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,360
You know that I'm always behind you, right?

846
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,360
Thank you.

847
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,360
What's wrong with me?

848
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,360
Hello?

849
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,380
Hello?

850
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,380
Father.

851
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,380
I'm trying to stop him.

852
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,380
But I don't know how long it will take.

853
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:32,380
Are you telling me that you have a solution?

854
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,380
I think you've made up your mind.

855
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,380
Are you sure you're okay?

856
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,380
I'll take you to the hospital.

857
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,380
Go home safely.

858
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,380
Thank you for your concern.

859
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,380
Okay, I'll call you.

860
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,380
Okay.

861
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,380
Ms. Gong.

862
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,380
Ms. Gong.

863
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,380
Ms. Gong.

864
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,380
Ms. Na.

865
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,380
You're here because you're in pain.

866
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,380
I'm here to see you.

867
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,380
Who said that?

868
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,380
I'm here to see your broken heart.

869
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:59,380
So, are you satisfied now?

870
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,380
I'm better than I thought.

871
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,400
You can live my life,

872
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,400
but I can't live yours.

873
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,400
What?

874
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,400
Like you said,

875
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,400
we're just dolls waiting to be taken out

876
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,400
from the machine of the doll-picking machine.

877
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,400
Maybe I can imagine your life

878
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,400
that I could have lived.

879
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,400
I'm afraid to imagine it

880
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,400
because my father is not there.

881
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,400
Please.

882
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,400
I beg you.

883
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,400
Please save my father.

884
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,400
You know what kind of person my father is.

885
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,400
I don't know what kind of pain I caused you,

886
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,400
but don't do this to my father

887
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,400
because you hate me.

888
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,400
Please.

889
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,400
Please go to the police station with me.

890
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,400
You're so annoying.

891
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,400
Don't touch me.

892
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,400
If you keep irritating me,

893
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,400
I'll...

894
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,420
I'll do anything for you.

895
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,420
Are you hiding the body of Chi Yeong well?

896
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,420
Don't worry.

897
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,440
Don't tell anyone about this.

898
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,440
Don't tell anyone about this.

899
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,440
Don't tell anyone about this.

900
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,440
Okay.

901
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,440
Hello?

902
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,440
What?

903
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,440
What's wrong?

904
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,440
The new director, Jang Tae Jin,

905
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,440
is outside.

906
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,440
What?

907
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,440
What's going on?

908
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,440
You didn't even tell me you were coming.

909
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,440
Could you please move out of the way?

910
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,440
I'm sorry.

911
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,440
I didn't mean to.

912
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,440
I'm sorry.

913
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,460
I'm sorry.

914
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,460
What?

915
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,460
Did you come here to investigate

916
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,460
where you bought the land?

917
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,460
Oh, I know already.

918
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,460
The information about the land

919
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,460
that An Sang Tae sold to my brother...

920
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,460
What did you do?

921
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,460
I told you to be careful.

922
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,460
How dare you?

923
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,460
What did you do

924
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,460
to find the other's office?

925
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,460
Does everyone in the world think you're a fool?

926
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,460
Do you know what your mother did

927
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,460
to Dal Ye today?

928
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,460
What?

929
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,460
Wasn't she your mother?

930
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,460
I don't know because

931
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,460
she's from a rich family.

932
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,480
What do you mean?

933
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,480
Tell me.

934
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,480
I guess you think I'm the same person

935
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,480
because I'm treated like a fool.

936
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,480
But I'm not the kind of person

937
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,480
who can be satisfied with a person like you.

938
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,480
Do you know why

939
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,480
I don't wear white when I go to eat potato soup?

940
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,480
Because it's too obvious.

941
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,480
Because it smells and it gets dirty.

942
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,500
You're like a potato soup.

943
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,500
It gets dirty when you get close and smells.

944
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,500
When you say something good,

945
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,500
you should stop talking.

946
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,500
It's the last warning.

947
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,500
What?

948
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
Who is it?

949
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,500
It's me.

950
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,500
I'm so sorry.

951
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,520
What?

952
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,520
What did you do?

953
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,520
Well...

954
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,520
What did you do?

955
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,520
You came at such a late hour.

956
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,520
What did I do to you?

957
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,520
Dal Ye?

958
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,520
Dal Ye?

959
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,540
Well...

960
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,540
I just...

961
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,540
Fine.

962
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,540
You should be more careful.

963
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,540
You should be beaten more.

964
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,540
You shouldn't have done anything

965
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,540
to make a man like you

966
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,540
go to someone else's house.

967
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,540
I wanted to rip off all your hair

968
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,540
when I was a girl,

969
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,540
but I just...

970
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,540
I just held it in because

971
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,540
I was so social-minded and hypnotic.

972
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,540
But you just went away

973
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,560
and ran away.

974
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,560
Did you hit her?

975
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,560
That woman?

976
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,560
If she hadn't been so strong,

977
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,560
she wouldn't have broken up with us.

978
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,560
Poor thing.

979
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,560
She suffered so much.

980
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,560
Did I hit her?

981
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,560
Just...

982
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,560
Just a few times.

983
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,560
Why?

984
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,560
Who are you?

985
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,560
What right do you have?

986
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,560
You little punk.

987
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,560
How dare you be rude to your mother?

988
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,560
Who are you?

989
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,560
Father, please calm down.

990
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,560
What are you doing?

991
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,560
Just admit it.

992
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,560
Who is Ms. Kim?

993
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,560
She came here at such a late hour

994
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,560
and made a mess.

995
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,560
Can't you see the meaning of this?

996
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,580
Do you know how much I've suffered

997
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,580
because of her?

998
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,580
If I had gone,

999
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,580
I would have been dead by now.

1000
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:43,580
I would have burned down her art gallery.

1001
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,580
I would have been so disappointed

1002
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,560
by her that she would have been

1003
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,580
a loser without a woman.

1004
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,580
Father!

1005
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,580
Why?

1006
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,580
Father,

1007
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,580
I'm a good listener.

1008
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,600
You know that, right?

1009
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,600
What?

1010
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,600
Oh my goodness.

1011
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,600
She's trying to get her mother out

1012
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,600
so that I can listen to her.

1013
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,600
Look at her.

1014
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,600
She's like that.

1015
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,600
My mother told me

1016
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,600
not to hate you.

1017
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,600
So I tried my best

1018
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,600
not to hate you.

1019
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,600
But

1020
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,620
it was so hard.

1021
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,620
No matter how hard I tried

1022
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,620
to get you out of my head,

1023
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,620
it was so hard.

1024
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,620
What's wrong with me?

1025
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,620
What's wrong with me?

1026
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,620
What should I do?

1027
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,620
I'm a loser

1028
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,620
even if I don't die.

1029
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,620
I can't even see

1030
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,620
my dreamy son.

1031
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,620
But

1032
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,620
I realized after I fell in love.

1033
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,620
Oh,

1034
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,620
my father also fell in love.

1035
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:20,620
That's why.

1036
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,620
My dying wife

1037
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,640
and my son also fell in love.

1038
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,640
That's what love is.

1039
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,640
I can only see him

1040
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,640
and the eyes,

1041
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,640
morals,

1042
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,640
laws, ethics, and family

1043
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,640
are all gone.

1044
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,640
I

1045
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,640
tried to understand you

1046
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,640
so much.

1047
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,640
But

1048
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,640
if you keep doing this,

1049
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,640
I can't listen to my mom anymore.

1050
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,640
I can't understand you.

1051
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,640
I can't understand you.

1052
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,640
Are you going to stop, Leyan?

1053
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,640
What?

1054
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,640
I'll stop

1055
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,640
trying to understand you.

1056
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,640
Find your own way

1057
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,640
to live.

1058
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,640
I'll find my own way.

1059
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:55,220
What?

1060
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,460
Leave him alone.

1061
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,060
He can't live without you.

1062
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,460
Be quiet!

1063
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:26,060
What brings you here?

1064
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,060
Well...

1065
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:31,220
I have something to discuss with you

1066
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,460
because of the C.L.E.

1067
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,420
I've been looking for you.

1068
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,820
I've come to see you.

1069
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,220
Father,

1070
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,420
I'm not your father.

1071
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,220
You know me better than anyone.

1072
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,020
What do you mean?

1073
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,020
I'm not your father.

1074
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,020
I'm your father.

1075
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,020
I'm not your father.

1076
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,020
You know me better than anyone.

1077
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:58,420
How did you come out of my house?

1078
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:03,020
Did you raise me because I was too naive?

1079
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,620
Or was I too strict?

1080
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:09,220
What's wrong with you?

1081
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:12,420
What's wrong with you?

1082
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,820
Let me...

1083
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,220
Let me...

1084
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,220
Let me write this.

1085
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:26,420
Don't worry about it.

1086
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:30,420
I'll take care of everything.

1087
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,620
Forgive me.

1088
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,020
I'm sorry.

1089
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:43,220
What happened?

1090
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,220
Dali.

1091
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:50,620
Please save my Cheongsong.

1092
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:55,620
You're the only one who can save her.

1093
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,620
She's been respected and protected

1094
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,620
since her childhood.

1095
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:03,620
How can you break her down with my hands?

1096
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,620
Even if it's for your father's sake.

1097
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,020
Dali.

1098
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,620
Dali.

1099
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:27,420
I can't start over with Taejin.

1100
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,420
I can't.

1101
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,420
I'm begging you.

1102
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,220
Dali, you just have to be careful.

1103
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:40,420
You have to be careful with Minseok and Cheongsong.

1104
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,620
If you're wronged,

1105
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,220
you can fix it.

1106
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,620
You can fix everything.

1107
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:04,220
You can do that for my family, right?

1108
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:08,220
You're Cheongsong's people.

1109
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,620
I'm sorry.

1110
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,220
I'm sorry.

1111
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,220
I'm sorry.

1112
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,220
I'm sorry.

1113
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,220
I'm sorry.

1114
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,220
I'm sorry.

1115
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,220
I'm sorry.

1116
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,220
I'm sorry.

1117
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:33,220
I'm sorry.

1118
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,220
I'm sorry.

1119
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,220
I'm sorry.

1120
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,220
I'm sorry.

1121
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,220
I'm sorry.

1122
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,220
I'm sorry.

1123
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,220
I'm sorry.

1124
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,220
I'm sorry.

1125
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,220
I'm sorry.

1126
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,220
I'm sorry.

1127
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,220
I'm sorry.

1128
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,220
I'm sorry.

1129
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,220
I'm sorry.

1130
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:59,220
I'm sorry.

1131
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:01,220
I'm sorry.

1132
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,220
I'm sorry.

1133
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:08,220
Won't it be harder for him?

1134
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,220
Protect what you want to protect.

1135
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,220
Protect it in front of me.

1136
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,220
What are you doing in the art gallery?

1137
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,220
You're not paying me.

1138
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,220
Unlike other people,

1139
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,220
I feel that you're too much.

1140
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,220
I'll do it.

1141
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,220
I won't let you talk about it again.

1142
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,220
Are you Zhang Tianjin?

1143
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,220
Don't do it.

1144
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,220
Talk to me first.

1145
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,220
You have something to talk to me.

1146
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:30,220
How long are you going to listen to this nonsense?

1147
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:34,220
I'm sorry that I have no choice but to make this choice.
