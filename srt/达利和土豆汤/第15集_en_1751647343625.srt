1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,360
My Little dit is Harrison's

2
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,420
What do we do, honey?

3
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,420
What are we going to do?

4
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,660
What if we really go bankrupt?

5
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,960
Come on.

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,760
We have to stay still.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,960
You think you can stay still?

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,760
What did I do?

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,300
I'm going to go to the moon

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,560
and have a concert without a band.

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,420
Junsun.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,760
Yes?

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,060
How much is true and how much is a lie?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,860
What?

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,100
You have to know that to prepare for it.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,700
Did you really make money to pay for An Sangtaek?

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,200
Well...

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
Well...

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,400
Hey.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,960
Would a man who likes money like An Sangtaek

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,400
only get paid by us?

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,800
Yes.

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,160
He would've gotten paid

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,960
from all over the country.

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,760
He's just trying to kill us

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,660
by taking our blood.

27
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,960
Money from the government?

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,260
That's just an excuse.

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,560
Who's going to kill us?

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,900
What for?

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I know!

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,060
Jang Taejin!

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,460
What?

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,400
What are you talking about?

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,860
He said we can't stay still.

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,760
I shook his head.

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,400
He said it was Jang Taejin.

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,560
What?

39
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,360
Why are you talking about that now?

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,460
How can you be so sure?

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,460
You're just a bad guy.

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,560
What are you doing?

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,900
Please calm down.

44
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,360
Let go of me.

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,560
Wait.

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
Hello?

47
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,660
Jang Taejin.

48
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,860
What are you doing?

49
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,660
You haven't sent out a summons notice yet.

50
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,360
This is the show that Jang Taejin

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
will throw me out of the game.

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,360
Anyway, I have to catch him.

53
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,860
Keep your head down

54
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,460
and see him alive.

55
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,460
Wait.

56
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,760
Mother.

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
What?

58
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,560
Do you know his number?

59
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,360
If you're going to keep saying things

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,460
that the other person won't understand,

61
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,660
go back.

62
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,060
I'm busy.

63
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,560
This is Jang Taejin.

64
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,660
I sent you a video.

65
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,260
Why don't you check it out?

66
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,460
But...

67
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,460
But I can't bury the truth.

68
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,860
Excuse me?

69
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,760
Excuse me?

70
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,960
If you don't believe me,

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,920
then the blame is on you alone.

72
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,380
Okay?

73
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
What else do I say?

74
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,520
No!

75
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,560
Go away!

76
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,980
What are you doing?

77
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,460
Something must be done...

78
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,340
We need to stop it.

79
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,460
What was that?

80
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,080
What?

81
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,960
Did you study that song?

82
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:37,400
That sounds like your dad's voice.

83
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,660
No way.

84
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:51,660
I think the recording file of the executive committee has leaked.

85
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,660
It looks like a bad luck.

86
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,660
I think I need to get a case immediately.

87
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,660
I think I need to get a case immediately.

88
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,660
I think I need to get a case immediately.

89
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,660
I think I need to get a case immediately.

90
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,660
I think I need to get a case immediately.

91
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,660
I think I need to get a case immediately.

92
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,660
I think I need to get a case immediately.

93
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,660
I think I need to get a case immediately.

94
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,660
It's weird that you're the only one who's looking for your father

95
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,660
even though he refused to see him.

96
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,660
Do you know anything?

97
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,660
What should I know?

98
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,660
He's the one who sold the pipe that was used to kill him.

99
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,660
Do I have to be the only one who can guarantee that?

100
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,660
Do I have to be the only one who can guarantee that?

101
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,660
What does it have to do with me and that drug addict?

102
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,660
I think it's a serious matter.

103
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,660
The leaked file.

104
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,660
It's not going to be completed in one go.

105
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
You're not serious about the leaked meeting

106
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,660
that came up in the company's secret?

107
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,660
Dallae, I'm sorry, but I don't have a reason to play with you.

108
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,660
Stop going back.

109
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,660
I'll call you.

110
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,660
I'll call you.

111
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,660
I'll call you.

112
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,660
What?

113
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,660
But I can't bury the truth.

114
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,660
If there's a hole, you have to dig it out and if there's something wrong, you have to catch it right away.

115
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,660
That way, you can get up again.

116
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,660
There are exceptions to cleaning.

117
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,660
Can you be healthy?

118
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,660
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,660
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,660
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,660
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,660
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,660
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,660
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,660
How do you feel?

126
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,660
Who are you?

127
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,660
We have to meet, right?

128
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,660
Who are you?

129
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,660
I'm upset.

130
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,660
I said hello last time.

131
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,660
Me?

132
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,660
I'm Jin Ki-cheol.

133
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
Money, money, F&B.

134
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,660
What?

135
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:41,660
Money, money?

136
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,660
That's just a cheap academy.

137
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,660
Don't be too happy.

138
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:55,660
I've never learned anything.

139
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,660
We know each other?

140
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
I said hello earlier.

141
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,660
I introduced you to the An Sang hospital.

142
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,660
I don't know.

143
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,660
I don't remember.

144
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,660
Why is it called Money, Money, F&B?

145
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:17,660
I'm focusing on the franchise business, but I'll see you often in business.

146
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,660
I'm Jin Ki-cheol.

147
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:29,660
I see.

148
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:39,660
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,660
Yeah.

150
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,660
Why are you playing around like this?

151
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,660
Play around?

152
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,660
Oh, play around.

153
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,660
Do you think I'm playing around?

154
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,660
I put a pre-trial in our company.

155
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,660
How can I hand this over?

156
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,660
Or do you spray it on the Internet?

157
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,660
Huh?

158
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,660
Watch what happens to the world.

159
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,660
I guess I still don't understand the situation.

160
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:27,660
Let the world know what you did to Kim Nak-chan.

161
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,660
Your life is on my hands.

162
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,660
Jang Tae-jin's life is in Jin Ki-cheol's hands.

163
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,660
Don't think about the way you treat me.

164
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:49,660
Wait until I call you again.

165
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,660
You're playing around.

166
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,660
Hey.

167
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,660
Let go!

168
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,660
Oh, my God!

169
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
Oh, my God!

170
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,660
Oh, my God.

171
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,660
What's wrong?

172
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,660
What?

173
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,660
What's wrong? Why are you so angry?

174
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,660
Jang Tae-jin's phone?

175
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,660
Huh?

176
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,660
You just called Jang Tae-jin.

177
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,660
What's Jang Tae-jin?

178
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,660
Jang Hye-jin?

179
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,660
Hyejin.

180
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,660
How can I call Jang Tae-jin?

181
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,660
What?

182
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,660
We're just friends.

183
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,660
You're so nice to me.

184
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,660
You keep crawling up.

185
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,660
Where are you going?

186
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,660
Where are you going?

187
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,660
I have to go to a meeting.

188
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,660
What meeting?

189
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,660
I have to write an explanation in the media.

190
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,660
I have to explain to the score.

191
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,660
I'm going to investigate right away.

192
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,660
We have to get ready, too.

193
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,660
I'm going to the meeting.

194
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,660
Aren't you going in with me?

195
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,660
What do you mean?

196
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,660
You do it yourself.

197
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,660
What?

198
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,660
Oh, my God.

199
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,660
Nothing's going to happen.

200
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,660
Don't worry too much.

201
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,660
Good luck.

202
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:33,660
Good luck.

203
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,660
You said you wanted to kill Jang Tae-jin.

204
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,660
I'm going to the meeting alone.

205
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,660
But here...

206
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:13,660
Boss!

207
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,660
Get to know about the F&B Jin Ki-cheol.

208
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,660
Not about Jin Mu-hak.

209
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,660
About Jin Ki-cheol.

210
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,660
A woman of taste, personality, and taste!

211
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,660
Get to know everything as you can.

212
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,660
A woman of taste, personality, and taste!

213
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,660
Get to know everything as you can.

214
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,660
Yes, sir.

215
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,660
And...

216
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,660
Go ahead.

217
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,660
I'll call the people from the company again.

218
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:05,660
Oh, my God.

219
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,660
Oh, my God.

220
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,660
You're going to show up today.

221
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,660
What do you want for dinner?

222
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,660
Hamburger?

223
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,660
He died because of me.

224
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,660
My uncle...

225
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,660
I...

226
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,660
I'm the eldest father.

227
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,660
I...

228
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,660
You don't like hamburgers?

229
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,660
I'm sure you heard that, too.

230
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,660
What?

231
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,660
Kim Hee-jung said she killed the director because of her.

232
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,660
What is it?

233
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,660
I'm just saying.

234
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,660
I heard you were very upset when the director died.

235
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,660
When parents die, their children are all sinners.

236
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,660
I heard Kim Hee-jung's grandfather was your father.

237
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,660
I'm Jang Tae-jin.

238
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:25,660
That's why I can't tell the truth.

239
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:33,660
It was definitely my dad's voice.

240
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:41,660
You were here.

241
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:49,660
I heard you were coming to the Paldas' auction next week.

242
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,660
Yes.

243
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,660
You're upset that I'm going to give it away, right?

244
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
Oh, right.

245
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,660
Choi Ki-chang and Gu Hae-young will be participating in the exhibition.

246
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
I guess other writers are thinking positively.

247
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,660
It's going well, right?

248
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
That's a relief.

249
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:19,660
I think we'll have a great lineup for this exhibition.

250
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,660
Excuse me, Song Ki-hwan.

251
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,660
Yes.

252
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:33,660
By any chance...

253
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,660
Do you want me to put it in the bag?

254
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:45,660
Will you do that for me?

255
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,660
I told Mr. Cha in advance.

256
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,660
He'll help you.

257
00:16:51,660 --> 00:17:01,660
You're pretending to be good until the end.

258
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,660
The museum is very busy.

259
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,660
We have to prepare for the new exhibition and the grand exhibition.

260
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,660
You're pretty good at it.

261
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,660
I'm sorry.

262
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,660
I'm sorry.

263
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,660
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,660
I'm sorry.

265
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,660
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,660
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,660
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,660
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,660
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,660
I guess you were pretty good.

271
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:41,660
You have a big spot.

272
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,660
Will you come out again?

273
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,660
I know you need courage.

274
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:53,660
It's uncomfortable to see the art team.

275
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,660
But I want you to be brave.

276
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,660
I need you.

277
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,660
Why are you doing this to me?

278
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,660
It all started with one spot.

279
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,660
What?

280
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:17,660
That spot exploded and there was a universe, stars, the sun, and the earth.

281
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:23,660
So we might be just one day's dust.

282
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:31,660
But it's also a star.

283
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:43,660
Gong-ju, we're not cheap dolls.

284
00:18:53,660 --> 00:19:03,660
I'm sorry.

285
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:33,660
I'm sorry.

286
00:19:53,660 --> 00:20:03,660
I'm sorry.

287
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,660
Are you here?

288
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:39,660
Come on in.

289
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,660
Why was it so hard today?

290
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
It's hard not to see you.

291
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,660
Nothing else is hard.

292
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:57,660
Do I have anything to do?

293
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
I'm helping you now.

294
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,660
What?

295
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:09,660
This is helping.

296
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,660
But don't you work overtime?

297
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:21,660
Why do you come home without notice?

298
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,660
I'm having a stomachache on purpose.

299
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,660
It would be nice if you could do a ab workout.

300
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,660
Wait a minute.

301
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
I'll be like this for a little while.

302
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,660
That's nice.

303
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,660
Hey.

304
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,660
What's wrong with my voice?

305
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,660
Are you imitating Won-tak?

306
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:53,660
Hey.

307
00:21:53,660 --> 00:22:03,660
I'm not going to.

308
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,660
Won-tak, why, why, why are you here now?

309
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:17,660
I almost fell for it.

310
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:29,660
It's not a dog, it's a dog.

311
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,660
People don't know what to do.

312
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,660
Without notice.

313
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,660
This is my house.

314
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,660
Who doesn't know what to do?

315
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,660
No, it's your house.

316
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,660
Go.

317
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,660
If you don't like it, go.

318
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,660
Go to your house.

319
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,660
Go, please go.

320
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,660
Who says I don't like it?

321
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,660
Just because it's cheap and dirty.

322
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
It's dirty.

323
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
It's dirty, so go.

324
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,660
Go, please go.

325
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,660
What's wrong with you?

326
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:11,660
We'll get caught.

327
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,660
Hey, do you know how to do this?

328
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:19,660
I was taught by a teacher.

329
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,660
Eat up.

330
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:29,660
I did it according to the recipe, but I don't know if it's okay.

331
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,660
Why?

332
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,660
Is it weird?

333
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,660
No.

334
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,660
Wow.

335
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,660
It's delicious.

336
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:57,660
I know.

337
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,660
It's delicious with oil.

338
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,660
Why?

339
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:09,660
I'll make some more.

340
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,660
What did you teach me to do?

341
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,660
I know.

342
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,660
It's delicious.

343
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,660
I think I'll sell it right away if I eat one more bite.

344
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,660
What?

345
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,660
It tastes unique.

346
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,660
I applied my own cooking method to the basic recipe taught by you.

347
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,660
You and I are having a hard time these days.

348
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:37,660
So vitamin B, magnesium, propolis, and ginseng.

349
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,660
I've got everything I need.

350
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,660
Cheer up.

351
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,660
I see.

352
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,660
That's why you're laughing.

353
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,660
Why don't you eat?

354
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,660
Why are you eating with Jinmoo?

355
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,660
I'll do the rest.

356
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:05,660
I don't like it because I smell you while I'm cooking.

357
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,660
That's possible.

358
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:15,660
Wait a minute. I'll make more.

359
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,660
I can't hear you.

360
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,660
Why do I want to go to the bathroom?

361
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,660
I have to go to the bathroom.

362
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:35,660
It's hot.

363
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:45,660
I'll make more.

364
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:55,660
It's hot.

365
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:05,660
I'll make more.

366
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,660
I'll make more.

367
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:13,660
You're making more?

368
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,660
Are you crazy?

369
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,660
Why are you giving me a big one?

370
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,660
You said you eat a lot.

371
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,660
You said you're different from the civilians.

372
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:27,660
I'm going to die.

373
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,660
It's so delicious.

374
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:37,660
You eat so well.

375
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,660
I think I'm talented in cooking.

376
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,660
I'll make more.

377
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,660
Don't go, you punk.

378
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,660
What?

379
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,660
To be honest, you're a cook.

380
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,660
Really?

381
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:05,660
Once, once, once more.

382
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:15,660
I'll make more.

383
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,660
What's wrong with Kim Si-young's son?

384
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,660
What are you talking about?

385
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,660
Do you know how scary it is to leak secrets in the investigation?

386
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,660
How can you know the secret of the public relations?

387
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,660
That's a good way to meet the investigation.

388
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,660
Don't do that and throw some rice cake.

389
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,660
What will come out of the rice cake?

390
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,660
Are you still looking for Taejin?

391
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:45,660
Yeah, well, I'm still persuading you.

392
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,660
Actually, I went to see Taejin today.

393
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,660
Why do you have to go there?

394
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,660
I heard something weird.

395
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,660
Weird?

396
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,660
Taejin got a call while I was talking to him.

397
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,660
I thought I was opening a file as soon as I hung up.

398
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,660
I heard my dad's voice.

399
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,660
I think the file leaked.

400
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:26,280
It looks like a

401
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,660
Taejin's words leaked the recording of the committee, but it was definitely my dad's voice.

402
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,660
I'm sorry, but I don't have a reason to play with you.

403
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,660
Go back.

404
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:40,660
I'll call you.

405
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,660
What are you talking about?

406
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:48,660
It's not exactly, but I can't ask the truth.

407
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,660
No, I can't get it.

408
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,660
That's what it was.

409
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,660
When was that?

410
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,660
Do you remember what time it was?

411
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,660
2 o'clock 40 minutes?

412
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,660
What about 3 o'clock?

413
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:12,660
That's when my brother and Jang Taejin were on the phone.

414
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,660
I guess you still don't understand the situation.

415
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,660
What you did to Kim Nak-chan.

416
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,660
Let the world know.

417
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:34,660
Your life line is on my hand.

418
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:46,660
Actually, on the day the director died, my brother met the director.

419
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:52,660
I was supposed to go, but I was supposed to go instead of my brother because of the Netherlands business trip.

420
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,660
Why would I meet him?

421
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,660
Wasn't it the day I went on a business trip to the Netherlands?

422
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:04,660
I was supposed to go to see Jin-young.

423
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,660
That's it.

424
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,660
I can't go because my father's so angry about lending you money.

425
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,660
How can I go through that mess?

426
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,660
What kind of trouble are you going to get?

427
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,660
But my brother said he didn't go.

428
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,660
I'm suspicious of that.

429
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:30,660
I guess you're definitely getting something from there that day.

430
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,660
I think you're threatening Jang Taejin with that.

431
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,660
Threatening?

432
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,660
What did you get?

433
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,660
I don't know that either.

434
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:52,660
Didn't my brother send you the file that Jang Taejin received today?

435
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,660
Actually, Kim Si-young said something weird.

436
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,660
He cried to his father at the arrest.

437
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,660
He said he died because of you.

438
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,660
He died because of me.

439
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,660
I killed his father.

440
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:24,660
I...

441
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,660
It could be just because of your sin.

442
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:38,660
I keep getting caught.

443
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,660
Jin Ki-cheol, 35 years old.

444
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,660
He was originally Oh Ki-cheol, but he changed his family name to Jin Ki-cheol as soon as the family law changed.

445
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:58,660
Under your traditional support, information communication company, entertainment company, advertising company, etc.

446
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:04,660
He has failed in various businesses, but he is currently working as the head of the company.

447
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,660
He's timid, he's not very good at work, but he's very greedy.

448
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,660
He's not a person to worry about.

449
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,660
I think we should wrap up with a good self-esteem.

450
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,660
The problem is not Jin Ki-cheol, but the thing Jin Ki-cheol is holding in his hand.

451
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,660
He was hit by a bomb by a guy who couldn't split the sky and earth.

452
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:30,660
It's a time bomb.

453
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,660
Are you ready, Mr. Han?

454
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
Yes.

455
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:50,660
If you ever do something wrong, we'll have to make a debut so that we can never get caught again.

456
00:32:50,660 --> 00:33:00,660
I'm sorry.

457
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,660
He went into the director's house.

458
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:12,660
There was no unusual movement.

459
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:30,660
He's not a person to worry about.

460
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:40,660
He's a person who's been hit by a bomb.

461
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:50,660
I'm sorry.

462
00:33:50,660 --> 00:34:00,660
Father, what are you doing here?

463
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:10,660
Right now?

464
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:16,660
I got a call from your mother-in-law that your body is getting worse.

465
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,660
But you have to see Si-young.

466
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:28,660
I don't know how much I've sinned, but I have to take responsibility for my sins.

467
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:36,660
If I find my parents after I'm hurt, I'll be able to get revenge.

468
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:56,660
I hope you take care of the Cheongsong Cultural Foundation and the Cheongsong International Academy from now on.

469
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:06,660
I'll be responsible for the Cheongsong Cultural Foundation and the Cheongsong International Academy.

470
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,660
Father.

471
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:18,660
I left the last letter to the chief of the department.

472
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:34,660
I remember your words that the name Cheongsong is connected mentally and not blood.

473
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,660
I can't accept that.

474
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,660
I was far away from you.

475
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
It's my age.

476
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
Forgive me.

477
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,660
I was wrong.

478
00:35:50,660 --> 00:36:00,660
Okay?

479
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,660
Don't get out.

480
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:14,660
I'll see you as soon as things get settled here.

481
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,660
How's the situation at the store?

482
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:32,660
I did make an announcement, but the store owners are worried.

483
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:38,660
It's also affecting the customer reviews.

484
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,660
Plan a grand event.

485
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,660
Not just a child, but a big one.

486
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,660
All the expenses will be transferred to the headquarters.

487
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:54,660
Yes, sir.

488
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,660
What are you doing?

489
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,660
It's the same as usual.

490
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,660
I'm going to work and eating with the chairman.

491
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,660
I usually get a one-page sheet.

492
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,660
But there's nothing special.

493
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:18,660
I'm sorry.

494
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,660
Where is he?

495
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:52,660
There's nothing in the diary.

496
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:18,660
That's him, right?

497
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,660
Where are you going?

498
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,660
You're not going?

499
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,660
What are you going to do with your hands?

500
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,660
Let's go.

501
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,660
Where are you going?

502
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,660
You're not going?

503
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,660
What are you going to do with your hands?

504
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,660
Let's go.

505
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:46,660
Let's go.

506
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:06,660
Taekjin, why are you here?

507
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:16,660
I told you to bring Taejin.

508
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,660
I have nothing to say to you.

509
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,660
Tell Taejin to come.

510
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,660
Did you kill him?

511
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:34,660
What are you talking about?

512
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:40,660
What am I?

513
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,660
You killed him.

514
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:54,660
My dad.

515
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:58,660
It's not me.

516
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,660
It's not me, Dal.

517
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,660
I'm not.

518
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,660
Why should I?

519
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,660
I'm really not.

520
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:14,660
Then did Taejin kill him?

521
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,660
This is the last chance.

522
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,660
You can be human.

523
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,660
Tell me.

524
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,660
What happened that day?

525
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,660
What happened that day?

526
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,660
What happened that day?

527
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,660
What happened that day?

528
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,660
What happened that day?

529
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,660
What happened that day?

530
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,660
What happened that day?

531
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,660
What happened that day?

532
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,660
What happened that day?

533
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,660
What happened that day?

534
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,660
What happened that day?

535
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,660
What happened that day?

536
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,660
What happened that day?

537
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,660
What happened that day?

538
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,660
What happened that day?

539
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,660
It's not me.

540
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:14,660
It's not me.

541
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:28,660
I've been looking for my uncle for years.

542
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,660
I don't want to sell it.

543
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,660
Even if I find my uncle,

544
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,660
I don't think I'll change.

545
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,660
So don't waste your time.

546
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,660
Just go back.

547
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,660
Don't do that.

548
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,660
Tell me what you want.

549
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:52,660
It would be nice if you could take a chance this time.

550
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,660
The art gallery is over there.

551
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,660
Let's build a quiet place

552
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,660
and make it shiny again.

553
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:08,660
Let's build a new city here.

554
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,660
Let's push it all away.

555
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,660
You know that, right?

556
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,660
You're not the one who'll ever accept it.

557
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:28,660
No, sir.

558
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,660
Is that the answer?

559
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:38,660
Break down all the sins, break them up, build new ones,

560
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:44,660
pull out a decent tree and make a private farm,

561
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:50,660
and leave it here.

562
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,660
People who work here,

563
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,660
mothers,

564
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,660
and young people who live in the city.

565
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:04,660
They should come here and talk.

566
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,660
If you're rich, poor,

567
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,660
president, or a homeless person,

568
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,660
you should have a place where you can come in

569
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,660
and make someone's head spin.

570
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,660
Don't you think so?

571
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,660
It's a hard to understand board.

572
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:44,660
So I became the next target.

573
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:48,660
If you say something, I'm going to kill you.

574
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:54,660
I'm going to kill you.

575
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,660
I'm going to lock you up.

576
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:04,660
I couldn't help it because I started to get addicted to medicine again.

577
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:08,660
If you don't do what they tell you,

578
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:18,660
they'll lock me up in the world.

579
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:40,660
I thought my uncle would accept their demands

580
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,660
even if I thought of the blame

581
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,660
that was poured on the city.

582
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,660
My uncle...

583
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,660
He told me to pay for my sins.

584
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:56,660
He said he'd report me if I didn't turn myself in.

585
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,660
If you've committed a sin,

586
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,660
you should pay for it.

587
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,660
There's a problem here.

588
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,660
I was just going to let it slide.

589
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,660
If I report you,

590
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,660
not only will I have to worry about this,

591
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,660
but I'll also have to reveal

592
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:20,660
the identity of Jang Taejin.

593
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,660
Then you can't bury the truth.

594
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,660
If there's a problem, you should turn yourself in

595
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,660
and if something goes wrong, you should kill me.

596
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:34,660
You can't start over.

597
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,660
You can't be an exception.

598
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:46,660
Can you handle it?

599
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:52,660
What?

600
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,660
As expected, it was Jang Taejin's acting.

601
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,660
People are mistaken,

602
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:04,660
but those who have a lot of money are more greedy for money.

603
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:08,660
If it's money, you don't have any parents.

604
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,660
If you stab your brother in the back, it's over.

605
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,660
Just think about it.

606
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,660
It's a project that Jo Dan-hee has been doing.

607
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:24,660
Don't worry.

608
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:40,660
My father was a strange person.

609
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,660
Will this simply end with a drug scandal

610
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:48,660
caused by the cleaning and cleaning?

611
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,660
The cleaning artist who has been

612
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,660
the center of the drug scandal

613
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,660
since the first generation of the country

614
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,660
and has been used as a drug warehouse

615
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,660
for a long time,

616
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:02,660
the people will be more disappointed and angry.

617
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,660
So far,

618
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,660
this isn't a trial?

619
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,660
You said you checked the stuff.

620
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:20,660
Did you think it was a drug that a person would enjoy alone?

621
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:26,660
Did you say you checked the stuff?

622
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,660
The house where Si-young lives, the car, the house,

623
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:32,660
the living expenses that the director gave were a lot more than that.

624
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:36,660
Probably the majority of the works in the warehouse

625
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,660
are fake.

626
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,660
The real stuff is sold abroad.

627
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,660
You bastard!

628
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,660
Grandpa!

629
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,660
All you have to do is allow the redevelopment.

630
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,660
If you help me get the green belt off,

631
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,660
the director promised to give me everything.

632
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,660
I'll make the news headlines bigger this time.

633
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:59,660
I'll be reborn as a new person.

634
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,660
I won't do drugs anymore.

635
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,660
Grandpa, please save me.

636
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:09,660
So this was your plan.

637
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,660
You wanted to re-develop the An Sang-tae and the Zha-go.

638
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,660
So you hired Si-young?

639
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,660
You guys are so stupid.

640
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,660
No.

641
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,660
Never!

642
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,660
The cleanliness...

643
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,660
The cleanliness of the cleanliness...

644
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,660
What's wrong?

645
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,660
What's wrong, Grandpa?

646
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,660
Grandpa!

647
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,660
Grandpa!

648
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,660
Grandpa!

649
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,660
Wake up!

650
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,660
What's wrong?

651
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,660
Grandpa!

652
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,660
Where? Where?

653
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,660
You never listen.

654
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,660
Then shouldn't we wait?

655
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,660
What do you want to do?

656
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,660
Huh?

657
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,660
You...

658
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,660
You...

659
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,660
You...

660
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,660
You...

661
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,660
Director.

662
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,660
Director.

663
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,660
Director.

664
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,660
Don't get caught.

665
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,660
Don't get caught.

666
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,660
119.

667
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,660
113.

668
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,660
What are you doing?

669
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,660
What are you doing?

670
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,660
What are you doing?

671
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,660
What are you doing?

672
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,660
He said he left.

673
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,660
He told me to prepare a passport for the comic book.

674
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:38,660
The person you have called cannot be reached.

675
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:41,660
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

676
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,660
Please leave a message after the beep.

677
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,660
What is this?

678
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,660
What is this?

679
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,660
What is this?

680
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,660
What is this?

681
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,660
What is this?

682
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,660
What is this?

683
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,660
What is this?

684
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,660
What is this?

685
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,660
What is this?

686
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,660
What is this?

687
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,660
What is this?

688
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,660
What is this?

689
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,660
What is this?

690
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,660
What is this?

691
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,660
Is this how it feels?

692
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,660
The world is under my feet.

693
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,660
It's nothing.

694
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,660
You scared me.

695
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,660
You have to be careful.

696
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,660
What if you fall?

697
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,660
If you want to fall, tell me.

698
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,660
I'm just kidding.

699
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,660
Don't be nervous.

700
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:13,660
Oh, you like to joke around.

701
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,660
I'll stop joking around.

702
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,660
Let's talk about work.

703
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,660
Let's.

704
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,660
Darn it.

705
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,660
Who do you think I am?

706
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,660
I should hand it over first.

707
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,660
I should hand it over too.

708
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,660
Darn it.

709
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,660
The development project that's being exported

710
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,660
from the world's most popular construction

711
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,660
has been included in the Dondon construction.

712
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,660
This isn't all.

713
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,660
What am I supposed to do with the prosecution?

714
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:14,660
What?

715
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,660
Don't worry.

716
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,660
The project hasn't been decided yet,

717
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,660
so it's not going to be imported.

718
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,660
If we pay back, we'll get a few hundred dollars.

719
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,660
That's a lot of money for a class.

720
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,660
Fine.

721
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,660
Darn it.

722
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,660
It's time to kick him out.

723
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,660
What?

724
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,660
I'm just kidding.

725
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,660
I'm not a jerk.

726
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,660
Don't doubt me.

727
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,660
Is this all?

728
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,660
The computer, laptop, and everything else

729
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:15,660
were all pre-selected.

730
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,660
What if you copy and paste them somewhere else?

731
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,660
Will you be quiet until now?

732
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,660
You should trust your friends.

733
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,660
Don't you?

734
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,660
I'm sorry.

735
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,660
Darn it.

736
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,660
I'm glad it went well without any problems.

737
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,660
I hope we never see each other again.

738
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,660
What are you talking about?

739
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,660
We're friends now.

740
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,660
We should see each other often.

741
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,660
I don't have any friends.

742
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,660
I have a good friend.

743
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,660
I should have one this time.

744
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:10,660
But I decided to be friends with her.

745
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,660
Goodbye, friend.

746
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,660
Goodbye.

747
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,660
Mr. Lee.

748
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,660
I'll take my leave.

749
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,660
Okay.

750
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,660
Yes, sir.

751
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,660
I'm sorry.

752
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,660
Hello?

753
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,660
Yes, honey.

754
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,660
Where are you?

755
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:26,660
I was working.

756
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,660
What's wrong with your voice?

757
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,660
Did something happen?

758
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,660
No.

759
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,660
Are you late?

760
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,660
Why?

761
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,660
Because you missed me?

762
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,660
Yes.

763
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,660
What?

764
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:50,660
I'm glad you were by my side.

765
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:56,660
Then I'm getting sick.

766
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:00,660
You know that I love you a lot, right?

767
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,660
Okay, I surrender.

768
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,660
I lost.

769
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,660
How could I do anything when you wanted to see me?

770
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:16,660
Wait a little longer. I'll fly right away.

771
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,660
I'll be right there.

772
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,660
Are you okay?

773
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,660
This way.

774
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,660
This way?

775
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,660
This way.

776
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,660
What are you guys?

777
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,660
Wait a minute.

778
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,660
You bastard.

779
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,660
You bastard.

780
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,660
You bastard.

781
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,660
You bastard.

782
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,660
I'm sorry.

783
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,660
Hey.

784
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,660
Let go.

785
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,660
Let go.

786
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,660
You bastard.

787
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,660
I surrender.

788
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,660
What?

789
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,660
What?

790
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:24,660
What?

791
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,660
What?

792
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,660
What?

793
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,660
What?

794
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,660
What?

795
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:34,660
What?

796
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,660
What?

797
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:39,660
I have to go see my sister.

798
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,660
Hey, Jinmoo.

799
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,660
Hey.

800
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,660
Jinmoo.

801
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,660
What?

802
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,660
Get a grip.

803
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,660
Jinmoo.

804
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,660
Jinmoo.

805
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:57,660
Jinmoo.

806
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,660
Please get a grip.

807
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:01,660
Jinmoo.

808
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:23,660
In a dream like a dream

809
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:29,660
Hidden at the end

810
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:35,660
I don't know anything

811
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:45,660
I'm going to throw it away on your rock

812
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:51,660
Thanks for watching.
