On the night ofQUARANTIN interview

2
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,400
Daughter.

3
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,100
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,800
If it wasn't for you.

5
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,060
Mom,

6
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,640
you would never know about this,

7
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,840
if you had even had themya.

8
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,580
Chaewoon atger't

9
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,160
was busy doing

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,400
the odpow embargo for Kyungsin.

11
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,020
You'd never take that as a steel

12
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,960
for a Trump.

13
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,300
You lose

14
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,700
Say it!

15
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,500
Father...

16
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,900
I've suffered too much.

17
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,600
I feel like I'm in a blood vessel.

18
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,500
I don't know what to do.

19
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,100
Father, what should I do?

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,300
What should I do?

21
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,300
I didn't contact you.

22
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,300
I didn't call you!

23
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,500
I'm sorry, father.

24
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,300
It's all my fault.

25
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,300
I was trying to save you,

26
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,500
but I couldn't.

27
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,500
I'm sorry, father.

28
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,300
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,900
It's all my fault.

30
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,500
I can't let you go.

31
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,900
I can't let you go!

32
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,900
Who died?

33
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,900
Why are you crying and crying?

34
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,700
What's wrong with us?

35
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,100
Who is that man?

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,700
Who is his son?

37
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,500
What's wrong with us?

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,100
Stop it.

39
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,900
You got stabbed in the stomach.

40
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,700
What's the big deal?

41
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Why did you kill him?

42
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,700
Father...

43
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,300
Why did you come here?

44
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,100
What are you going to do to my son?

45
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,900
Go away.

46
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,500
I don't want to see your face.

47
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,900
I'll go after I see your surgery.

48
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,500
Go away!

49
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,300
Why did you

50
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,100
kill my son?

51
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,500
What right do you have?

52
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Who did this to you?

53
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,700
If it weren't for you,

54
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,900
I wouldn't have been able to

55
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,900
be here.

56
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
And now, in the operating room,

57
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,900
that man...

58
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,900
That man...

59
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Do you know what kind of son he is?

60
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,900
He's not like any other son.

61
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,900
My son,

62
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,900
I'm going to kill him.

63
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,900
He's the one who's stuck here.

64
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
He's my son.

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,900
I'm not going to let him grow up.

66
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,900
I'm not going to let him take care of me.

67
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,900
I'm going to make him pay for the delivery

68
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,900
and I'm going to kill him.

69
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,900
I've been doing this for a long time.

70
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,900
There are many opportunities for revenge.

71
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,900
Hurry up and join the

72
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,900
Macau New Beijing Entertainment City 772772.com

73
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,900
I'm going to live a little longer.

74
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,900
Okay, really.

75
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,900
It's going to be okay.

76
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,900
Don't cry, honey.

77
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,900
Don't cry.

78
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,900
I can't give my son to you.

79
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,900
I can't show him my face.

80
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,900
He's right in front of you.

81
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,900
I don't know what kind of son he is.

82
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,900
So, please leave the house.

83
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,900
Please.

84
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,900
I'm begging you.

85
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,900
Please leave.

86
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900
Go away.

87
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,900
Go away, honey.

88
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,900
Go away.

89
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,900
Go away.

90
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,900
Go away.

91
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,900
Go away.

92
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
Go away.

93
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,900
Go away.

94
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,900
Be careful.

95
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
It's my baby.

96
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,900
What did you say?

97
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Say something.

98
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,900
What?

99
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
It's your father.

100
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,900
Did you recognize him?

101
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Why is my baby so wrinkly?

102
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,900
What are you talking about?

103
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Mother.

104
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,900
Are you okay?

105
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,900
Mother.

106
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Mother.

107
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
Mother.

108
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,900
Wake up.

109
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Mother.

110
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,900
I think my baby cried a lot.

111
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,900
He's swollen.

112
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,900
I'm fine.

113
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
Mother.

114
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,900
What are you doing?

115
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,900
Open your eyes.

116
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
What are you doing?

117
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
You can't do this here.

118
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
You have to be safe.

119
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,900
Please leave.

120
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
Open your eyes.

121
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
What are you doing?

122
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
I opened my eyes.

123
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Hurry up.

124
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,900
Oh, my.

125
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,900
I'll be here.

128
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
You both go in.

129
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
I'll stay here.

130
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,900
Go inside and get some money.

131
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,900
I don't need it.

132
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,900
I'll protect our motherland.

133
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,900
Nobody can touch our motherland.

134
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,900
Go inside.

135
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,300
Ki Cheol!

136
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,220
Where's Mr. Mu Hak?

137
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,780
He fell asleep because of anesthesia.

138
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,420
He's fine now.

139
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,580
You should go back to sleep.

140
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,220
No, I'll go after I see him.

141
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,260
He might wake up one day

142
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,860
and be shocked by what happened.

143
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,700
He might have a heart attack.

144
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,300
I'll call you when he wakes up.

145
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,580
Where are you?

146
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,380
I was working.

147
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,260
What's wrong with your voice?

148
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,340
Did something happen?

149
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,020
Nothing.

150
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,420
Are you late?

151
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,420
Why?

152
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,300
Do you miss me?

153
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,420
Yes.

154
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,420
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,420
I'm late.

156
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,420
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,420
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,420
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,420
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,900
Yes.

161
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,420
Yes?

162
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,420
I'm glad you're by my side.

163
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,940
Then I'll get a cold.

164
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,740
You know that I love you a lot.

165
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Okay, I surrender.

166
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,580
I lost.

167
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,100
I can't help it if you miss me.

168
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,300
Wait a minute.

169
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
I'll fly to you right now.

170
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,420
Okay.

171
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
This...

172
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Are you giving this to me?

173
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,300
When I'm not around,

174
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
think of me.

175
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,380
It's so pretty.

176
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,380
I didn't know you were around.

177
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,380
Hey!

178
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,380
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,380
I...

180
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,380
I can't just wash it.

181
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,380
It's dirty.

182
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,380
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,380
I'm sorry.

184
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,380
I'm sorry.

185
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,380
It's all in the script.

186
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,380
Oh, my goodness.

187
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,380
What's wrong, sir?

188
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,380
What's wrong, sir?

189
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
What's wrong with you?

190
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,380
What's wrong, sir?

191
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,380
What's wrong, sir?

192
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,380
What's wrong, sir?

193
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,380
You said you couldn't.

194
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,380
Then shouldn't you tell me?

195
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,380
I...

196
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,380
I...

197
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,380
I...

198
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,380
I...

199
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,380
I...

200
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,380
I...

201
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,380
I...

202
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,380
I...

203
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,380
Director Yeo, where's Mu Hak?

204
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,380
I'll be right there.

205
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,380
The chairman is at home.

206
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,380
Please come quickly.

207
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,380
The director has been waiting all day.

208
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,380
I waited.

209
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,380
I thought I should tell you in person.

210
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,380
You're so cold.

211
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,380
You're so shameless.

212
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,380
I'm sorry.

213
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,380
I'm sorry.

214
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,380
I'm sorry.

215
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,380
I'm sorry.

216
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,380
I'm sorry.

217
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,380
I'm sorry.

218
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,460
I'm sorry.

219
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,460
Sometimes, bad things happen.

220
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,460
It's not my intention.

221
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,460
You don't know how I feel.

222
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
I've been thinking.

223
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,460
How can I do that to my dad?

224
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,540
How can you eat with me,

225
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,540
apply for a funeral,

226
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,540
sponsor an art gallery,

227
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,540
comfort and support me?

228
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,540
The answer is easy.

229
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,540
You were fine.

230
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,540
You're a monster who can't feel anything.

231
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,540
That's you.

232
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,540
You said it.

233
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,540
Even if you put on a luxury brand from head to toe,

234
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,540
you can't hide your identity.

235
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,620
People and food are important.

236
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,620
That's right.

237
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,620
No matter how much money and money

238
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,620
you put on the packaging,

239
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,620
you're a cheap girl who only knows money.

240
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,620
I don't know if you believe me,

241
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,620
but I'll tell you everything I've done.

242
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,620
I was sincere about what I said and did.

243
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,620
Don't doubt my love for you.

244
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,620
You're a cheap girl.

245
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,620
You're a cheap girl.

246
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,620
I'm sorry.

247
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,620
You should have just stayed there.

248
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,620
You'll be back soon.

249
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,620
I'm sorry.

250
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,620
I'll get you a mirror.

251
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,620
What?

252
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,620
A mirror.

253
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,620
A mirror?

254
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,620
Why would a sick person need a mirror?

255
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,620
Do you have a tissue?

256
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,620
Wet tissue.

257
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,620
Wet tissue.

258
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,620
Wet tissue.

259
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,620
Wet tissue.

260
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,620
Wet tissue.

261
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,620
Perfume.

262
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,620
Perfume.

263
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,620
What?

264
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,620
Mine.

265
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,620
Here it is.

266
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,620
Wet tissue.

267
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,620
Yes?

268
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,620
I'm sorry.

269
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,620
I've waited for you.

270
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,620
I'll call you right after I call you.

271
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,620
What are you doing?

272
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,700
I'm at the hospital.

273
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
I'm not a bad person.

274
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,700
I'm not that bad.

275
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
I'm really fine.

276
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,700
It's because I'm wearing a suit.

277
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,700
If I had been more comfortable,

278
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,700
I would have been a complete loser.

279
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,700
I should have changed the number 3 and 4.

280
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,700
I forgot to change them.

281
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,700
I changed them to number 5 and 6.

282
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
I'm fine.

283
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,700
Don't get hurt again.

284
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,700
I'm serious.

285
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,700
If you get hurt again,

286
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
I'll get hurt too.

287
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,700
What?

288
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,700
So don't get hurt again.

289
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,700
I'm sorry.

290
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,700
I'm sorry.

291
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,700
I'm sorry.

292
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,700
You didn't see Seok-geu-ram?

293
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,700
Isn't it a must-see course in the school?

294
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
That time,

295
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
I couldn't go on a school trip

296
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,700
because I was told that a group of customers would come to the store.

297
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,700
It's different.

298
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
Such an art piece.

299
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,700
You must have seen a lot.

300
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,700
You majored in Asian art.

301
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,700
Actually, I haven't seen it yet.

302
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Why?

303
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
I couldn't go on a school trip because I was sick.

304
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,700
I couldn't go to a school event with my dad.

305
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,700
I had several chances to go,

306
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,700
but I couldn't go.

307
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,780
I think I was going to go with you.

308
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,780
Then when I'm discharged,

309
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,780
shall we go to Gyeongju?

310
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,780
To see Seok-geu-ram.

311
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,780
I can go tomorrow.

312
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,780
It's true.

313
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,780
Stop sleeping.

314
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,780
It's hard.

315
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,780
Why?

316
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,780
You can't come here.

317
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,780
Go to sleep.

318
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,780
I'm sick.

319
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,780
No.

320
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,780
I'm not sick.

321
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,780
I'm not sick.

322
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,780
I'm not sick.

323
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
I'm not sick.

324
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,780
I'm not sick.

325
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,780
It hurts.

326
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,780
It hurts.

327
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,780
It hurts.

328
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,780
It hurts.

329
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,780
I'll give you all the best of me

330
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,780
and you can be the rest of me

331
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:04,780
Will you stay by my side?

332
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,780
Never gonna let you go

333
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,780
and I swear to you there's something

334
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,780
I promise

335
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,780
I'll always make you smile

336
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,780
I promise

337
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,780
I'll always make you smile

338
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,780
I promise

339
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,780
I'll always make you smile

340
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,780
I promise

341
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:46,780
I'll always make you smile

342
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,780
I promise

343
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:56,860
I'll always make you smile

344
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,860
I promise

345
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,860
I'll always make you smile

346
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:08,860
I promise

347
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:13,860
I'll always make you smile

348
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,860
I promise

349
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,940
Don't come back.

350
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,940
I'm sure I told you that.

351
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,940
You can ignore a pure person like me.

352
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,940
I won't.

353
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,940
The more you act like this,

354
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,940
the harder it will be to do anything.

355
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,940
Before you become a man,

356
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,940
I'll call off your marriage.

357
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,940
I know you're not guilty.

358
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,940
I know you're overflowing with love for Mu Hak.

359
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,940
No, I'm not good enough.

360
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,940
Mu Hak and I...

361
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,940
We love each other deeply.

362
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,940
We can't break up.

363
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,940
Listen to your parents.

364
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,940
Listen to me.

365
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,940
Do you know why this happened?

366
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,940
The video that was on the news all day long.

367
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,940
My eldest son took it.

368
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,940
Mu Hak's mother.

369
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,940
He said that he traded with Jang Tae Jin.

370
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,940
The video of your father's death.

371
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,940
Young lady.

372
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,940
Can you see his face?

373
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,940
I can't see your face.

374
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,940
He's not my son.

375
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,940
He's my son.

376
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,940
How can I see your face?

377
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,940
No matter how old you are, you're still my father.

378
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,940
I can't see you because I'm not guilty.

379
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,940
I can't see you even if I die.

380
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,940
But...

381
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,940
I'll cut ties with my parents.

382
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,940
I'll cut ties with my brother.

383
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,940
Young lady.

384
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,940
Please cut ties with me.

385
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,940
I've learned something from this.

386
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,940
People...

387
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,940
live with people who are similar.

388
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,940
Young lady.

389
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,940
Please go to your world.

390
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,940
You have to eat the pine leaves.

391
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,940
We can't...

392
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,940
see each other again.

393
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,940
The End

394
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,940
Honey.

395
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,940
Honey.

396
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,940
Honey.

397
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,940
Honey, I made you a soup.

398
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,940
What?

399
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,940
I made you a soup.

400
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,940
Go wash it.

401
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,940
He's drunk.

402
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,940
How is it?

403
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
It's cool, right?

404
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,940
Why did you come to my house

405
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,940
after leaving your father?

406
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,940
You don't like this neighborhood.

407
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,940
I don't like this neighborhood.

408
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,940
I only remember the hard times.

409
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,940
I remember the old days

410
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,940
when we ate together.

411
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,940
We ate cold rice with the leftover soup.

412
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,940
We ate and drank.

413
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,940
We went to the market.

414
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,940
I think...

415
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,940
I was the happiest.

416
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,940
When we were living together,

417
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,940
we were the only two people in the world.

418
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,940
I never thought about being lonely.

419
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,940
You're lying.

420
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,940
What?

421
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,940
You're not lonely because of me?

422
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,940
You're not lonely because of someone else?

423
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,940
I'm fine now.

424
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,940
Stop bothering me.

425
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,940
Call me brother and mother.

426
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,940
It's enough for a year.

427
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,940
You should have told me about that.

428
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,940
You're still crying

429
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,940
because of that.

430
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,940
You said you knew even if you were wrong.

431
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,940
Why is that because of brother and mother?

432
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,940
That's how it happened.

433
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,940
And you're responsible for your father.

434
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,940
You know that.

435
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,940
You're being punished for it.

436
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,940
Isn't that right?

437
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,940
Stop being stubborn.

438
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,940
What if...

439
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,940
you meet another man?

440
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,940
What?

441
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,940
I'm meeting another man?

442
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,940
Wait.

443
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,940
What?

444
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,940
Mother?

445
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,940
Find her before it's too late.

446
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
I'm not happy.

447
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,940
There's nothing to be happy about.

448
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,940
If you live with someone you like,

449
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,940
you'll be happy.

450
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,940
Dress up,

451
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,940
take a bath,

452
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,940
and put on some perfume.

453
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,940
Go to places like this.

454
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,940
What's this?

455
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,940
Red tea and madeleine.

456
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,940
What? Are you tasting it?

457
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,940
You're so stubborn.

458
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,940
You're always eating meat.

459
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,940
What's that smell?

460
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,940
I own a new rooftop room.

461
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,940
When are you taking this?

462
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,940
You're such a beggar.

463
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,940
You know you have to pay for it, right?

464
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,940
You're the one who's busy.

465
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,940
If you don't take it in three days...

466
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,940
What?

467
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,940
You hung up?

468
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,940
You're so rude.

469
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:14,940
Brother!

470
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,940
Brother!

471
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,940
Brother!

472
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,940
Why didn't you answer when I was calling you?

473
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,940
What's wrong?

474
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,940
Please change the tiles in the bathroom.

475
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,940
It's a rooftop room,

476
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,940
but it's too old.

477
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,940
Are you going to pay for it?

478
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,940
If you're going to pay,

479
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,940
then do the tiles.

480
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,940
I don't have that kind of money.

481
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,940
Then at least change the wallpaper.

482
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,940
The best-quality wallpapers.

483
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,940
I just got them all.

484
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,940
Why did you change them?

485
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,940
They don't match my closet.

486
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,940
Then change the closet.

487
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,940
Then change the wallpapers.

488
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,940
I can't let you do this.

489
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,940
Why the wallpapers?

490
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,940
They're not marble.

491
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,940
They stick to the floor.

492
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,940
Change them to marble.

493
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,940
I got them.

494
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,940
They're Italian.

495
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,940
Just leave.

496
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,940
What?

497
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,940
You were so proud of yourself

498
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,940
that you paid for the room.

499
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,940
The marble floor on the silk wallpaper?

500
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,940
There are so many people

501
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,940
who want to come into my house.

502
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,940
Call the real estate company

503
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,940
and I'll just...

504
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,940
Yes, Mr. Song Kyu.

505
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,940
Really? I didn't know.

I'll have theived.

Okay.

526
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,940
I'll do it.

527
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,940
You're so mean.

528
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,940

I'm the wind-surfing queen of Majang-dong.

531
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,740
What's the big deal about this?

532
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,340
Mom,

533
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,540
why don't you call your father?

534
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,740
I'm the one who's guilty,

535
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,540
but you're the only one who's guilty.

536
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,740
Forget it.

537
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,740
I'm so relieved that you're not a lawyer.

538
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,940
Ooh.

539
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,040
Hello.

00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,380

541
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,540
Are you okay?

542
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,840
I'm really weak.

543
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,140
You need to lose some weight

544
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,540
to bend down.

545
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,540
What are you going to do?

546
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,540
What if you get sick?

547
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,540
What should I do?

548
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,040
I have to get over it

549
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,540
to make you feel better.

550
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,540
My goodness.

551
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,040
You're crying.

552
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,540
My honey, you're too skinny.

553
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,540
You're too skinny.

554
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,540
What?

555
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,540
You little brat.

556
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,540
Honey, I'm sorry.

557
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,540
Let's go home.

558
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,540
Everyone, this is my father.

559
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,540
The owner of the company.

560
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,540
He's my father.

561
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,540
I heard that the cleaning exhibition

562
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,540
is going to be a big hit.

563
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,540
Why don't you go?

564
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,540
I think you should go at least once.

565
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,540
I told you not to talk about cleaning in front of me.

566
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,540
If you can hear me

567
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,540
on the way to the office,

568
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,540
I'll go to the office.

569
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,540
I'm sorry.

570
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,540
What's wrong?

571
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,540
What's wrong?

572
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,540
Nothing.

573
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:59,160
I was just looking at the

574
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,540
Then,

575
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,540
you should work on

576
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,540
the art camp with Cha-ki.

577
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,540
This year, we have a lot of sponsors.

578
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,540
Don't worry about the budget.

579
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,540
Okay.

580
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,540
You're so nice.

581
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,540
Thank you.

582
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,540
Thank you.

583
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,540
It's been a long time.

584
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,540
Director.

585
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,540
Director.

586
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,540
You said you were coming next month.

587
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,540
I just stopped by.

588
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,540
I have something important to do.

589
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,540
Something important?

590
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,540
What's important?

591
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,540
Give me the bag.

592
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,540
You should have called me.

593
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,540
I would have taken you to the airport.

594
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,540
It's great.

595
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,540
I had so many questions

596
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,540
about the cleaning art camp.

597
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,540
You're the idea bank.

598
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,540
By the way,

599
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,540
how about a dinner tonight?

600
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,540
You must have eaten a lot.

601
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,540
It's clean and easy.

602
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,540
Shall we?

603
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,540
Sure.

604
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,540
Sounds good.

605
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,540
I'll make the reservation.

606
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,540
That's how you live in society.

607
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,540
Why am I so bad?

608
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,540
Let's learn from each other.

609
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,540
What's wrong?

610
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,540
It's like a rule.

611
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,540
I know.

612
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,540
Don't cry.

613
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,540
It's been a long time.

614
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,540
I forgot to tell you.

615
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,540
How much do you think Sang-Yoon

616
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,540
If you need anything,

617
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,540
feel free to tell me.

618
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,540
Thank you.

619
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:03,540
Thank you.

620
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,540
Don't cry.

621
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,540
Sang-Yoon.

622
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,540
Jins...

623
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,540
Jins...

624
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,540
Are you checking the expiration date?

625
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,540
Yes, of course.

626
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,540
The new recruits will be training next week.

627
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,540
You guys will be in charge of the training.

628
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,540
You should be responsible

629
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,540
for teaching the students, not the juniors.

630
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,540
It's not a big deal.

631
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,540
We'll upgrade the season menu.

632
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,540
I'll take care of this.

633
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,540
You can leave.

634
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,540
How's the new menu?

635
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,540
It's okay.

636
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,540
But the omelet is not enough.

637
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,540
I'll make it more.

638
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,540
I'll make it more if I have time.

639
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,540
I'll make it more.

640
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,540
I'll make it more.

641
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,540
I'll make it more.

642
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,540
I'll make it more.

643
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,540
I'll make it more.

644
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,540
I'll make it more.

645
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,540
I'll make it more.

646
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,540
I'll make it more.

647
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,540
I'll make it more.

648
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,540
I'll make it more.

649
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,540
I'll make it more.

650
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,540
I'll make it more.

651
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,540
I'll make it more.

652
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,540
I'll make it more.

653
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,540
I'm in Korea.

654
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,540
But I can't reach you.

655
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,540
You can call me if you're worried.

656
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,540
It's not like that.

657
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,540
It's not like that.

658
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,540
You've been touching your phone.

659
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,540
You saw his face.

660
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,540
I know.

661
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,540
I told you to call me first.

662
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:19,540
Did you do everything I told you to do?

663
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,540
You've done everything I told you to do.

664
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:26,540
I know everything.

665
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,540
You always talk about studying when you're talking.

666
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,540
I didn't get an ice cube even of the songkranme.

667
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,540
Is there any food at home?

668
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,540
I can't eat because I'm worried about you.

669
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,540
Then, ramen?

670
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,540
Okay.

671
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:57,540
It's great to come to my home.

672
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,540
Wait a minute.

673
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:06,900
It's trash.

674
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,540
Why?

675
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,960
There must be something in it.

676
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,340
I meant the garbage.

677
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,360
What trash is this?

678
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,000
It costs 200,000 taels.

679
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,260
Toilets for beggars

680
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,460
shouldn't besod terrific.

681
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,280
It's your hands vs yours.

682
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,520
I've been trying to get along with the landlord

683
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,680
for the past two days.

684
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,520
Don't call me again.

685
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,280
What's wrong with you?

686
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,880
I'm the landlord here.

687
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,480
Don't you know the protection of the rooftop room?

688
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,920
The protection of the rooftop room?

689
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,120
Is it the protection of the rental car?

690
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,320
Not the car, the room.

691
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,360
So the rental car...

692
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,960
You can protect the car, the room, anything.

693
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,960
This is crazy.

694
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,920
Do you have a bed over there?

695
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,560
What?

696
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,320
If you don't, I'll pay for it.

697
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,200
Who would use a beggar like you?

698
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,160
How much is it?

699
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,720
100 dollars.

700
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,560
100 dollars?

701
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,560
It's a beggar.

702
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,120
I paid more than 1 million dollars.

703
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,160
Even if you want to throw it away,

704
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,800
you have to pay at least 10 dollars.

705
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,200
But it's 100 dollars.

706
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,600
Wow.

707
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,400
The police are going to catch the eyes of the citizens.

708
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,320
You're right.

709
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,760
A criminal police like you

710
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,800
needs to eat red rice to wake up.

711
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,600
You're right.

712
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,320
How many times did you say,

713
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,320
I'm the landlord?

714
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,800
What are you doing in a girl's room?

715
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,520
What?

716
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,600
I don't eat red rice in prison these days.

717
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,600
You're pretending to know

718
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,920
that you've never been to a prison.

719
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,120
I'm on my way to a prison.

720
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,720
My dad wants to see me.

721
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,000
It's nice to be on a special trip with my dad.

722
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Isn't it nice?

723
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,520
I saw you trick me into going to a room

724
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,200
that's like a beggar's house.

725
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,720
Okay, okay.

726
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,800
Take this and do everything.

727
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,800
Okay?

728
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,480
How dare you wipe the bed with a blanket?

729
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,480
What else?

730
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,680
Buy me a meal.

731
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,280
Why would I buy you a meal?

732
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,280
The noodles are good, right?

733
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,880
The Chinese restaurant in front is good.

734
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,880
Why would I buy you a meal?

735
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,280
Should we go with the fan?

736
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,280
It's okay to use the microwave.

737
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,880
No, the fan is not working.

738
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,280
It's not working.

739
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,280
Why would I buy you a meal?

740
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,880
Because you're hungry.

741
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,160
Why are you telling me that you're hungry?

742
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,160
Me?

743
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,760
You're good at editing.

744
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,360
What?

745
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,560
I'm not. Why would I go there?

746
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,960
I'm hungry.

747
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,520
What do you think about the

748
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,560
illegal distribution today?

749
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,880
You said you would sign the paper.

750
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,760
Is that true?

751
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,360
Do you have anything to say to the chief?

752
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,060
Do you think no more isinaudible?

753
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,480
Did you bring a participant until today?

754
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,080
You can give it to the manager.

755
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,920
Most people listen to them.

756
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,280
Is that your phrase?

757
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,360
You are such a troublemaker.

758
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,360
Please give us your comment.

759
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,920
Do you appreciate your rescued?

760
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,480
This is too arrogant.

761
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,820
Please, let us in this room.

762
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:08,560
Come on, let me through.

763
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,580
Please let me pass.

764
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,660
Please let us in.

765
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,720
Let me go through here.

766
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,680
It's the Степхе, the most beautiful place in the whole world!

767
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,040
Will you really do that?

768
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,280
Could there be some other way?

769
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,840
Putting up weddingare quite

770
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,040
unexpectedly difficult for me?

771
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,620
I think I'm not very friendly to them.

772
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,760
Besides, I can't give up the exhibition on the weekend.

773
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:51,760
That's why you should focus on your choices.

774
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,460
If you want to congratulate me for my happiness,

775
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,260
you can have a weekend's evening party.

776
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,460
It's a wedding with those people

777
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,120
at the art gallery.

778
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,320
You can attend the wedding,

779
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,460
watch the exhibition,

780
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,520
and share your dignity.

781
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,120
Stop it!

782
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,920
Goodbye.

783
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,320
What was that?

784
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,560
One person is a team in a month?

785
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,460
So this is a complete mess.

786
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,760
Because it won't be done by me.

787
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,160
What are you doing?

788
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,680
Don't you know that?

789
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,120
A consultant who doesn't make money

790
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,160
but is good at making money

791
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,320
What right does he have?

792
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,120
Do you know me?

793
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,120
Do you think we're a good match?

794
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,320
Thank you

795
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,120
The meeting is not over yet

796
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,120
Right?

797
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,120
Please leave, Dr. Jin

798
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,920
Dr. Jin

799
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,520
What's going on?

800
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,520
Don't you know?

801
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,320
You're a debtor

802
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,720
When did you pay back the debt?

803
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,320
Why are you still talking about debtors?

804
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,520
I know you paid back the interest

805
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,520
But you didn't get a penny wrong

806
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,720
My watch

807
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,920
I took it from the Netherlands a year ago

808
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,520
Don't you remember?

809
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,320
Do you know how much that is?

810
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,520
You should have a conscience

811
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,120
I'm just saying

812
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,720
I'm telling you to take it with money

813
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,520
I'm telling you to buy it with the same model

814
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,120
If you're going to say such a thing, don't do it

815
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,320
That's very important to me

816
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,720
Even if you ask for a penny, I'll just give it to you

817
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,320
I'm sorry

818
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,320
집

819
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,920
Did it start theulative operation?

820
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,320
Your watch

821
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,720
I found it while cleaning up the flat in the Netherlands

822
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,720
Good?

823
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,760
I'm sorry.

824
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,600
You two are always together.

825
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,040
How could you leave me and never call me?

826
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,040
You didn't want to call me until the end?

827
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,120
Do you know how I've been feeling?

828
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,960
What's so serious?

829
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,000
You know why they fought, right?

830
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,800
Well...

831
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,000
You're on a business trip?

832
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,680
I've bought all my stuff.

833
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,160
I just need to leave now.

834
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,480
I heard there's a problem with your work.

835
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,320
I'll be right back.

836
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,320
Where are you going?

837
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,440
The Netherlands.

838
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,440
The Netherlands?

839
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,240
What about Gyeongju?

840
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,320
What about Seok-gu?

841
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,240
I can go there.

842
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,400
I've been wanting to go there since I was born.

843
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,120
Do you know how many times I've been there?

844
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,640
You're busy as you are,

845
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,960
and I'm busy as I am.

846
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,800
Do you know how hard it is to find the time?

847
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,800
What can we do?

848
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,400
The Korean-Nederland exchange may be cancelled.

849
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,680
So you're saying it's okay for Gyeongju and Seok-gu to cancel?

850
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,600
It's just an act.

851
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,600
What?

852
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,160
Sorry, I'll be right back.

853
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,880
It's no use kissing.

854
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,760
You can't do that.

855
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,080
You can't do that today.

856
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,280
If you want to go,

857
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,280
you have to step on me.

858
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,120
Okay?

859
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,840
Step on me!

860
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,840
I'll be right back.

861
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,840
Hey.

862
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,840
Hey!

863
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,840
Hey, Kim Dalin!

864
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,280
He's saying that he's been away for a week.

865
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,000
What do you mean?

866
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,920
He's saying that he's been away for a week?

867
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,080
Why?

868
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,520
He's never dated anyone.

869
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,520
He's so annoying.

870
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,680
I'm so embarrassed.

871
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,080
Why did he do that when he was fine?

872
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,080
Yes.

873
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,080
He's a good man.

874
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,000
Shall we go in?

875
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Okay.

876
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,800
Let's call it a day.

877
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,800
A day?

878
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
What do you mean?

879
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
A day.

880
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
A day.

881
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,600
This is not going to work.

882
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,320
I don't have a choice.

883
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,720
I'll add another $4,000 to make it $7,000.

884
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,200
$7,000?

885
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,720
No.

886
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,320
$3,000, $4,000.

887
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,920
What's $7,000?

888
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,320
Money again?

889
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,520
Money again?

890
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,520
No, no.

891
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,520
Money again?

892
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,640
I think he's talking about fate.

893
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,240
I think he's talking about fate.

894
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,240
Fate?

895
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,240
Fate?

896
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,640
Let's wait and see.

897
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,520
If it's $7,000...

898
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,160
$7,000.

899
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,280
Kim Dalin.

900
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,640
Do you want to go $7,000 with me?

901
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,240
No.

902
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,240
I don't want to.

903
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,240
What?

904
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,240
I don't want to.

905
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,920
Hush.

906
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,120
Are you crazy?

907
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,040
You come out of nowhere!

908
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,040
You stay right there!

909
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,640
Hurry, they're late.

910
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,940
Stop driving...

911
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,040
I am so sorry. I can't finish studying.

912
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,400
What is it?

913
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,380
People can't see each other

914
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,480
I think we should love each other, not the same person.

915
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,280
I love you, Mr. Mu Hak.

916
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,480
You love me too.

917
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,720
Please don't leave me.

918
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,960
Please don't leave me either.

919
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,880
Time will be on your side.

920
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,480
You'll be to come around yourself.

921
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,880
One day it'll be.

922
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,880
Time will be on your side.

923
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:31,680
You'll be to come around yourself.

924
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:35,180
One day it'll be.

925
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:43,180
Time will be on your side.

926
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:48,980
You'll be to come around yourself.

927
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:53,580
One day it'll be.

928
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:05,980
Time will be on your side.

929
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,180
People who work,

930
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,780
mothers who have children,

931
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:20,380
young people who work in the same building,

932
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:24,580
come here and have a chat.

933
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:28,180
Whether you're rich or poor,

934
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:30,380
president or a homeless person,

935
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,280
if you have a ticket,

936
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,880
you can come in and have a chat.

937
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:40,280
You should have a place like that.

938
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,480
Power Food

939
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,080
This was about a love story of Dalin.

940
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,480
And Gamja Tan.

941
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,280
Well, darling, Prince Gamja,

942
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:35,040
Finally, from there they'll never be back

943
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,280
Yeah, we made it

944
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,720
