1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
The Return of Superman

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,100
Dundun F&B is buying the land around the museum

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,760
for free.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,100
Did you hear?

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,160
What?

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,260
After your father died,

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,860
they're buying the land that doesn't matter

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,460
to the location or price.

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,860
They even said they were taking over the construction company.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,160
Aren't you going in?

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,060
Where?

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,760
The art director is here.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:47,780
The one with the

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,780
red hair.

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,580
I saw him earlier when he was at the restaurant.

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,080
He was in a great mood.

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,580
He was giving the director

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,500
snacks and water.

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,980
He was giving them all sorts of things.

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,480
It must be a good time for them to get back together.

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,080
I think so.

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Get back to work.

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,980
What?

24
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,180
Get back to work.

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,380
You treat me as your son-in-law.

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,480
You think everyone else is your son-in-law too?

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
How much do you know about Jin Mak?

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,580
Can I trust you?

29
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,380
You're a good person.

30
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
You're right.

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm here for the stir-fried rice.

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,080
You should've told me earlier.

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,880
You should've told me to pay more attention.

34
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,780
I mean, I'm the kind of person who always provides

35
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,280
the best service to all customers.

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
I'm a good person, but...

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,880
You must work at a restaurant yourself.

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,480
It's hard to make time, but I try to come out

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,280
at least once a month.

40
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,280
That way, I can hear the sound of the scene and

41
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,480
get my first impression.

42
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,280
Your first impression is great.

43
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,480
There's a place for people to be.

44
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,480
Right?

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Thank you.

46
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,480
It's a great compliment that a person who

47
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,680
runs a restaurant suits a person who runs a restaurant.

48
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,480
This stir-fried rice is our signature menu.

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,680
If you try it...

50
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,480
Even after eating this much meat and rice,

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,680
you're still eating stir-fried rice?

52
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,480
What a pathetic and pathetic composition.

53
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,980
Junsun.

54
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,680
What kind of meat should I use to dip

55
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,480
this strong sauce?

56
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,680
People are like that too.

57
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,180
If you cheat a lot, your words and actions

58
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,680
become more dramatic and fancy.

59
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,680
Junsun, that's not...

60
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,280
Stop it.

61
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,480
I thought it was food that looked a lot like

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,180
the owner of this restaurant.

63
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Even if you put a lot of luxury on your head

64
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
and toe, you can't hide your origin.

65
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,980
People and food are the most important.

66
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,180
I said stop it.

67
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,980
I'm sorry, Mr. Ji.

68
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
What do you mean, sorry?

69
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Let's eat.

70
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,480
It might not be enough in terms of composition,

71
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,480
but it's the most popular menu among customers these days.

72
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,480
And Jang Taejin is also a business man like me,

73
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
so you know well,

74
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,480
but the level of customers these days is no joke.

75
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
With the best ingredients and the best ingredients,

76
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,480
they're not only good at introducing their tastes,

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
but also the best at introducing their tastes.

78
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,480
I'm sure you've heard of it.

79
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
I'm sure you've heard of it.

80
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
I'm sure you've heard of it.

81
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
I'm sure you've heard of it.

82
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
With the skills alone,

83
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,480
they can't fool their taste.

84
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,480
Seasoning and sauce only help with the flavor.

85
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,480
As I said, the important thing is the quality.

86
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Don't worry and eat.

87
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Bye.

88
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,480
I heard you're expanding your business in construction.

89
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,480
I heard you're buying a lot of land near the museum.

90
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Is that why you rejected my offer?

91
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,480
You said you'd give me $2 billion.

92
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
I don't think it's something the owner and the customer

93
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,480
will talk about, but let's finish our meal.

94
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
We're done with our meal.

95
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,480
I think we're done with the payment.

96
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Don't avoid answering while you're in that weak job.

97
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Ma Jiang Hu Le Er,

98
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
the Golden Queen,

99
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
the Golden City,

100
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
the Colorful Cat,

101
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
the Golden Captain,

102
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
and so on.

103
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
High pay rates,

104
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
high reward rates.

105
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
There are many opportunities to get rich.

106
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Join the AOMG New Peking Entertainment City

107
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
772772com.

108
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Don't make excuses.

109
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,480
I don't usually lose to a customer

110
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
who gives me a lot of teams.

111
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
I told you last time,

112
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,480
but I don't think you have a good memory,

113
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
so I'll say it again.

114
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Stop being interested in my problem and Kim Dal Lee.

115
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Since when did a big company

116
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
become interested in a big company?

117
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Whether you buy land or a building,

118
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
what are you doing?

119
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,480
And how did you tell me about the construction

120
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,480
that hasn't been reported to me yet?

121
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
What if it's true?

122
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
That's not what I mean.

123
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
That's what you and I are related to.

124
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Why are you saying that here?

125
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
It's a warning.

126
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
A warning?

127
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
I don't know what you're drawing

128
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
for the art department

129
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
with a million dollars.

130
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
But you'll never be able to dream

131
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
like you think you will.

132
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,480
What can I draw with 200 million?

133
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Whether it's a watercolor painting,

134
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
a portrait painting,

135
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,480
or a wall painting,

136
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
I'll do it myself,

137
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,480
so you live your life.

138
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Stop staring at the broken woman's face.

139
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
You punk.

140
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Stop it, Junsu.

141
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Stop it, Ms. Shin.

142
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
If you don't want to be embarrassed,

143
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
you should tell the art department

144
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
that you're going to pay us a few cents.

145
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
I suddenly want to buy it.

146
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
I didn't have any plans,

147
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,480
but if you get excited from the other party,

148
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
it really feels like something is going on.

149
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
And...

150
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
You can pay...

151
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,480
On the counter.

152
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
And make sure you take your money.

153
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,480
I don't know if I've seen you wrong

154
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,480
or if you've changed.

155
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Do I have to do this?

156
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Do you think that's what you think?

157
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Don't you know what you're dreaming of?

158
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
You're going to pretend to be nice

159
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
and pretend to be nice

160
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
and make a lawsuit and auction

161
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
for the art department.

162
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Then you'll have to take the art department.

163
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
The construction company, the surrounding land,

164
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
and everything else.

165
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
No way.

166
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
I know.

167
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
You can't just take it out of your head.

168
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Dali.

169
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Do you still not know who's on your side?

170
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Yes?

171
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Yes.

172
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,480
I'm sure I lent you money.

173
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
I don't want to take a single penny.

174
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
So whether you sell the house or the painting,

175
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
you can sell everything,

176
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,480
but it's best to settle this.

177
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
What right do you have

178
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
to become the art director?

179
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
You said you'd do whatever you wanted.

180
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
I'm not going to do anything.

181
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
I'm just going to do what I want.

182
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
I'm going to do what I want.

183
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
I'm going to do what I want.

184
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
I'm going to do what I want.

185
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
You said you'd do whatever you wanted.

186
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,480
You said you'd accept any conditions.

187
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
You don't have to think it hard.

188
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm going to make my own money and take it.

189
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Is it over already?

190
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
I was just about to leave.

191
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Darn it!

192
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Darn it!

193
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
What's the money?

194
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
I'd just give it to you.

195
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
What's the money?

196
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
What's the money?

197
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,480
You're much braver than you think.

198
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
You're not the type of person

199
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
who gives up because you're afraid of something.

200
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,480
As far as I know.

201
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Let's go.

203
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,480
The person you have called is unavailable.

204
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,480
The person you have called is unavailable.

205
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Isn't that Ms. Moon?

206
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Should I stop?

207
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Just go.

208
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Go.

209
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,480
What on earth are you doing?

210
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,480
What are you talking about?

211
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
What do you mean?

212
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,580
What do you mean you're taking over the construction company?

213
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,660
What?

214
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,420
Construction company?

215
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,660
It must be true.

216
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,560
But where did you hear that?

217
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,160
This is a very urgent situation.

218
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
Father!

219
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,560
You're annoying me.

220
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,260
What did you do?

221
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,260
Fine.

222
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,360
I'll take over the construction company.

223
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,060
I'll play with the company until I'm a middle-aged man.

224
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,460
For the sake of money and the future,

225
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,560
I spent a lot of money.

226
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,960
Do you think anyone can build a building?

227
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,700
What?

228
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,100
Do you think you can build a building just by selling the sign?

229
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,500
Building a building isn't a business. It's politics.

230
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,500
You have to maintain the area and build a network

231
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,960
of politicians to make a fortune.

232
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,300
That's why I'm building a network!

233
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,500
Do you think I'm going to meet people

234
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,100
because I have nothing to do?

235
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,400
What?

236
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,700
I have plans and plans too!

237
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,900
Of course!

238
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,600
No matter how many movies and movies

239
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,700
Ki Cheol has made, he can't do it himself.

240
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,000
My gosh.

241
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,400
Okay, Moa.

242
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,100
I've looked into it too, but this time, it's a real deal.

243
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,900
I don't have to worry too much

244
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,300
because I know the exact person and the exact information.

245
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,200
So you were buying land around the museum

246
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,400
without me knowing?

247
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,200
Did Ahn Sangtae tell you to do that?

248
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,000
Since when did I get fired for deciding on money?

249
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,200
How can a company be so insured?

250
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,300
I'm telling you,

251
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,700
I'm not interested in land.

252
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,100
If I get 2 billion won from the museum,

253
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,700
I'll get my hands dirty. So...

254
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,300
What's with the construction? Just get rid of it.

255
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,900
If you ever do something like this without me knowing,

256
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,700
I won't see my real father.

257
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,600
I'm not saying anything.

258
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,000
The green belt will be untied soon, you punk!

259
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,300
You can't make a statement this month.

260
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,700
It's the government's decision.

261
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,900
You haven't made a statement yet.

262
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,500
It's already been decided.

263
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,100
The businessmen and the women are all in this together.

264
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,500
You don't even know anything.

265
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
You...

266
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,300
You...

267
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,100
You're doing this because of the women at the museum, right?

268
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,500
Just think that the order has changed.

269
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,100
Our money is 100 to 50.

270
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,700
Do you think you can get away with destroying the museum?

271
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,200
If we start a construction company,

272
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,300
we'll be able to get the money.

273
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,700
I'm telling you,

274
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,300
if we start a construction company,

275
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,900
we'll be able to get the money.

276
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,800
If we start a construction company,

277
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,100
someone will start a 100 to 50-year-old business.

278
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,900
Does this make you think you can get away with this?

279
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,300
Of course, there's a higher line.

280
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
We can't make a new city by destroying the development plan.

281
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,900
What's the use of having a new member?

282
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,300
I think...

283
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,600
An Sangtae is a new-born.

284
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,900
Who's that higher line?

285
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,100
I don't know.

286
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,800
I think Heechul knows something.

287
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,300
He doesn't open his mouth.

288
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,100
I just happened to see the head of the land.

289
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,500
The VIP guests at the opening party.

290
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,500
I saw a lot of their names.

291
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,300
You're late.

292
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,300
Did you wait for me?

293
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,100
It's nice to live in the same house.

294
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,300
You wait for me even though you're late.

295
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Do you have anything else to say?

296
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
I think I've said everything.

297
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,300
About earlier...

298
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
I was worried about you.

299
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,300
I was worried about you.

300
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,300
I was worried about you.

301
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,700
I'm sorry.

302
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,700
Why did you do that?

303
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,900
Well...

304
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,500
Did you think I was a cheap and innocent person?

305
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
No, it's not that.

306
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,300
I'm not that rude.

307
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,700
I think I've become too emotional.

308
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
So don't take it to heart.

309
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,900
You're driving me crazy.

310
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,700
What?

311
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,300
Hey, Ms. Kim.

312
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,900
Do you know what kind of people I've been through

313
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,900
since I was 10 years old?

314
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,100
They say you don't even touch dogs when you eat.

315
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
That's insult to dogs.

316
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,100
Do you know how many people are worse than dogs?

317
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,900
That Jang Taejin?

318
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,600
He doesn't even listen to me.

319
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,900
He doesn't even like me.

320
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,100
But...

321
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,300
He didn't sleep until this hour to protect that kid

322
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,500
and he's apologizing instead of waiting?

323
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,900
That's rude.

324
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,500
Isn't that a bit too much?

325
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,900
Then what about you, Ms. Jin?

326
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,300
Shouldn't you make excuses or explain yourself?

327
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,700
Excuses?

328
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,100
Why didn't you answer my call?

329
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,900
Did you mean that I did something bad

330
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,500
that you should make excuses?

331
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,700
You're a real estate agent and a construction worker.

332
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,100
It's true that you're suspicious.

333
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,500
You said my brother bought some land.

334
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
Do I have to report that?

335
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,500
Because I like you?

336
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,500
I told you from the beginning.

337
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,700
If you get my 20 billion won back,

338
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,900
I'll get my hands on it at the art gallery.

339
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,700
If you can't trust me, you can bring me the 20 billion.

340
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,500
Ask Jang Taejin.

341
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,300
If you can't trust me, you can bring me the 20 billion.

342
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,100
I'll give you 20 billion.

343
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,700
You jerk.

344
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,500
Let's stop.

345
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,900
I think I'll make a mistake next time.

346
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,700
My heart is getting deeper

347
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,100
Please forgive me

348
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:20,100
Our meeting

349
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,100
How did I fall in love at first sight?

350
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,700
What do you mean by that?

351
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,500
It's not easy to explain

352
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,100
It's fate

353
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:44,100
I'll give you this love

354
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:51,500
Because you're the only one I have in my heart

355
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:57,700
I can't live without you anymore

356
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:15,100
What?

357
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,500
What do you mean by that?

358
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,300
Yes, as soon as my father passed away,

359
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,700
the financial situation changed 180 degrees.

360
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Mister.

361
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,700
Please save me.

362
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,900
Let's get rid of everything else.

363
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,500
Let's get rid of our bank account first.

364
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,700
It's a baseless bankruptcy.

365
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,900
What are you doing?

366
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
Give me everything I can get money for.

367
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,300
Don't do this.

368
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,300
These are articles that are being reported to people

369
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
who haven't been in the business for a long time.

370
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,100
Even forced scandals.

371
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,100
Who was the man in the motel with?

372
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,300
Did the man who was with you get hurt?

373
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,100
I didn't think it was moving in an organized way.

374
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,500
As if the museum really wants to close down.

375
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,700
Why do you want the museum to close down?

376
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,700
That's how it gets easier to develop.

377
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,700
I don't know how much I have to believe it,

378
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,300
but it's already decided to remove the green belt.

379
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,300
All that's left is the presentation and the selection of the business owner.

380
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,500
No way.

381
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,300
If it's moving in an organized way,

382
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,900
it means someone is giving orders.

383
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,100
Probably.

384
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:56,420
I'm sure the council will just go to the

385
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,300
person who got the biggest benefit from this project.

386
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,100
The person who has the strongest power

387
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,700
to influence the public, the system, the media, and the law.

388
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,100
But the person who is so smart

389
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,300
that he will never show himself with a mask.

390
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,300
What do you want me to do?

391
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,100
Do you want me to give you a bank loan?

392
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
Do you want me to sell that reporter?

393
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,100
If you get caught,

394
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,100
I'll never let you see the sunlight again.

395
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
If you don't want to be embarrassed,

396
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,100
you should raise your hand when I say I'll give you a few cents.

397
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,100
Do you understand?

398
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
What am I thinking right now?

399
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
I'm sorry.

400
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,100
What am I thinking right now?

401
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,100
Yes.

402
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
What about the candy?

403
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,100
I spilled the candy.

404
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,100
Oh, you liked candy.

405
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
What's wrong?

406
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,100
Oh, the...

407
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,100
The brochure design at the printing house

408
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
was a little messy.

409
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,100
I asked the printing house to send me the brochure design again,

410
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,100
but Gong-ju quit again.

411
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,100
She didn't answer the phone and didn't open the mail.

412
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,100
And the computer was locked.

413
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,100
I have to return the final data of the Chungseong Art Camp,

414
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,100
but I didn't know what would happen, so I consulted with her.

415
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,100
I guess it wasn't just a simple job.

416
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,100
I just found out because it was under the desk.

417
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,100
Hey, these days are scary.

418
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,100
What are you going to do if you quit without a personal connection?

419
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,100
Is it over when you go to study abroad?

420
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,100
Do you think we'll never meet again?

421
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
You're amazing.

422
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
The land near the Chungseong Art Museum

423
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,100
is the land that An Sang-tae has as his name.

424
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,100
Yes.

425
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
Investigate what kind of relationship it is with An Sang-tae,

426
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,100
and find out about people who have recently lost their ownership.

427
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
From about five or six years ago.

428
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
No, until ten years ago.

429
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,100
Find out everything.

430
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,100
Yes, sir.

431
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,100
Here.

432
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,100
You're going to do something important,

433
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
so you can't take a single step.

434
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
Do the cross-check, okay?

435
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Yes, sir.

436
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,100
What are you doing?

437
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
What do you think this is?

438
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
What is this?

439
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
It says here.

440
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
The dead and the alive.

441
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,100
Isn't this the number one?

442
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
The art number?

443
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,100
Why are you looking for bean paste?

444
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Is this even a collection?

445
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,100
What's the use of this?

446
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
Buak.

447
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
I'm really confident this time.

448
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,100
Trust me just once and help me.

449
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,100
We talked about that yesterday.

450
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,100
You know how hard I worked to become your real son, right?

451
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
As soon as the family law changed,

452
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,100
I applied for a transfer of success myself.

453
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,100
Do you know what was easy about being a son-in-law

454
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
when you were five?

455
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
That was...

456
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,100
I was denying my identity.

457
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
Even after I became a son-in-law,

458
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,100
I worked really hard to be recognized by my father.

459
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,100
But I still couldn't.

460
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,100
What can I do?

461
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
What can I do?

462
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,100
I don't have a business wish like you.

463
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,100
I don't have a big fortune.

464
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,100
I don't have luck either.

465
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,100
I don't have a good background.

466
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

467
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
But it's really different this time.

468
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,100
You're going to get three chances for the rest of your life.

469
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,100
The first one was to become your father's son.

470
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
The second one was to be related to Cheongsong.

471
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
And now it's the third one.

472
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
This is not the second time, you idiot.

473
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,100
Who's the son-in-law?

474
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,100
Why are you so confident about it?

475
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,100
No.

476
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,100
Or you'll get hurt.

477
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
Seriously.

478
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,100
I'm not joking.

479
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,100
It's really dangerous.

480
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
If this goes off, the world will be upside down.

481
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,100
And it's like you're looking for something.

482
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
You've been looking all over the room.

483
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
But there's nothing that's gone.

484
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,100
You told me to just let you see the director.

485
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,100
How could you do that?

486
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,100
It's not a regular company. It's an art gallery.

487
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,100
How could you know what would happen?

488
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,100
I just quietly followed him for a day.

489
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,100
And as expected,

490
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,100
he was lying about the address.

491
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,100
But he did a great job.

492
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,100
I'm so grateful for him.

493
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,100
I did a great job.

494
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
I have a sense of it.

495
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,100
I think it's that princess.

496
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,100
You can go now.

497
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,100
The writers have a meeting.

498
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,100
Are you sure you're okay by yourself?

499
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,100
Of course.

500
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
I'll talk to her.

501
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,100
I'll be right back.

502
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,100
Hey, you guys ate that, right?

503
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,100
No.

504
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,100
It's you, right? The girl who stole my dumplings.

505
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
What?

506
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
I counted 17 yesterday.

507
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,100
But there were only 8 left.

508
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
You were the only one who stayed at the orphanage all day.

509
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
Do you want to live like that?

510
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,100
You counted the number of dumplings.

511
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,100
You're so stubborn.

512
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,100
What? Stubborn?

513
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
How dare you pretend to be a high-ranking official?

514
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
You're not letting go of this?

515
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
Art gallery?

516
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,100
Everyone here knows that you were a drunkard.

517
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,100
You want to die?

518
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
You're not letting go of my dumplings.

519
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
Put this down.

520
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,100
Put this down.

521
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,100
What's wrong with you?

522
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
Who are you?

523
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,100
You stole my dumplings.

524
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,100
Come here.

525
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,100
You're not letting go of my dumplings.

526
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Let go of me.

527
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,100
Let go of me.

528
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,100
How do you feel about seeing my floor?

529
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,100
It feels good.

530
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Can I talk to you now?

531
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
You quit the art gallery.

532
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,100
I'm not interested in your floor.

533
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,100
What were you looking for in my room?

534
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,100
What?

535
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,100
The hall, the rooftop, and if I guessed right,

536
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,100
the whole house.

537
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,100
What were you looking for?

538
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

539
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,100
This is the current detective's house.

540
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,100
I've been looking for witnesses

541
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
and even CCTV footage.

542
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,100
I came here because I didn't have any evidence.

543
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

544
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,100
I just looked around.

545
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,100
I wanted to know what kind of house

546
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
the mother and daughter lived in.

547
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,100
Can't I?

548
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Then call the police.

549
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,100
I can't if you tell me to.

550
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,100
So do it.

551
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:19,820
I just need to get a

552
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,100
I guess I found it.

553
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
Who the heck are you?

554
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
Why are you doing this to me?

555
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,100
Why are you doing this to us?

556
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,100
You think you're very different from me, don't you?

557
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,100
No.

558
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:38,100
You could have been me and I could have been you.

559
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,100
You and I were just dolls

560
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,100
that were made to be pulled out of dolls.

561
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
Ask Kim Siyeong.

562
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
This is all I can say to her.

563
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Ms. Na.

564
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
We're from Seongdong.

565
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,100
You should come with us.

566
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:40,100
Hey, hey.

567
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,100
I'll call you as soon as the test results come out.

568
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,100
Hey, Wanta.

569
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
You can't let this out.

570
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
If this comes out of the museum...

571
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Don't worry.

572
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
I need to get a call from Siyeong.

573
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,100
I'll be right there.

574
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,100
What about the cleaners?

575
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,100
Are you a little upset because it's a drug scandal?

576
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,100
You think you're very different from me, don't you?

577
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,100
You and I were just dolls that were made to be pulled out of dolls.

578
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
No, no.

579
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,100
I'm going to lose my job today.

580
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,100
What is that?

581
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,100
He's not even wearing an umbrella.

582
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Oh, my.

583
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,100
Here.

584
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,100
A car.

585
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,100
What?

586
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,100
Stop the car.

587
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Ms. Na.

588
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
What are you doing here without an umbrella?

589
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
Are you here to see me?

590
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,100
I'll call you.

591
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
What if you go to work?

592
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Wait a minute.

593
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,100
I'll be like this for a moment.

594
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,100
Okay.

595
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
Okay.

596
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,100
I just happened to run out of the car.

597
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,100
What car?

598
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,100
I forgot to tell you that I was preparing.

599
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,100
I thought you were in good shape and didn't react,

600
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,100
so I took a special two-shot.

601
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
Two shots?

602
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Do you want one more shot?

603
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
It's okay. Thank you.

604
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,100
Tell me whenever you need it.

605
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,100
Then...

606
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,100
I'll go.

607
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,100
He abandoned Jang Taejin and my wife?

608
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,100
Why?

609
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,100
He has a unique taste.

610
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
I like your work.

611
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,100
I like your work.

612
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,100
Doenjang-danjang.

613
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
You look happy, right?

614
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,100
I don't know.

615
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,100
I put it up to make you feel better.

616
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
The person who lives with you

617
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,100
is a superstitious, evil, and unrighteous person.

618
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
He really likes things like that.

619
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,100
Anyway,

620
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,100
what if you're already like this?

621
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,100
What?

622
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,100
I can see you when I get off work,

623
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,100
but I can't help it.

624
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,100
If you run into the rain and hug me in front of the company,

625
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,100
and in front of all the employees,

626
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,100
I'd be so happy.

627
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,100
My gosh.

628
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,100
Is it because of what I said yesterday?

629
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,100
I was just a little scared.

630
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,100
I thought of you,

631
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,100
and when I woke up, I was in front of the company.

632
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
I have to ask for your forgiveness.

633
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,100
Maybe...

634
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,100
I could be a victim to you.

635
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,100
I'm sorry.

636
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,100
I'm sorry.

637
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,100
I'm sorry.

638
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
I'm sorry.

639
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,100
I'm sorry.

640
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,100
I'm sorry.

641
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,100
I'm sorry.

642
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,100
I'm sorry.

643
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,100
I'm sorry.

644
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,100
I'm sorry.

645
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,100
You're the person I'm supposed to help.

646
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
Can I

647
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,100
protect

648
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,100
the artist?

649
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,100
You can't.

650
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,100
What if I help?

651
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:28,100
I'm a serious and quiet person.

652
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,100
Especially when it comes to money, I never say anything.

653
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:42,100
Try to make up your mind.

654
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:48,100
Are you really going to do it right here?

655
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,100
I can't go home for a few days because of business.

656
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,100
Kim Si-young's cell phone is out of place.

657
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,100
What?

658
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Well, I think it's Busan, but I don't use credit cards and my cell phone is off.

659
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,100
I think it'll take some time.

660
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,100
Be sure to lock the door.

661
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,100
What about Na Gong-ji?

662
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,100
You're going to hold a lottery?

663
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:24,100
You don't say a word.

664
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:34,100
You still don't have a friend?

665
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,100
Then I'll go on a business trip.

666
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,100
Then I'll go on a business trip.

667
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:50,100
In the meantime, make sure you eat well and fill it up for 48 hours to get home safely.

668
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:57,100
Hey.

669
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Hey.

670
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:07,100
Do you know why people like you are the most disgusting?

671
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,100
The black beast in the head says don't be a coward.

672
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,100
It's a kind person.

673
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:22,100
It makes a good person look like a fool.

674
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:28,100
Su Wontak, you've grown up a lot.

675
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:42,100
How can you hide that your son is a detective?

676
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:47,100
You were just the right person.

677
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:52,100
What are you taking out of this?

678
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,100
Hey.

679
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:59,100
What did you say?

680
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,100
What are you taking out?

681
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,100
Who?

682
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:08,100
Did you think it came out of nowhere?

683
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,100
Did you decide to die because of blood?

684
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:15,100
Did you just let him go?

685
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,100
That floor?

686
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,100
What?

687
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,100
You're done?

688
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,100
Come here.

689
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,100
Come here.

690
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,100
Do it again.

691
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,100
What?

692
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,100
I really can't do it anymore.

693
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,100
Really?

694
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:35,100
Then I'll send you the money.

695
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,100
How much money have you paid so far?

696
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,100
It's still blood.

697
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,100
How much money do you have left?

698
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,100
Hey, didn't you know?

699
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,100
You can't talk until you die.

700
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:52,100
If you can't talk now, you can die.

701
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,100
Why aren't you listening?

702
00:44:55,100 --> 00:45:05,100
Get in!

703
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:09,100
Kim Dal-ri, a colleague of Kim Nak-chun,

704
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:13,100
the director of the Cheongsong Museum,

705
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,100
was the first Asian to be appointed

706
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,100
as the chief researcher of the Saint Miller Museum.

707
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,100
Kim Dal-ri, who was selected

708
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,100
as a white person in the modern art

709
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,100
that was selected by the Art Forum in 2019,

710
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,100
said that she would play the role of a matemba

711
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:37,100
in introducing Korean art to Europe.

712
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Did you come to see an interview?

713
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,100
What?

714
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,100
An interview?

715
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

716
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,100
I thought you were a student

717
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:19,100
who came to see an intern interview at the museum.

718
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,100
I'm sorry.

719
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,100
I'm sorry.

720
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,100
I'm sorry.

721
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,100
I'm sorry.

722
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:32,100
I'm sorry.

723
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,100
I'll see you.

724
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:39,100
Interview.

725
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,100
How do I see you?

726
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:48,100
Do I need a license?

727
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:52,100
Do you like art?

728
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,100
One day,

729
00:46:54,100 --> 00:47:08,060
a woman who looked like a

730
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:14,060
I can live even if I have one secret hill!

731
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:21,060
The director!

732
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:29,020
The director wants to be that hill?

733
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:34,980
What is it?

734
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:05,980
Ah...

735
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,020
Dad!

736
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,020
Dad!

737
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:39,020
Dad, please save me.

738
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:44,020
I'll just die if I leave you.

739
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:48,020
I'm the only child.

740
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:52,020
I'm the only child.

741
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,020
I'm the only child.

742
00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:07,020
Dad, if you save me, I'll try to make a real fortune.

743
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,020
Hey!

744
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,020
Don't do it.

745
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,020
Hey, you bastard.

746
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:17,020
Hey, let go of me.

747
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,020
I'm going to kill you.

748
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,020
I'm going to kill you.

749
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,020
Dad, please save me.

750
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,020
Dad, please save me.

751
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,020
Please save me.

752
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:27,020
Please save me.

753
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,020
Please save me.

754
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,020
Please save me.

755
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,020
Please save me.

756
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,020
Oh, my God, what's wrong with you?

757
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,020
Please save me.

758
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,020
Please save me.

759
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,020
Please save me.

760
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:47,020
All right.

761
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:51,020
You're amazing.

762
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:56,020
It's a national committee.

763
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:04,020
Everyone was pretending not to care about money and thinking about the high-ranking class.

764
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,020
Don't use quick service.

765
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,020
Tell the secretary directly to Kim Dal-ri.

766
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:17,020
In Kim Dal-ri's hands.

767
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:20,020
Do you really have to do this?

768
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:25,020
Don't you think of the chairman and the director?

769
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:33,020
The director really put a lot of effort into this.

770
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:39,020
There's money we've been giving you so far, and objectively, it's a great profit for our money.

771
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,020
Yes.

772
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:55,020
I don't know how Kim Dal-ri and I became friends, but you're saying you're going to give up that money because of Kim Dal-ri?

773
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,020
I mean it.

774
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:07,020
You like money, don't you?

775
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,020
Do you think I'm doing this because of Kim Dal-ri?

776
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,020
Or what?

777
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:15,020
You know I smell like money a lot, right?

778
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:20,020
But here, I smell rotten, not money.

779
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,020
That's very strong, too.

780
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:30,020
This is for my father, brother, and to protect our money.

781
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:40,020
Here.

782
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:56,020
I came because I told you to, but I'm against it even at this moment.

783
00:51:56,020 --> 00:52:06,020
You know what kind of danger our director is taking and handing over this data, right?

784
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:17,020
Even if others are ignorant, ask for money, and point fingers, I respect our director.

785
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:23,020
Our director is different from the old people who were hit by money by chance.

786
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:33,020
He's a man who came all the way here with his own strength, his own steps, and his own efforts.

787
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:39,020
If you use and throw away such a person, you're a really bad person.

788
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:42,020
You'll be punished for the first time.

789
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:50,020
If the sky forgets, I'll fly the moon even if I do that.

790
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,020
Keep that in mind.

791
00:52:51,020 --> 00:53:03,020
I'll keep an eye on you.

792
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:11,020
I'm asking for an investigation into the violation of the second-hand collision prevention law by An Sang-tae, a member of the National Land and Land Management.

793
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:15,020
I'll be the one to talk.

794
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:20,020
You have to catch all the people who play with the land.

795
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,020
You have to chase them.

796
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,020
What kind of land is this?

797
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:28,020
This is the land that our ancestors risked their lives to protect.

798
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:32,020
You call them pigs with that land?

799
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:40,020
You have to catch them all and use them.

800
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,020
What?

801
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:45,020
What kind of person is that?

802
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:53,020
An Sang-tae, who has been active as a member of the National Land and Land Management for seven years, is a representative developer who claims to have removed the green belt in the first-class green belt in Seoul City.

803
00:53:53,020 --> 00:54:05,020
An Yi-won claims that the green belt removal of the South Seogu City is an inevitable demand of the times for the creation of a residential and work place, but in fact, it is just a ridiculous name to relieve his assets.

804
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:16,020
In fact, An Sang-tae's family owns a considerable amount of land in this area, and the land is exactly the same as the time when Ahn Yi-won was active as a member of the National Land and Land Management.

805
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:27,020
There's no one to call now.

806
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:37,020
Then who should I eat tteokbokki with?

807
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:47,020
I'll go with you.

808
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,020
Is the calendar in front of you?

809
00:54:52,020 --> 00:55:02,020
Yes.

810
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:17,020
Wow.

811
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,020
What do you think?

812
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,020
It's good.

813
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:32,020
I mean, people don't know this combination well.

814
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:37,020
It's all over now.

815
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:44,020
It's not like before these days, so if the media is so impulsive, they can't push it.

816
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:50,020
First of all, I said I was going to investigate the relevant people, and the art museum is being dismissed as not subject to review.

817
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,020
I can't remove the green belt for a while.

818
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:58,020
No, this won't be the end.

819
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:07,020
As Mr. Jin said, if Ahn Sang-tae is a new member, the other person is a much more scary and great being.

820
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,020
If it's that kind of person, I'll never stop.

821
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:15,020
Maybe I stimulated them more.

822
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:18,020
That's why I'm going to post it.

823
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,020
It's a revenge that I have to handle.

824
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:25,020
I'm not going to burden you with your father and brother.

825
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:30,020
Above all, it's our art museum.

826
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:38,020
Everything else is fine, but I'm a little worried that I have to prepare for a fight without knowing who the other person is.

827
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:49,020
Maybe someone unexpected might be the closest.

828
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:59,020
I'm going to go to the art museum.

829
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:09,020
I'm going to go to the art museum.

830
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:19,020
I'm going to go to the art museum.

831
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:29,020
I'm going to go to the art museum.

832
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:36,020
I'm a little late today because I was talking about how the reporters were following me.

833
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:39,020
I don't have anything to worry about.

834
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:46,020
It's good for people who are not politicians to be posted on the media unless they are their vice directors.

835
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:50,020
Do you think anyone can be the number one on the time search?

836
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:55,020
Leave your vice director's seat to An Sang-tae.

837
00:57:55,020 --> 00:58:00,020
I don't know if I can continue this relationship with the committee.

838
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,020
What?

839
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:09,020
But who the hell did this happen to?

840
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:13,020
Are you saying you're going to do something about it?

841
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:20,020
I'd have done it if I'd lost the museum and handed it over to Kim Si-young.

842
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,020
What's the girl doing?

843
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:31,020
I'm sorry for leaving this important thing and turning my eyes to a man who's going to date.

844
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,020
Why are you here?

845
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:37,020
I'm sorry.

846
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,020
I was too excited for a moment.

847
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:45,020
I'm sorry for everything.

848
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:50,020
If I'm so frustrated, will I do this?

849
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:52,020
What do you think?

850
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:57,020
I think things are getting more complicated after Kim Nak-cheon died.

851
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:02,020
So do you have a solution?

852
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:12,020
I knew this would happen.

853
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:22,020
Oh, my.

854
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:28,020
When is our Won Tak coming up?

855
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:31,020
I guess it'll take two or three more days.

856
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:37,020
It's a region without a research center.

857
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,020
I'll clean this up.

858
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:43,020
You can do the separation work over there.

859
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:51,020
Then would you like to sleep at my house tonight?

860
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,020
What?

861
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:56,020
No, it's not because I have a different meaning.

862
00:59:56,020 --> 01:00:01,020
Like last time, I'm the owner of the house, so I'm going to be the TV.

863
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,020
You can sleep in my bed.

864
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,020
I just want to be with you.

865
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,020
I'm serious.

866
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:10,020
I'm not doing anything.

867
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,020
I won't touch you, so don't worry.

868
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:17,020
If you're not going to do anything, why are you sleeping at Mr. Jin's house?

869
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,020
What?

870
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:24,020
Why aren't you going to touch me?

871
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,020
What?

872
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:29,020
I guess you're a little conservative.

873
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:32,020
No, I mean...

874
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,020
It's okay.

875
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,020
There's nothing to rush.

876
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:38,020
When you're ready and comfortable, please tell me.

877
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:41,020
I can wait.

878
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:44,020
Who said I wasn't ready?

879
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,020
I'm totally ready.

880
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:51,020
I feel comfortable.

881
01:00:51,020 --> 01:01:01,020
There's nothing to wait for.

882
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:26,020
I'm sorry.

883
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:36,020
I'm sorry.

884
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:46,020
Wait a minute.

885
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:56,020
I'm sorry.

886
01:01:56,020 --> 01:02:06,020
Car key.

887
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:09,020
Why is that woman here?

888
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:19,020
Are you two living together?

889
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:44,020
I'm not in the mood to sleep with Hee-chan's face.

890
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,020
Just sleep like you're dead.

891
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,020
Don't even make a sound.

892
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:51,020
I'm going to live with you.

893
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:55,020
Mr. Jin is a good guy, a nice person, and a gentle person.

894
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:58,020
Who's the one who's on top of Ahn Sang-tae?

895
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,020
I'm not a good person.

896
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:02,020
I'm not a good person.

897
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:04,020
I'm not a good person.

898
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:06,020
I'm not a good person.

899
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,020
Who's the one who's on top of Ahn Sang-tae?

900
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:11,020
Who's the one who's the most important?

901
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,020
Father.

902
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:15,020
Go ahead.

903
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:17,020
What do you mean?

904
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:27,020
Will this be?
