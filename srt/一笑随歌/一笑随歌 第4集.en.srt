[Fated Hearts]

2
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,970
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,150
If we had taken Zhennan Pass,

4
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,039
our next move
would've been to march into the city.

5
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:47,840
The fact that Jinxiu was able to

6
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,640
mobilize all forces

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,400
instantly

8
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,509
proves that the city

9
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,509
was already heavily fortified.

10
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,509
If we had entered,

11
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,120
they only needed to close the gates,

12
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,000
and our entire army

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,800
would've been
slaughtered with no burial ground.

14
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,680
According to

15
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,410
your theory,

16
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,560
Fu Yixiao's arrow

17
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,310
wasn't a disaster at all,

18
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,350
but actually saved us?

19
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,660
Otherwise, as someone
who has rendered meritorious service,

20
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,630
why would her own people

21
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,710
want to kill her?

22
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,760
The fact that Jinxiu knew

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,900
our retreat route

24
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,840
can only mean

25
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,870
someone in Susha
is collaborating with the enemy.

26
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,800
Someone has leaked

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,060
our military secrets.

28
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,310
The person who wanted to kill Fu Yixiao

29
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,070
is most likely

30
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,960
the traitor
who's collaborating with the enemy.

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,280
That's not necessarily true,

32
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,610
but it's a possibility.

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,800
The motive for killing Fu Yixiao

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,520
may well be that

35
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,750
she had uncovered some secret.

36
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,630
So Fu Yixiao

37
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,590
had uncovered some secret,

38
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,960
and someone wanted to silence her?

39
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,750
Anyway, this matter

40
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,690
concerns us.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,630
As long as we find out

42
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,630
who wants to kill Fu Yixiao,

43
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,860
we can follow the clues

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,730
to uncover the traitor in Susha.

45
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,390
Oh, come on!

46
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,470
Do we even need to investigate?

47
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,000
It's most likely

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,470
that old scoundrel Prime Minister Zhuang.

49
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,430
Do you have any evidence?

50
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,030
I... I'm not afraid of him...

51
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,050
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

52
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,079
I got so into thinking of
this place as a military camp

53
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,150
that I forgot about you
while we were talking.

54
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,840
Your Highness.

55
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,460
What should we do next?

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,860
The people who have been following us

57
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,150
must have reached Yujing by now.

58
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,040
We were being followed?

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,820
How did I not know that?

60
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,630
Your Highness, are you referring to

61
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,560
those injured soldiers from Jinxiu

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,280
whom we saw

63
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,970
when we left Zhengnian Villa?

64
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,000
Treat guests with hospitality.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,260
Take good care of them.

66
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,420
Your Highness.

67
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,840
Physician Xu, what are your chances

68
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,640
of curing her?

69
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,840
The lady's meridians are damaged.

70
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,980
A full recovery

71
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,780
will be extremely difficult.

72
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,030
I have less than

73
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,430
a 30% chance of success.

74
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,960
What if we add this?

75
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,060
Your Highness.

76
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,430
This is really good for external injuries

77
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,800
and might do wonders

78
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,260
for your arrow wound.

79
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
But for the lady's

80
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,930
damaged meridians,

81
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,470
it won't be of much help.

82
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,560
Besides, this belongs to
the Second Prince...

83
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,680
My brother gave it to me,

84
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,590
so it's mine.

85
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,430
What's mine is hers.

86
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,640
Give her the best medicine we have.

87
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,150
In short,

88
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,000
you must heal my beloved concubine's

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,120
hand injury.

90
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,070
Yes.

91
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,160
My dear.

92
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,370
My dear. Don't be angry.

93
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,730
Though you're called a concubine,

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,860
you are the only woman

95
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,100
in my household.

96
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,300
Why would I be angry?

97
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,430
I'm so happy.

98
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,780
However,

99
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,050
if you give all your medicine to me,

100
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,750
what will you do for yourself?

101
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,270
Your arrow wound

102
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,940
hasn't healed yet, has it?

103
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,650
Let me check it for you.

104
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,790
Then I shall

105
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,920
also take a good look at

106
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,230
your hand injury.

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,950
How's that?

108
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,860
You two, escort Physician Xu out.

109
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,620
-Yes.
-Yes.

110
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,770
Thank you, Physician Xu.

111
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,350
Don't look at me.

112
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,430
I know nothing.

113
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,950
I didn't mishear, did I?

114
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,630
Nah, you heard it right!

115
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,770
He said "beloved concubine".

116
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,510
You have to admit that

117
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,160
unmarried noble ladies

118
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,750
are too quiet and refined.

119
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,710
They certainly can't match
this female general from the enemy state

120
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,440
in terms of vigor and vitality.

121
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,330
His Highness has such tastes.

122
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,160
How do you know so much about

123
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,690
His Highness's preferences?

124
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,700
You don't know?

125
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,570
How would I know?

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,360
Do you remember His Highness asked me

127
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,960
to find someone
to paint Fu Yixiao's portrait?

128
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,000
That portrait was painted by me

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,950
based on His Highness's descriptions.

130
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,800
Think about it.

131
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,390
Who would describe their enemy

132
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,240
in such detail,

133
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,070
vivid

134
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,690
and heroically impressive?

135
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,880
There were signs all along.

136
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,080
We just realized it too late.

137
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,470
But it does

138
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,870
seem to make sense.

139
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,560
What cooperation?

140
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,990
You're clearly humiliating me!

141
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,630
I don't have time for that.

142
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,230
Giving you the title of concubine

143
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,460
is to protect you.

144
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,600
I don't have many women in my mansion.

145
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,510
Your sudden appearance

146
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,240
will surely arouse suspicion.

147
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,930
I don't need your protection.

148
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,480
I sincerely cooperate with you,

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,800
so you'd better play along.

150
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,430
I also sincerely cooperate
with the First Prince,

151
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,310
but I won't play along with you.

152
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,540
Your Highness.

153
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,600
Come in.

154
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,570
As a member of my household,

155
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,600
those clothes simply won't do.

156
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,480
Take good care of my wife.

157
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,560
Yes.

158
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,000
My lady,

159
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,390
let me help you change your clothes.

160
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,930
Get out.

161
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,320
I don't need to change.

162
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,250
My lady.

163
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,310
I am here to serve you by order.

164
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,930
I don't need your service.

165
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,370
If we leave like this,

166
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,640
we'll be punished.

167
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,310
Get out!

168
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,590
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

169
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,630
My lady,

170
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,000
please change your clothes,

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,970
or we'll have to kneel until you do.

172
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,360
My lady,

173
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,230
please change your clothes.

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,560

These are so...

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,910
so precious.

207
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,600
Do we really need

all these expensive herbs?

209
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,320
There are many herbs on this prescription

that you can't buy even with money.

211
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
I was thinking of using

212
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,160
some ordinary herbs.

213
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,630
But I

stop being so hostile toward me.

Shouldn't you cooperate a little?

Thank you for your consideration.

from Jinxiu

How could she
be the concubine of our prince?

how could she be a royal consort?

rack their brains guessing,

why bother asking?

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,600
no one...

325

You're lying...

330
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,240
She doesn't look like a woman from Yujing.

331

In this Yujing City,

332

all the beautiful women.

334

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,840
somewhere along the way?

336
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,390
Enough, Yao.

337
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,630

Didn't you want to end our brotherhood?

348
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,890
Get off my carriage.

349
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,360
What?

350
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,880
Am I not allowed
to ride in your carriage anymore?

351
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,000
Where are you going?

352
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,440
To your mansion.

353
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,849
I must say, you're really something!

354
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,109
Where did you get this?

355
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,550
Marquis Changle is our prince's

356
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,670
childhood friend,

357
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,290
as close as real brothers.

358
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,200
Keep me in mind
when there's something good!

359
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,880
Right?

360
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,920
Excuse me.

361
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,900
Excuse me.

362
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,890
Excuse me.

363
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,069
Excuse me.

364
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:27,589
Excuse me.

365
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,070
I heard they are close.

366
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,590
Excuse me.

367
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,750
We're friends.

368
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,070
The three or four women around me

369
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,700
are not as good as her.

370
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,640
Yixiao.

371
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,350
Master.

372
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,500
-Master.
-Master.

373
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,470
Miss Yixiao.

374
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,160
Master.

375
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,780
Young Master Ling.

376
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,510
What are you doing here?

377
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,160
Master!

378
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,510
I've brought them here.

379
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,550
Master.

380
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,890
I came to Yujing...

381
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,440
to get herbs.

382
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,920
Master.

383
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,680
Master, I'm Fang.

384
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,350
-Master.
-Master, what's wrong?

385
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,160
What's wrong?

386
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,000
Master.

387
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,480
Master, what's wrong?

388
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,390
Who are you?

389
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,240
-Master.
-Master.

390
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,790
I'm Fang.

391
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,890
Oh no,

392
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,310
I completely forgot

393
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:19,960
about her memory loss.

394
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,830
Master.

395
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,200
Master.

396
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,000
Get up.

397
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,310
Get up.

398
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,280
Master.

399
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm Fang.

400
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,550
Who are you all, anyway?

401
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,920
Master.

402
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,400
Master, we've all been good.

403
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,880
Please don't abandon us.

404
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,640
I'll be good.

405
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,370
Master.

406
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,790
Kids.

407
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,640
You must be tired from your journey.

408
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,240
Why don't we all
go to my mansion and talk there?

409
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,290
Let's go.

410
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,310
Master.

411
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,020
What do you think, Young Master Ling?

412
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,490
Master.

413
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,550
Master.

414
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,240
Master!

415
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,830
Okay.

416
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,720
Master.

417
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,400
Let's go.

418
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,030
Master.

419
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,600
-Master.
-Master.

420
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,590
Master.

421
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,860
Well...

422
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,790
My Lady.

423
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,210
Stop crying, okay?

424
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,920
Your master is just injured

425
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,330
and has lost some memories.

426
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,980
She hasn't forgotten you.

427
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,290
It's just that she can't

428
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,490
recall you right now.

429
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,780
Do you understand?

430
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,340
Don't cry.

431
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,530
You say I'm your master.

432
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,890
Do you have any proof?

433
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,160
No.

434
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,950
Then that's just your one-sided story.

435
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:58,790
How come I don't remember

436
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,190
taking on any disciples?

437
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,360
Master.

438
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,590
Master.

439
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,640
Alright, stop crying.

440
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,590
Something's wrong with Master.

441
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,090
These children,

442
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,480
would they lie?

443
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,880
Master.

444
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,420
Master.

445
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,960
When you go out,

446
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,480
we always wait at home

447
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,800
for your return.

448
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
Ask Nine.

449
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,030
You would ask Ning Fei

450
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,690
to send someone to take care of us.

451
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,920
If you don't believe me,

452
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,510
you can ask Ning Fei.

453
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,440
I don't know this

454
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,750
Ning Fei you're talking about,

455
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,440
nor do I understand

456
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,000
what you're saying.

457
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,570
Master,

458
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,960
don't you even remember

459
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,510
Ning Fei anymore?

460
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,820
You kids,

461
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,960
go back to wherever you came from.

462
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,920
Young Master Ling,

463
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,960
please do me a favor

464
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,490
and send them away quickly.

465
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,660
Where do you want to send them?

466
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,480
Is my grand prince's mansion

467
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,880
not big enough for a few kids?

468
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,090
Don't be afraid.

469
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,900
She doesn't want you, but I do.

470
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,510
I'm not

471
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,880
as cold-hearted as her.

472
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,440
I'd never disown my own disciples.

473
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,880
I won't let you
talk about my master like that.

474
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,510
Say that again if you dare.

475
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,400
I won't allow it either.

476
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,720
That fierce look on your faces

477
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,480
is quite similar to your master's.

478
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,030
You're wasting your time

479
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,590
trying to intimidate me here.

480
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,850
You should eat something first instead.

481
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,640
Master.

482
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,000
Master, wait for me.

483
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,440
The food is here.

484
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,350
Let me

485
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,880
introduce each dish to you.

486
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,960
Crab-stuffed orange from Zhenxiu Pavilion.

487
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,790
Crystal quail slices
from Zuixian Restaurant.

488
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,480
Scallop soup and lychee paste

489
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,270
from Sai Jiangnan Restaurant.

490
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,880
Each one is a signature dish

491
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,590
from the major restaurants in Yujing City.

492
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,270
There's also my home-made

493
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,440
roasted whole lamb.

494
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,200
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

495
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,410
Help yourselves.

496
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,250
Don't be shy.

497
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,880
Right, don't be shy.

498
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,000
Make yourself at home.

499
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,510
Eat.

500
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,720
Master.

501
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
I can do it myself.

502
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,130
Hurry up and eat.

503
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,800
Then leave immediately.

504
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,830
Don't just sit there. Let's eat.

505
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,860
Make yourself at home.

506
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,890
All of these are signature dishes.

507
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,570
Young Marquis,

508
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,480
we have plenty of

509
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,940
wine cups in our mansion.

510
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,550
Your shabby wine cups

511
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,300
are not worthy of my fine wine.

512
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,080
Today we hold this feast

513
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,770
to celebrate Suige's return,

514
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,640
and also to wish Suige and Sister-in-law

515
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,200
a long and happy...

516
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,680
One more word of your nonsense,

517
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,280
and I'll cut out your tongue.

518
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,540
What does she mean?

519
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,240
She's not my sister-in-law?

520
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,510
Miss Yixiao is such a beauty.

521
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,380
How could she
possibly be interested in you?

522
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Come on, Miss Yixiao.

523
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,010
Let me raise my glass to you.

524
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,680
Miss Yixiao doesn't care for wine?

525
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,510
With such spirit,

526
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,040
you're truly captivating.

527
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,700
Since you're not his wife,

528
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,920
Miss Yixiao, why don't you

529
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,720
stay at my mansion with the kids?

530
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,450
I'm a very open-minded person.

531
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,550
I don't care where my friends are from.

532
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,640
If you agree,

533
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,400
my household will have

534
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,240
another dear sister.

535
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,400
It's lively with more people,

536
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
unlike his place,

537
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,310
which is so quiet

538
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,570
and full of smelly men.

539
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,650
I actually like it.

540
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,610
It's peaceful.

541
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,790
What about you, miss?

542
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,840
Do you know who she is?

543
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,400
She is from Zhengnian Villa,

544
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,880
Lord Ling's daughter.

545
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,350
My apologies.

546
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,920
I've been terribly rude.

547
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,650
So you're the renowned young physician.

548
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,920
Please forgive my ignorance.

549
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,780
You flatter me.

550
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,160
I left in such a hurry last time

551
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,880
and didn't properly thank you.

552
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,720
I owe it

553
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,160
to your Zhengnian Villa

554
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,460
that my injuries have healed so quickly.

555
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,590
I'll drink first to show my respect.

556
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,210
I'm full.

557
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,570
I'll take my leave.

558
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,810
-Master.
-Master.

559
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,060
Your Highness,

560
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,550
I must also excuse myself.

561
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,440
I need to check

562
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,510
Miss Yixiao's hand injury.

563
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,000
Very well, thank you.

564
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,750
My lamb isn't even fully roasted yet,

565
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,280
and you just let them leave?

566
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,720
She's so unromantic

567
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,760
and unyielding.

568
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,620
All my efforts have been wasted.

569
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,830
I'll eat it.

570
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,640
Don't you remember

571
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,720
those kids?

572
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,400
When they came to Zhengnian Villa

573
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,330
looking for you,

574
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,920
I could tell their concern for you

575
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,050
wasn't pretending.

576
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,270
Are you suspecting that

577
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,270
someone deliberately arranged for them

578
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,330
to get close to you?

579
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,000
Aren't you overthinking this?

580
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,400
Why are you here?

581
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,480
I felt sorry for the kids

582
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,720
walking all the way to find you,

583
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,270
so I wanted to give them a ride.

584
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,420
I planned to take them back to the villa

585
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,310
and settle them in

586
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:45,830
once they couldn't find you

587
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,030
and gave up hope.

588
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,400
I never imagined I'd encounter you

589
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,260
in Yujing City.

590
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
It all happened

591
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,170
so suddenly.

592
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,830
Is that all?

593
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,160
What?

594
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,920
You don't believe me?

595
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,900
Fu Yixiao,

596
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,790
you don't actually think

597
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,400
that Feng Suige and I

598
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,840
are working together, do you?

599
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,960
I went to all the trouble
of asking Mr. Qin

600
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,160
to find your whereabouts,

601
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,270
yet you actually suspect I'd harm you?

602
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,000
Anyway, those kids

603
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,270
have been delivered to you.

604
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,600
Whether you accept them is your business.

605
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,720
Why are you so afraid of Feng Suige?

606
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,640
That's none of your concern.

607
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,550
During the meal just now,

608
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,080
when he offered you a toast,

609
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,190
I could see the fear in your eyes.

610
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,110
The rule that fighting is forbidden

611
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,030
at Zhengnian Villa,

612
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,430
you know about it, right?

613
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,840
Yes, I do.

614
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:29,640
Since this rule

615
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,350
was established by the two royal families,

616
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,880
no one has ever violated it.

617
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,180
He alone is the exception.

618
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,880
I've never seen anyone

619
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,340
kill so many people.

620
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,510
The entire room was soaked in blood.

621
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,850
It took me

622
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,200
a full ten days to clean that floor

623
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,460
until it was spotless.

624
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,170
He's not human;

625
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,070
he's a demon.

626
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,330
I don't care what you think.

627
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,050
I advise you to stay away from Feng Suige.

628
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,390
I believe you.

629
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,230
Fear cannot be faked.

630
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,350
You're clearly terrified inside,

631
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,210
yet you're still willing to stay.

632
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:18,960
That's enough to prove

633
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,160
you're a good person.

634
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,960
Yixiao.

635
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,790
Miss Yixiao is actually a female general
from the enemy state?

636
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,790
Then you've got to be careful

637
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,790
staying by her side.

638
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,240
Don't end up worse off than before,

639
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,400
getting yourself hurt again.

640
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,800
That's impossible.

641
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,210
Then what are you after?

642
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,790
She couldn't have secretly

643
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,750
surrendered to you, could she?

644
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,240
Tell me,

645
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,910
how did you win her heart?

646
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,900
Stop prying.

647
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,850
I'm just curious.

648
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,400
Forget it if you won't tell me.

649
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,720
I actually came today for another matter.

650
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,050
I'm here to say goodbye.

651
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,240
His Majesty has sent my father
to guard the North Pass,

652
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,640
and I must accompany him.

653
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,070
But as you know,

654
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,880
I have no interest in court affairs,

655
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,750
and I know nothing about
leading troops into battle.

656
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,830
But I have no choice.

657
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,230
I'm my father's only son.

658
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,230
When will you return?

659
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,590
What?

660
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,120
Don't tell me

661
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,310
you'll miss me?

662
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,790
Get lost quickly!

663
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,790
With you in Yujing City,

664
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,310
I'm annoyed to death all day long.

665
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,480
Annoyed?

666
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,830
Aren't you happy with me here?
Why are you annoyed?

667
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,490
All right, take this with you.

668
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,080
You might need it out there.

669
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,680
That day,

670
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,750
when you went off to war,

671
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,920
I was afraid you'd die out there.

672
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,000
I specifically stole this

673
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,050
from my father.

674
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,840
For that,

675
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,190
I got a severe beating

676
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,310
and was confined for three months.

677
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,200
Three months!

678
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,160
Is that all?

679
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,140
I never used it anyway.

680
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,510
Why don't you take it back

681
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,400
and return it to your father?

682
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,330
Can you really return clothes

683
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,510
after they've been given away?

684
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,240
I don't care.

685
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,240
You, Feng Suige,

686
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,440
owe me a big favor.

687
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,080
How do you want me to repay it?

688
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,930
I'll have to think about that,

689
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,920
but whatever I ask for,

690
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
you can't refuse.

691
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,070
Don't worry.

692
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,720
I won't set my sights on

693
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,960
Miss Yixiao.

694
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,400
I'm a man who values

695
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,260
brotherhood,

696
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,300
and would never

697
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,970
steal someone else's love.

698
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm leaving.

699
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,400
You really don't want it?

700
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,310
No, I don't.

701
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,400
Lu Ke,

702
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,760
have they shown themselves?

703
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,980
They were about to make a move

704
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,960
on Fu Yixiao at that moment.

705
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,880
Young Marquis

706
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,040
came at just the right time.

707
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,000
Once he showed up with his entourage,

708
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,160
everyone scattered.

709
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,110
But I had Gu Yu and Yun Fang

710
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:16,880
follow them.

711
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,400
Good.

712
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,000
My Lady talks about you every day.

713
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,720
She came all the way here to see you.

714
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,450
Why are you making her unhappy?

715
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,310
My Lady,

716
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,070
why are you siding with an outsider?

717
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,530
Yixiao isn't an outsider.

718
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,630
She's an ungrateful wretch.

719
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,110
I told her to go get
the medicine box just now

720
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,240
and didn't call her for dinner.

721
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,840
She's mad about it right now.

722
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,270
With the smell of roasted lamb
filling the yard,

723
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,070
someone's stomach must be

724
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,600
growling from hunger, huh?

725
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,440
Not at all!

726
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,160
I'm not hungry at all.

727
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Does it hurt here?

728
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,420
It hurts if I use force,

729
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,720
but otherwise I don't feel much.

730
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,160
From what I can see of your recovery,

731
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,550
you should be fine day to day,

732
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,590
but with this hand injury,
you can't engage in combat.

733
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,310
If you want to regain your former skills

734
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,540
as a top archer,

735
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,440
I'm afraid it'll take some time.

736
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,650
I'm not really sure

737
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,500
if I can fully heal

738
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,500
your hand injury.

739
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,420
But I promise

740
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,830
I'll do my best.

741
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,160
Thank you.

742
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,220
I had them save a lamb leg for you.

743
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,640
Really?

744
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,540
But it's so late now.

745
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,280
Are you sure you still
want to eat roasted lamb?

746
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,690
I'll go eat then.

747
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,480
There are only four.

748
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,960
We've only identified four so far.

749
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,790
They left the city when it got dark

750
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,250
and didn't stay in Yujing.

751
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,900
They're cautious indeed.

752
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:43,920
Your Highness,

753
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,480
they're definitely not ordinary spies.

754
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,550
As per your instructions,

755
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,510
Gu Yu and I followed them out of the city,

756
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,350
but didn't pursue further,

757
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,440
afraid of alerting them.

758
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,330
Who

759
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,510
do you think

760
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,440
they could be?

761
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,340
Judging by their methods,

762
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,400
they must be Jinxiu secret guards.

763
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,660
Jinxiu secret guards?

764
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,510
They serve under

765
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,000
Prince of Zhennan, Xia Jingshi.

766
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,350
The one seeking to kill Fu Yixiao

767
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,050
is him?

768
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,830
But if he

769
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,550
wanted to kill

770
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,810
a military commander,

771
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,360
would he go to such lengths?

772
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,910
This gets more interesting.

773
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,060
Your Highness,

774
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:11,730
what are

775
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,920
our next steps?

776
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,960
The more anxious they are

777
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,220
to get rid of Fu Yixiao,

778
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,160
the more it shows that Fu Yixiao

779
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,110
holds a secret

780
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,590
that terrifies them.

781
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,510
We'll stay put on the surface,

782
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,310
but deploy our forces secretly.

783
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,350
They might only get one chance,

784
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,640
and we too

785
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,160
have only one.

786
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,030
We must wipe them out completely.

787
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,110
As Master taught,

788
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,240
of ten parts of skill,

789
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,350
seven come from stance training.

790
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,150
We need to firm up our lower body.

791
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,330
Not bad,

792
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,810
you're practicing quite well.

793
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,130
But just learning horse stance

794
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,490
won't be enough to protect your master.

795
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,160
That's none of your business.

796
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,240
Being cautious around strangers

797
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,060
is also good.

798
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,180
But I'm your master's friend.

799
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,550
I only want

800
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,960
to help you

801
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,690
because you're her disciples.

802
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,440
If you don't appreciate it, so be it.

803
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,740
You!

804
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,530
How do you want to help us?

805
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,910
Follow me if you want to know.

806
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,600
Don't go.

807
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,640
I'll go see

808
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,440
what he can do.

809
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,500
I'll be right back.

810
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,790
Fang!

811
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
-Fang!
-Brother.

812
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,200
It is necessary to have effective tools

813
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
to do good work.

814
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,550
If you want to master a skill,

815
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,840
you must first choose a suitable weapon.

816
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,440
Just like my master,

817
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,550
she has an incredibly powerful

818
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,680
Moon-Shooting Bow.

819
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,920
You know quite a bit.

820
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:28,960
Of course.

821
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,790
I've been with my master
since I was little.

822
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,240
I know everything about her.

823
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,790
Really?

824
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,510
I don't believe that.

825
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,270
Why would I lie to you?

826
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,550
Shunzi, Nine

827
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,840
and I are all orphans.

828
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,690
Our fathers and uncles

829
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,590
were the generals of our master.

830
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,870
In the battle at Yazipo,

831
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,000
they all sacrificed their lives.

832
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,510
Later,

833
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,980
our master adopted us.

834
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,680
She taught us martial arts
and swordsmanship,

835
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,390
saying it was for self-protection.

836
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,400
We want to join

837
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,000
the Zhennan Army when we grow up,

838
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,400
but she doesn't approve,

839
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,830
saying that the battlefield is dangerous.

840
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,400
But she herself...

841
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,720
So Yixiao adopted

842
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,780
the children of her fallen comrades.

843
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,280
You're trying to
get information out of me?

844
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,920
Yes.

845
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,550
I am indeed curious about

846
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,090
the connection
between you and your master.

847
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,860
Come on.

848
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,170
This is for you.

849
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,030
Are you really giving this to me?

850
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,820
Of course.

851
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,480
From today onwards,

852
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,510
I am your friend.

853
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,860
Your Highness,

854
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,070
the marriage proposal letter
from Jinxiu has arrived.

855
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,480
His Majesty summons you to the palace.

856
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,540
Marriage proposal?

857
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,739
Who's marrying whom?

858
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,750
[Wutong Mansion]

859
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,490
Your Highness.

860
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,340
-Stop following me.
-Your Highness!

861
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,930
Your Highness!

862
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,400
Oh no!

863
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,340
This is trouble.

864
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,690
We need to stop him.

865
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,070
We can't let him enter the palace

866
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:14,880
like this to see the Emperor.

867
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,760
Who can stop him?

868
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,320
Looking at him like this,

869
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,360
I'd even believe he'd
burn down the imperial palace!

870
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,030
Gu Yu.

871
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,780
Keep an eye on Fu Yixiao at the mansion.

872
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,540
[Wutong Mansion]

873
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,270
What are you doing?

874
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,400
Assemble the Feng Battalion.

875
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,150
Nonsense!

876
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,360
Do you want everyone to think

877
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,190
His Highness is staging a rebellion?

878
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,050
Are you insane?

879
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,110
His Highness said

880
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,020
no.

881
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,980
Gu Yu.

882
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,590
Gu Yu is right this time.

883
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,320
Let's talk inside.

884
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,960
Don't stop me.

885
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,670
Don't stop me!

886
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,000
Give me back my dagger.

887
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You're a traitor!

888
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,110
You took his stuff,

889
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,230
and you're still holding onto it!

890
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,920
-Let go!
-You're wrongly accusing me.

891
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,400
-He gave it to me.
-Give it to me.

892
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,000
I didn't say anything to him.

893
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,670
You're wrongly accusing me.

894
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,440
Return my dagger!

895
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,280
Give it to me!

896
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,480
This the dagger he gave me.

897
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,080
-Master.
-Are you alright? Get up.

898
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,170
Master.

899
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,400
Feng Suige gave this dagger

900
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,150
to me.

901
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,640
She took it away.

902
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,400
Master,

903
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,420
he's a traitor.

904
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,680
He just insists on having this dagger!

905
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,760
Qin!

906
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,430
Qin, are you alright?

907
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,730
Hang in there.

908
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,000
Hang in there!

909
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,690
General.

910
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,940
My...

911
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,030
My family

912
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,130
has no other members left.

913
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,470
I have only one son,

914
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,400
who is at home in Pingling City.

915
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,030
His name is...

916
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,710
-Fang.
-He's a traitor.

917
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,760
I'm not a traitor.

918
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,440
He gave me this dagger.

919
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:47,780
-There's a birthmark on his arm.
-It's mine.

920
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,070
Master, I was wrong.

921
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,200
Look straight ahead.

922
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,770
Stand properly.

923
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,820
Throw a punch!

924
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,510
One.

925
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,230
Two.

926
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,480
Yixiao.

927
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,280
Yixiao.

928
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,880
Brother Ning Fei.

929
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,710
Brother Weiran.

930
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,300
Master!

931
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,670
-Master!
-Master!

932
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,930
-Master, don't scare me!
-Master!

933
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,720
Your Majesty.

934
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,070
Now that the war between
our two nations has just ended,

935
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,480
there is deep hatred
between soldiers on both sides.

936
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,960
Without a significant event

937
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,160
to pacify the people,

938
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,550
if conflicts arise again at the border,

939
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,680
I fear both sides will suffer greatly.

940
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,280
Moreover, the marriage alliance

941
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,630
was proposed by Jinxiu,

942
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,360
which clearly shows

943
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,150
their eagerness for peace.

944
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,050
If Jinxiu is so eager for peace,

945
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,070
why don't they send their princess

946
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,400
to marry into our Susha?

947
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,930
Susha has only one princess, Xiyang,

948
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,330
who is His Majesty's precious daughter.

949
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,390
In my opinion,

950
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,210
we must never send
our princess to beg for peace.

951
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,370
How is this begging for peace?

952
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,550
Jinxiu clearly proposed
the marriage alliance,

953
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,670
and they took the initiative
to propose it.

954
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,330
The First Prince
requests an audience outside.

955
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,990
Your Majesty.

956
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,430
The First Prince requests an audience.

957
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,710
Summon the First Prince.

958
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,870
Your Majesty, this son pays his respects.

959
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,280
Rise.

960
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

961
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,070
The Emperor of Jinxiu has sent envoys

962
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,280
with a formal proposal
for a marriage alliance,

963
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,710
requesting that I marry
your sister Princess Xiyang

964
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,800
to the Prince of Zhennan,

965
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,760
in exchange for lasting peace
between our nations

966
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,050
and time to recover.

967
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,070
What do you think?

968
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,280
Your Majesty.

969
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,590
My wounds have mostly healed,

970
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,030
and the Feng Battalion
is ready for battle,

971
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,830
prepared to fight at any moment.

972
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,720
Your Majesty.

973
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,960
Susha has just endured a fierce battle.

974
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,000
Our troops, provisions, and siege weapons

975
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,600
have been greatly depleted.

976
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,180
If we go to war again now,

977
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,690
it will do nothing but harm
to both the state and the people.

978
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,510
I believe

979
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,120
that gaining an opportunity for Susha

980
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,710
to recover and rebuild

981
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,040
is the best strategy.

982
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,870
Moreover,

983
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,070
if the princess truly brings peace

984
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,150
to the people of both nations,

985
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,610
it will indeed be
a blessing for all mankind.

986
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,230
Your Majesty, please think carefully.

987
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,360
How dare you!

988
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,770
What are you doing in court?

989
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,880
Susha has never had

990
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,670
a precedent of sending
a princess for a marriage alliance.

991
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,150
Peace has never been achieved

992
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,840
through humiliation.

993
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,280
Only by fighting for

994
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,000
every inch of our territory

995
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,630
can we speak of true peace.

996
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,240
Jinxiu's proposal for marriage

997
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,660
appears to seek peace,

998
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,170
but is actually an insult.

999
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,590
Not all the men of Susha are dead yet.

1000
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,960
I will never use a woman

1001
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,590
to exchange for your so-called

1002
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,880
recovery.

1003
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,150
Enough!

1004
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,230
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

1005
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,960
Your desire to
defeat enemies and achieve merit

1006
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,960
is commendable.

1007
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,150
But in Susha, no one

1008
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:33,840
has ever dared

1009
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,670
to shout in the imperial presence!

1010
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,550
The civil and military officials
behind you,

1011
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,610
are they not all loyal to the country?

1012
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,740
Even if there are disagreements,

1013
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,000
it's not your place to call for war.

1014
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,690
All of you, rise.

1015
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1016
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,510
Your Majesty.

1017
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,710
I think

1018
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,800
the First Prince is right.

1019
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,130
Prime Minister Zhuang.

1020
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,150
Share your thoughts.

1021
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,550
A marriage alliance only
brings temporary peace.

1022
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,630
It can never resolve the
deep-seated enmity between our nations.

1023
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,030
This marriage proposal comes from Jinxiu.

1024
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,440
If we reject it,

1025
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,280
they will have reason
to wage war against us.

1026
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,960
The First Prince
is brave and skilled in battle,

1027
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,030
so naturally he does not fear the enemy.

1028
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,590
But years of continuous warfare

1029
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,360
have brought
unbearable suffering to our people.

1030
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,670
If we collect more provisions for war now,

1031
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,230
I fear countless citizens

1032
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,960
would have to give up

1033
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,860
even their winter food supplies.

1034
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,400
I do have an idea.

1035
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,670
We can return the four cities

1036
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:37,710
west of Zhennan Pass to Jinxiu.

1037
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,910
If Jinxiu reclaims these four cities,

1038
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,510
peace between our nations
can be assured for at least three years.

1039
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,760
What did you say?

1040
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,400
Your Highness.

1041
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,400
I am well aware that you shed blood

1042
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,660
and fought hard to conquer these cities.

1043
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,590
But this is our only option.

1044
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,880
For our people,

1045
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,590
and for the greater good,

1046
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,450
Susha cannot endure another war.

1047
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,250
For the princess's sake,

1048
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,170
we cannot agree to
the marriage alliance either.

1049
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,590
Enough.

1050
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:11,960
Let me

1051
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,920
think about it.

1052
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,150
Men fight for their country,

1053
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:16,760
and women

1054
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,330
can also share in
the burden for their nation.

1055
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,410
Inform the princess of this matter

1056
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,070
and hear her opinion.

1057
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,760
Your Majesty.

1058
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,280
The court is adjourned.

1059
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,590
We respectfully send Your Majesty off.
