00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,850
[Fated Hearts]

2
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,990
[Episode 35]

3
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,530
Your Highness,

4
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,710
the Imperial Guards are here.

5
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,770
Quite a few of them.

6
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,230
It must be the Murong family's doing.

7
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,070
Your Highness,

8
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,350
take Miss Yixiao and leave first.

9
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,220
We'll take care of them.

10
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,980
Stay calm.

11
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,360
They came prepared.

12
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,620
We mustn't act rashly.

13
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,050
They outnumber us.

14
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,280
We can't fight them head-on.

15
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,150
Let's retreat for now.

16
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,760
Follow me.

17
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,690
But...

18
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,670
This way.

19
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,380
Search!

20
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,140
Yes!

21
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,560
Let's go.

22
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,240
Anyone there?

23
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
-No.
-No.

24
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,420
General,

25
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,480
no one inside.

26
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,130
General, no one behind the house either.

27
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,620
Come on.

28
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,010
Murong Jie!

29
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,750
Attack!

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,700
Go report to General.

31
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,240
Yes.

32
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,480
This strike...

33
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,000
Is for Gu Yu!

34
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,310
This strike

35
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,780
is for Hound!

36
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,560
This strike...

37
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,240
Is for all our fallen brothers!

38
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,480
Kill!

39
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,360
Lu Ke.

40
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,159
We can't delay any longer.

41
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,890
Retreat now.

42
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,530
Let's go.

43
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,750
Keep chasing them!

44
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,110
Yes!

45
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,960
Let's go!

46
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,010
Yes!

47
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,690
Your Highness,

48
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,300
what should we do next?

49
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,560
Go to the Feng Battalion.

50
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,420
Your Highness,

51
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,650
I told you before

52
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,240
that in the Feng Battalion,

53
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,310
those who refused to submit to Murong Yao

54
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,830
have all been killed by him.

55
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,480
The Feng Battalion

56
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,830
is no longer what it used to be.

57
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,630
It would be dangerous for you to go there
like this.

58
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,159
Our men have fought through life and death

59
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,510
alongside me for so many years.

60
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,270
I don't believe they would betray me.

61
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,920
They only submitted to Murong Yao

62
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,380
by force of circumstance.

63
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,560
Be loyal to the ruler and the kingdom,

64
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,830
and never fail the people.

65
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,790
This is the shared belief of all our men.

66
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,430
This will never change.

67
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,180
The Feng Battalion

68
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,730
will always be the Feng Battalion.

69
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,510
You personally told me back then

70
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,909
that Feng Suige was dead,

71
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,030
and now you're telling me
he's still alive?

72
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,880
I killed him with my own hands,

73
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,250
and his body

74
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,050
was buried by Yao personally.

75
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,040
I cannot figure out

76
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,040
how he survived.

77
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,510
Could it be that
Ling Feng went to save him?

78
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,310
It doesn't matter who saved him!

79
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,560
What matters is that he's still alive

80
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,490
and he's back!

81
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,610
He's back for revenge.

82
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,870
Your Majesty,

83
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,680
please calm down.

84
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,350
How can I possibly calm down?

85
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,920
Back then, you asked me to save your son.

86
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,310
I made him a commandery prince

87
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,510
and even put the Imperial Guards
under his command.

88
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,720
Your Murong family

89
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,250
has gained so much already.

90
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,190
But what have you done in return?

91
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,990
A Feng Suige who has lost everything

92
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,960
is enough to make Your Majesty
panic like this?

93
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,010
If I could kill him once,

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,720
I can do it again.

95
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,480
But you've already made me

96
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,810
trust you wrongly once.

97
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,270
Feng Suige

98
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,890
hasn't even made a move yet,

99
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,480
and Your Majesty is already

100
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,270
trying to settle scores with me?

101
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,870
It hasn't been long
since Feng Pingcheng died,

102
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,920
and you've already forgotten

103
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,850
how I helped you settle matters

104
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,080
and put your son

105
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,480
on the throne?

106
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,040
You're threatening me again.

107
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,170
This isn't a threat.

108
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,560
It's a reminder,

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,270
reminding Your Majesty

110
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,730
not to forget that you said

111
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,890
the Zhuang and Murong families

112
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,800
would forever be bound together,

113
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,070
sharing weal and woe.

114
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,870
Then I must also remind you

115
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,040
that the one

116
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,570
who branded Feng Suige
with the crime of regicide and patricide

117
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,870
was you.

118
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,750
You're truly battle-hardened.

119
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,270
You really know
how to keep your composure.

120
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,820
When Feng Suige returns,

121
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,030
the truth will be revealed.

122
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:49,750
Given the situation,
you're still not worried,

123
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,320
so why should I be?

124
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,670
Very well.

125
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,030
Now that everything's out in the open,

126
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,120
it'll actually be easier for us
to handle things.

127
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,970
You and I

128
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,600
no longer have to pretend

129
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,720
to get along.

130
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
The closeness between our two families

131
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,670
may be a facade,

132
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,840
but the fact that we share weal and woe

133
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
is true.

134
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,920
As long as Feng Suige lives,

135
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,900
neither of us will know peace.

136
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,480
If Feng Suige

137
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,030
wants to turn things around,

138
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,720
he has only two paths to take:

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,660
the first is

140
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:26,840
to return now

141
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,630
and regain control of the Feng Battalion.

142
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,830
Your Majesty need not worry about this.

143
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,270
I can take care of it.

144
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,610
But this second path

145
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,570
concerns His Majesty the Emperor...

146
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,030
Chengyang won't help him.

147
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,270
I'm his mother.

148
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,980
Your Majesty is so confident.

149
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,960
How many lies

150
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,450
did you tell His Majesty?

151
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,550
And how many of those lies did he buy?

152
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,330
Do you know

153
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,390
that His Majesty left the palace
last night

154
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,240
to see Feng Suige?

155
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,120
Did he

156
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,670
tell you about that?

157
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,720
What did you say?

158
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,310
Brother.

159
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,130
What else can I do for you?

160
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,520
Consider it

161
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,300
as me doing something for Father.

162
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,200
If that's the case,

163
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,000
I need you to do something for me.

164
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,520
Go and reclaim the command of

165
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,750
the Imperial Guards from

166
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,810
the Murong family.

167
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,470
All right.

168
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,710
I promise you.

169
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,930
Her Majesty the Empress Dowager
has arrived.

170
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,800
Everyone leave.

171
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,480
Yes.

172
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,030
Mother.

173
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,200
You left the palace last night.

174
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,210
Where did you go?

175
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,440
I was feeling troubled,

176
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,630
so I wanted to go out for a walk.

177
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,980
You still dare to lie to me?

178
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,110
I'm the Emperor!

179
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,070
I go wherever I want!

180
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,810
So now you realize who you are?

181
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,390
Now you know you're the Emperor?

182
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,270
Even if you're the Emperor,

183
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,870
you'll always be my son!

184
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,380
I'm the one who put you on that throne.

185
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,320
Is this imperial arrogance you're showing

186
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,910
meant for me?

187
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,420
Then I might as well

188
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,960
give up this throne.

189
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,020
You wouldn't dare!

190
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,640
Mother, you came to see me today

191
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,630
because you already knew

192
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,480
where I went

193
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,520
and whom I met.

194
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,490
So why bother asking me?

195
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,290
Tell me.

196
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,260
What exactly did Feng Suige tell you?

197
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,360
What sweet lies did he use

198
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,220
to beguile you?

199
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,610
Brother didn't beguile me.

200
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,190
He told me the truth.

201
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,380
You're still calling him "Brother"?

202
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,030
You'd rather believe his nonsense

203
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,260
than believe me?

204
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,110
I am your mother.

205
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,360
I'm the only family you have left

206
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,520
in this world!

207
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,870
That's exactly why I can't let you

208
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,130
keep making mistakes!

209
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,790
Mother,

210
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,480
please wake up.

211
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,270
Don't stay lost in your delusions,

212
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,530
and don't keep making the same mistakes.

213
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,480
Listen to yourself.

214
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,810
What nonsense are you even talking about?

215
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,960
I can still tell

216
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,000
right from wrong.

217
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,840
I have never been

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,060
this clear-headed in my entire life.

219
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,120
Mother,

220
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,600
I beg you.

221
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Please turn back.

222
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,080
You know, Grandfather's last words

223
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,750
were for me

224
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,320
to take good care of you.

225
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
I don't want to see you

226
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,080
keep making the same mistakes.

227
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't want to see you

228
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,670
become what you are now.

229
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,120
Brother is still alive.

230
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,420
We still have a chance to make amends.

231
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,910
Anyone in this world can say I'm wrong—

232
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,840
anyone but you!

233
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,990
Everything I've done

234
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,200
has been for you.

235
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,320
Mother.

236
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,390
I've made my decision.

237
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,150
I'll issue an edict to strip Murong Yao

238
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,000
of his position as
the Imperial Guards' Commander-in-Chief.

239
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,400
Even if you try to stop me,

240
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,200
I'll still do it.

241
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,890
I was wrong indeed.

242
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,010
My mistake was

243
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,880
spoiling you too much.

244
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,770
You're not yet ready to bear
the weight of an emperor.

245
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,520
I was too hasty.

246
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,680
From this moment on,

247
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,390
you'll remain in the palace
to reflect on your mistakes.

248
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,200
You're not to take a single step outside.

249
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
I will handle court affairs in your stead,

250
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,480
and matters of state
will be decided by me.

251
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,410
The rest can wait

252
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,800
until you've truly reflected on
your actions.

[Embrace Simplicity and Uphold Truth]

255
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,730
Father,

256
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,160
where are you going?

257
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,940
Have you found Feng Suige?

258
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,760
Feng Suige is now isolated and weak.

259
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,050
If he wants to compete against us,

260
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,210
[Embrace Simplicity and Uphold Truth]

261
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,240
the Feng Battalion

262
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,870
is the only power

263
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,930
he can rely on.

264
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,710
I've decided

265
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,440
to go to the Feng Battalion
to personally take command.

266
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:38,910
Father,

267
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,590
I'll go with you.

268
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,520
No need.

269
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,270
You lead the Imperial Guards
and stay in the capital.

270
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,030
As long as the capital stays secure

271
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,080
and the Feng Battalion
is under my control,

272
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,100
Feng Suige

273
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,750
will sooner or later

274
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,550
be trapped like a turtle in a jar.

[Embrace Simplicity and Uphold Truth]

276
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,600
Alright,

277
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,950
don't worry too much.

278
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,650
Everything is under my control.

279
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,000
Feng Suige

280
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,750
has no chance of turning the tables.

281
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Alright, Father.

282
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,270
Please be careful.

283
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:14,900
Let's go!

284
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,560
Why did you summon me?

285
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,080
You're the first person to ever see me

286
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,680
draw a bow and shoot an arrow.

287
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,030
What do you think?

288
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,910
How does my heroic stance

289
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,440
compare to your brother's?

290
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,260
You can't even fully draw the bow.

291
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,560
Are you even capable?

292
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,760
I just don't care for weapon practice.

293
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,330
If I were to lead troops,

294
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,290
I'd certainly be an emperor on horseback.

295
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,800
My brother taught me

296
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,860
never to release an empty bow.

297
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,710
It damages both the bow and the shooter.

298
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,510
I know that.

299
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,090
I just forgot for a moment.

300
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,590
Why are you suddenly playing with a bow?

301
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,720
To help you.

302
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,150
Come on.

303
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,760
Grind the ink for me.

304
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,640
I'll draft an edict.

305
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,570
Xia Jingyan,

306
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,860
what exactly do you want to do?

307
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,960
I'll proclaim myself

308
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,760
the Grand Marshal of all forces.

309
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,190
I'll take back all military authority,

310
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,870
including the command over

311
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,150
Xia Jingshi's Zhennan Army.

312
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,120
Then, I'll personally
lead troops to Susha,

313
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,440
deploy forces at the border
between our two kingdoms,

314
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,550
and force the Murong father and sons
to show themselves.

315
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,480
If you do this...

316
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,490
Don't worry.

317
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,440
As long as your brother is sensible,

318
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,840
our kingdoms won't go to war.

319
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,390
Your brother is the Emperor of Susha.

320
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,960
His authority

321
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,670
has been undermined
by the Murong father and sons.

322
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,400
I'm sure he also wants to get rid of
the Murong family.

323
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,130
I'll write him a secret letter.

324
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,680
When the time comes,
I'll join forces with him

325
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,859
to get rid of the Murong father and sons—

326
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,440
kill two birds with one stone,

327
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,650
a win-win.

328
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,819
I'm afraid your thinking's too simple.

329
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,920
Xia Jingshi

330
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,720
would never give up his command,
not even in death.

331
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,640
Then I'm really looking forward to seeing

332
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,040
if he has the guts
to defy my imperial order.

333
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,640
Alright, stop dawdling.

334
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,770
Grind the ink for me.

335
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,960
Who's there? Halt!

336
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,000
His Highness.

337
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,260
It's His Highness!

338
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,450
Your Highness.

339
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,010
You're still alive?

340
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,480
It's me.

341
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,540
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

342
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,830
Let him in! Quick, open the gate!

343
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,030
Open the gate! Hurry!

344
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,280
Feng Suige?

345
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,530
You're not dead?

346
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:10,750
It's General.

347
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,480
General is back.

348
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,400
General is back.

349
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,350
General has returned.

350
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,550
-General.
-General.

351
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,140
-General.
-It's General.

352
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,720
This man is a wanted criminal
of the imperial court.

353
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,570
Generals,

354
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,200
seize him at once!

355
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,310
Are you trying to rebel?

356
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,850
Feng Suige committed
regicide and patricide!

357
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,880
His crimes are unforgivable!

358
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,540
Arrest him at once!

359
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,710
He's right.

360
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,710
Right now,

361
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,200
I'm a fugitive wanted by the court.

362
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,770
But I never committed
regicide or patricide.

363
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,310
I came back today

364
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,170
to clear my name.

365
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,760
Brothers of the Feng Battalion!

366
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,480
I don't want to
make things difficult for you.

367
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,340
If any of you want to win merit
by capturing me today,

368
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,930
don't hesitate and step forward.

369
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,460
Did you all hear that?

370
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,060
He just admitted it himself!

371
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,540
Seize him now!

372
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:24,840
What are you waiting for?

373
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,930
Take him down!

374
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,060
Today,

375
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,180
whoever captures Feng Suige

376
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,360
will be promoted 3 ranks

377
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,960
and rewarded with 100 taels of gold!

378
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,210
If anyone dares to harbor him,

379
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,680
they'll be treated as accomplices!

380
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
The crime of rebellion

381
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,240
will lead to the execution of
your entire clan!

382
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,640
-Think about your family!
-Your Highness!

383
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,000
You...

384
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,510
Cao.

385
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,880
What happened to your leg?

386
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,590
It's nothing.

387
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,140
Those bastards broke it.

388
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,120
I

389
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,230
can't follow Your Highness
to battle anymore,

390
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,760
but I can still cook for you.

391
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,860
Your Highness,

392
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,950
you won't mind having me around, will you?

393
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,210
How could I ever mind?

394
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,810
Where is Hong Shan?

395
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,210
That poor fellow

396
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,570
has gone ahead of us.

397
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,240
He asked me to wait for
Your Highness's return.

398
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,620
It's all my fault.

399
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,020
I came back too late.

400
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,900
Honor heaven above,

401
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,930
respect the earth below!

402
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,880
Be loyal to the ruler and the kingdom,

403
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,510
and never fail the people!

404
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,700
You...

405
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,080
Honor heaven above,

406
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,910
respect the earth below!

407
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,830
Be loyal to the ruler and the kingdom,

408
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,490
and never fail the people!

409
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,270
Honor heaven above,

410
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,010
respect the earth below!

411
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,880
Be loyal to the ruler and the kingdom,

412
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,460
and never fail the people!

413
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,200
All of you,

414
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,610
shut up!

415
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,530
Get up!

416
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,690
Get up right now!

417
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,830
You...

418
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,160
All of you!

419
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,310
The government pays your salaries!

420
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,550
You're not Feng Suige's private army!

421
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,510
Let me tell you,

422
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,430
if you arrest Feng Suige now,

423
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,460
it's not too late!

424
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,400
The Prince of Han

425
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,930
is on his way here right now!

426
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,960
If you dare to delay any longer,

427
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,790
once His Highness arrives,

428
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,510
he'll surely make you

429
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,970
die alongside Feng Suige!

430
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,980
What are you doing?

431
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,310
-Beat him to death!
-Beat him to death!

432
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,310
Beat him to death!

433
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,920
-Beat him!
-Beat him!

434
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,580
Although I, Feng Suige, am a prince,

435
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,240
I've been displaced since childhood.

436
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,920
It wasn't until
I founded the Feng Battalion

437
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,450
that I finally found a home.

438
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,960
You're all my family.

439
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,420
Guys.

440
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,480
Over the years,

441
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,270
we've fought off foreign enemies together,

442
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,350
risking our lives

443
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,880
for Susha,

444
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,160
never showing

445
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,020
the slightest bit of negligence.

446
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,890
Yet now,

447
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,960
I've been accused of

448
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,540
regicide and patricide.

449
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,000
It was me who led you all

450
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,530
down this path of no return.

451
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,590
I'm sorry to have made you suffer!

452
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,190
Not at all!

453
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,830
We don't mind.

454
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,550
We don't mind at all!

455
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,640
Not at all!

456
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,700
If anyone wants to leave now,

457
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,750
I, Feng Suige, will not force them
to stay.

458
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,960
I won't stop you,
nor will I hold any grudge.

459
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,560
Whatever I do from here on out

460
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,760
will have nothing to do with
any of you present!

461
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,240
Is there anyone who wishes to leave?

462
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,070
No one!

463
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,240
Now is not the time to play hero.

464
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,800
It's not too late to quit!

465
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,360
Our fates

466
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,070
rise and fall together!

467
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,810
Live together in joy,

468
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,810
die together in hardship!

469
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,510
Guys.

470
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,030
Today, I also want to

471
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,490
introduce someone to you.

472
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,710
Her name is Fu Yixiao.

473
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,920
She was once Jinxiu's

474
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,980
Red-Clad General.

475
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,280
But now, she has

476
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,000
nothing to do with Jinxiu anymore.

477
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,680
My life

478
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,080
was saved by her.

479
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,420
She not only saved my life.

480
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,500
When I was falling into the abyss,

481
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,410
she pulled me back;

482
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,320
when I was sinking into hell,

483
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,960
she awakened me.

484
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,070
Without Fu Yixiao,

485
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,400
there wouldn't be the Feng Suige

486
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,690
you see today!

487
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,030
Guys.

488
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,570
What I want to say is,

489
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,820
from now on,

490
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,000
I'll stand by Fu Yixiao
through thick and thin,

491
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,930
never abandoning each other.

492
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,380
From this day forward,

493
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,350
she's one of our Feng Battalion.

494
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,790
She

495
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,510
is our family!

496
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,790
Fu Yixiao! Fu Yixiao!

497
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,790
Fu Yixiao! Fu Yixiao!

498
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,000
Fu Yixiao! Fu Yixiao!

499
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,110
Fu Yixiao! Fu Yixiao!

500
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Fu Yixiao! Fu Yixiao!

501
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,510
Fu Yixiao! Fu Yixiao!

502
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,590
Fu Yixiao!

503
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,120
Guys!

504
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,920
Murong Zhong will be here any moment.

505
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,550
Let's get our defenses in place

506
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,070
and prepare to face the enemy!

507
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,830
Yes!

508
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,240
An enemy is an enemy.

509
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,200
Next time, don't put on
that sanctimonious act,

510
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,400
pretending to persuade me to turn back.

511
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,920
You just think killing me

512
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,780
would interfere with your plans.

513
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,360
Xia Jingshi.

514
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,790
No one in this world

515
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,720
understands what you're thinking

516
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,510
right now better than I do.

517
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,160
Xia Jingshi!

518
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,500
I'll kill you!

519
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,120
Your Highness, Her Majesty has arrived.

520
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,800
Your Highness.

521
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,490
Your Highness, what's wrong?

522
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,790
Is the poison acting up again?

523
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,920
Help me deal with Her Majesty
for a bit.

524
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,600
Greetings

525
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,440
to you, Mother.

526
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,450
What's wrong with you?

527
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,750
Your Majesty.

528
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,550
His Highness is suffering from
the effects of the poison.

529
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,590
Didn't I give you

530
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,990
the antidote last month?

531
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,700
Did you not take it on time?

532
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,750
His Highness did take the antidote,

533
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,080
but these past few days,

534
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,510
His Highness has been feeling restless,

535
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,200
utterly exhausted in body and mind.

536
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,880
It's probably because

537
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,960
his body is too weak

538
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,480
that the poison has flared up again.

539
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,570
Prince of Zhennan.

540
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,640
You're not hiding

541
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,170
something from me, are you?

542
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,650
Mother,

543
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,880
I'm not.

544
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,030
I don't want to make you worry, Mother.

545
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,570
It's nothing serious.

546
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,240
Since you've taken the antidote on time,

547
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,700
your life's not in danger.

548
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,410
Get up and speak.

549
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,550
Yes.

550
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,230
If you can't endure this little pain,

551
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,070
how will you command the army

552
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,470
in my stead in the future?

553
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,290
You speak wisely, Mother.

554
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,750
I heard His Majesty took you

555
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,200
to that wretched woman,

556
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,760
and Feng Xiyang almost killed you,

557
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,160
so I came to check on you.

558
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,510
Why didn't you tell me

559
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,350
about such a serious matter?

560
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,950
I didn't want to make you worry, Mother,

561
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,600
so I kept quiet about it.

562
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,350
Your health

563
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,950
is deteriorating day by day.

564
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,600
This Rongyang Palace
is gloomy and confined,

565
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,280
not suitable for long stays.

566
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,310
I think

567
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,650
you should move out of the palace.

568
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,880
Mother, do you mean

569
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,760
you want me to leave the palace?

570
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,090
His Majesty didn't kill you this time,

571
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,070
but there's no guarantee

572
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,730
he won't be serious next time.

573
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,680
Now in this palace,

574
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,880
even I find it difficult to protect you.

575
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,620
You'd better go outside
and hide for a while.

576
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,100
I've arranged a residence in the city.

577
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
Go and stay there.

578
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,390
Don't forget,

579
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,970
you were the one who reminded me

580
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,720
the Qianqiu Festival is approaching.

581
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,130
You should start preparing early.

582
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,270
Thank you for your kindness, Mother.

583
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,160
I understand.

584
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,670
And I know what to do.

585
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,060
Don't disappoint me again this time.

586
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,780
Your Highness!

587
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,000
The antidote.

588
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,120
Give me the antidote.

589
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:19,680
Yes.

590
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,110
I said before

591
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,070
that these antidotes must not be touched

592
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,670
until the grand plan begins.

593
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:36,960
And now,

594
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,150
the grand plan is about to begin.

595
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,640
Feng Suige...

596
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,550
Uncle Murong.

597
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,220
We meet again.

598
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,770
So you really aren't dead.

599
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
With my great vengeance unavenged,

600
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,880
how would I dare to die first?

601
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,510
There's no rush.

602
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,210
I still have things to ask you.

603
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,630
There's nothing left to say.

604
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,000
Kill him!

605
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,980
You once saved my life.

606
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,690
I regarded you as my closest elder.

607
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,650
Why did you kill my father?

608
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,380
Why did you want me dead as well?

609
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,720
If you hadn't,

610
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,820
then Yao would have had to die.

611
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,970
I begged you,

612
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,510
but you turned me down.

613
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,290
You wouldn't help me save Yao.

614
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,170
I carried thorny branches on my back,

615
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,460
kowtowing with every step into the palace,

616
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,480
to beg your father

617
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,860
to spare his life.

618
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,070
But he still wouldn't let Yao go.

619
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,710
I couldn't just watch

620
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,230
my son die.

621
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,820
Yao and I

622
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,000
had no way out.

623
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,400
This was all

624
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,360
forced upon us by you and your father.

625
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,580
If it hadn't been for Murong Yao's

626
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,800
treason and collusion with the enemy,

627
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,230
so many Susha soldiers

628
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,400
wouldn't have died unjustly

629
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,860
in the Battle of Pingling!

630
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,360
He betrayed me.

631
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,100
I could spare his life,

632
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,110
but how am I supposed to answer to

633
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,170
all our brothers who died?

634
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,340
Talking about

635
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,070
brotherhood in front of me?

636
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,490
In this life,

637
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,050
how many battles

638
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,420
have Yao and I

639
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,760
fought for

640
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,910
you and your father's kingdom?

641
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,300
I was even like a brother to His Majesty.

642
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,360
It's fair to say I've spent my entire life

643
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,960
laying down my life for him!

644
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,580
Look at me!

645
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,920
I've done far more for Susha

646
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,320
than you ever have.

647
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,040
All that talk of patriotism

648
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,070
is nothing

649
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,550
but a joke to me now!

650
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,280
In my life,

651
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,330
I've never sought fame

652
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,850
or power.

653
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,000
All I wanted

654
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,290
was to live peacefully

655
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,710
with my children and grandchildren.

656
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,550
Is that too much to ask?

657
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,150
Is that a crime?

658
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,960
Your father

659
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,760
deserved to die,

660
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,920
and so do you.

661
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,590
I must save Yao.

662
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,290
I must save Yao!

663
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,760
I must save Yao.

664
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,150
Suige,

665
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,910
please spare Yao.

666
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:46,850
Killing you

667
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,660
was my idea.

668
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,330
He was forced into it.

669
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,230
You may pulverize my bones

670
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,880
and scatter my ashes.

671
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,720
I only beg you

672
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,840
to spare Yao...

673
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,290
Uncle Murong.

674
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,720
His Majesty never intended

675
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,330
to harm you and Yao.

676
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,170
That day,

677
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,030
it was Empress Zhuang

678
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,960
who killed His Majesty.

679
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,400
The Murong family has brought chaos
to our kingdom

680
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,730
and committed treason.

681
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,800
Their crimes are grave,

682
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,660
intolerable to heaven and earth.

683
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,800
All soldiers, heed my command!

684
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,590
Yes!

685
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,850
March with me into Yujing City

686
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,990
to avenge His Majesty!

687
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,150
Yes!

688
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,720
My mistake

689
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,700
was spoiling you too much.

690
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,900
You're not yet ready to bear
the weight of an emperor.

691
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,210
I was too hasty.

692
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,650
From this moment on,

693
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,760
you'll remain in the palace
to reflect on your mistakes.

694
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,020
You're not to take a single step outside.

695
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,470
Spare my mother.

696
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,140
I'll take her away from Yujing

697
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,880
to live out our remaining days.

698
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,710
Her sins

699
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,880
are also my sins.

700
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,330
I'll pay for them in her place.

701
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,360
Someone!

702
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,400
Summon the Keeper of the Imperial Seal

703
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,920
to bring the Imperial Seal.

704
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,250
I need to draft an edict.

705
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,110
I'm speaking to you.

706
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,170
Can't you hear me?

707
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,130
Are you defying my orders?

708
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,800
Your Majesty.

709
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:18,990
Her Majesty...

710
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,520
The Empress Dowager's words are orders,

711
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,960
and mine aren't?

712
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,070
I am the Emperor.

713
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,760
My words—

714
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,360
every single word I utter
is an imperial edict!

715
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,530
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

716
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,800
I will say this one last time.

717
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,070
Summon the Keeper of the Imperial Seal
to bring the Imperial Seal.

718
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,480
I need to draft an edict!

719
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,930
If these ears of yours cannot hear,

720
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,110
I'll cut them off for you!

721
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,700
Who let the Prince of Zhennan go?

722
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,030
Was it you?

723
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,820
Spare me, Your Majesty!

724
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,570
I know nothing about it!

725
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,080
He glanced at you.

726
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,110
So it must be you.

727
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,360
It wasn't me, Your Majesty.

728
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,480
Spare me, Your Majesty!

729
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,800
It was me who let him go.

730
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
All of you, leave!

731
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,400
Mother, what's that supposed to mean?

732
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,930
I should be asking you.

733
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,670
You intend to reclaim all military power.

734
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,330
What's that supposed to mean?

735
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,150
Mother, you truly have eyes and ears
everywhere.

736
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,400
My edict just reached the Secretariat,

737
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,150
and you're already alarmed.

738
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,590
Do you realize

739
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,850
how much trouble

740
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,670
issuing this imperial edict will cause?

741
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,510
Which of those veteran generals,
so used to wielding their own troops,

742
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,970
will let it slide quietly?

743
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,280
Even if the sky fell on Jinxiu,

744
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,850
it should be me bearing the weight.

745
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,690
I understand now.

746
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,360
In your heart,

747
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,480
the one who holds up

748
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,070
the sky over Jinxiu has never been me,

749
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,600
but Xia Jingshi. Am I right?

750
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,840
He did hold it up.

751
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,550
If it weren't for him,

752
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,550
Susha's army

753
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,070
would have reached here long ago!

754
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,530
Even without Xia Jingshi,
there's still me!

755
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,590
Look at

756
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,920
what you've become now.

757
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,360
How exactly

758
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:25,840
did that wretched Feng Xiyang

759
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,880
bewitch you?

760
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,280
Don't call her wretched!

761
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,230
You think I'm

762
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,630
bewitched by her beauty?

763
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,000
I've seen all kinds of women, okay?

764
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,590
Then why do you protect her so fiercely?

765
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,440
Because she gave me

766
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,000
something I've never had before.

767
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,800
When she was most helpless,

768
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,060
she asked for my help. Do you understand?

769
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,710
Of course you wouldn't understand.

770
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,500
In your eyes,

771
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,280
I'm nothing but someone who

772
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,010
wastes his life in debauchery.

773
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,250
I only ascended to this throne

774
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,710
because I am your son.

775
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,440
Have you ever for one day

776
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,300
cared about me?

777
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,880
Everyone in the world thinks

778
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,720
I'm useless.

779
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,000
After a while,

780
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,530
I started to believe it too.

781
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,660
I once wanted to be a good emperor,

782
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,490
but no one believed in me,

783
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,660
and no one had expectations of me.

784
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,020
Then what's the point of working so hard?

785
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,500
You've always been
the true ruler of Jinxiu.

786
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,570
So I could only give up on myself.

787
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,240
But Feng Xiyang doesn't think like that.

788
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,690
She thinks I have value.

789
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,030
She's never

790
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,070
tried to bewitch me.

791
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:35,480
She's never even

792
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,710
treated me kindly.

793
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,630
But when she was most desperate

794
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,510
and most helpless,

795
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,510
she asked me to help her get revenge.

796
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,330
Do you find me ridiculous

797
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,580
or pitiful?

798
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,980
But I don't think so.

799
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,590
I like this feeling

800
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,760
of being needed.

801
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,590
Because I have never

802
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,720
been needed before.

803
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,550
All of this...

804
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,400
All of this was because of you,

805
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,190
Mother!
