our spies within Jinxiu

185
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,580
will track this person down at all costs.

186

Your Highness, hang in there.

I won't make it to Susha.

189

There is a place...

190
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
that might be able to save my life.

191

192
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,480
Will... she be alright?

193
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,150
What are you saying?

194
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,360
I personally handled it myself.

195
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,490
How can I let her die?

196
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,000
Go find some clean gauze

197
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,790
and wrap her up.

198
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,050
Remember to be gentle.

199
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,270
Okay.

for two years.

220

This battle

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,270
at the Battle of Ping Ling,

231
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,400

by an enemy general’s arrow.

237
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,350
With our commander-in-chief shot,
the army fell into disarray.

238
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,550
That's why we failed.

239
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,920
I disagree.

240

There are no eyes on the battlefield.

Moreover,

242
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,350
Zhennan Pass stands within
treacherous mountains

243
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,750
It's easy to defend but hard to attack.

244
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,960
The First Prince used only

245
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,310
8,000 soldiers and horses

246
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,510
to break through the gate of Zhennan Pass.

247

This is already

His safety concerns the fate of the state.

The most pressing thing now

259

is to send someone

It's okay. She just needs
a few more days of sleep.

347
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,920
At least the wound is recovering well.

348
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,850
We can remove the splint and gauze.

349
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,440
My Lady!

350
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,310
Don't move.

351
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,200
What are you doing?

352
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,830
My Lady just

353
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,760
saved your life!

354
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,160
How ungrateful!

355
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,550
Are you extorting money?

356
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,210
1,000 guan?

357
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,070
Okay?

358
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,070
2,000?

359
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,000
2,000 guan?

360
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,480
T-T-Three...

361
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,470
My Lady, are you alright?

362
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,960
The anaesthetic effect
hasn't worn off yet.

363
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,200
Push too hard, and one will
collapse from exhaustion.

364
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,240
Within 3 counts,

365
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,540
she would fall.

366
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,170
I was so scared.

367
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,570
Don't come over.

368
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,930
Don't touch me.

369
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,480
Who are you?

370
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,920
Have you forgotten?

371
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,680
You saved me in the forest that day.

372
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,830
You were badly injured,

373
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,030
so I brought you back.

374
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,060
What is this place?

375
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,950
This is Zhengnian Villa.

376
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,270
We treat people here.

377
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,070
I'm the Young Mistress here.

378
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,400
My name is Ling Xueying.

379
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,490
We simply met by chance.

380
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,980
Why did you save me?

381
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,090
I'm a physician.

382
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,920
It's my duty to save and cure people.

383
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,480
No, let me tell you.

384
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,480
You were hunted down
in the forest that day.

385
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,210
Before that,

386
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,160
you should have fallen
from a high place, I suppose.

387
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,480
After we got you back,

388
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,030
we found that your head was injured.

389
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,070
Your internal organs were displaced,

390
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,640
and the bones and tendons
in your left hand were shattered.

391
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,350
Luckily, you met Her Ladyship.

392
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,880
She set your bones
and stitched your wounds,

393
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,470
and it took her
3 whole days and nights.

394
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,310
It

395
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,480
took everything out of her

396
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,440
to save your life.

397
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,110
Besides,

398
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,310
if I want to hurt you,

399
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,970
why would I bother to save you?

400
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,640
Exactly.

401
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,750
Miss,

402
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,350
what's your name?

403
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,720
My name?

404
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,480
My Lady.

405
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,730
Has she lost her memory?

406
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,000
Besides not remembering

407
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,830
your name,

408
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,800
do you remember anything else?

409
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:03,920
Oh no.

410
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,720
She must have amnesia.

411
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,510
Amnesia is the most difficult to treat.

412
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,400
Your left shoulder was shot by an arrow.

413
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,930
You can't move your arm now.

414
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,070
Looks like your wound

415
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,680
was from an arrow that pierced you

416
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,270
in 5 steps face-to-face.

417
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,400
In 5 steps?

418
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,830
That's right.

419
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,080
I've seen many arrow wounds.

420
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,960
But I've never seen such a wound

421
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,070
like yours.

422
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,680
Logically, given the close distance

423
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,270
and your defenseless state,

424
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,200
it seems that you were

425
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
shot by an arrow
from someone you know well.

426
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,200
Forget it. Get recovered first.

427
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,640
We'll talk about it later.

428
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
You've moved too vigorously,

429
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,960
and you must have strained your tendons
again.

430
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,880
Let me get her some medicine.

431
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,480
No need.

432
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,680
It's too late to apply the medicine now.

433
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,110
We can only send her

434
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,310
to the medical pool at the back mountain
and take a chance.

435
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,790
The pool

436
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,960
contains various rare herbs
from around the world,

437
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,270
from Saffron beyond the pass

438
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,400
to the Tianshan Snow Lotus
in the frozen lands.

439
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,790
Anyway, it works wonders

440
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,790
for all kinds of external injuries.

441
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,270
This is called
the Primordial Qi Consolidating Powder.

442
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,960
For ordinary wounds,

443
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,960
whether they're festering
or bleeding nonstop,

444
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,550
taking it will work wonders.

445
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,610
After you soak in the pool and take it,

446
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,030
even if your tendons can't be reconnected,

447
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,560
it will at least
ease the pain significantly.

448
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,550
Don't underestimate it.

449
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,750
In order to make it,

450
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,920
Her Ladyship
went all over Susha and Jinxiu

451
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,160
to look for herbs

452
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,960
for the entire 4 years.

453
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,660
If you had meant to harm me,

454
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,410
you wouldn't have saved me.

455
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,310
In that case,

456
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,640
it can't be poison.

457
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:55,790
Here.

458
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,270
How could it be poison?

459
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,320
You are being too cautious.

460
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,110
Who do you take

461
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,790
Her Ladyship for?

462
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,350
Eleven.

463
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,400
She just
went through a life-or-death situation.

464
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,130
It's only right to be cautious.

465
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,510
Thanks.

466
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,510
This is the forbidden place
of Zhengnian Villa.

467
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,030
Those who know about this place
in the world

468
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,310
have a deep connection with the villa

469
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,960
and with my father.

470
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,830
They are our friends.

471
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,030
Miss,

472
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,240
don't worry.

473
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,270
Soaking the wound in the medical pool

474
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,640
will hurt at first.

475
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,920
After a moment,

476
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,460
you'll slowly become dull

477
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,610
and fall into a coma.

478
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,790
You'll feel dizzy

479
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,000
in the process.

480
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,400
All these mean the herbs are working.

481
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,200
Don't worry.

482
00:26:59,270 --> 00:26:59,960
Be careful.

483
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,640
Be careful, Your Highness.

484
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,370
Your Highness.

485
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,720
This is the back mountain
of Zhengnian Villa.

486
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,850
What are we here for?

487
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,480
I heard from Lord Ling

488
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,110
that there is a forbidden place

489
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,510
in the back mountain of Zhengnian Villa.

490
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,110
There is a medical pool inside.

491
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,840
It's a perfect place
to treat external injuries.

492
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,550
Is there really such a mysterious place

493
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,000
in this world?

494
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,400
Gu Yu.

495
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,070
Wait outside.

496
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,880
I'll go in alone.

497
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,880
I'll go with you, Your Highness.

498
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,830
Go find Yun Fang

499
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,000
and reorganize the old troops
as soon as possible.

500
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,790
Yes.

501
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,610

It's very likely that she'll come here.

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,240
You came uninvited.

517
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,400
How dare you call yourselves soldiers?

518
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,260
I think you're more like bandits.

519
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,440
Take it.

520
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,360
I just want to find someone.

521
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,030
A girl in her twenties

522
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,790
in red

523
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,340
who got severely injured.

524
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,490
Have you actually seen her?

525
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,310
Search!

526
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,110
Yes!

527
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,790
What are you doing?

528
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,960
What are you doing?

529
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,310
-Stop!
-Stop!

530
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,000
What are you doing?

531
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,480
We're Miss Yixiao's brothers.

532
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
What Miss Yixiao?

533
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,030
What are you talking about?

534
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,750
Stop pretending.

535
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,720
She must be here!

536
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,920
Did she get hurt?

537
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,180
Did she get hurt badly?

538
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:11,880
Let go!

539
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,270
Let go!

540
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:12,960
Don't lay a hand on her!

541
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,590
I'm her brother!

542
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,830
I'm here to take her home!

543
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,480
Brother?

544
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,000
Yes!

545
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,920
Most people in this world

546
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,880
are betrayers.

547
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,750
They call each other brothers
on the surface,

548
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,110
but hurt each other behind their backs!

549
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,640
What are you talking about?

550
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,790
Whether I saw an injured girl

551
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,720
doesn't matter.

552
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,170
Even if she's here,

553
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,590
I will never

554
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,680
hand her over,

555
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,010
given what you've done!

556
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,510
Who is it?

557
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,400
I'm sorry for offending you so much.

558
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,460
Please forgive me.

559
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,480
Lord Ling and I are old friends.

560
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,340
I need to use this place today.

561
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,480
I will explain it to him
face-to-face later.

562
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,010
You still haven't answered

563
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,270
who you are.

564
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,750
-Officer Ning.
-Go ahead.

565
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,400
Not found.

566
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,790
We've searched the pharmacy,
but we couldn't find her.

567
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,320
We've searched
but couldn't find her either.

568
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,160
Have you searched thoroughly?

569
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,560
We've searched everywhere,
but we really couldn't find her.

570
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,270
Susha and Jinxiu have fought for years.

571
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,110
They've set a rule

572
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,310
that there's no violence in the villa.

573
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,110
Zhengnian Villa

574
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,720
may not be some powerful faction,

575
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,400
but it's a place

576
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,680
where we treat patients
and save their lives.

577
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,790
Do you know how many lives from Jinxiu

578
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,440
we've saved?

579
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,960
Can you even count them yourselves?

580
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,560
You broke into my villa today

581
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,170
and used violence.

582
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,880
I must get an explanation!

583
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,680
Impossible.

584
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,830
Impossible.

585
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,750
How could Yixiao not be here?

586
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,550
Let me search again.

587
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,080
Ning Fei.

588
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,480
Goodbye.

589
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,310
Weiran.

590
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,080
Yixiao's right here!

591
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,200
Yixiao!

592
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,240
Just let me know if you're here!

593
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,720
Yixiao, answer me!

594
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,000
Let go of me! What are you doing?

595
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Yixiao's inside.

596
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,830
Trust me!

597
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,310
Don't pull me!

598
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,550
Yixiao!

599
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,790
Trust me, Weiran.

600
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,400
Wake up.

601
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,160
Don't die here.

602
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,880
Water.

603
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,110
Water.

604
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,440
Water.

605
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,200
Water.

606
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,670
My Lady.

607
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,800
The girl has been in the medical pool
for so long.

608
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,480
I wonder how she is now.

609
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,190
She should be getting better.

610
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,650
We'll know when we see her.

611
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,590
I know him.

612
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,940
He's a subordinate
of the First Prince of Susha.

613
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,590
Even the subordinate
of the First Prince of Susha

614
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,880
is so unreasonable.

615
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,550
Do you think that girl is in danger?

616
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,480
My Lady,

617
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,190
why are you so afraid

618
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,790
of the First Prince of Susha?

619
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,670
Remember,

620
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,670
the rules of Zhengnian Villa

621
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,760
apply to the world,

622
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,030
except him.

623
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,060
You have my portrait with you.

624
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,230
Fu Yixiao.

625
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,940
Turns out my name is Fu Yixiao.

626
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,150
She's been injured.

627
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,920
Who are you?

628
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,360
You don't know who I am?

629
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,350
She really doesn't remember me?

630
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,130
You're afraid of me?

631
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,480
Why?

632
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,440
Am I your enemy?

633
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,680
What are you talking about?

634
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,240
How could I be afraid of you?

635
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,930
I've been looking for you for a long time.

636
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,920
You saved me

637
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,510
when I fainted just now, right?

638
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,760
You haven't answered me.

639
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,890
Who on earth are you?

640
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,360
I'm your friend.

641
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,920
Feng Suige.

642
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,070
Feng Suige.

643
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,920
She remains indifferent

644
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,000
even to the name.

645
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,940
She's really lost her memory.

646
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,060
What's wrong with you?

647
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
Do you know

648
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,920
how I got hurt?

649
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,550
I almost died

650
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,920
just to save you.

651
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,380
Yet you're asking who I am.

652
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,690
Do you really think I'm your enemy?

653
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,280
Why did you get hurt?

654
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,920
What does it have to do with me?

655
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,590
It's a long story.

656
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,800
Can you go

657
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,000
get me a bowl of water first?

658
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,460
Don't change the subject.

659
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,800
Fu Yixiao!

660
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,480
How dare you lie to me!

661
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,030
Gu Yu.

662
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,880
Look who she is.

663
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,840
We've finally found Yixiao.

664
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,110
Don't be nervous.

665
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,070
I said we are not enemies.

666
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,280
Trust me.

667
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,230
Gu Yu.

668
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,070
What are you waiting for?

669
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,550
Deal with the rabbit.

670
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,920
We've finally found Yixiao.

671
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,320
We should celebrate.

672
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,320
As you can see,

673
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,440
all my men are outside.

674
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,400
If we were enemies,

675
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
I would have ordered them

676
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,480
to break in.

677
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,360
Since you said

678
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,480
we are friends,

679
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,150
you must know

680
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,320
who my enemy is

681
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,550
and who wants to kill me.

682
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,520
Actually, since you disappeared,

683
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,360
I've been wondering

684
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,800
who the murderer is.

685
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,760
After all, very few people

686
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,360
have the ability to kill you.

687
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,630
Who are they?

688
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,150
Urgent news from His Highness!

689
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,950
Come to Zhengnian Villa to help!

690
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,630
Gu Yu knows

691
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,070
you don't like the smell of blood.

692
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:35,840
Every time he deals with a rabbit,

693
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,440
he'll clean it several times thoroughly.

694
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,970
Let's get down to business.

695
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,070
Do you remember

696
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,920
the Battle of Pingling

697
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,250
between Susha and Jinxiu half a month ago?

698
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,670
What does it have to do
with who wants to kill me?

699
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,840
Of course, it does.

700
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,010
You're a general of Jinxiu.

701
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,080
You also contributed to the war.

702
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,900
In the Battle of Pingling,

703
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,190
if you hadn't shot an arrow

704
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,510
at the First Prince of Susha,

705
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,240
making him fall from the horse,

706
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,000
Zhennan Pass of Jinxiu

707
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,760
would be occupied

708
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,920
by Susha now.

709
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,760
Is he dead?

710
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,590
Almost.

711
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,000
He narrowly escaped death.

712
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,360
Then he's the one

713
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,240
who wants to kill me.

714
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,550
He came to me for revenge.

715
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,110
Turns out it's him.

716
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,880
I shot him down.

717
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,060
Looks like he's not that good.

718
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,190
Not necessarily.

719
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,490
He actually has another title,

720
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,280
Killer God of Susha.

721
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,610
His reputation is feared
all over the place.

722
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,610
He's the First Prince.
If he wants to kill me,

723
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,420
why would he do it himself?

724
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,090
You don't know him.

725
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,440
He never

726
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,960
lets a grudge go unavenged.

727
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,190
You know him well.

728
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,760
What's his name?

729
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,360
Feng.

730
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,510
Sui.

731
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,960
Ge.

732
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,070
Commander Fu.

733
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,070
If I can't make sure it's foolproof,

734
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:33,880
how would I dare

735
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,800
to lay a hand on you so easily?

736
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,230
Despicable.
