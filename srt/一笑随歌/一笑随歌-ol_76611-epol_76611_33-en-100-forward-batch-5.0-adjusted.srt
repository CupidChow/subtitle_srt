3
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,229
Aren't you always

4
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,490
by His Majesty's side?

5
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,759
How could

6
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,370
Bai Shouzhuo be killed out of the blue?

7
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,280
And he was working for Prince of Zhennan?

8
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,080
Your Majesty,

9
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,229
Eunuch Bai proclaimed his innocence
until death.

10
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,479
It was all the Princess of Susha's
accusation.

11
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,740
The Princess of Susha?

12
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,430
She was involved?

13
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,230
It was the Princess of Susha

14
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,560
who took His Majesty to arrest Eunuch Bai.

15
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,230
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

16
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:10,920
The Princess of Susha

17
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,510
never leaves His Majesty's side.

18
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,430
I dared not tell you.

19
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,090
I am guilty.

20
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,979
Your Majesty, please punish me.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,260
You are indeed guilty.

22
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,240
But I want to give you

23
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,840
a chance to atone.

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,240
Go kill that bitch.

25
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,829
Whatever method you use,

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,500
I just want her dead.

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,870
I've been in Shengjing for so many days,

28
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,910
and the Emperor has kept me locked

29
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,960
in Yeting Palace

30
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,240
and only today allowed me to see you.

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,260
Your Highness,

32
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,340
what happened in Yujing

33
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,810
has spread throughout Yeting Palace.

34
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,910
What are we going to do now?

35
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,850
You still have me.

36
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,470
Trust me.

37
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,150
One day I will take you home.

38
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,440
But we are in enemy territory.

39
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,350
And you're all alone, Your Highness.

40
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,140
Perhaps I'm not alone.

41
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,000
I've inquired about the situation
in Yujing.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,750
It seems no one

43
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,280
has seen my brother's body.

44
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,640
I've been thinking these past days

45
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,280
that he must still be alive.

46
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,590
Did you also feel Elder Zhou

47
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,050
was acting strange today?

48
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,390
His words today

49
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,430
seemed like he was testing us.

50
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,760
If you are determined to leave,

51
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,790
will you fight your way out?

52
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,280
Indeed.

53
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,950
There was murderous intent in his eyes.

54
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,750
I could feel it.

55
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,750
He seemed to really want

56
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,120
me to fight my way out.

57
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,800
Ning Fei,

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,360
you've been here the longest

59
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,760
and know this place best.

60
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,000
Tell us.

61
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,120
What kind of person

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,079
is Elder Zhou?

63
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,240
Usually,

64
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,040
he doesn't seem strange at all.

65
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,840
He always talks about being content

66
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,900
with a simple life.

67
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,190
Wait.

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,660
I remember now.

69
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,079
After I recovered,

70
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,240
he came to see me.

71
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,240
At that time, he asked me many questions

72
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,500
about His Highness...

73
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,750
About Xia Jingshi.

74
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,840
He even inquired

75
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,590
about my relationship with Xia Jingshi.

76
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,030
After learning about

77
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,630
my history with Xia Jingshi,

78
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,520
he hinted that I should introduce him
to Xia Jingshi someday.

79
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,540
He wants to ally with Xia Jingshi?

80
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,630
But he's a member of the Storm Alliance.

81
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,360
He can't possibly leave this place.

82
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,890
Unless he's been planning
to leave all along.

83
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,959
Elder Zhou saved my life.

84
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,930
I didn't want to overthink it.

85
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
But today I could feel

86
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,270
he was subtly

87
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,680
hinting to us

88
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,610
that the key to leaving this place

89
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,760
lies with Elder Lei.

90
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,870
Could it be

91
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,710
that he wants to use us

92
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,930
against Elder Lei?

93
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,240
He came

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,510
right after you quarreled

95
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,750
with Lei Lie.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,670
Maybe

97
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,930
he wants to exploit

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,659
the conflict between you two.

99
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,909
Oh, right.

100
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,560
I just remembered

101
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,990
something else suspicious.

102
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,290
I once accidentally saw some of

103
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,720
Elder Zhou's close followers
practicing martial arts.

104
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,960
They're scholars.

105
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,520
They don't need to practice martial arts.

106
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,800
Does anyone else

107
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,870
in the Storm Alliance know about this?

108
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,800
No one does, I think.

109
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,040
He's been secretly building his own force,

110
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,570
maybe to stage a rebellion.

111
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,510
It seems he might be

112
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,770
really planning to move against Lei Lie.

113
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,430
Once you go any farther, you'll be
outside the Storm Alliance's territory.

114
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,960
What are you two doing here?

115
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,560
Bro,

116
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,500
we were ordered by an elder

117

to gather herbs on the mountain.

will soon notice something's wrong.

120

According to the plan,

But you?

179
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,480
Why?

180
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,600
Didn't your two sons

181
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,270
also die

182
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,470
right in front of you?

183
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,910
Have you forgotten

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,910
those desperate looks in their eyes

185
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,670
before they died?

186
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,870
I haven't forgotten for a single day.

187

You say you haven't forgotten,

But I dare not forget.

190

and my unborn child—

192
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,910

Do you understand now?

196
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,670
I will kill him!

197
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,630
But he is Qingyu's son.

What about my child?

What about your sons?

Did they die for nothing?

You want to repay kindness

At this point,

I accept our defeat.

No need for this pretense.

Was it I who ruined you?

When you were young,
you obsessed over the imperial exam,

trying for years and never passing.

235

Because of that, you fell into poverty

and were nearly beaten to death
by creditors.

so many unreasonable rules!

for a reason.

Without these rules,

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,030
this family would have fallen apart
long ago.

[Storm Alliance]

350
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,470
What do you mean?

351
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,730
Don't you want to kill me for revenge?

352
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,240
I'm giving you a chance.

353
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,420
Feng Suige,

354
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,970
you know I want to kill you.

355
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,760
Why did you still save me?

356
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,240
The last words I said to my father

357
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,480
were that

358
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,150
our father‑son bond

359
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,080
and the duties between ruler and subject

360
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,540
were completely severed.

361
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
That was because I discovered

362
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,360
that my mother's death
was connected to him

363
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,360
and that my life

364
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,960
had been manipulated by him.

365
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,100
I didn't kill him

366
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,600
only because he was my father.

367
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,790
It's not a choice I can make;

368
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,920
I can only accept it.

369
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,080
You hate me.

370
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,850
You want to kill me.

371
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,640
This too is not something I can choose.

372
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,270
But I will uncover the truth.

373
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,349
If all of this

374
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,829
was truly my father's wrongdoing,

375
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:13,630
I will bear it.

376
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,680
If you want revenge,

377
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,510
I will accept it.

Many of you here

380
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,720
hate me deeply

381
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,569
because I'm Feng Pingcheng's son.

382
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,510
So what I said just now

383
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,660
was also meant for you to hear.

384
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:32,770
Whether you believe me or not,

385
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,440
I will uncover the truth.

386
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,840
Elder Zhang,

387
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,880
only when you know the truth

388
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,200
can you truly have your revenge.

389
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,960
Since you're willing

390
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,490
to do anything for revenge,

391
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,850
why can't you be a little more patient

392
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,220
and wait for an answer?

393
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,350
Will you really give me this answer?

394
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,280
I, Feng Suige, always keep my word.

395
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,590
Fine.

396
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,680
I'll wait for your answer.

397
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,350
Elder Lei,

398
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,410
are you willing to wait for the truth?

399
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,530
It doesn't matter anymore.

400
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,340
Whether I'm willing or not

401
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,880
is no longer important.

[Storm Alliance]

403

I want to ask all of you a question

404
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,790
I've never asked before:

405
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,310
do you want to strictly follow
the alliance rules?

406

You want to leave too?

[Storm Alliance]

408
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,880
I beg you to tell me the truth.

409
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,620
Godfather,

410
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,360
I don't want to lie to you.

411
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,830
I see.

412
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,200
So it turns out

413
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,280
I've been the only one
wishing for this all along.

414
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,860
Godfather!

415
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,070
Actually, Elder Lei

416
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,180
has his reasons.

417
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,180
Many in the Storm Alliance

418
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,110
have never seen

419
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,680
the dangers of the outside world.

420
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,010
They only long to go out,

421
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,010
but they don't appreciate

422
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,000
how precious this paradise is.

423
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,310
A person won't know

424
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,170
the taste of pain until they fall.

425
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,150
You've been through so much pain

426
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,370
that you've come to this realization.

427
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,570
And haven't you as well?

428
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,560
The pain you've experienced

429
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,030
is greater and deeper

430
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,000
than mine.

431
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,270
Today, you said

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,520
you're an orphan without a home.

433
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,210
But now it's different.

434
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,640
Now you have me.

435
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,070
I will always be your family.

436
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,540
We've been through so much together.

437
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,080
Because I lost my memory

438
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,240
we went from enemies to lovers,

439
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,140
and when you lost yours

440
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,640
we nearly went from lovers
back to enemies.

441
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,110
But even so,

442
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,550
you're still willing

443
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,590
to be my family.

444
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,960
Thank you.

445
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,380
After all we've been through,

446
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,740
don't you feel bitter?

447
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,350
With you here,

448
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,920
how could I?

449
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,330
I'll always be here.

450
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,830
I'm sure after this,

451
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,640
Elder Lei won't be

452
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,440
so rigid in following the rules;

453
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,270
we should be able

454
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,200
to leave soon.

455
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,380
Wherever you go in the future,

456
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,880
I will be with you.

457
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,640
When we return to Susha,

458
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,720
we'll reveal the truth.

459
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,970
It's not just for revenge,

460
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,960
but also to show the world

461
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,000
that Xiyang's brother isn't a villain

462
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,730
who killed his father and king.

463
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,330
I'll send word to Xiyang

464
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,030
to tell her I'm alive.

465
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,830
I can't bring her back

466
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,270
with peace of mind

467
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,670
until I've personally killed our enemies.

468
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,400
Murong Zhong and his son

469
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,790
haven't found your whereabouts.

470
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,450
They certainly won't give up.

471
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,200
When we return to Yujing this time,

472
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,530
it'll be full of danger.

473
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,920
After leaving here,

474
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,790
let's first find someone

475
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,480
to get a clear picture
of the current situation.

476
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,740
This person is completely trustworthy.

477
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,590
Okay.

478
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,430
Killing Murong Zhong
and his son won't be easy.

479
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,750
Why did you agree to that

480
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,730
so readily?

481
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,920
When my army

482
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,240
breaks through your Susha,

483
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,550
taking their heads

484
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,550
won't be hard.

485
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,590
You're still going to send troops
to attack Susha?

486
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,270
Our two countries
have finally achieved peace.

487
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:16,960
What good would attacking Susha again

488
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,290
do for you?

489
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,310
What?

490
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,830
Now you suddenly care about

491
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,120
the people of Susha?

492
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,270
I only agreed to help you kill them;

493
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,930
I never agreed to how I'd do it.

494
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,850
I only want Murong Zhong and his son dead.

495
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,120
I don't want innocent people to suffer.

496
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,440
You're angry?

497
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,170
It doesn't matter.

498
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,720
As long as I'm happy.

499
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,640
Whether to send troops

500
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,110
isn't for you to decide, is it?

501
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,110
Isn't your mother

502
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,510
the real ruler of Jinxiu?

503
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,450
Dare you say that again?

504
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,210
Am I wrong?

505
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,200
Dare to make another bet with me?

506
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,060
I'm listening.

507
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,300
I bet your mother

508
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,550
doesn't care about your opinion at all.

509
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,410
She sees me as a thorn in her side.

510
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,690
She will find a way to get rid of me.

511
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,200
Fine.

512
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,460
I'll take that bet.

513
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,310
In 15 minutes,

514
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,310
the Royal Guards will be back here.

515
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,240
We must be quick.

516
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,650
Your Highness,

517
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,270
the water's getting cold.

518
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,270
You've been bathing for a long time.

519
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,610
Shall I help you dress?

520
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,330
No matter how long I bathe, it's no use.

522
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,230
I won't get clean.

[Yujian Pavilion]

524
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,310
Kneel!

525
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,340
Get out.

526
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,800
You may leave.

527
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,200
Yes.

528
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,680
I killed the person who wanted to kill you

529
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,830
with my own hands.

530
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,110
So?

531
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,240
From now on,

532
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,950
no one in this palace will dare kill you.

533

534
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,160

[Storm Alliance]

537
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,310
Elder Lei,

538
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,130
what are your plans for the future?

539
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,110
I...

540
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,210
I'm not going anywhere.

541
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,880
I'll stay here.

542
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,610
In case they come back,

543
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,230
someone needs to be home.

544
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,070
If I'm not mistaken,

545
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,480
you're also here to say goodbye.

546
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,920
Yes.

547
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,000
I saved you,

548
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,510
and you saved me.

549
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,750
You and I

550
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,550
are even now.

551
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,880
Since I gave you my word,

552
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,440
I'll do everything I can

553
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,640
to find out the truth.

554
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,240
May I

555
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,080
ask you for one favor?

556
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,350
Please speak.

557
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,510
You're both capable people

558
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,310
who've seen all kinds of storms.

559
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,110
If any member of the Storm Alliance

560
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,000
runs into trouble out there

561
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,910
and comes to you for help,

562
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,240
could you—

563
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,350
for my sake—

564
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,070
not let them go hungry or cold?

565
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,370
You can send them

566
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,110
back to me.

567
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,310
Alright.

568
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,000
I promise you.

569
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,600
Of course, Elder Lei.

570
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,040
Please rest assured.

571
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,080
Lei Lie has agreed
to let them leave the mountain.

572
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,190
I have more good news for you.

573
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,310
From now on,

574
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,310
anyone who wants to leave
the Storm Alliance

575
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,440
can do so at any time.

576
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,300
I'm here to say goodbye.

577
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,110
Before I leave,

578
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,250
there's one more thing.

579
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,430
I lost our bet, didn't I?

580
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,880
I'm giving you Zhengnian Villa.

581
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,680
Who wants your stupid villa?

582
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,550
You said it yourself.

583
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,550
No take-backs.

584
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,390
Well...

585
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,750
a bet is a bet.

586
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,280
I can't owe you anything.

587
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,830
As long as it's within my power,

588
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,290
just tell me what you want.

589
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,000
I want you to drink this.

590
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,830
Mushroom?

591
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,350
Drink it.

592
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,550
I've already had some.
What are you afraid of?

593
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,550
Once I drink this,

594
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,590
we're even, alright?

595
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,240
Yes, we'll be even.

596
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,270
What is this?

597
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:18,030
A new medicine I developed.

598
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,400
It dispels dampness.

599
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,030
I...

600
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,270
How would I know?

601
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,350
Why is this...

602
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,160
dampness-dispelling medicine so strong?

603
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:41,680
I want you to drink it.

604
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,110
You don't know?

605
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,270
And you made me drink it?

606
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,120
I'm dying of laughter.

607
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,960
Your injuries are mostly healed,

608
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,680
but they still need time to fully recover.

609
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,640
This medicine can nourish the body
and restore your energy.

610
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,170
Take 2 pills a day for 5 days,

611
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,170
and you should recover
about 70 to 80 percent.

612
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,110
Thank you, Young Mistress Ling.

613
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,480
What about you, Xueying?

614
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,880
What are your plans next?

615
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,750
I just went to find my father

616
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,590
at Lady An's place.

617
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,880
He left me a note

618
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,030
saying...

619
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,690
he went traveling with Lady An

620
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,440
and told me to go back

621
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,240
and look after Zhengnian Villa.

622
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,110
Yixiao.

623
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,610
Ning Fei.

624
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,640
I prepared some dry rations

625
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,300
for you to eat on your journey.

626
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,240
Thank you.

627
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,640
Yes.

628
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:47,440
Here.

629
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,040
Thank you.

630
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,320
Ning Fei has agreed

631
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,500
to return to Zhengnian Villa with me.

632
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,210
That's good.

633
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,720
You can look out for each other,

634
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,180
which puts my mind at ease.

635
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,830
You must take care of yourselves.

636
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,070
After I send Xueying back,

637
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,240
I'll come join you.

638
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,310
Maybe I can be of some help.

639
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,160
Okay.

640
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,600
I'll thank you in advance.

641
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,440
Why are you being so polite again?

642
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,100
I told you we're brothers now.

643
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,750
This list names so many officials

644
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,960
to be promoted.

645
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,310
[Li Boyong] [Zhang Ziyu]

646
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,160
Yes.

647
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,110
The new emperor
has just ascended the throne,

648
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,030
and state affairs are in disarray.

649
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,290
All the departments are short of people.

650
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,450
We really need to add more people.

651
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,590
Did you draft this list?

652
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,820
I discussed it

653
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,790
with the other ministers at court.

654
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,320
They had no objections.

655
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,890
Once His Majesty approves it,

656
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,100
I can send the appointments
to each department.

657
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,200
Your Highness,

658
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,920
you are truly devoted to Susha.

659
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,720
You've reached the age

660
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,960
when you should be enjoying retirement
in your hometown.

661
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,440
Yet you're still managing state affairs

662
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,200
for this widow and her orphaned son.

663
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,980
I am truly moved.

664
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,960
I only wish to dedicate myself fully

665
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,160
and help ease His Majesty's burdens.

666
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,960
However,

667
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,830
selecting officials
is a matter of great importance.

668
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,000
Let's wait until I have discussed it
with His Majesty

669
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,400
before making any decisions.

670
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,350
Very well.

671
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,420
I'll return to my residence

672
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,880
and await your news.

673
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,760
By the way,

674
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,970
there's another matter

675
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,440
of utmost importance

676
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,030
that I must report to you and His Majesty

677
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,650
for a decision.

678
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,680
Feng Suige has disappeared,

679
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,740
and we don't know if he's still alive.

680
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,410
What did you say?

681
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,400
Isn't he already dead?

682
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,050
His body is missing.

683
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,680
I'm afraid there might be
unexpected trouble.

684
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,750
I was planning to wait until
the court stabilized

685
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,830
before personally

686
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,870
investigating this matter,

687
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,920
but as I just said,

688
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,270
with all departments short of staff,

689
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,380
I can't leave.

690
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,620
Your Highness,
