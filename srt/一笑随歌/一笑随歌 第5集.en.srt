This is my responsibility.

Born into the royal family,

such an alliance with our Susha.

If that's the case,

he must hold onto that hatred forever.

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,549
didn't you say

177
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,510
we were going to buy
medicinal herbs for Master?

178
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,049
You... lied to us.

179
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,960
I didn't.

180
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:41,669
I...

181
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,130
Where are you taking us?

182
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,840
Yes.

183
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,730
I'll be honest with you.

184
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,320
It was your master who

185
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,910
asked me to take you out of the city.

186
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,790
She's in danger

187
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,120
and can't take care of you.

188
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,810
Be good.

189
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,550
Will you come back to
Zhengnian Villa with me?

190
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,990
If Master is in danger,

191
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,250
why should we leave?

192
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,680
I want to get off.

193
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,330
Why are you being so disobedient?

194
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,200
If you stay here,

195
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,960
you'll only make your master

196
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,790
worry more.

197
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,360
If someone

198
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,080
uses your lives

199
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,000
to threaten your master...

200
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,330
-Then she...
-Let's go.

201
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:08,960
Fang!

202
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,870
Fang!

203
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,850
Where are you going?

204
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,470
Shunzi!

205
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,680
Don't run!

206
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,270
Shunzi!

207
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,360
Brother! Sister!

208
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,160
-Stop!
-Fang!

209
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,330
-Stop!
-Don't run!

210
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,120
Brother!

211
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,910
Sister!

212
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,320
Eleven, watch over Nine.

213
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,690
-I'll go after them.
-Sister, wait for me!

214
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,600
-Shunzi!
-Brother!

215
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,660
-Sister!
-Shunzi!

216
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,970
Your Highness,

217
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,640
you've finally come out.

218
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,360
Yun Fang

219
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,240
nearly drove me crazy.

220
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,040
He insisted on returning to camp
to reorganize the troops,

221
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,910
and bringing the Feng Battalion
into the city.

222
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,170
What is he trying to do?

223
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,150
Stage a rebellion?

224
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,320
Well, I talked to him.

225
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,890
We only stopped him after discussion.

226
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,890
That brat.

227
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,070
Are you alright, Your Highness?

228
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,360
What's His Majesty's

229
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,840
attitude toward the marriage alliance?

230
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,170
Whatever his attitude,

231
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,600
it won't happen anyway.

232
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,810
You have a plan already?

233
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,820
The undercover guards of Jinxiu
attacked Yujing

234
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,510
and severely wounded
the First Prince of Susha.

235
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,480
The two states had just ended the war,

236
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,860
and such a thing happened.

237
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,320
Besides, it was the fault of Jinxiu.

238
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm sure they wouldn't dare
to go to war because of this.

239
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,270
Brilliant, Your Highness!

240
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,960
You had us all so worried.

241
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,030
We were so worried.

242
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,220
I thought of it on the way just now.

243
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,520
Impressive.

244
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,200
It's impressive.

245
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,700
Your Highness,

246
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,720
something's happened.

247
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,040
Excuse me.

248
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,700
I'm sorry.

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,200
Master!

250
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,000
Master, please don't abandon me.

251
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,990
I'll do anything you ask.

252
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,120
Don't abandon me.

253
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,150
I'll be good.

254
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,960
Who told you to run off like that?

255
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,790
Running around like this is dangerous.

256
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,850
Do you understand?

257
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,480
Didn't I tell you

258
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,390
to listen to Xueying?

259
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,240
Why are you being so disobedient?

260
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,370
What if you got lost?

261
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,050
Are you asking for a spanking?

262
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,750
I...

263
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,150
Please don't abandon us.

264
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,720
I'm not abandoning you.

265
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,150
I want you

266
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,080
to leave Yujing City,

267
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,510
and keep yourselves safe,

268
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,240
understand?

269
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,120
Yixiao!

270
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,120
Yixiao!

271
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,440
These kids...

272
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
They're so disobedient.

273
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,180
I almost couldn't catch up with them.

274
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,560
-Master!
-Slow down!

275
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,850
Why are you running around too?

276
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,670
You're all giving me headaches.

277
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,300
Where's Fang?

278
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,080
He's run off in that direction!

279
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,840
Fang went in another direction.

280
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,240
They ran off separately.

281
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,200
These two kids

282
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,720
have had me running ragged!

283
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,120
Yixiao, don't worry.

284
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,410
I'll go after Fang now.

285
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,480
I'll go find him.

286
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,000
You keep an eye on

287
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,860
these two kids.

288
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,730
No more running off!

289
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,480
Fang!

290
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,750
Fang!

291
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,040
Merchant ships on the Wei River.

292
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,270
Fang!

293
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:14,980
Fang!

294
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,760
You're Fang, right?

295
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,500
Your full name is Qin Fang.

296
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,550
Your father was once my squad leader.

297
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,270
It's alright. Don't be afraid.

298
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,320
As long as you behave,

299
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,470
I won't hurt you.

300
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,840
Alright.

301
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,550
The time has finally come.

302
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,680
We can make our move.

303
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,350
Boatman, hurry!

304
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,240
Master!

305
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,390
Master!

306
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,310
Master!

307
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,180
They know this kid is my weakness.

308
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,260
It seems that they know me well.

309
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,350
You are from the Jinxiu Army.

310
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,440
Master!

311
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,730
What's wrong, Commander Fu?

312
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,080
Don't tell me

313
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,890
you don't even remember me?

314
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,000
I've followed you for many years.

315
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,520
I was even your guard.

316
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,650
She fell from such a high cliff.

317
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,610
Could she have damaged her brain?

318
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,360
Who wants to kill me?

319
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,480
Once you reach the underworld,

320
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,390
someone will tell you.

321
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,270
Move!

322
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,490
Master!

323
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,310
-Master.
-Fang.

324
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,330
Are you okay?

325
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,850
Master!

326
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,630
Master!

327
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,360
Master!

328
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,480
Master!

329
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,420
Master!

330
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,150
Fang!

331
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,500
Put down the knife,

332
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,710
or I'll kill him!

333
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,770
Master!

334
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,050
Don't worry about me!

335
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,800
Shut up!

336
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,270
Put it down!

337
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,200
Master, no!

338
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,590
Master!

339
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,240
Master!

340
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640

341

342

343
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,960

This ship is soaked with oil.

365
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,560
If you stay, you'll only die.

366
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,550
Let me go!

367

372
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,260
Move!

373
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,860
I said move!

374
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,030
Let go!

375
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,590
Let go of me!

Where is Fu Yixiao?

387
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,580
Don't be afraid.

388
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,640
Do you have the gift

389
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,270
I gave you?

390
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,980

Get in.

394
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,100
Hold onto the box tightly.

395
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,590
Come out when there's no water.

396
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,320
Understand?

397
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,090

Are you alright?

403
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,400
Where is Feng Suige?

404
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,750
He's still in the cabin.

405
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,550
Lie down.

406
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,050
Let me out!

407
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,980
His Highness has ordered

408
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,350
that you cannot step outside the mansion.

409
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,830
I am not

410
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,880

What are you doing?

416
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,800
Who told you to lay hands on her?

417
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,510
It's all my fault.

418
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880

Thank you for today.

467
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,720
Rather than thanking me,

468
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,270
you should be

469
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,520
apologizing to me.

470
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,720
What do you mean?

471
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,320
When I was unconscious just now,

472
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,030
what did you do?

473
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,720
To save you,

474
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,650
I pounded on your chest a few times.

475
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,310
What?

476
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,990
Are you holding a grudge?

477
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,390
How can you forget

478
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,370
what just happened so quickly?

479
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,560
Why don't you remind me then?

480
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,070
I mean...

481
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,990
What more do you need me to say?

482
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,240
Are all women from Jinxiu

483
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,580
as bold as

484
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,880
you are?

485
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,030
Oh, you're talking about that little thing

486
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,110
with the blowing?

487
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,910
How did you feel about it?

488
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,750
Did you just ask me how I felt?

489
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,880
I've always known

490
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,270
you're not an ordinary woman

491
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,400
and you don't care much

492
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,270
about gender boundaries.

493
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,130
But I didn't expect you to be so...

494
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,400
So...

495
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,790
So what?

496
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,900
Never mind.

497
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:09,960
Considering you did it

498
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,240
to save me,

499
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,880
I won't hold it against you.

500
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,030
But you are not allowed

501
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,760
to mention this to anyone else.

502
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,320
I can keep quiet about it,

503
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,720
but I think

504
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,310
you should ask Fang about it.

505
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,640
After all, it wasn't me who blew on you

506
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,200
just now.

507
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,310
It was him.

508
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,920
Master, let me do it.

509
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,440
Stop laughing and put your shoes back on.

510
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,510
Look at you!

511
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Wet shoes make feet uncomfortable.

512
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,720
It's much more comfortable barefoot.

513
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,920
You should take your shoes off too.

514
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,720
Take them off.

515
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,410
Alright. I can do it myself.

516
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,960
Go ahead then.

517
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,120
You just fell into water,

518
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:03,680
yet you're acting like

519
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,070
a sulking housewife.

520
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,680
However,

521
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,310
it's quite rare to see you like this.

522
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,550
I'm indebted to you

523
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,570
for saving Fang.

524
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,750
No matter what happens in the future,

525
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,000
when you ask me to repay it,

526
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,750
even if it means
going through fire and water,

527
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,280
I will certainly repay you.

528
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,530
Zhuang He just passed away.

529
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,880
Do you want to follow in his footsteps?

530
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,270
I know what you're thinking.

531
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,590
You want to use someone from Jinxiu

532
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,040
to eliminate Feng Suige.

533
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,050
Do you think you can hide it?

534
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,050
This is Yujing City.

535
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,550
Whatever you do,

536
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,680
do you think Feng Suige won't find out?

537
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,320
I'm sorry.

538
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,970
I was wrong.

539
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,880
I have always been

540
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,830
completely loyal to you, Uncle,

541
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,880
and never had
any thoughts of disobedience.

542
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,200
I just want to help you

543
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,310
solve your problems.

544
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,000
Listen,

545
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,680
I have my own plans.

546
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,510
Whoever dares to ruin my plans

547
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,570
will die by my hand!

548
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,370
Before Feng Suige tracks you down,

549
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,370
get out of here and hide yourself.

550
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,240
Uncle.

551
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,310
When can I return?

552
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,670
When I need you,

553
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,540
I'll send for you.

554
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,580
Your Highness.

555
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,240
The imperial decree was issued days ago.

556
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
The marriage alliance
cannot be delayed any longer.

557
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,950
We must set a wedding date soon.

558
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,360
[Uphold Virtue to Honor the Ancients]

559
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,520
We haven't even found Yixiao yet.

560
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,440
How could His Highness be in the mood
for the marriage alliance?

561
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,240
I will keep sending people

562
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,350
to look for Yixiao.

563
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,750
But this marriage alliance
is a major affair.

564
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,010
If we delay any longer,

565
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,510
and the Emperor blames us,

566
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:05,960
we'll be...

567
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,760
We'll be what?

568
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,280
Would they really charge His Highness

569
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,760
with defying imperial orders?

570
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,110
The one who guards the border for Jinxiu

571
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,000
is His Highness.

572
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,230
The one who safeguards
the Emperor's security

573
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,429
is also His Highness.

574
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,630
But how does the Emperor
treat His Highness?

575
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,670
Withholding our military pay,

576
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,130
suppressing our military achievements...

577
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,469
[Uphold Virtue to Honor the Ancients]

578
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,090
Your Highness!

579
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,670
Your Highness!

580
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,600
Commander Fu...

581
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,360
Commander Fu is still alive.

582
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,560
We've found her.

583
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,510
You've found her?

584
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,170
What did you say?

585
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,510
Where did you find her?

586
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,250
Tell me.

587
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,190
According to our wounded soldier,

588
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,550
the Young Mistress of Zhengnian Villa

589
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,870
saved a woman in red,

590
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,100
who was Commander Fu.

591
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,690
And Commander Fu was captured

592
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,170
by Feng Suige in the villa.

593
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,449
We also learned that

594
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,550
she was taken to Susha by Feng Suige,

595
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,030
and is now in Yujing City.

596
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,670
But we already went to Zhengnian Villa

597
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,530
to look for her.

598
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,760
She must have been hidden then.

599
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,950
That's great.

600
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,540
Yixiao is still alive.

601
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,730
I told you she couldn't possibly die.

602
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,670
Your Highness,

603
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,030
please let me go to Yujing to save her!

604
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,070
I'll even lay down my life

605
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,210
to get Yixiao back!

606
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,400
How?

607
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,990
Will you go alone,

608
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,170
or take our brothers-in-arms?

609
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,550
-I...
-How many people?

610
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,710
Open confrontation or stealth?

611
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,440
What are your chances of success?

612
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,840
And you'll even lay down your life?

613
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,280
Does His Highness
not care about your life?

614
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,670
I just want to save Yixiao!

615
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,320
Enough!

616
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,320
Weiran.

617
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,620
Send someone to inform His Majesty

618
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,930
[Uphold Virtue to Honor the Ancients]

619
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,590
that I will depart for Yujing immediately,

620
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,360
and we'll discuss
the wedding date after I arrive.

621
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,030
Your Highness,

622
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,760
I'm afraid it's inappropriate...

623
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,320
Go now!

624
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,510
Yixiao is in Feng Suige's hands.

625
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,440
No one knows
how much suffering she has endured.

626
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,230
Her life could be in danger

627
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,150
at any moment.

628
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,670
Now I'm the only one who can save her.

629
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,400
We can't waste a single moment.

630
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
Prepare the horses,

631
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,670
travel light,

632
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,070
we'll leave immediately.

633
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,590
Yes.

634
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,800
His Highness will be fine.

635
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,210
He will be safe.

636
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,070
Let's search downstream
along the riverbank.

637
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,190
We must find His Highness.

638
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,050
Your Highness!

639
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,220
Your Highness!

640
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,010
Your Highness!

641
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,080
Your Highness!

642
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,970
Your Highness!

643
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,150
Your Highness!

644
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,570
Yun Fang.

645
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,880
Take some men to search the east bank.

646
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,670
I'll check ahead.

647
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,030
Okay.

648
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,630
Wait!

649
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,030
Stop!

650
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,190
Listen.

651
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,070
It's His Highness's secret signal.

652
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,330
-Hurry! Go that way! Hurry!
-Over there.

653
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,410
Will this really summon your men?

654
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,510
My men should be

655
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,590
searching along the river

656
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,440
for any trace of me right now.

657
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,030
Your Highness!

658
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,760
They shouldn't be too far away.

659
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,960
That's true.

660
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,820
You're the First Prince after all.

661
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,960
They need to see you alive

662
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,880
or your body.

663
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,640
What?

664
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,490
Are you afraid I'll poison you?

665
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,190
But

666
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,510
this really is

667
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,040
a perfect place for murder.

668
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,150
Three taps followed by
a pause of one breath,

669
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,590
four taps followed by
a pause of three breaths,

670
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,110
two taps followed by
a pause of two breaths,

671
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,510
repeat this cycle twice,

672
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,560
then reverse the sequence once.

673
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,630
That's your military's

674
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,160
distress signal, isn't it?

675
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,330
Knowing it won't help.

676
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,630
This secret signal

677
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,160
changes every half a month.

678
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,290
It's fine.

679
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,760
Just tell me the new one

680
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,840
once it's updated.

681
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,150
Sure.

682
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,880
Really?

683
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,370
I dare to say it,

684
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,560
but do you dare to believe it?

685
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,560
Guess whether I believe you or not?

686
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,630
You said you wanted to repay my favor,

687
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,670
and now I've suddenly thought of

688
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,800
a way to repay it.

689
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,710
Isn't that a bit too hasty?

690
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,000
It was you who just swore

691
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,480
and talked big

692
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,750
over there yourself.

693
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,030
To me it sounds like

694
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,070
you're already preparing to back out.

695
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,760
I, Fu Yixiao, always keep my word.

696
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,690
If I can't deliver, you can kill me.

697
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,710
Don't worry.

698
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,630
It's easy to repay my favor.

699
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,430
It's just a piece of cake for you.

700
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,360
It seems you've long had this planned out.

701
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,920
No wonder you're the First Prince.

702
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,510
You have an ulterior motive
for everything,

703
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,510
and you'll never make a losing deal.

704
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,800
Just tell me.

705
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,960
Why are you getting so close?

706
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,280
This is a secret.

707
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,720
I was being foolish.

708
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,150
There's no one else here.

709
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,960
We don't need to whisper.

710
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,740
Your Highness!

711
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,780
Your Highness!

712
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,150
Your Highness!

713
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,200
Your Highness!

714
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,430
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

715
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,550
Your Highness!

716
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,740
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

717
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,630
Your Highness!

718
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,590
Your Highness!

719
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,840
Your Highness!

720
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,550
Your Highness!

721
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,920
We can go now.

722
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,420
How dare you fall asleep
right under my nose?

723
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,880
Aren't you afraid I'll harm you?

724
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:18,920
What?

725
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:19,930
How much longer?

726
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:20,970
Your Highness.

727
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,670
We're about to enter the city.

728
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,130
We'll be back at the mansion
in just a moment.

729
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,780
Tell Gu Yu and Yun Fang to go ahead.

730
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,800
We'll circle the city a couple more times.

731
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
No rush to return.

732
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,440
Yes.

733
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:52,960
Fine,

734
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,920
I'll let you rest a little longer,

735
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,450
but don't make this a habit.

736
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,750
How did I fall asleep?

737
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,590
Feng Suige,

738
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,740
why did you save Fang?

739
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,760
Aren't you supposed to be ruthless?

740
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,230
Why would you risk your life

741
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,360
to save a child

742
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,760
who means nothing to you?

743
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,590
Are you good or evil?

744
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,770
I find you more puzzling by the day.

745
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,240
We've arrived, Your Highness.

746
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,260
We've arrived.

747
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,440
You fell asleep.

748
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,490
Impossible.

749
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,480
With strangers around,

750
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,230
I could never fall asleep.

751
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,880
I was merely

752
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,150
resting my eyes.

753
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,510
Master, where are we?

754
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,230
It's alright now. We're safe.

755
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:08,980
Let's go.

756
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,560
She feels safe with me?

757
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,510
Brother.

758
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,560
Thank you for saving me.

759
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,070
Don't mention it.

760
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,410
Didn't I tell you?

761
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,910
We're friends.

762
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,000
You're the first friend

763
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,150
I've made here,

764
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,590
and in the future,

765
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,320
if there's anything I can do for you,

766
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,630
I'll definitely help.

767
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:55,900
Great.

768
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,750
If I need anything,

769
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,120
I won't hesitate to ask.
