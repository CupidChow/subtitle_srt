00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,450
I know

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,710
you let Xia Jingshi go

7
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,770
because you were afraid I'd kill him.

8
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,200
But I'll say it again—

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,430
he may look like a beaten dog,

10
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,030
but he's actually a wolf cub!

11
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,690
Sooner or later, he will bite!

12

I won't stand in your way.

But you must wait until
after the Qianqiu Festival.

Every year during the festival,

Why go to all this trouble for him?

49
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,530
Since I need his help,

50
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,560
I should naturally show sincerity.

51
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,680
Besides, Xia Jingyan is

52
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,950
temperamental and unpredictable.

he might suddenly change his mind

00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,760
This subject

176
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,660
is at Your Majesty's command!

177
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,800
All of you, leave us.

178
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,790
I have something to say to His Majesty.

179
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,980
All of you, out.

180
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

181
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,600
Have you lost your mind?

182
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,960
In front of all those people,

183
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,030
what are you trying to do?

184
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,490
Are you attempting a coup?

185
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,350
You asked me to reflect,

186
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,220
and I've realized only one thing—

187
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,870
I no longer wish to play

188
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,020
the emperor.

189
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,720
And the last thing I will do

190
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,320
as this puppet emperor

191
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,600
is reclaim military power

192
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,150
and clear the obstacles for my brother

193
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,320
so he can eliminate
Murong Zhong and his son

194
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,240
without concern for future troubles!

195
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,640
You...

196
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,810
My mind is made up.

197
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,850
If you refuse to hand over
the Imperial Seal,

198
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
I'll summon all the court officials

199
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,970
and publicly announce the removal
of their military command.

200
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,720
Guards!

201
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,180
Yes, Your Majesty!

202
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,670
Convey my decree:

203
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,870
Strip the Commandery Prince of Yishu,

204
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,660
Murong Yao,

205
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,600
of his command

206
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,390
over the Imperial Guards immediately.

207
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,600
All Imperial Guards

208
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,760
shall obey only my commands.

209
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
Those who disobey

210
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
shall be executed.

211
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,840
Yes, Your Majesty!

212
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,720
By the mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor of Susha

213
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,480
decrees:

214
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,030
The Commandery Prince of Yishu,
Murong Yao,

215
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,670
is hereby ordered to
return home immediately and rest.

216
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,320
The position of Commander
of the Imperial Guards

217
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,030
shall be filled
by another worthy candidate.

218
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,200
By imperial order.

219
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,100
Your Lordship.

220
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,250
Quickly accept the decree.

221
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,000
This subject

222
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,640
accepts the decree.

223
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,030
Prepare the carriage.

224
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,200
I'm going into the palace.

225
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,530
When my father returns,

226
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,750
tell him I've gone to see
the Empress Dowager.

227
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,410
-Yes.
-Yes.

228
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,600
Calm yourself for now.

229
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,670
Your command

230
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
has only been temporarily removed.

231
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,150
Once the situation stabilizes,

232
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,610
it will be restored to you.

233
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,000
What troubles me is not

234
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,600
the loss of command
over the Imperial Guards,

235
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,930
but the reason behind this sudden change!

236
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,660
Could it be that...

237
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,910
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager has lost

238
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,840
control over His Majesty?

239
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,440
Insolent!

240
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,510
How dare you speak

241
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,510
such treasonous words to me!

242
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,390
This subject has gravely offended you.

243
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,840
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

244
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,720
At this point, I just want to know

245
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,600
what exactly happened in the palace.

246
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,120
His Majesty went to see Feng Suige,

247
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,870
and upon his return,

248
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,080
stripped me of my command.

249
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,670
Isn't that because

250
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,670
you and your father failed in your duty?

251
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,790
Feng Suige is still alive,

252
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,790
and I have yet to hold you to account.

253
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,360
For now, I won't pursue this matter.

254
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,420
The top priority is

255
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,840
to wait for your father

256
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,510
to secure control of the Feng Battalion.

257
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,630
You must kill Feng Suige
as soon as possible.

258
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,690
As for His Majesty,

259
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,550
I will handle him myself.

260
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,170
[Murong Residence]

261
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,450
[Murong Residence]

262
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,240
My Lord!

263
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,530
Terrible news!

264
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,120
[Murong Residence]

265
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,060
[Murong Residence]

266
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,670
Feng Suige,

267
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,750
come out!

268
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,440
[Noble Virtue and Lofty Spirit]

269
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,980
Feng Suige,

270
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,130
show yourself!

271
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,840
Father?

272
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,390
Father!

273
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,900
Father, wake up...

274
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,910
Wake up, Father!

275
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,440
Father!

276
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,000
Father!

277
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,290
I was wrong.

278
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,380
It was all my fault.

279
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,100
If only I had listened to you back then

280
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,000
and been content as a spoiled noble,

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,800
this would never have happened.

282
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,680
I just wanted

283
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,550
to change our family's fate.

284
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,079
I never thought it would cost your life,

285
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,079
Father...

286
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,790
I was wrong.

287
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,960
I've failed you as a son!

288
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,569
When you tried to kill me before...

289
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,310
it was just like this.

290
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,150
Feng Suige!

291
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,830
If you have a grievance,
take it out on me!

292
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,440
Why couldn't you

293
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,370
spare my father?

294
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,030
Did you ever think about

295
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,470
sparing my father?

296
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,590
Back then, when you conspired with Jinxiu,

297
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,830
did you think about sparing

298
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,640
those innocent Susha soldiers?

299
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,200
When you personally

300
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,700
buried me in the ground,

301
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,960
did you remember

302
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,610
we were once like brothers?

303
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,440
I considered you

304
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,950
my best friend!

305
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,000
But from the moment
you conspired with Zhuang Shen,

306
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
you knew

307
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,920
we'd become enemies.

308
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,880
I never expected

309
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,720
that we would

310
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,610
come to this.

311
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,900
When I watched you die,

312
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,640
I felt awful too.

313
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,730
But now I regret it!

314
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,790
I regret not

315
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,590
making sure you were truly dead!

316
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,310
At this point,

317
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
there's no need for empty words.

318
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,440
Today,

319
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,170
I'll show no mercy.

320
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,750
I'll rip you to shreds!

321
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,750
I'll kill you

322
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,960
to avenge my father!

323
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,030
This man has been

324
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,680
my best friend since childhood.

325
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,340
He's a rare and honored guest.

326
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,650
Make sure he's well taken care of.

327
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,390
Yao!

328
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,520
Do it now!

329
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,310
Yao,

330
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,350
do it!

331
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,640
Kill him!

332
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,170
I still can't believe

333
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,910
that my son

334
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,750
is actually

335
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,350
a villain who kills innocent people.

336
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,570
Only you are the most important
to the Murong family.

337
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,660
In this world,

338
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,070
nothing is more important than you.

339
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,480
For you,

340
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,240
I can give up everything.

341
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,350
Traitor

342
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,240
or

343
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,550
rebel—

344
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,550
let them call me whatever they will.

345
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,210
As long as I can save your life,

346
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,520
I'll accept whatever comes,

347
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,220

You're going to Jinxiu?

I'm going to bring Xiyang back.

I don't know how she's doing.

When will you leave?

368
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,410
I'll depart at dawn tomorrow.

I haven't had the chance

to stand with me

384

it must be hard for you
to face your mother.

I've decided.

391
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,750
I'll take Mother

392
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,350
to guard Father's mausoleum

393
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,310
and pray that Father's spirit

What do you mean by that—

399
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,010
are you putting me under house arrest?

400

everything I've done

You've always been

474
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,070
driven by your own obsession:

was me or someone else,

478

you would have done the same thing.

Don't use me as an excuse anymore.

480

00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,210
I don't care about the throne.

522
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,240
What I care about

523
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,000
is fighting alongside you

524
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,400
to protect our homeland.

525
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,640
So, please stop trying

526
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,270
to persuade me to take the throne.

527
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,920
Susha's peace was hard-won.

528
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,270
There must be no more chaos.

529
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,270
Otherwise, it's always the common people
who suffer.

530
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,210
Today,

531
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,180
I'll depart for Jinxiu

532
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,560
to bring back my sister.

533
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,030
While I'm gone,

534
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,910
I hope all of you

535
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,680
will protect Susha for me.

536
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,480
-We will definitely guard our homeland
-We will definitely guard our homeland

537
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,880
-until Your Highness returns!
-until Your Highness returns!

538
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,480
All right.

539
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,310
You may leave now.

540
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,340
-Yes!
-Yes!

541
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:37,830
Yun Qing,

542
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,500
Lu Ke and Yun Fang

543
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,160
will accompany me to Jinxiu.

544
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,350
I'm counting on you to manage things here.

545
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,880
Besides,

546
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,960
there's another important task

547
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,270
I need to entrust to you.

548
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,270
Help me investigate

549
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,310
the truth behind the raid
on the Storm Alliance back then.

550
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:49,790
Yes.

551
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,030
I suspect it was most likely

552
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,650
Zhuang Shen who did it.

553
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,610
But we don't have evidence yet.

554
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,160
If he really did it,

555
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,960
someone in the Zhuang family
must know about it.

556
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,270
Among those exiled from the Zhuang family,

557
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,870
someone must know the truth.

558
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,310
Start there

559
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,590
to find a breakthrough.

560
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,540
Then dig deeper

561
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,700
until you uncover the truth.

562
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,430
Understood.

563
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,480
You can count on me, Your Highness.

564
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,970
On your journey to Jinxiu,

565
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,000
be sure to stay safe.

566
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,000
Don't worry.

567
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,630
Oh, right.

568
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,180
[Ning Fei]

569
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,110
Rush

570
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,140
this letter to Ning Fei

571
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,010
at Zhengnian Villa.

572
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,700
[Ning Fei]

573
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,110
Yes.

574
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,240
What right do you have to keep me here?

575
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,030
My brother is still alive.

576
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,430
Of course, I need to return to Susha
to find him!

577
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,390
Just think about

578
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,030
all the things you've done for Xia Jingshi

579
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,550
that angered your brother.

580
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,150
You think he wants to see you?

581
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,850
Get out of my way!

582
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,250
Feng Xiyang!

583
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,720
Remember this:

584
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,400
you're mine now!

585
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,120
Whether you stay or go...

586
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,350
depends entirely on my mood.

587
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,960
Are you alright?

588
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,890
Someone, come!

589
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,070
Xiyang?

590
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,460
Xiyang!

591
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,030
Why would she suddenly faint like that?

592
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,550
Her Highness is pregnant.

593
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,350
Your Majesty,

594
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,750
Princess Xiyang is with child.

595
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,570
What did you say?

596
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,920
She's definitely pregnant.

597
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,550
If you dare make a wrong diagnosis,

598
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,680
I'll have your head.

599
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,310
I wouldn't dare give a false diagnosis.

600
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,350
Her Highness is indeed pregnant.

601
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:32,880
Get out.

602
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:33,720
Yes.

603
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,740
All of you, out.

604
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
You're pregnant.

605
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,030
Whose child is it?

606
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,310
You and Xia Jingshi

607
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,330
were married

608
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,780
but never consummated the marriage.

609
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,720
If this child isn't mine,

610
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,980
then whose could it be?

611
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,300
That's wonderful.

612
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,840
Feng Xiyang,

613
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,090
I'll marry you.

614
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,710
I'll make you my Empress!

615
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,900
I, Feng Xiyang, would sooner die

616
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,160
than become your Empress!

617
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,860
Your Highness, you've returned.

618
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,700
You must be hungry.

619
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,830
Shall I have the meal brought in?

620
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,030
Your Highness, you've had

621
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,680
little appetite these past few days.

622
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,000
I've had hawthorn and apricot soup

623
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,060
prepared for you.

624
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,440
It's sweet and sour

625
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,500
and should stimulate your appetite.

626
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,690
What are you talking about?

627
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,580
Your Highness,

628
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,210
are...

629
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,550
are you all right?

630
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,030
This maid will go see

631
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,350
if lunch is ready.

632
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,840
This subject

633
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,550
pays respects to Your Majesty.

634
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,010
Speak plainly. What is it?

635
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,120
Your Majesty,

636
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,850
an urgent message from Susha—

637
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,960
Feng Suige is already

638
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,560
on his way to Shengjing City.

639
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,520
What is he coming for?

640
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,469
Your Majesty,

641
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,750
the message only says

642
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,300
Feng Suige wishes to
meet with Your Majesty.

643
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,570
He's coming to take Feng Xiyang back.

644
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,550
I won't see him.

645
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,070
Find some excuse to turn him away.

646
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

647
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,630
Wait.

648
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,250
The news of Feng Suige coming to Shengjing

649
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:07,670
must never

650
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,000
reach Princess Xiyang.

651
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,030
If you leak a word of this,

652
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,500
I'll not spare you.

653
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,440
Yes.

654
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,360
I understand, Your Highness.

655
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,020
I understand, Your Highness.

656
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,290
[Princess Xiyang is secretly pregnant
with the Emperor's child.]

657
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,890
Your Highness,

658
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
our undercover guards

659
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,330
have secretly arrived in Shengjing City.

660
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,490
Your Highness?

661
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,210
She's pregnant with Xia Jingyan's child.

662
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,000
You mean Princess Xiyang?

663
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,360
If she had listened to me back then

664
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,040
and returned to Susha,

665
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,110
none of this

666
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,310
would have happened.

667
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,760
It's too late now.

668
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,280
She brought this upon herself.

669
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,370
She has only herself to blame.

670
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,550
At midnight on Xia Jingyan's birthday,

671
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,800
he'll go to the ancestral home

672
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,150
to pay respects to the ancestors.

673
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,880
He usually

674
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,610
arrives there a day in advance.

675
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,320
And this time, he'll certainly
bring Feng Xiyang

676
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,150
with him.

677
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,220
At that time,

678
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
the Empress Dowager will help us

679
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,490
remove the Royal Guards from his side.

680
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,630
Xia Jingyan and Feng Xiyang...

681
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,150
must both die.

682
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,810
[Shengjing City, Jinxiu Kingdom]

683
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,480
You're quite familiar with this place.

684
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,940
Have you been here before?

685
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,880
I came here once

686
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,150
when I had business outside the border.

687
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,370
After all these years,

688
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,700
it hasn't changed much.

689
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,660
I didn't expect it to be so lively.

690
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,920
Because the day after tomorrow

691
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,650
is Jinxiu's Qianqiu Festival—

692
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,440

864
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,740
♪ Don't cry, don't cry ♪

865
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,300
I'll die right here today,

866
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,400
along with the child in my womb!

867
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,670
You're threatening me again!

868
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,920
I'm just reminding you!
