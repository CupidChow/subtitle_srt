[Episode 8]

3
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:45,850
Prince of Zhennan?

4
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,600
It was you who saved me that day,

5
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,320
and you had also let me go.

6
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,350
Princess Xiyang.

7
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,640
I truly don't remember.

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,039
I am your captive.

9
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,310
Please be careful with your words.

10
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,910
You are a precious princess,

11
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
never my captive.

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,530
But you've stolen my heart.

13
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,710
From that day on, I finally
understood that

14
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,310
women were never meant
for the battlefield.

15
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,240
I cannot follow my Brother's path.

16
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,710
From that day on,

17
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:11,840
my heart

18
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,360
has been tied to yours.

19
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,800
No,

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,800
you're wrong.

21
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,810
There was a woman

22
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,910
who not only went into battle,

23
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,170
but became a hero far surpassing any man.

24
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,280
Don't cry, don't cry

25
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,130
I've shared so much with you,

26
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,790
I'll remember the way home

27
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,170
yet you thinking of another woman.

28
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,550
Do you know that

29
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,710
in order to marry you,

30
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,460
I even offended my Brother?

31
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,140
Don't cry

32
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,730
I just wanted to say that

33
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,120
women can also go to war.

34
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,670
I'll find my way home

35
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,850
What is her name?

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,200
General of Jinxiu,

37
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,850
Fu Yixiao.

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
Princess Xiyang,

39
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,970
I'll take my leave.

40
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,720
Fu Yixiao?

41
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,800
It's the Prince of Zhennan from Jinxiu

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,110
and our First Prince.

43
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,290
Yes.

44
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,220
These two are sworn enemies.

45
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,590
Prince of Zhennan.

46
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,870
We meet again.

47
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,910
Yes.

48
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,890
We've met at

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,410
the Battle of Pingling.

50
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,000
We were so close to success.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,860
If Pingling City had fallen then,

52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,850
you would now be

53
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,290
my prisoner.

54
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,600
What a pity.

55
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,310
Indeed a pity.

56
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,480
A pity that arrow

57
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,110
lacked just a bit more force.

58
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,040
Otherwise, Yujing City today

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,580
wouldn't be celebrating,

60
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,350
but mourning instead.

61
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,130
You see,

62
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,070
in this world, disappointments

63
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,180
are aplenty.

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,760
Do you have Yixiao?

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,870
Yixiao?

66
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,040
I happen to have a concubine

67
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,030
named Yixiao.

68
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,110
Could she be the one you speak of?

69
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,550
Concubine?

70
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,620
I found her by the roadside

71
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,680
and took her in out of pity.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,840
She was deeply grateful

73
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,680
and wants to repay me with her life.

74
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,280
So, I graciously accepted her
as my concubine.

75
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,890
If you are still holding

76
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,070
a grudge for that arrow shot

77
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,720
during the Battle of Pingling,

78
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,060
just blame it on me.

79
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,730
I ordered her to shoot you.

80
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,350
None of this is her fault.

81
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,760
The score between her and me,

82
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,850
you want me to settle it with you?

83
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,190
On what grounds?

84
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,360
I once swore

85
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,790
to protect her for life.

86
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,800
You claim to be protecting her.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,600
But when her life was hanging by a thread,

88
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,160
where were you?

89
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,000
When she was severely wounded
and being hunted,

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,300
where were you then?

91
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,010
None of your business.

92
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,800
You've already forgotten what I just said.

93
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,070
She belongs to my household,

94
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,480
so of course it concerns me.

95
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,970
Yixiao is one of

96
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,120
the Three Heroes of Jinxiu under my command,

97
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,390
my right-hand woman,

98
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,870
someone I cannot afford to lose.

99
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,920
I ask you, the First Prince,
to do me this favor

100
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,050
and return her to me.

101
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,500
If she's that important,

102
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,300
then it seems

103
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,960
I definitely can't give you what you want.

104
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,600
Then what would it take for you

105
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,880
to give her back to me?

106
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,200
Xia Jingshi,

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,920
have you forgotten that

108
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,420
Fu Yixiao is a person,

109
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,420
not some stray cat or dog?

110
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,190
If she wishes to leave,
I don't need to return her,

111
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,110
nor do I need to release her.

112
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,750
She'll leave of her own accord.

113
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,940
Does she know I've come to Susha?

114
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,620
Of course.

115
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,650
She knows you're here

116
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,770
to marry my sister.

117
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,280
Let's go back.

118
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,740
Oh, by the way,

119
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,830
I can return the other one of

120
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,720
your Three Heroes of Jinxiu.

121
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,120
He is...

122
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,600
What was his name again?

123
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,290
Ning Fei.

124
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,630
The one named Ning Fei.

125
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,800
You can take him back.

126
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,480
I've already sent him to your inn

127
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,830
with just... three broken ribs.

128
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,130
No need to thank me.

129
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's go back!

130
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,960
Slow down. Don't move.

131
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,390
I'm fine,

132
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,240
don't worry.

133
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,870
How many fingers am I holding up?

134
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,770
I can see clearly.

135
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,130
No, let me check again.

136
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,740
I told you I'm fine.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,860
Yes, you are.

138
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,560
You have no idea

139
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,630
how terrifying you were just now,

140
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,230
swinging your sword wildly.

141
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,570
I just had a nightmare.

142
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,920
I dreamt that I was
surrounded by many people.

143
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,159
I fought desperately,

144
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,690
fighting with all my might,

145
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,680
but I couldn't eliminate all my enemies.

146
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,080
What happened back then?

147
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,720
How did you end up like this?

148
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,440
I saw them.

149
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,790
Who?

150
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,220
Those people from Jinxiu.

151
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:51,850
[Nan]

152
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,130
Kill!

153
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,010
Kill!

154
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,159
-Kill!
-Kill!

155
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,270
Do you know someone

156
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,190
named Ning Fei?

157
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,770
I've heard the name,

158
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,060
but I don't remember anyone.

159
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,660
He claims to be your brother.

160
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,040
He came looking for you earlier,

161
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,770
but was beaten up by Feng Suige.

162
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,190
His injuries are serious.

163
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,450
With those injuries,

164
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,190
if treated by an incompetent doctor,

165
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,870
he might suffer from

166
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,140
permanent damage.

167
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,240
Xueying.

168
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,720
Then please go

169
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,850
check on his wounds.

170
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,650
You're recalling him?

171
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't know yet if he's friend or foe.

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,970
Regardless, help me

173
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,100
treat his injuries.

174
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,970
What if...

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,120
he really is my good friend from before?

176
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,760
Alright.

177
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,070
I'll do as you say.

178
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,480
[Inn]

179
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,490
I'm done.

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,770
Thank you, Miss Ling,

181
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,080
for coming to treat me personally.

182
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,120
Appreciate the trouble.

183
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,030
I couldn't care less about your affairs.

184
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,650
I'm just doing someone a favor

185
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,850
and couldn't refuse.

186
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,530
Doing someone a favor?

187
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,000
Is it Yixiao?

188
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,870
Miss Ling.

189
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,270
How is Yixiao doing?

190
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,150
Miss Ling!

191
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,150
You've broken three ribs.

192
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,810
Although I've treated the wound
and applied medicine,

193
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,200
it's best you do not move around
for the next three days.

194
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,670
Be careful not to let bone fragments
pierce your lungs or heart,

195
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,270
or there'll be no saving you.

196
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,730
I'm fine.

197
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,390
Miss Ling.

198
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,350
Is Yixiao doing well?

199
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,740
No.

200
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,990
Miss Ling.

201
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,310
How is Yixiao doing now?

202
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,030
I hope you will tell me.

203
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,410
She's lost her memory.

204
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,150
Her left hand is injured too.

205
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,120
She doesn't remember Jinxiu,

206
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,520
or the Prince of Zhennan.

207
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,120
Nor does she remember
the Three Heroes of Jinxiu.

208
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,600
Lost her memory?

209
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,480
She remembers nothing?

210
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,320
What's wrong with you people?

211
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,100
Can't you even protect

212
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,160
your own comrade?

213
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,450
Miss Ling,

214
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,470
does Zhengnian Villa have any way

215
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,400
to treat Yixiao?

216
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,300
Whatever you need,

217
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,200
Prince Zhennan's Mansion
will do our best to help.

218
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,240
She is no longer

219
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,040
the Red-Clad General of Jinxiu.

220
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,930
The prescription.

221
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,630
Thank you.

222
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,860
How are you?

223
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,320
Are you alright?

224
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,870
Fu Yixiao!

225
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,630
What happened on the city wall...

226
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,240
Thank you.

227
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,990
I'm glad you're well.

228
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,690
I heard...

229
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,120
you attacked my former comrade?

230
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,320
Yes.

231
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,870
Why did you act

232
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,330
without any explanation?

233
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,750
I spared his miserable life

234
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,110
only because of you.

235
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,400
If I don't punish him,

236
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,120
wouldn't that mean

237
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,960
any Tom, Dick, or Harry

238
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,390
will dare to cause trouble
at my residence?

239
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,050
Besides, you belong to me now.

240
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,030
Let's make things clear.

241
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,230
I have never belonged to you.

242
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,650
Still sharp-tongued as ever.

243
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,730
You must be fine.

244
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
Didn't you spare my life and

245
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,320
seek my cooperation back then

246
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,120
precisely to help me

247
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,240
recover my memories quickly,

248
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,080
so I could uncover

249
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,600
who in Susha is
collaborating with the enemy?

250
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,240
So why did you stop me today?

251
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,770
I can wait while you slowly recall.

252
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,840
I have plenty of patience.

253
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,390
You may have patience,

254
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,790
but I don't have time.

255
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,550
After all, you're not the one
who lost your memory.

256
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,870
You have no idea how I feel.

257
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,550
I'm in a lot of agony now.

258
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,960
My thoughts are completely chaotic.

259
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,670
I need someone

260
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,120
to help me sort things out.

261
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,150
I cannot let you see Xia Jingshi.

262
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,150
I'm not asking for your permission.

263
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,790
I'm not asking for it either.

264
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,480
With Yixiao's strong-willed personality,

265
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,240
now that

266
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,630
she's lost

267
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,430
her most prized archery skills,

268
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,590
how agonizing must it be for her?

269
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,810
Your Highness,

270
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,230
please give the order.

271
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,750
Even if we have to
turn Yujing City upside down,

272
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,200
we must rescue Yixiao.

273
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,520
Your wounds haven't healed,
but you've forgotten the pain.

274
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,150
Is this the time to be impulsive?

275
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,970
Don't forget

276
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,150
what we're here for.

277
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,000
Is Yixiao more important than
the marriage alliance?

278
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,790
If something goes wrong with
the marriage alliance,

279
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,770
the Emperor of Shengjing City,

280
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,150
will immediately strip
His Highness of military power.

281
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,950
Don't you understand even that?

282
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,540
Then...

283
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,760
what do you suggest we do?

284
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,000
When I think about Yixiao

285
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,360
being in the tiger's den,

286
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm practically on pins and needles.

287
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,270
Enough.

288
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,870
How can I possibly stay calm?

289
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,040
I'm considering...

290
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,000
bringing the matter of rescuing Yixiao

291
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,970
to the public.

292
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,720
Your Highness, you mean...

293
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,150
you want to make the Emperor of Susha
order her release?

294
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,790
Yes.

295
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,270
If the two states enter
the marriage alliance,

296
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,840
it's only right they release our people.

297
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,640
But we've just arrived in Susha.

298
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,600
Making demands for her release now

299
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,030
will inevitably invite speculation around

300
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,960
Your Highness's true intentions

301
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,390
behind your early arrival.

302
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,080
Your Highness's early arrival

303
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,870
can be for the marriage alliance,

304
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,600
or for peace between our nations,

305
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,720
or to demonstrate Jinxiu's sincerity,

306
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,380
but it absolutely

307
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,110
cannot be for a female general.

308
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,430
That's right.

309
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,030
We mustn't rush this matter.

310
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,550
I will find an opportunity

311
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,480
to request her release from Susha.

312
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,530
Now that Yixiao

313
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,990
has lost all her memories,

314
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,200
why would she stay

315
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,400
by Feng Suige's side?

316
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,630
She must have her reasons.

317
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,970
We need to find a way

318
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,110
to see her.

319
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,600
There was a woman

320
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,840
who not only went into battle,

321
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,970
but became a hero surpassing many men.

322
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,480
What is her name?

323
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,640
General of Jinxiu,

324
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,000
Fu Yixiao.

325
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,950
Try this.

326
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,670
I had someone prepare it.

327
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,360
We've finally

328
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,890
put aside our differences,

329
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,220
and agreed to work together

330
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,420
to uncover the truth.

331
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,140
Nothing and no one

332
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,360
should ever

333
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,780
come between us.

334
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,490
I know you want to see Xia Jingshi

335
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,240
because you're hoping his account

336
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,750
might help you

337
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,350
recover your memory faster.

338
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,110
But you need to understand

339
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,200
that any memory someone shares with you

340
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,540
may not be the truth.

341
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,920
I didn't want you to see them

342
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,880
for no other reason than

343
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,160
I was afraid you might be manipulated.

344
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,810
I can judge for myself.

345
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,210
I won't be easily manipulated.

346
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,840
I understand how you feel right now.

347
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,360
How could you possibly understand?

348
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,320
You're not the one who lost your memory.

349
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,030
I just want you

350
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,230
to respect my wishes.

351
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,810
At the Zhennan Pass of Jinxiu,

352
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,600
those who have both

353
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,670
the ability and opportunity to harm you

354
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,590
are very few.

355
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,930
This includes Xia Jingshi,

356
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:03,790
as well as

357
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,720
your two brothers from

358
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,240
the Three Heroes of Jinxiu.

359
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,960
I don't want

360
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,000
you to trust anyone blindly.

361
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,660
So I should trust you instead?

362
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,860
When I agreed to work with you,

363
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,150
you promised me

364
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,240
I could leave anytime I wanted.

365
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,320
But now I simply want

366
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,790
to meet with Xia Jingshi

367
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,360
in order to understand my circumstances,

368
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,320
yet you're doing everything to stop me.

369
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,380
How can I trust you?

370
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,210
Since we're partners,

371
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,720
we share the same goal.

372
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,390
How could I possibly hurt you?

373
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,510
If we're partners,

374
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,930
then we're equals.

375
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,820
I'm not your subordinate,

376
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,140
and you have no right to decide for me.

377
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,670
Are you worried that

378
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:38,870
if I meet Xia Jingshi,

379
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,720
I'll recall past events

380
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,600
and be so eager to return him

381
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,510
that I'll eventually

382
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,910
stop cooperating with you?

383
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,960
If I go back,

384
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,960
your efforts will be in vain.

385
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,750
So that's what you think of me.

386
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,200
What else could it be?

387
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,160
No matter what you say,

388
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,550
I won't allow you

389
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,630
to see Xia Jingshi.

390
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,800
Why do you think

391
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,000
His Highness won't let Miss Yixiao

392
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
meet Xia Jingshi?

393
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,440
Why should she meet him?

394
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,160
Why shouldn't she?

395
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
How would her meeting him

396
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,460
benefit His Highness?

397
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,079
What's the harm?

398
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,880
Do you know what it means

399
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,280
if she meets Xia Jingshi,

400
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,240
remembers something,

401
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,160
and regains her memory?

402
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,220
Do you understand the implications?

403
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,750
It means...

404
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,120
she'll recover her memory.

405
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,590
Then wouldn't she remember

406
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,160
that His Highness

407
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,200
is her enemy?

408
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,790
What are you talking about?

409
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,880
Whether she recovers or not,

410
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,740
aren't we all her enemies anyway?

411
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,830
Have you ever seen His Highness

412
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,480
be this merciful

413
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,910
to any enemy before?

414
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,310
Well, no.

415
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,210
Exactly.

416
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,030
You've seen how His Highness's attitude

417
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,640
toward her

418
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,790
has changed these past few days.

419
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,720
If at first

420
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,960
His Highness simply wanted to use her,

421
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,480
then

422
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,480
things just aren't that simple now.

423
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,980
I'm afraid His Highness

424
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,640
wants her to recover her memory quickly,

425
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,960
yet fears she might remember everything.

426
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,860
Why?

427
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,720
Because if she

428
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,110
truly remembers everything,

429
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,910
she'll no longer be Miss Yixiao,

430
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,730
but Fu Yixiao,
one of the Three Heroes of Jinxiu.

431
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,830
She'll become the female general

432
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,090
who must fight His Highness to the death.

433
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,110
You're overthinking.

434
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,000
His Highness has always

435
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,880
prioritized the bigger picture.

436
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,750
When will he ever

437
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,750
be caught up in these

438
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,810
romantic affairs?

439
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,440
I...

440
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,900
Even if this time,

441
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,720
His Highness has indeed

442
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,200
been swept up by his feelings,

443
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,860
I don't think it's a bad thing.

444
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,930
In my opinion,

445
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,950
Miss Yixiao is quite nice.

446
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,510
Miss Yixiao?

447
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,480
Since when are you so polite?

448
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Am I being polite?

449
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,370
Fu Yixiao.

450
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,030
Yixiao.

451
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,790
Miss Yixiao.

452
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,610
It rolls off the tongue nicely.

453
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:01,880
This waist token was

454
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,160
found on the corpse.

455
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,350
This...

456
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,460
This is the undercover guards'
waist token.

457
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,780
In Jinxiu,

458
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,030
who can mobilize
the undercover guards?

459
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,610
His Highness can.

460
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,390
Besides him,

461
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,080
who else can mobilize them?

462
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,160
Only Military Advisor Xiao.

463
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,630
She actually revealed all this?

464
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,240
Today, as Prince of Zhennan
was entering the court,

465
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,110
Princess Xiyang deliberately
went to see him.

466
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,350
But when they spoke,

467
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,680
I didn't dare approach.

468
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,940
I just heard

469
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,070
the Princess mentioned

470
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,830
that the Prince of Zhennan

471
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,960
once saved her life.

472
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,760
I never expected

473
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,720
they had such a history.

474
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,920
I also heard from

475
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,620
the prisoner from Jinxiu that

476
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,200
the female general from Jinxiu
staying at First Prince's Residence

477
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,030
was saved by
the Prince of Zhennan years ago

478
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,400
and then recruited into his army.

479
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,790
The two have faced
life and death together many times,

480
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,590
sharing an extraordinary bond.

481
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,920
There are even rumors saying that

482
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,020
they are... secretly engaged.

483
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,350
Nonsense!

484
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,400
Is the Princess aware of this?

485
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,490
I dare not say.

486
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,790
When the Princess met
the Prince of Zhennan today,

487
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,550
it seems that he

488
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,110
had mentioned a female general.

489
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,400
After returning to the palace,

490
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,960
the Princess became troubled,

491
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,750
and she hasn't been eating

492
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,110
for the entire day.

493
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,350
Has she shown any signs of backing down?

494
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,110
Has she ever mentioned she's unwilling to
marry for alliance?

495
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,960
Not at all.

496
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,510
The Princess is actually

497
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,830
rather excited about
the marriage alliance.

498
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,790
She also has deep feelings

499
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,250
for the Prince of Zhennan.

500
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,870
I understand.

501
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,960
You may leave.

502
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:49,960
Yes.

503
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,100
Your Highness.

504
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,130
Your Highness.

505
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,510
The ceremonial procession from Jinxiu

506
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,240
is about to enter

507
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,180
Susha territory.

508
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,000
In just a few days,

509
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,330
they will reach Yujing.

510
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,790
How many people have come?

511
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,000
Not counting the escorts,

512
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,960
over a hundred people and
more than thirty carriages.

513
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,240
He didn't dispatch troops from
Zhennan Pass to accompany him?

514
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,990
No.

515
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,560
I heard that the escorts

516
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,310
are all from

517
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,790
Prince Zhennan's Mansion in Pingling City.

518
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,200
The Emperor of Jinxiu has also decreed

519
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,240
that on the day of the marriage alliance,

520
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,590
the main camp at Zhennan Pass
must retreat 30 miles.

521
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,240
From every angle,

522
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,200
I think Jinxiu

523
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,350
is showing genuine sincerity

524
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,210
towards this marriage alliance.

525
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,480
Before the procession enters the city,

526
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,290
ask them to hand in

527
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,200
a detailed list of all attendants.

528
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,240
We must not be careless.

529
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,680
Yes.

530
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,200
Your left hand has only just

531
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,730
begun to show improvement.

532
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,830
If you keep this up,

533
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,560
you'll truly become crippled.

534
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,200
If it weren't for my left hand
being this weak,

535
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,160
do you really think you could have
trapped me here?

536
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,480
Are you that desperate to see him?

537
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:49,950
Yes.

538
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,030
Have you ever considered

539
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,560
whether he wants to see you?

540
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,500
To be honest,

541
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,310
I actually hoped Xia Jingshi

542
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:57,960
would storm

543
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,350
the First Prince's Residence
for your sake.

544
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,550
Then I could take the opportunity to end

545
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,720
his thoughts of marrying my sister.

546
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
But he didn't.

547
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,070
He's more composed than I imagined.

548
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,680
What do you mean?

549
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,550
You aren't

550
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,810
that important to him.

551
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,410
In other words,

552
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,160
if a general I had carefully trained,

553
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,240
my good brother,

554
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,560
fell into enemy hands,

555
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,920
I'm afraid I could hardly match

556
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,760
his profound sense of duty.

557
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,770
You're trying to sow discord.

558
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,540
He doesn't deserve it.

559
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,670
[Zhengnian Hall]

560
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,400
Headache?

561
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,760
Let's go inside.

562
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,750
All's good.

563
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,550
You'll be fine after taking the medicine.

564
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:48,960
Thank you.

565
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,490
Okay.

566
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,590
Go back and have a good rest.

567
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,650
Thank you, Doctor.

568
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,300
Hold still.

569
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,260
If you dare spit it out,

570
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,270
I'll make you drink

571
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,930
this entire bowl of medicine.

572
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,710
She's doing it on purpose.

573
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,590
She's definitely doing it on purpose.

574
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,240
What did he say?

575
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,680
What did he say?

576
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,510
Who's doing what on purpose?

577
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,480
Young Mistress Ling,

578
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,740
please don't mind him.

579
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,440
Bear with it.

580
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,400
Hang in there.

581
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,870
It'll be over soon.

582
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,240
Hang in there.

583
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,840
Done.

584
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,830
Change the dressing every three days.

585
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,750
Don't move around while
you're on bed rest.

586
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,480
Bone and tendon injuries

587
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,780
aren't easy to heal.

588
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,670
If you

589
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,830
don't follow my instructions,

590
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,000
don't come looking for me again.

591
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,730
Understood.

592
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,570
We'll strictly follow your medical advice.

593
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,940
Alright,

594
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,060
you may go now.

595
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,960
Pay for the medicine at the front hall.

596
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,350
As for the consultation fee...

597
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,550
I'll waive it for you.

598
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,510
This way.

599
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,120
Young Mistress Ling.

600
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,750
May I have a word with you?

601
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,660
You want to see Yixiao?

602
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,270
No way.

603
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,350
Although I can enter

604
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,350
Feng Suige's residence,

605
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,030
I can't just

606
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,350
bring you in as I please.

607
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,400
We just want to see her—

608
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,000
No need for all that trouble.

609
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,350
This bamboo whistle

610
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,350
was the token we used to contact Yixiao

611
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,210
back in the day.

612
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,530
But now that she had lost
all her memories,

613
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,200
this method probably

614
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,370
won't work anymore.

615
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,810
But no matter what danger she is in,

616
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,830
as long as she blows this bamboo whistle,

617
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,640
we brothers will come without hesitation,

618
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,790
even if it means walking through

619
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,850
mountains of knives and seas of fire.

620
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,170
Please, Young Mistress Ling.

621
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,530
Alright.

622
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,070
I'll pass this bamboo whistle

623
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,110
to her for you.

624
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,270
Why don't you just

625
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,400
bring her here then?

626
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,110
We really want to see her again.

627
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,640
His Highness

628
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,480
also wants to see her as soon as possible.

629
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,720
We truly are her brothers.

630
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,480
I swear,

631
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,880
if I'm not her brother...

632
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,520
This is Yujing City in Susha.

633
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,680
This is Feng Suige's territory.

634
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,160
Young Mistress Ling's willingness
to help us

635
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,760
is already a great kindness.

636
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,030
Please.

637
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:18,830
Please.

638
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,400
Brother Ning Fei!

639
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,680
Brother Weiran!

640
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,400
Brother!

641
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,920
How come it's you guys?

642
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,050
Shunzi, Fang, Nine.

643
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,310
-What brings you here?
-Brother Ning Fei.

644
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,690
I brought them here.

645
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,130
When they came to Zhengnian Villa

646
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,510
looking for Yixiao,

647
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,360
I saw how pitiful

648
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,620
the three of them were.

649
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,210
Anyway, it's

650
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,340
a long story.

651
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,090
Brother Weiran,

652
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,310
we've found our Master.

653
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,440
We'll listen to you.

654
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:45,920
Do you know how dangerous

655
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,800
it is here?

656
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,910
If anything happened to you,

657
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,000
how would I explain to your Master?

658
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,750
Alright.

659
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,110
-Let me have a look.
-Shunzi.

660
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,880
-Brother Ning Fei.
-Nine.

661
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,480
Brother Weiran.

662
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
Brother Ning Fei.

663
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,310
As long as you guys are okay.

664
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:57,680
All's good now.

665
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,830
You've grown taller.

666
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,630
Were you good to Sister Xueying?

667
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,350
When they came to Zhengnian Villa

668
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,280
looking for you,

669
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,880
you were in the medical pool
at the back mountain.

670
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,750
I didn't tell them

671
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,680
your whereabouts

672
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,740
because you were wounded by an arrow,

673
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,510
and anyone who could hurt you
within five paces

674
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,170
must be someone you knew well.

675
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,450
They claimed to be your brothers,

676
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,840
so I...

677
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,600
You did the right thing,

678
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,050
Don't blame yourself.

679
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,470
Do you remember them now?

680
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,010
I can't say I remember,

681
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,890
just some fragments of memory.

682
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,720
When those images appear,

683
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,830
I feel as if I'm just

684
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,160
a spectator,

685
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,470
detached from it all.

686
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,560
You speak with such sincerity,

687
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,550
but I only feel

688
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,210
a slight emotional response.

689
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,510
I understand that

690
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,590
I seem to have

691
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,170
a very close bond with them.

692
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,600
But this feeling is like

693
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,450
flowers in a mirror

694
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,950
and moon in the water.

695
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,550
What about the Prince of Zhennan,
Xia Jingshi?

696
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,310
You said when you met him
at the city gate,

697
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,640
it seemed as though a flood of emotions

698
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,350
welled up from the depths of your memory.

699
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,750
Then why don't you go see him?

700
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,160
Perhaps he is the key

701
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,800
to unlocking your memories.

702
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,040
I thought so too.

703
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
But Feng Suige

704
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,910
wouldn't let me see him.

705
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,590
Just because he wouldn't let you go,
so you won't go?

706
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,060
That's not like you.

707
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,310
This is a great opportunity

708
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,580
for you to slip away.

709
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,720
Don't tell me you really plan

710
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,270
to continue working

711
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,310
with Feng Suige?

712
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,200
I feel that

713
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,960
whether or not you want to
return to Jinxiu,

714
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,070
you should take this chance

715
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,600
to get away from Feng Suige.

716
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,610
This place of his

717
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,980
isn't exactly a good place after all.

718
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,030
Although he's not exactly a good person,

719
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,810
and he doesn't really

720
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,350
have good intentions toward me,

721
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,640
when I was in trouble,

722
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,980
he did protect me.

723
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,650
Besides,

724
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,550
I agreed to cooperate with him.

725
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,130
If I go back on my word now,

726
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,440
it would seem somewhat dishonorable.

727
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,550
You're talking about honor with him?

728
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,880
At a time like this?

729
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,070
I've always kept my affairs separate.

730
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,310
I always repay my debts,

731
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,030
and I always collect what's owed to me.

732
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,690
I need to help him at least once

733
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,070
before I can leave with
a clear conscience.

734
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,070
What should we do then?

735
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,820
If Feng Suige

736
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,880
refuses to let you see him,

737
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,610
wouldn't you be

738
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,870
trapped here forever?

739
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,040
Here's the plan.

740
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,940
Ask Ning Fei to send a message
to Xia Jingshi.

741
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,480
You guys want to meet at my place?

742
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,700
Just say I'm going to see the kids.

743
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,720
Feng Suige's people will definitely be watching,

744
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,480
but they'll only guard the front entrance.

745
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,160
At that time,

746
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,830
have Xia Jingshi come in
through the back door.

747
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,310
I must see him as soon as possible

748
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,970
and get all the answers I need.

749
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,490
When?

750
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,510
No time like the present,

751
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,770
so let's make it today.

752
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,030
Did Yixiao really send a message

753
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,030
wanting to see us?

754
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:27,830
That's right.

755
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,550
Thankfully we have
Young Mistress Ling's help,

756
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,720
otherwise we'd have no idea

757
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,120
when we could see Yixiao.

758
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,050
I knew Yixiao

759
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,530
wouldn't forget about us.

760
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,880
We are so thrilled

761
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,480
we forgot her Moon-Shooting Bow.

762
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,880
Didn't I just tell you we must

763
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,350
avoid making a spectacle out of
meeting Yixiao?

764
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,480
So why bring the Moon-Shooting Bow?

765
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,110
What if Yixiao wants to see it?

766
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,750
Enough.

767
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,550
When we meet Yixiao later,

768
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,160
both of you

769
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,640
absolutely must not tell her

770
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,970
too much about the past.

771
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,750
Miss Ling specifically instructed that

772
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,960
she shouldn't be upset.

773
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,690
Understood?

774
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,200
Yes.

775
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:54,920
Yes.

776
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,560
Let's go.

777
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,510
This servant greets Your Highness.

778
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,160
The Empress

779
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,750
is hosting a banquet in the
Imperial Garden today

780
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,160
and wishes to have a chat
with Your Highness.

781
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,890
She sent me to escort you there.

782
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,410
Today?

783
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,610
Is Your Highness unavailable?

784
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,350
No.

785
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,260
I'll accept the order.

786
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,480
I...

787
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,440
Wait for me here.

788
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:34,920
Yes.

789
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:54,080
[Zhengnian Hall]

790
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,950
I still feel a little unwell.

791
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,030
Be careful.

792
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,790
Master,

793
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,300
let me pour you some tea.

794
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,350
I'll do it myself.

795
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,350
We agreed to meet here

796
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,420
after two hours.

797
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,620
Why haven't they shown up yet

798
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,950
after all this waiting?

799
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,260
Here, Shunzi.

800
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,730
Thank you.

801
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,750
Sister, I want some too.

802
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,110
Here.

803
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,910
Here, Fang.

804
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,340
Sister.

805
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,400
Don't worry.

806
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
How about I send someone

807
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
to the inn to ask?

808
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,900
It's fine,

809
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,400
let's wait a bit longer.

810
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,800
They're here.

811
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,080
Brother Ning Fei.

812
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,960
-Brother Ning Fei!
-Brother Ning Fei!

813
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,090
-Brother Ning Fei!
-Brother Ning Fei!

814
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,380
This courtyard is nice.

815
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,000
Full of birdsong and flowers,

816
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,310
and quite secluded.

817
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,750
Where is he?

818
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,460
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

819
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,290
No, Your Highness.

820
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,030
He...

821
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,700
For your father's sake,

822
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,550
just this once.

823
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,690
It was my idea,

824
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,830
she had nothing to do with it.

825
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,090
Direct any anger at me.

826
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,200
Xueying,

827
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,310
take the children inside quickly.

828
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,440
Shunzi, Fang, Nine.

829
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,130
Let's go.

830
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,590
Let's go.

831
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,510
Since we're working together,

832
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,830
we are partners.

833
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,790
It's perfectly normal for you
to get temperamental.

834
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,720
But since you're so eager to see him,

835
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,400
it would make me seem petty

836
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,230
if I keep trying to stop you.

837
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,610
So go ahead and meet,

838
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,210
but in my presence,

839
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
where both you can speak freely.

840
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,960
Xiyang lost her birth mother
at a young age,

841
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,840
so I raised her myself.

842
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,960
Though she's not my biological daughter,

843
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,020
I've always treated her as my own.

844
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,440
Throughout her life,

845
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,590
I've never let her suffer
the slightest injustice.

846
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,990
Just thinking about her marrying far away,

847
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,050
my heart just feels...

848
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,100
indescribable.

849
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,310
I feel empty somewhere.

850
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,350
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

851
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,890
When Princess Xiya marries into Jinxiu,

852
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,750
she will not suffer

853
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,680
any grievances whatsoever.

854
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,510
That's good.

855
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,720
Then I can entrust my daughter

856
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,120
to you with peace of mind.

857
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,720
I may be saying all of this to you,

858
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,030
but Prince of Zhennan,

859
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,560
please don't take offense.

860
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,410
I wouldn't dare.

861
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,570
By the way,

862
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,020
I heard that there's a female general

863
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,880
in your army.

864
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,640
Yes,

865
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,790
her name is Fu Yixiao.

866
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,400
Is she that lady staying as a guest

867
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,460
at the residence of our First Prince?

868
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,030
Battlefields

869
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,040
have always been the domain of men.

870
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
How did you come to have

871
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,610
a woman in your army?

872
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,710
It's a long story.

873
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,800
She was an orphan from childhood,

874
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,000
so she suffered a lot.

875
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,679
Later she came to my army,

876
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,730
and over time,

877
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,679
she developed

878
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,570
remarkable battlefield skills.

879
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,330
It seems like

880
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,699
there must be a profound bond

881
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,030
between you two.

882
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,280
I am the Commander-in-Chief
of Zhennan Pass,

883
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,480
and she is my general.

884
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,040
In our army,

885
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,280
even the common soldiers

886
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,760
share a bond forged in life and death.

887
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,840
Without such loyalty,

888
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,710
how could anyone dare to

889
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,310
turn their back to a comrade?

890
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,120
I wonder if Your Majesty...

891
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,090
is referring to this kind of bond?

892
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,980
Is there anything else?

893
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,710
Beyond this?

894
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,040
Absolutely nothing.

895
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,230
Perhaps I was just overthinking it.

896
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,510
You should know that

897
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,120
Xiyang is His Majesty's precious jewel

898
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,460
and Susha's only princess.

899
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,580
She also shares the same mother

900
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,110
with the First Prince of Susha.

901
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,070
Even though this marriage alliance
is a matter of great importance

902
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,230
and concerns the welfare of
both countries,

903
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,010
if Xiyang herself refuses,

904
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,000
no one

905
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,510
can force her to comply.

906
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,030
She has lived sheltered in the palace,

907
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,320
knowing little of the outside world.

908
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,400
I've protected her too well
since childhood.

909
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,930
Even the slightest trigger

910
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,100
might cause her to change her mind.

911
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,990
Thank you for your guidance, Your Majesty.

912
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,610
This is hardly guidance.

913
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,070
I simply wanted to meet

914
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,670
my future son-in-law today.

915
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,410
A good match is hard to find.

916
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,750
Prince of Zhennan,

917
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,090
you must treasure this opportunity.

918
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,080
It was you who interfered, wasn't it?

919
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,190
Such underhanded tactics

920
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,380
are exactly what I'd expect from you.

921
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,580
Feng Suige.

922
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,400
Only now do I see clearly that

923
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,630
your definition of cooperation

924
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,730
is just a different way

925
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,260
to imprison me by your side.

926
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,350
Not only do you want to

927
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,360
uncover the truth from me,

928
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,920
you want me to submit to you.

929
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,920
Otherwise you wouldn't
repeatedly stand in my way.

930
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,110
You show me kindness on one hand

931
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,510
to make me feel indebted,

932
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,000
yet you control me on the other

933
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,630
and claim it's for my own good.

934
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,550
But in reality, they're all at
your disposal.

935
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,240
I'm nothing more than

936
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,370
a pawn in your game.

937
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,360
But you seem to have forgotten that

938
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,490
I, Fu Yixiao, have never been

939
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,880
someone who submits to others.

940
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,590
I didn't want to

941
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,280
fall out with you before

942
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,000
because I was mindful of

943
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
what you've done for me.

944
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,070
For every kindness shown to me,

945
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,320
I will repay it a hundredfold.

946
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,290
You must have figured

947
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,750
I wouldn't resist, right?

948
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,480
How foolish I was to have actually
thought for a moment

949
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,410
that you genuinely cared about me.

950
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,630
I thought you were my friend.

951
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,190
Looking back now, it's laughable.

952
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,960
Fu Yixiao, you—

953
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,880
I'm going to see Xia Jingshi now.

954
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,960
I'll kill anyone

955
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,280
who tries to stop me.

956
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,880
How did this turn into an argument now?

957
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,320
Move!

958
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,160
Alright.

959
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,590
Go and have a look.

960
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,480
Miss Yixiao.

961
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,960
Your Highness, what's wrong?

962
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,190
S-Such a temper,

963
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,410
like she's gone mad.

964
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,220
Your Highness.

965
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,280
Where did she go?

966
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:46,960
Miss Yixiao

967
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,800
is going to the inn alone.

968
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Should we send someone to watch her?

969
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,470
Let her die.

970
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,820
Your Highness.

971
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,320
Yun Fang.

972
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,120
Go watch her.

973
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,030
Got it.

974
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,450
Boss,

975
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,710
two more bowls of porridge, please.

976
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,640
Coming right up!

977
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,520
[Inn]

978
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:25,710
Hurry up. Hurry up.

979
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,880
Where is he?

980
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,580
Over there.

981
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,860
Yixiao!

982
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,740
Yixiao!

983
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,800
Yixiao!

984
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,960
Yixiao!

985
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,610
You really are okay.

986
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,460
I knew it.

987
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,460
Yixiao.

988
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,280
When we heard you wanted to see us,

989
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,990
Your Highness was so excited.

990
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,960
But just as we were about to leave,

991
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,190
he was summoned to the palace
by Empress Zhuang.

992
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:54,920
So...

993
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,210
Yixiao.

994
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,860
I can't believe you actually

995
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,590
came to find us yourself.

996
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,030
Yixiao,

997
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,670
are you eating well and

998
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,880
sleeping well over there?

999
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,140
Don't get too excited.

1000
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,680
Yixiao is still injured.

1001
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,750
My bad,

1002
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm being too abrupt.

1003
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,050
Yixiao,

1004
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,280
how's your injury?

1005
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,510
I heard you were badly hurt.

1006
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,760
Let me see. Is it your arm?

1007
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,480
Yixiao,

1008
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,740
do you still recognize us?

1009
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,450
I'm Ning Fei,

1010
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,440
do you remember me?

1011
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,070
You're Ning Fei.

1012
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,750
Then you must be Xiao Weiran.

1013
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,390
See?

1014
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,590
You were overthinking it.

1015
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,230
How could Yixiao

1016
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,160
not remember us?

1017
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:36,920
Yixiao.

1018
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,630
Has Feng Suige given you a hard time?

1019
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,320
A few days ago,

1020
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,550
he was doing everything to keep us away.

1021
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,230
Today is the day

1022
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,490
of our joyous reunion.

1023
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,970
Let's not mention him.

1024
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,670
Yixiao.

1025
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,800
If that Feng Suige bullies you,

1026
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,430
just tell us

1027
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,310
and I'll settle the score for you.

1028
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,190
Remember,

1029
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,520
now that we're here,

1030
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,080
you have someone to rely on.

1031
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,180
Thank you, Ning Fei.

1032
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,800
Why are you thanking me?

1033
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,360
-Yeah.
-She…

1034
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,690
Why be so polite with us?

1035
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,220
Your Highness is back.

1036
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,450

Yixiao.

1060
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,280
I had planned to go and meet you,

1061
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,510
but something came up.

1062
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,150
I know.

1063
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,430
They told me everything.

1064
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,430
Why didn't you come back?

1065
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,800
I...

1066
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,810
I knew you weren't dead.

1067
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,190
I believed you would find

1068
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:53,990
your way home.

1069
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,960
But why wouldn't you return?

1070
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,360
Yixiao, do you know?

1071
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,510
I've been looking for you all along.

1072
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,970
I've been waiting for you.

1073
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,800
I was afraid you'd never return.

1074
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,840
I...

1075
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,290
I don't remember anything.

1076
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,290
You don't even remember me?

1077
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,300
Then what do you remember?

1078
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,200
Ning Fei?

1079
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,210
Xiao Weiran?

1080
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,570
Everything about Pingling City,

1081
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,170
you don't remember any of it?

1082
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,800
Fang and Shunzi told me

1083
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:24,960
a bit about the past.

1084
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,590
Feng Suige told me some stories

1085
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,920
about the battlefield.

1086
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,320
Other than that...

1087
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,850
You don't remember anything else?

1088
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,190
Nothing at all?

1089
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,920
What about everything

1090
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,800
between us?

1091
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,530
All that we've shared

1092
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,240
through thick and thin,

1093
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,840
you don't remember any of it?

1094
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:46,800
Yixiao.

1095
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:48,760
Look at me.

1096
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,000
Look at my face.

1097
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,800
Tell me honestly,

1098
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,110
do you remember?
