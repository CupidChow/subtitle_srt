00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,450
I know

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,710
you let Xia Jingshi go

7
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,770
because you were afraid I'd kill him.

8

But I'll say it again—

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,430
he may look like a beaten dog,

10
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,030
but he's actually a wolf cub!

11
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,690
Sooner or later, he will bite!

12

I won't stand in your way.

But you must wait until
after the Qianqiu Festival.

Every year during the festival,

Why go to all this trouble for him?

49
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,530
Since I need his help,

50
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,560
I should naturally show sincerity.

51
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,680
Besides, Xia Jingyan is

52
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,950
temperamental and unpredictable.

I can't figure out what's on his mind.

he might suddenly change his mind

00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,760
This subject

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,660
is at Your Majesty's command!

177
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,800
All of you, leave us.

178
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,790
I have something to say to His Majesty.

179
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,980
All of you, out.

180
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

181
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,600
Have you lost your mind?

182
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,960
In front of all those people,

183
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,030
what are you trying to do?

184
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,490
Are you attempting a coup?

185
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,350
You asked me to reflect,

186
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,220
and I've realized only one thing—

187
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,870
I no longer wish to play

188
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,020
the emperor.

189
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,720
And the last thing I will do

190
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,320
as this puppet emperor

191
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,600
is reclaim military power

192
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,150
and clear the obstacles for my brother

193
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,320
so he can eliminate
Murong Zhong and his son

194
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,240
without concern for future troubles!

195
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,640
You...

196
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,810
My mind is made up.

197
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,850
If you refuse to hand over
the Imperial Seal,

198
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
I'll summon all the court officials

199
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,970
and publicly announce the removal
of their military command.

200
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,720
Guards!

201
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,180
Yes, Your Majesty!

202
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,670
Convey my decree:

203
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,870
Strip the Commandery Prince of Yishu,

204
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,660
Murong Yao,

205
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,600
of his command

206
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,390
over the Imperial Guards immediately.

207
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,600
All Imperial Guards

208
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,760
shall obey only my commands.

209
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Those who disobey

210
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
shall be executed.

211
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,840
Yes, Your Majesty!

212
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,720
By the mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor of Susha

213
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,480
decrees:

214
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,030
The Commandery Prince of Yishu,
Murong Yao,

215
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,670
is hereby ordered to
return home immediately and rest.

216
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,320
The position of Commander
of the Imperial Guards

217
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,030
shall be filled
by another worthy candidate.

218
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,200
By imperial order.

219
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,100
Your Lordship.

220
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,250
Quickly accept the decree.

221
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,000
This subject

222
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,640
accepts the decree.

223
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,030
Prepare the carriage.

224
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,200
I'm going into the palace.

225
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,530
When my father returns,

226
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,750
tell him I've gone to see
the Empress Dowager.

227
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,410
-Yes.
-Yes.

228
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,600
Calm yourself for now.

229
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,670
Your command

230
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
has only been temporarily removed.

231
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,150
Once the situation stabilizes,

232
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,610
it will be restored to you.

233
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,000
What troubles me is not

234
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,600
the loss of command
over the Imperial Guards,

235
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,930
but the reason behind this sudden change!

236
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,660
Could it be that...

237
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,910
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager has lost

238
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,840
control over His Majesty?

239
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,440
Insolent!

240
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,510
How dare you speak

241
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,510
such treasonous words to me!

242
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,390
This subject has gravely offended you.

243
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,840
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

244
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,720
At this point, I just want to know

245
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
what exactly happened in the palace.

246
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,120
His Majesty went to see Feng Suige,

247
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,870
and upon his return,

248
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,080
stripped me of my command.

249
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,670
Isn't that because

250
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,670
you and your father failed in your duty?

251
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,790
Feng Suige is still alive,

252
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,790
and I have yet to hold you to account.

253
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,360
For now, I won't pursue this matter.

254
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,420
The top priority is

255
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,840
to wait for your father

256
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,510
to secure control of the Feng Battalion.

257
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,630
You must kill Feng Suige
as soon as possible.

258
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,690
As for His Majesty,

259
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,550
I will handle him myself.

260
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,170
[Murong Residence]

261
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,450
[Murong Residence]

262
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,240
My Lord!

263
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,530
Terrible news!

264
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,120
[Murong Residence]

265
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,060
[Murong Residence]

266
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,670
Feng Suige,

267
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,750
come out!

268
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,440
[Noble Virtue and Lofty Spirit]

269
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,980
Feng Suige,

270
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,130
show yourself!

271
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,840
Father?

272
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,390
Father!

273
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,900
Father, wake up...

274
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,910
Wake up, Father!

275
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,440
Father!

276
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,000
Father!

277
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,290
I was wrong.

278
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,380
It was all my fault.

279
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,100
If only I had listened to you back then

280
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,000
and been content as a spoiled noble,

281
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,800
this would never have happened.

282
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,680
I just wanted

283
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,550
to change our family's fate.

284
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,079
I never thought it would cost your life,

285
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,079
Father...

286
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,790
I was wrong.

287
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,960
I've failed you as a son!

288
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,569
When you tried to kill me before...

289
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,310
it was just like this.

290
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,150
Feng Suige!

291
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,830
If you have a grievance,
take it out on me!

292
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,440
Why couldn't you

293
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,370
spare my father?

294
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,030
Did you ever think about

295
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,470
sparing my father?

296
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,590
Back then, when you conspired with Jinxiu,

297
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,830
did you think about sparing

298
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,640
those innocent Susha soldiers?

299
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,200
When you personally

300
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,700
buried me in the ground,

301
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,960
did you remember

302
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,610
we were once like brothers?

303
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,440
I considered you

304
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,950
my best friend!

305
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,000
But from the moment
you conspired with Zhuang Shen,

306
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
you knew

307
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,920
we'd become enemies.

308
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,880
I never expected

309
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,720
that we would

310
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,610
come to this.

311
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,900
When I watched you die,

312
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,640
I felt awful too.

313
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,730
But now I regret it!

314
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,790
I regret not

315
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,590
making sure you were truly dead!

316
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,310
At this point,

317
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
there's no need for empty words.

318
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,440
Today,

319
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,170
I'll show no mercy.

320
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,750
I'll rip you to shreds!

321
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,750
I'll kill you

322
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,960
to avenge my father!

323
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,030
This man has been

324
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,680
my best friend since childhood.

325
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,340
He's a rare and honored guest.

326
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,650
Make sure he's well taken care of.

327
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,390
Yao!

328
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,520
Do it now!

329
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,310
Yao,

330
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,350
do it!

331
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,640
Kill him!

332
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,170
I still can't believe

333
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,910
that my son

334
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,750
is actually

335
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,350
a villain who kills innocent people.

336
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,570
Only you are the most important
to the Murong family.

337
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,660
In this world,

338
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,070
nothing is more important than you.

339
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,480
For you,

340
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,240
I can give up everything.

341
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,350
Traitor

342
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,240
or

343
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,550
rebel—

344
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,550
let them call me whatever they will.

345
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,210
As long as I can save your life,

346
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,520
I'll accept whatever comes,

347
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,220

You're going to Jinxiu?

I'm going to bring Xiyang back.

I don't know how she's doing.

When will you leave?

368
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,410
I'll depart at dawn tomorrow.

I haven't had the chance

to stand with me

384

it must be hard for you
to face your mother.

I've decided.

391
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,750
I'll take Mother

392
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,350
to guard Father's mausoleum

393
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,310
and pray that Father's spirit

What do you mean by that—

399
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,010
are you putting me under house arrest?

400

everything I've done

You've always been

474
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,070
driven by your own obsession:

was me or someone else,

478

you would have done the same thing.

Don't use me as an excuse anymore.

480

00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,210
I don't care about the throne.

522
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,240
What I care about

523
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,000
is fighting alongside you

524
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
to protect our homeland.

525
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,640
So, please stop trying

526
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,270
to persuade me to take the throne.

527
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,920
Susha's peace was hard-won.

528
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,270
There must be no more chaos.

529
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,270
Otherwise, it's always the common people
who suffer.

530
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,210
Today,

531
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,180
I'll depart for Jinxiu

532
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,560
to bring back my sister.

533
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,030
While I'm gone,

534
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,910
I hope all of you

535
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,680
will protect Susha for me.

536
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,480
-We will definitely guard our homeland
-We will definitely guard our homeland

537
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,880
-until Your Highness returns!
-until Your Highness returns!

538
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,480
All right.

539
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,310
You may leave now.

540
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,340
-Yes!
-Yes!

541
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:42,830
Yun Qing,

542
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,500
Lu Ke and Yun Fang

543
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,160
will accompany me to Jinxiu.

544
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,350
I'm counting on you to manage things here.

545
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:48,880
Besides,

546
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,960
there's another important task

547
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,270
I need to entrust to you.

548
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,270
Help me investigate

549
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,310
the truth behind the raid
on the Storm Alliance back then.

550
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,790
Yes.

551
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,030
I suspect it was most likely

552
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,650
Zhuang Shen who did it.

553
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,610
But we don't have evidence yet.

554
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,160
If he really did it,

555
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,960
someone in the Zhuang family
must know about it.

556
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,270
Among those exiled from the Zhuang family,

557
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,870
someone must know the truth.

558
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,310
Start there

559
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,590
to find a breakthrough.

560
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,540
Then dig deeper

561
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,700
until you uncover the truth.

562
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,430
Understood.

563
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,480
You can count on me, Your Highness.

564
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,970
On your journey to Jinxiu,

565
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,000
be sure to stay safe.

566
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,000
Don't worry.

567
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,630
Oh, right.

568
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,180
[Ning Fei]

569
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,110
Rush

570
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,140
this letter to Ning Fei

571
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,010
at Zhengnian Villa.

572
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,700
[Ning Fei]

573
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,110
Yes.

574
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,240
What right do you have to keep me here?

575
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,030
My brother is still alive.

576
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,430
Of course, I need to return to Susha
to find him!

577
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,390
Just think about

578
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,030
all the things you've done for Xia Jingshi

579
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,550
that angered your brother.

580
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,150
You think he wants to see you?

581
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,850
Get out of my way!

582
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,250
Feng Xiyang!

583
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,720
Remember this:

584
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,400
you're mine now!

585
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,120
Whether you stay or go...

586
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,350
depends entirely on my mood.

587
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,960
Are you alright?

588
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:01,890
Someone, come!

589
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,070
Xiyang?

590
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,460
Xiyang!

591
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,030
Why would she suddenly faint like that?

592
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,550
Her Highness is pregnant.

593
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,350
Your Majesty,

594
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,750
Princess Xiyang is with child.

595
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,570
What did you say?

596
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,920
She's definitely pregnant.

597
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,550
If you dare make a wrong diagnosis,

598
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,680
I'll have your head.

599
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,310
I wouldn't dare give a false diagnosis.

600
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,350
Her Highness is indeed pregnant.

601
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,880
Get out.

602
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,720
Yes.

603
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,740
All of you, out.

604
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,900
You're pregnant.

605
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,030
Whose child is it?

606
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,310
You and Xia Jingshi

607
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,330
were married

608
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,780
but never consummated the marriage.

609
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,720
If this child isn't mine,

610
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,980
then whose could it be?

611
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,300
That's wonderful.

612
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,840
Feng Xiyang,

613
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,090
I'll marry you.

614
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,710
I'll make you my Empress!

615
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,900
I, Feng Xiyang, would sooner die

616
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,160
than become your Empress!

617
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,860
Your Highness, you've returned.

618
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,700
You must be hungry.

619
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,830
Shall I have the meal brought in?

620
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,030
Your Highness, you've had

621
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,680
little appetite these past few days.

622
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,000
I've had hawthorn and apricot soup

623
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,060
prepared for you.

624
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,440
It's sweet and sour

625
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,500
and should stimulate your appetite.

626
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,690
What are you talking about?

627
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,580
Your Highness,

628
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,210
are...

629
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,550
are you all right?

630
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,030
This maid will go see

631
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,350
if lunch is ready.

632
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,840
This subject

633
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,550
pays respects to Your Majesty.

634
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,010
Speak plainly. What is it?

635
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,120
Your Majesty,

636
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,850
an urgent message from Susha—

637
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,960
Feng Suige is already

638
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,560
on his way to Shengjing City.

639
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,520
What is he coming for?

640
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,469
Your Majesty,

641
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,750
the message only says

642
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,300
Feng Suige wishes to
meet with Your Majesty.

643
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,570
He's coming to take Feng Xiyang back.

644
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,550
I won't see him.

645
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,070
Find some excuse to turn him away.

646
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

647
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,630
Wait.

648
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,250
The news of Feng Suige coming to Shengjing

649
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:12,670
must never

650
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,000
reach Princess Xiyang.

651
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,030
If you leak a word of this,

652
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,500
I'll not spare you.

653
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,440
Yes.

654
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,360
I understand, Your Highness.

655
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,020
I understand, Your Highness.

656
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:35,290
[Princess Xiyang is secretly pregnant
with the Emperor's child.]

657
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,890
Your Highness,

658
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
our undercover guards

659
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,330
have secretly arrived in Shengjing City.

660
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,490
Your Highness?

661
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,210
She's pregnant with Xia Jingyan's child.

662
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,000
You mean Princess Xiyang?

663
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,360
If she had listened to me back then

664
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,040
and returned to Susha,

665
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,110
none of this

666
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,310
would have happened.

667
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,760
It's too late now.

668
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,280
She brought this upon herself.

669
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,370
She has only herself to blame.

670
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,550
At midnight on Xia Jingyan's birthday,

671
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,800
he'll go to the ancestral home

672
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,150
to pay respects to the ancestors.

673
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,880
He usually

674
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,610
arrives there a day in advance.

675
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,320
And this time, he'll certainly
bring Feng Xiyang

676
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,150
with him.

677
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,220
At that time,

678
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
the Empress Dowager will help us

679
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,490
remove the Royal Guards from his side.

680
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,630
Xia Jingyan and Feng Xiyang...

681
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,150
must both die.

682
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,810
[Shengjing City, Jinxiu Kingdom]

683
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,480
You're quite familiar with this place.

684
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,940
Have you been here before?

685
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,880
I came here once

686
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,150
when I had business outside the border.

687
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,370
After all these years,

688
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,700
it hasn't changed much.

689
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,660
I didn't expect it to be so lively.

690
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,920
Because the day after tomorrow

691
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,650
is Jinxiu's Qianqiu Festival—

692
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,440

864
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,740
♪ Don't cry, don't cry ♪

865
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,300
I'll die right here today,

866
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,400
along with the child in my womb!

867
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,670
You're threatening me again!

868
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,920
I'm just reminding you!
