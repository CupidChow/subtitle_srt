[Episode 38]

3
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,520
Did you kill her?

4
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,509
Mother,

5
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,590
we've

6
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,800
killed her.

7
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,039
Good.

8
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,970
Very good.

9
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,440
Prince of Zhennan,

10
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,300
you really didn't disappoint me.

11
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,039
I've never forgotten

12
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,950
your kindness,

13
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,510
and I dare not slack

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,730
in meeting your expectations.

15
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,230
It is my honor

16
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,060
to help ease your burdens.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,860
Good boy.

18
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
I know your filial devotion.

19
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:17,590
Hurry.

20
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,940
Rise and speak.

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,740
Thank you, Mother.

22
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,590
Bring it in.

23
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,700
Mother,

24
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
I have brought her

25
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,470
back to you.

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,870
You wretch,

27
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,190
your miserable state today

28
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,670
is what you get for opposing me.

29
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,000
Open it.

30
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,320
Let me see.

31
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,960
Jingyan!

32
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,120
Jingyan!

33
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,430
Jingyan!

34
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,820
Jingyan!

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,800
What's wrong with you, Jingyan?

36
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,300
Wake up.

37
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,360
Jingyan, wake up!

38
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,800
Jingyan!

39
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,680
Jingyan!

40
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,430
Mother,

41
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,490
are you satisfied

42
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,130
with my filial devotion?

43
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,520
His Majesty...

44
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,650
His Majesty is dead!

45
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,400
His Majesty has passed away!

46
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,640
Jingyan!

47
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,610
It was you.

48
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,720
Xia Jingshi!

49
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,430
Kill him.

50
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,110
Kill him!

51
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,600
Kill!

52
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,240
You...

53
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,190
You're committing treason!

54
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,220
You dog!

55
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,130
I have long wanted you dead!

56
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,440
Heaven shows no mercy,

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,000
and darkness draws near.

58
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,360
Only you

59
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,040
can save all living beings.

60
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,390
You...

61
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,270
You...

62
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,270
Protect me!

63
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,360
Guards!

64
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,840
Protect me!

65
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,630
The Jinxiu Royal Guards' Whistling Flare?

66
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,190
They only use it

67
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,680
in dire emergencies.

68
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,560
It must be Xia Jingshi
causing trouble over there.

69
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,110
Let's go.

70
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,040
Protect me.

71
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,310
Guards!

72
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,830
Guards!

73
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,750
Protect me!

74
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,480
Guards!

75
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,260
Mother,

76
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,120
isn't it enough that I'm here

77
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,980
to protect you?

78
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,530
Xia Jingshi,

79
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,840
I'll kill you!

80
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,570
Why are you so angry, Mother?

81
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,480
Isn't this

82
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,580
what you want?

83
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,680
Xia Jingshi,

84
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,430
you heartless,

85
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,190
ungrateful traitor.

86
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,080
I treated you as my own,

87
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,800
yet you repaid kindness with betrayal!

88
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,000
Give me back my Jingyan.

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,060
Give me back my Jingyan!

90
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,940
You treated me as your own?

91
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,920
Would you

92
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,070
feed poison

93
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,140
to your own child?

94
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,000
Xia Jingshi, have you forgotten?

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,800
You're only alive because I give you

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,260
the antidote every month.

97
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,130
Are you insane?

98
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,690
How dare you hold a grudge against me?

99
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,630
Should I be grateful instead?

100
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,950
Do you know how long I've waited

101
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,900
for this day?

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,240
Do you know

103
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,190
how long I've waited

104
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,120
to see you crawl at my feet,

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,300
begging for mercy?

106
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,970
Cry. Scream.

107
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,830
If you don't cry or scream,

108
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,230
how can I feel satisfied?

109
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,270
Xia Jingshi, you're heartless.

110
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,730
Everyone wanted you dead,

111
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,400
but I spared your life.

112
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,750
You're insane.

113
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,040
I should've killed you long ago!

114
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,800
Otherwise,

115
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,820
my Jingyan wouldn't have died.

116
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,270
Mother,

117
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,800
that's quite unfair.

118
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,730
I once swore

119
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,350
that one day

120
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,890
I would repay kindness and avenge hatred.

121
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,830
Mother, I have never forgotten

122
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,210
your kindness.

123
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,190
Today,

124
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,190
I'm here to repay it.

125
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,000
Mother,

126
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,190
do you know

127
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,310
what I just fed you?

128
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,310
It's a poison

129
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,190
I prepared especially for you.

130
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,190
Xia Jingshi,

131
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,840
you vile, rotten bastard!

132
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,870
After taking this poison,

133
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,830
you'd better not get too agitated,

134
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,270
or your blood will surge

135
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,760
and flow faster.

136
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,190
Mother,

137
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,640
I don't want you to die too quickly.

138
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,430
What do you want?

139
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,510
What do I want?

140
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,480
Back then, when you poisoned me,

141
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,120
you didn't take my life right away.

142
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,860
So now, to show my filial piety,

143
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,750
I won't

144
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,410
take yours right away either.

145
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,240
You have 10 to 15 minutes.

146
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Within that time,

147
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,360
the poison

148
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,870
will spread through your entire body,

149
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,600
gradually

150
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,220
corroding your organs.

151
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,909
Your heart, liver, and lungs

152
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,430
will all dissolve into blood.

153
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,000
You'll feel pain

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,510
in every part of your body,

155
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,290
unable to live or die as you wish.

156
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,950
See how filial I am?

157
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,680
You tormented me for so many years,

158
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,070
but I'll torment you

159
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,030
for just 10 to 15 minutes.

160
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,700
Your Eminence!

161
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:20,990
Your Highness,

162
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,950
the Imperial Guards
have fired the Whistling Flare.

163
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,610
Their reinforcements
could arrive any moment.

164
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,200
Protect His Highness!

165
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,120
Yixiao?

166
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,870
Yixiao is here.

167
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,360
Yixiao,

168
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,120
you've come at the perfect time.

169
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,080
This is the most important

170
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
moment of my life.

171
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,320
I'm glad

172
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,570
you're here to witness it

173
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,520
and be with me.

174
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,790
How many more people

175
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,670
must die

176
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,620
for this so-called
important moment of yours?

177
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,490
No, no.

178
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,910
I think there's
a misunderstanding between us.

179
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,120
Now that my great revenge
is finally complete,

180
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,030
I can finally clear up

181
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,200
all these misunderstandings with you.

182
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,750
There's so much

183
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,910
I want to say to you.

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,930
There's no need.

185
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,090
I only have one thing to say:

186
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,560
those who commit too many evil deeds
will destroy themselves.

187
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,420
What is "evil?"

188
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,930
I rid Jinxiu

189
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,260
of a tyrannical ruler.

190
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,660
How is that evil?

191
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,220
I endured years

192
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,910
of pain and humiliation,

193
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,550
and now I've paid it

194
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,150
all back in full.

195
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,450
How is that evil?

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,910
As the eldest son
of Jinxiu's late emperor,

197
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,550
I took back

198
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,450
what was rightfully mine.

199
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,980
How is that evil?

200
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,790
Haven't you always wanted to know

201
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,970
why I was poisoned?

202
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,910
It was all thanks to her.

203
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,560
To seize my throne,

204
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,070
she poisoned me

205
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,720
and drove me out of Shengjing.

206
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,870
I hate her to the bone.

207
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,630
But every month

208
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,440
when I had to get the antidote,

209
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,670
I had to beg her

210
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,480
like a dog.

211
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,280
What for?

212
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,590
I just wanted to live.

213
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,090
I wanted to survive!

214
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,320
Yes.

215
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,260
I know

216
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,910
my hands are stained with

217
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,920
the blood of countless innocent people.

218
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,110
But I had no choice.

219
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,330
This path I've taken

220
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,630
is one I must walk through

221
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,720
mountains of corpses and seas of blood.

222
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,200
So,

223
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,800
I don't care how many people I kill.

224
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,150
Yixiao,

225
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,420
now that I've told you all this,

226
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,440
can you understand me?

227
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,990
I didn't tell you before

228
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,210
because I didn't want my suffering

229
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,900
to become your pain.

230
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,070
Your suffering

231
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,040
has become your obsession.

232
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,360
You believe that since you're in hell,

233
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,030
everyone else should

234
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,230
be dragged there too.

235
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,910
But you don't know

236
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,610
you've become a prisoner
of that obsession.

237
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,720
Do you really want

238
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,200
to make me your enemy?

239
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,120
It seems you still

240
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,750
have no intention of repenting.

241
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,950
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

242
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,480
Your Highness,

243
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:20,960
we're out of time!

244
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,480
Yixiao,

245
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,480
I don't believe you will kill me.

246
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,450
I don't believe you actually will!

247
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,360
-Yixiao...
-Your Highness, let's go!

248
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,390
Let's hurry back

249
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,920
and meet up with Feng Suige.

250
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,630
Okay.

251
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,010
Please rest assured.

252
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,720
Her wounds have been treated.

253
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,550
Her life will no longer be in danger.

254
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,930
She just needs proper rest to recover.

255
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,590
Thank you for your help.

256
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,610
See the doctor out

257
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,200
and reward him generously.

258
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,660
Yes.

259
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,210
I'll take my leave.

260
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,460
Doctor,

261
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,630
this way, please.

262
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,960
When I just woke up,

263
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,870
I heard your conversation with the doctor.

264
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,910
He said the child in my womb

265
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,120
was gone

266
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:33,870
and that

267
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,200
I'll never be able to have children again.

268
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,680
Don't think about that now.

269
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,650
Just focus on recovery.

270
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,710
Don't worry, Xiyang.

271
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,270
I will definitely tear Xia Jingshi

272
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,480
to pieces.

273
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,600
Whether Xia Jingshi lives or dies

274
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,870
no longer matters to me,

275
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,840
and not being able to have children

276
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,290
doesn't matter either.

00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,600
I couldn't keep his child.

tomorrow I'll have someone

294
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,560
send you to Zhengnian Villa.

295
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,200

you're determined to kill Xia Jingshi.

304
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,720
Promise me,

305
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,480
don't put yourself in danger.

306
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,030

I'm sorry, Xiyang.

314
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,120
I failed to protect you.

315
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,510
But don't be afraid.

316
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,330
As long as I'm here,

317
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,200
all of this will pass.

318
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,490
Your Highness,

319
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,810
Miss Yixiao and her group have returned.

320
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,400
Thank you. Thank you.

321
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,200
You helped me

322
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,300
get rid of that tyrant,

323
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,100
which has finally lifted
the hatred from my heart.

324
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,960
Do you really want

325
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,410
to make me your enemy?

326
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,390
It seems you still

327
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,010
have no intention of repenting.

328
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,450
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

329
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,120
I don't believe

330
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,580
you will actually kill me!

331
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,480
Please rise.

332
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,030
Now that the Emperor
and Empress Dowager have been executed,

333
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,080
Your Highness,
as the eldest son of the late emperor

334
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,740
and an accomplished general,

335
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,180
you are the only choice for the throne.

336
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,620
When the His Highness ascends the throne,

337
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,870
everything you've done

338
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,870
will be rewarded.

339
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,720
Your Highness,

340
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,120
what are your plans next?

341
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,600
You must have come to me
to entrust a matter to me.

342
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,460
I am at your service
even at the cost of my life.

343
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,100
Yes.

344
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,370
We will leave Shengjing immediately

345
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,840
and return to Pingling City.

346
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,670
During this time,

347
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,480
we need you to mediate in the court

348
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,410
and help us win over the ministers.

349
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,000
Shengjing is now without a leader

350
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,770
and desperately needs you
to take control of the situation.

351
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,370
You're leaving at this time?

352
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,020
Do you think

353
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,240
he will return to Pingling City?

354
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,100
It's possible.

355
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,990
The Emperor and Empress Dowager are dead.

356
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,790
Only Xia Jingshi

357
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,200
is qualified to succeed the throne.

358
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,790
Once the news of their deaths

359
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,480
spreads,

360
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,800
Shengjing City
will surely fall into chaos.

361
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,870
In the capital region,

362
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,390
there are still

363
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,770
some ministers who hold military power.

364
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,220
They will surely harbor
treasonous thoughts.

365
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,270
When he returns with his army

366
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,440
to Shengjing,

367
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,510
no one will be able

368
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,440
to stop him from taking the throne.

369
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,810
Then I will stay in Shengjing City

370
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,210
waiting for your return.

371
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:05,790
No.

372
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,530
I'm not leaving.

373
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,670
Your Highness,

374
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,750
according to our plan,

375
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,680
we should return to Pingling City

376
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,750
after we succeed.

377
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,569
Mr. Wang, you may leave us now.

378
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,720
Yes.

379
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,589
I'm staying here.

380
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,920
I have

381
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,720
something more important to do.

382
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,410
I never imagined

383
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,829
Xia Jingshi held

384
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:32,359
so much hatred in his heart,

385
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
and that he's carried it
for so many years.

386
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,440
He is even more patient and enduring

387
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,440
than I thought.

388
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,260
Whatever he wants to do,

389
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,310
he will do it at any cost.

390
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,440
Even if he kills

391
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,620
all the Imperial Guards from before,

392
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,560
what about us?

393
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,310
Isn't he afraid

394
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,070
we'll expose

395
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,850
his regicide?

396
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:50,390
Exactly.

397
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,480
Who would believe us?

398
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,730
With Weiran's tactics,

399
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,090
he would surely label Yixiao and me

400
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:54,640
as

401
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,830
traitorous generals who defected to Susha.

402
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,050
You are from Susha.

403
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,030
We, the people of Jinxiu,

404
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,030
naturally trust the Prince of Zhennan
who protects our land

405
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,830
more than you.

406
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,920
Xia Jingshi won't leave.

407
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,460
As you just said,

408
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,880
whatever he wants to do,

409
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,440
he will do it at any cost.

410
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,560
What he wants most right now

411
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,940
is probably to kill me.

412
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,530
As long as I'm still here,

413
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,380
he won't leave.

414
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:19,720
Your Highness, how could you

415
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,320
stay just to kill Feng Suige?

416
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,190
He destroyed my Yixiao.

417
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,960
I will tear him to pieces.

418
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,250
Your Highness!

419
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,480
The look Yixiao gave me today

420
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,920
was familiar.

421
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,100
That's how she looks at enemies.

422
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,480
Yixiao and I

423
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,200
have faced death together countless times

424
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,960
and trusted each other

425
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,890
with our backs on the battlefield.

426
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,200
Whenever someone hurt me,

427
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,680
Yixiao would give them

428
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,530
a hateful stare.

429
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,160
But today,

430
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,030
I was the one she hated.

431
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,890
Your Highness,

432
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,880
Yixiao has already

433
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,190
become our enemy.

434
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:53,920
No.

435
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,110
Yixiao has never

436
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,240
been my enemy.

437
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,540
I could have won Yixiao back.

438
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,440
I could have waited

439
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,970
until my plan succeeded

440
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,400
and then told her

441
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,350
why I did everything.

442
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,880
I could have

443
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,030
earned her forgiveness

444
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,630
and had her return to my side.

445
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,830
But Feng Suige...

446
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,050
Feng Suige changed her.

447
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,760
If it weren't for Feng Suige...

448
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,010
Without Feng Suige,

449
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,720
Yixiao wouldn't

450
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,020
be like this now.

451
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,400
Now that my great revenge is complete,

452
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,160
I could have

453
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,000
taken back everything that was mine—

454
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
the throne,
the realm, my dignity, my freedom.

455
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,480
But I will never

456
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,640
get Yixiao back.

457
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,300
Yixiao never belonged to anyone.

458
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,260
She belongs to me!

459
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,160
If not for Feng Suige,

460
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,750
no matter what happened

461
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,640
between us,

462
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,240
she would never have left me.

463
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Feng Suige...

464
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,830
I will kill Feng Suige

465
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,880
and win Yixiao back.

466
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Otherwise, what kind of victor am I?

467
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,060
Have you forgotten

468
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,960
how much hardship we've endured,

469
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,550
how much humiliation we've suffered,

470
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,350
and how much blood we've shed

471
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,620
to get here?

472
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,650
I'm begging you,

473
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,160
return to Pingling City

474
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,700
and bring the Zhennan Army back
to reclaim the throne.

475
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,440
We're only one step away from success!

476
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,480
You can wait
until you've secured the throne

477
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,160
before killing Feng Suige.

478
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,570
I will not leave this place either.

479
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,810
He wants to kill me.

480
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,270
And who said I don't want to kill him?

481
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,510
This is my best opportunity.

482
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,030
Once Feng Suige returns to Susha...

483
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,200
Once Xia Jingshi returns to Pingling,

484
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,400
who knows...

485
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,680
When we'll have another chance
to kill him.

486
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,030
But I can't wait even one day.

487
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,690
Your Highness,

488
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,810
please reconsider it.

489
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,880
Weiran,

490
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,560
I've made up my mind.

491
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,530
Go back by yourself.

492
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,050
Go back to Pingling.

493
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,680
If I lose to Feng Suige,

494
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,820
the Zhennan Army will be yours.

495
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,860
I trust you.

496
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,350
With your abilities...

497
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,680
I'm not going anywhere.

498
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,910
Do you think I follow you

499
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,980
for wealth and glory?

500
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,160
Only I know

501
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,620
what you've been through.

502
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,510
Only I

503
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,920
have devoted myself wholeheartedly

504
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,050
to helping you reclaim everything.

505
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,160
I've given up

506
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,400
my two best brothers

507
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,790
and sworn to serve you to the death.

508
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,320
If you're right, I'm right.

509
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,080
If you're wrong, I'm wrong.

510
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,790
But what am I, Xiao Weiran, after all?

511
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,120
Am I a loyal man,

512
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,660
or just blindly obedient?

513
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,750
I've already betrayed my principles.

514
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,150
I cannot be disloyal too.

515
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,540
Since you've decided to stay,

516
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,500
I will stay as well.

517
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,650
Life or death, success or failure—

518
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,110
I will bear it all with you.

519
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,720
Okay.

520
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,650
We will not fail.

that Wang Encheng,

has somehow obtained information

527
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,550
and spread the news that the Emperor

528

Now they are searching
the whole city for the culprit.

who deliberately spread the news.

to the royal ancestral residence.

537

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:44,920
So impressed!

693
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,780
I'm impressed too. Come, cheers!

694
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,630
Well, well, well. Who's back?

695
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,220
General Lu!

696
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,110
You truly deserve the title

697
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,860
of Grand Commander of our Imperial Guards.

698
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,270
You look full of energy.

699
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,560
Are you on duty tonight?

700
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,570
Then you can't drink.

701
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,550
Really?

702
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,320
Not even one cup?

703
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,990
Yun Qing.

704
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,760
He has his duties.

705
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,400
Don't make such a fuss
about it in the future.

706
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,000
Alright.

707
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,880
Indeed.

708
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,110
I'm a third-rank official

709
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,190
with important responsibilities.

710
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,070
My brother was promoted to a commander

711
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,310
in the Feng Battalion—

712
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,310
also third-rank.

713
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,190
Yes.

714
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,320
I heard about it.

715
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,550
No wonder I think

716
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,370
His Highness

717
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,710
is brilliant most of the time,
but sometimes clueless.

718
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,230
You brat,

719
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,110
how did you manage to become a commander?

720
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,820
You brat.

721
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,400
I praised you a bit
and you started showing off again,

722
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:26,960
huh?

723
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,190
I don't care if you're on duty or not.

724
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:28,800
Tonight,

725
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,000
I'd like to see who gets drunk first.

726
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,530
Let's go.

727
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,150
I quit drinking

728
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,150
after the celebration banquet

729
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,410
at the Storm Alliance.

730
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:36,800
Oh, right.

731
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,750
Save your appetite and eat more meat—

732
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,960
that's better than anything.

733
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,440
Yes.

734
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,150
Yes.

735
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:40,710
Yes.

736
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,110
Ning Fei, you're here?

737
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,070
Hurry up and join us for a drink.

738
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,710
Have a drink with us.

739
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,170
Come on!

740
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,320
Maybe next time.

741
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,630
I've just rushed back

742
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,510
from the Storm Alliance day and night

743
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,440
so as not to delay

744
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,360
what your boss and Yixiao

745
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,740
entrusted to me.

746
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,400
You

747
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,510
must be eager to reunite

748
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,510
with Young Mistress Ling.

749
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,000
See?

750
00:39:58,850 --> 00:39:59,710
I am. So what?

751
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:00,510
You

752
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,000
can just keep being jealous.

753
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,660
Look at him.

754
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,960
I have something to talk to you.

755
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,070
Have you relayed to Elder Lei

756
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,510
what His Highness asked you to?

757
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,110
Of course.

758
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,430
I told them that

759
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,880
it was the Kui Battalion of Susha

760
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,320
who hunted the Storm Alliance back then.

761
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,440
It was an order from Zhuang Shen.

762
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,770
The evidence is ironclad.

763
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,250
Right.

764
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,840
When Elder Zhang heard that Feng Suige

765
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,850
helped them take revenge,

766
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,000
she said she'd thank him in person

767
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,110
if she had the chance.

768
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,780
Really?

769
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
That's good then.

770
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,960
Then the matter with the Storm Alliance

771
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,800
is over now,

772
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,840
and the grudge of Elder Lei and the others

773
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,630
has finally been resolved.

774
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,110
I...

775
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,760
Look how eager you are.

776
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,190
Alright.

777
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,960
I'll help you pass this news

778
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,190
on to His Highness.

779
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,570
Hurry up and go now.

780
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,890
Look how eager you are.

781
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,800
Thank you.

782
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,170
Give my regards to them.

783
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:35,590
Sure.

784
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,210
Right?

785
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,920
While I've been away these days,

786
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,000
Xueying is taking care of 3 children
alone.

787
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,880
You even have children now?

788
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,510
Three?

789
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,510
Don't talk nonsense.

790
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,440
They're not our children.

791
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,710
Alright, alright. You'd better go now.

792
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,710
If you're late, you won't even be able
to enter your mansion.

793
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,230
Alright.

794
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,020
I'll be going then.

795
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,420
Go.

796
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,010
Wait...

797
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,030
Ning Fei, hold on.

798
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,400
Miss Yixiao

799
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,670
specially asked me

800
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,880
to prepare this for you.

801
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,400
Inside,

802
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,840
there's braised meat and wine,

803
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,670
and candies and preserves

804
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,110
that Nine, Fang, and Shunzi like.

805
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,000
Since you're out here,

806
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,600
don't go back empty-handed.

807
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,450
Where is Yixiao?

808
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,520
Do you even need to ask?

809
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,840
She's surely...

810
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,140
Reuniting with His Highness.

811
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,920
What are you thinking about?

812
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,510
The bustle of the world

813
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,510
and its splendor.

814
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:40,710
To you.

815
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:42,810
Why?

816
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,170
Jinxiu is in chaos,

817
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:46,670
with a weak prince ascending the throne.

818
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,280
It should have been

819
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,710
the perfect chance for you
to attack Jinxiu.

820
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,440
But you agreed

821
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,460
with Jinxiu

822
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,280
that for ten years neither side

823
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,050
would attack so the people

824
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,800
could recover.

825
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,640
I should toast to you.

826
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,520
The novel Pei wrote about you

827
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,530
is selling like hotcakes.

828
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,480
The story of the heroine Fu Yixiao

829
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,010
has spread across the land.

830
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:07,800
Who doesn't know

831
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,130
how much you sacrificed

832
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,800
for this peace?

833
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,590
Do you really not want to be emperor?

834
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:14,670
Chengyang has gone to Youqi Temple

835
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,920
to live in seclusion.

836
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,320
He wanted to return the throne to you,

837
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,130
but you refused it.

838
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,860
Things are fine as they are now.

839
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,760
I want to wait 3 years

840
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,480
until the mourning period ends

841
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,340
before deciding the succession;

842
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,960
in the meantime Xiyang
will handle state affairs.

843
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,240
Xiyang was previously

844
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,640
in complete despair.

845
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,630
Now, focusing on governance

846
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,740
and the people

847
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,920
is good for her

848
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,130
and for Susha.

849
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,670
If, after 3 years,

850
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,230
she likes it

851
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,290
and rules well,

852
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,740
I'll let her be the empress.

853
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,900
When the three-year mourning period ends,

854
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,700
♪ The world is vast and far ♪

855
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,360
I will give you

856
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,810
the grandest wedding in the world.

857
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,240
I have a gift

858
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:59,030
♪ Time is unbearable to endure ♪

859
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:58,990

860
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,100

861
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,480
♪ Lost in the wilderness ♪

862
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,440
Susha's First Prince

863
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,210
or the Regent?

864
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:05,470
