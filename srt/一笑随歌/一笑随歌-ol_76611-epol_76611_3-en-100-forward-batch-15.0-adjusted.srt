[Episode 3]

3
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,050
What do you think, Prime Minister?

4
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,120
Shouldn't I kill him?

5
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,710
Your Majesty.

6
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,590
He deserves to be executed for
attempted assassination of the First Prince.

7
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,630
I also believe that

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,910
the First Prince won’t make things up.

9
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,510
Since he has pleaded guilty,

10
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,079
I think

11
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,360
he must be involved.

12
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,820
You're making it sound so simple.

13
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,190
He is your adopted son.

14
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,280
He is just an outer disciple

15
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,750
of the Zhuang family.

16
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,360
I only took him as my adopted son

17
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,530
so that I wouldn't die alone in old age.

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,680
Alas,

19
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
an adopted son is still adopted.

20
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,490
If he really took me as his father,

21
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,680
he wouldn't have done such

22
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,320
treasonous acts behind my back!

23
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,550
Your Majesty,

24
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,910
I failed to teach my son well.

25
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,910
I deserve to die!

26
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,630
Since you said so,

27
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,190
it seems that

28
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,810
I did not kill the innocent.

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,360
It seems like Her Majesty

30
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,520

while I have also caught

34
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,540
a spy from the Battle of Pingling,

35
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,960
and can finally

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,329
answer to Your Majesty.

37
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,680
The Second Prince is here.

38

I have just finished
my coming-of-age ceremony,

Brother is back.

45
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,310
He said that he had something important
to discuss with Father,

46
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,520
so I came back early.

47
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,829
Nothing should be important enough

48
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:34,920
to disturb your coming-of-age ceremony.

49
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,070
Brother has said that

50
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,000
he will

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,600
make it up to me in the future.

52

Your Brother is a deep thinker.

You two aren't from the same womb.

85

You mustn't get too close to him.

the more you should be careful.

I'm going to practice my swordsmanship.

Must you choose the day
of your Brother's coming-of-age ceremony

How dare you!

109
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,240
I have never

110
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,120
asked you to be biased towards me.

111
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,350
But everything should be reasonable.

112
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,240
The treacherous minister
wants to harm me,

113
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,770
but yet you are not enraged.

114
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,430
I as a prince
killed a treacherous minister,

115
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,030
but Father wants to blame me.

116
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,920
Are you still making excuses
in front of me?

117
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,409
Since Father wants to blame me,

118
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,720
how about this?

119
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,390
You should just

120
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,870
stab me in the chest with an arrow

121
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,920

124
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,120

347
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,830
Wonderful!

348
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,200
Bravo!

349
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,590
Bravo! Bravo!

350
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,880
Bravo!

351
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,720
You watch out.

352
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,000
If you don't eat dinner,

353
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,800
Her Majesty will be suspicious.

354
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,120
I'll just tell her that
my stomach isn't feeling well.

355
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,850
I've even prepared what to say.

356
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,370
I can't do anything

357
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,650
in the palace.

358
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,480
If I walk too fast, Nanny will say,

359
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,410
"Princess, you should be steady."

360
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,270
If I eat too fast, Nanny will say,

361
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,960
"Princess, you should be graceful."

362
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,820
Even for my sleep, Nanny will say,

363
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,720
"Princess, you're of royal descent."

364
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,580
"You can't breathe too heavily."

365
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,350
I'm asleep.

366
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,310
How do I know

367
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,750
if my breathing is heavy?

368
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,330
Breathing heavy?

369
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,170
That means you snore.

370
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,460
Watch out.

371
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,440
What if your future consort

372
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,440
doesn't like you snoring in your sleep?

373
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:53,840
You...

374
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,270
Alright.

375
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,150
If your future consort

376
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,210
dares to bully you,

377
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,230
Tell me.

378
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,790
I'll stand up for you.

379
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,990
Has someone wronged you?

380
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,750
Tell me who bullied you.

381
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,600
I'll make them regret it.

382
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,000
Brother,

383
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,370
even you have been wronged by someone.

384
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,110
No one in the royal family

385
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,680
hasn't been wronged.

386
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,420
I really miss my childhood

387
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,900
when I was carefree every day.

388
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,590
I always felt like

389
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,440
I was the happiest

390
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,160
and luckiest person in the world.

391
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,360
But the more I grow up, the more I realize

392
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,750
everything that I received

393
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,160
has a price to be paid.

394
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,400
As a princess,

395
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,510
other than my life,

396
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,750
everything else
belongs to the royal family,

397
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,640
to Susha.

398
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,510
All of them

399
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,350
are very respectful towards me,

400
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,180
but no one

401
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,340
really cares about what I'm thinking.

402
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,510
I know.

403
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,120
This is my responsibility.

404
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,240
Being born in the royal family,

405
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,400
everyone has

406
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,970
their own responsibility.

407
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,370
But I just want to live for myself once.

408
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,400
Even if it's just once.

409
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,350
Brother,

410
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,240
you're the only one
I can have this conversation with.

411
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,300
You won't find me bothersome, do you?

412
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,240
Silly girl.

413
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,030
I'm your Brother.

414
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Even if I do I'd still have to listen.

415
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,720
Since you are my Brother.

416
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,590
You have to endure my hits.

417
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,250
No dodging!

418
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,120
No dodging!

419
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,960
It hurts.

420
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,070
Are you okay?

421
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,400
All right.

422
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,390
You're right.

423
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,270
No one in the royal family
hasn't been wronged.

424
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,070
But I fought hard during battles

425
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,750
and made great achievements

426
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,330
just to make sure

427
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,420
you don't suffer.

428
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,410
Don't worry.

429
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,720
I will remember

430
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,880
what you said.

431
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,750
All right, you may leave.

432
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,590
Yes.

433
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,000
Although He'er is an adopted son,

434
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,240
he is still a Zhuang.

435
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,340
This Feng Suige

436
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,510
is so unbridled that

437
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,290
he dare kill him in public?

438
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,410
At this point,

439
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,720
there's no point in speaking of it.

440
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,180
It's just a pity for He'er.

441
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,680
He did look

442
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,580
somewhat similar do Jingheng.

443
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,960
I didn't expect that

444
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,060
he couldn't live past thirty as well.

445
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,310
It was Chengyang's coming-of-age ceremony

446
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,000
and yet he spilled blood in court.

447
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,860
Looks like

448
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,790
he's targeting the Zhuang family soon.

449
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,680
He's no longer the kid

450
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,880
that only knows how to cry 15 years ago.

451
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,090
You shouldn't have

452
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,550
arranged Chengyang's
coming-of-age ceremony

453
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,680
of the fifth of May

454
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,200
just for a moment of satisfaction.

455
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,990
You should have listened to me

456
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,750
and gotten rid of Feng Suige early on.

457
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,830
Then something like this

458
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,070
wouldn't have happened.

459
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,920
A young prince

460
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,400
can't cause any trouble.

461
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,410
If a young prince

462
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,570
died in the palace,

463
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
His Majesty would've

464
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,440
started to suspect

465
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,550
me and you.

466
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,270
Your Highness's swordsmanship

467
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,480
has improved a lot.

468
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,350
Thanks to the sword Brother gave me.

469
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,930
If not for the years of endurance,

470
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,770
there wouldn't be Chengyang today.

471
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,880
So,

472
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,760
we can't rush it.

473
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,660
Feng Suige is the eldest son.

474
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,880
Now he's of the age to get married.

475
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,790
Once he gets married and has children,

476
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,020
it's only a matter of time before he gets his title.

477
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,720
Along with his outstanding military achievements…

478
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
So you think that

479
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,150
he's the best candidate?

480
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,680
As long as Feng Suige is alive,

481
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,740
how can Chengyang ascend the throne?

482
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,000
I am willing to obey

483
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,350
whatever you decide, Father.

484
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,150
But right now,

485
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,720
we can't wait any longer.

486
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,080
The Jinxiu marriage
proposal will arrive soon.

487
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,190
Make preparations

488
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,570
for Xiyang to marry into their court.

489
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,020
Father...

490
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,290
Father, what do you mean by this?

491
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,880
What happened before
has nothing to do with you.

492
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,940
Don't ask further.

493
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,240
May Your Majesty enjoy health and peace.

494
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,680
I'll take my leave.

495
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,580
Feng Suige,

496
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,310
you locked me up here.

497
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,990
What exactly do you want?

498
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,420
Looks like you've recovered well.

499
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,820
You've got strength now.

500
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,730
Answer me.

501
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,160
I spared your life

502
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,910
and let you stay here

503
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,200
not so you could recover

504
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,140
and then cry for my blood.

505
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,980
I told you

506
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,860
I don't remember anything.

507
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,670
Don't waste your efforts on me.

508
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,510
If you can't remember, then forget it.

509
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,830
At least you
still have your martial skills.

510
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,960
It would be a pity if you died.

511
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,240
My left hand is crippled.

512
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,030
Still enough
to throw an inkstone at me, isn't it?

513
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:37,890
That's enough.

514
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,700
I'll find someone

515
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,900
to heal that arm.

516
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,510
No need.

517

This is no charity hall.

518
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,200
I spared you

519
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,960
because I have conditions.

520
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,400
Finally getting to the point.

521
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
What conditions?

522

Serve me, and you live.

Refuse, and you die.

527

Looks to me

528
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,610
like you don't have many choices.

529
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,150
Fu Yixiao,

530
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,310
though there are

531
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,640
no weapons in this room,

532
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,960
there are plenty of sharp objects.

533
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,590
If you truly wanted to die,

534
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,110
you've had ample opportunity.

535
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,550
But instead of seeking death,

536
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,960
you stayed here waiting for me.

537
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,090
That means you've thought it through.

538
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,030
You know your only chance

539
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,390
to uncover the truth

540
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,640
is to join forces with me.

541
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,910
If you want cooperation,

542
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,110
at least prepare good wine and food.

543
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,070
Why are you so interested

544
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,200
in who wants me dead?

545
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,850
Doesn't seem

546

to concern you.

547
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440
If you won't speak honestly,

548
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,880
you're clearly not sincere.

549
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,180
My enemy colluded with Jinxiu

550
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,380
to set me up.

551
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,550
And the traitor

552
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,200
is likely the same person in Jinxiu

553
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,260
who wants you dead.

554
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,420
I need your help

555
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,160
to find a clue to his betrayal,

and kill him.

when we entered the city.

561
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,590
There are people
in Susha who want me dead.

562
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,810
People who want to eliminate me.

563
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,000
And you,

564
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,770
a decorated warrior on the battlefield,

565
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,380

Aren't we the same?

567
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,830
You and I were meant

568
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,270
to share in each other's sorrow.

569

I see now.

570
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,200
You just want to use me

571
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,100
to kill for you.

572
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,120
Why should I help you?

573
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,940
Don't call it help.

574
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,770
And don't say I'm using you.

you found the one who wants you dead,

581

you couldn't take them down alone.

582

Even if your killer

Where is my master?

692
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,310
This little girl

693
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,240
really does resemble Yixiao a bit.

694
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,330
She was taken to Yujing.

695
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,540
Stop right there!

696
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,830
Where do you think you're going?

697
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,100
Thank you for the steamed buns.

698
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,550
Stop!

699
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:02,960
Kids!

700
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,310
Kids!

701
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,400
Eleven!

702
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,200
Here.

703
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,590
Here.

704
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,940
One isn't enough.

705
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,830
Take a few more.

706
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,750
They're all for you.

707
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,070
Right.

708
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,970
One is enough.

709
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,430
Any more would be greedy.

710
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,030
Once we find our master,

711
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,960
we'll surely repay your kindness.

712
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,160
A few steamed buns,

713
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,830
not exactly a great kindness.

714
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,030
Do you know how far Yujing

715
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,900
is from here?

716
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,800
Very far.

717
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,410
One bun won't get you there.

718
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,270
Then let me escort you.

719
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:51,930
Wait for me.

720
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,720
I'll pack more buns

721
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,050
for the kids.

722
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,090
I haven't said you could leave yet.

723
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,060
Your Highness, you're delicate and fair.

724
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,930
You would make

725
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,170
a fine boy toy.

726
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,960
During the Battle of Pingling,

727
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,020
that arrow

728
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,070
should've pierced right through here.

729
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,230
If you kill me,

730
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,880
you won't survive either.

731
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,240
Kill you?

732
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,700
You've finally

733
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,900
fallen into my hands.

734
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,880
Of course

735
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,350
I must treat you properly.

736
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,070
You two, come with me.

737
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,850
The rest, go that way.

738
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,550
Yes.

739
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,150
Fifteen.

740
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,400
Sixteen.

741
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,690
How's that?

742
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,440
How do you feel?

743
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,280
Right.

744
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,110
How many did I just count?

745
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,630
Eleven.

746
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:00,790
Wasn't it?

747
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,050
Yes, 11.

748
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,400
47 minus 11…

749
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,810
Still quite a few lashes left.

750
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,690
Exactly 47 lashes,

751
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,360
no more, no less.

752
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,790
You shot me with an arrow,

753
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,190
then saved me by feeding me medicine

754
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,320
in the medical pool.

755
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,900
I gave you 47 lashes.

756
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,670
And you lashed me

757
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,840
back.

758
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,920
Now we're even.

759
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,660
And you think it ends there?

760
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,160
I repay

761
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,670
all debts.

762
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,280
Grudges and kindnesses alike,

763
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,550
in double.

764
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,280
Fu Yixiao.

765
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,760
I've tolerated you

766
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,750
because I want to cooperate.

767
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,590
Don't push your luck.

768
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,470
Enough.

769
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,930
Untie me!

770
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,190
You think I'll let you
go just because you said so?

771
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,360
When you tied me up,

772
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,800
I thought the same thing.

773
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,320
Did you let me go?

774
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,030
You dragged me all this way,

775
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,960
not just to vent,

776
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,550
but to lure someone out, didn't you?

777
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,220
Tell me,

778
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,380
who am I trying to lure out?

779
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,250
I've fought too many battles.

780
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,780
If I couldn't tell someone

781
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,840
was tailing me,

782
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,720
how would I have lived this long?

783
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,230
You're right.

784
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,650
Someone has been

785
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,960
following us

786
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,930
from Zhengnian Villa

787
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,790
all the way to Susha.

788
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,530
Let's go.

789
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:40,930
Let's go.

790
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,290
Let's go.

791
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,530
You want to use me

792
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,180
to capture them.

793
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,880
While my people

794
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,760
clash with them,

795
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,000
you reap the rewards.

796
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,400
Two gains with one move.

797
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,560
But have you considered it?

798
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,970
This is Susha.

799
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,660
My spies are everywhere.

800
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,320
Even if

801
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,300
they dared follow,

802
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,960
they wouldn't get close.

803
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,090
Your plan may fall apart.

804
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,840
But no worries.

805
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,710
I can

806
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,320
help you catch them.

807
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,390
No need.

808
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,810
You just agreed to cooperate.

809
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,360
Now you want to back out?

810
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,800
Your face,

811
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,580
half smiling,

812
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,740
half scheming.

813
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,540
Just like you,

814
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,070
part righteous, part wicked.

815
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,230
Impossible to read.

816
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,440
Is there anyone

817
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,330
in this world who truly understands you?

818
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,550
You think you can see through me?

819
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,150
Seems those around you

820
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,550
don't know you at all.

821
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:50,930
Then again,

822
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,360
someone like you

823
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,360
probably doesn't have many friends.

824
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,920
If you want to understand me that badly,

825
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,150
fine.

826
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,360
Go ahead.

827
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,240
Take a good look.

828
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,200
As long as my arrow

829
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,780
can pierce through here,

830
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,400
I don't need to understand you.

831
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,400
Agreed.

832
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,880
All we need

833
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,440
is cooperation.

834
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,480
Understanding or not, does it matter?

835
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,030
Let's place a bet.

836
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,280
Let's bet

837
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,030
that I can become a partner

838
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,280
you can truly rely on.

839
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,190
Do you dare?

840
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,030
Why wouldn't I?

841
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,640
Why didn't you act earlier?

842
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,840
His Lordship said

843
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,920
it's best if Fu Yixiao

844
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,150
dies by Feng Suige's hand.

845
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,840
If Feng Suige really wanted to kill her,

846
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,250
he would've done it at the post station.

847
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,670
Why bring her all the way to Yujing?

848
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,830
This is Susha.

849
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,920
To strike

850
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,020
under Feng Suige's watch,

851
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,450
[Time is running out.
You must get rid of Fu Yixiao.]

852
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,400
we only have one chance.

853
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,630
[Fu Yixiao is skilful.
You must plan carefully.]

854
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,550
To hit the mark,

855
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,130
we must wait patiently.

856
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,510
His Lordship also said

857
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,960
reinforcements are on their way.

858
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,520
We must not act rashly.

859
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,360
If we alert the enemy,

860
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,800
we'll lose our only shot.

861
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:06,590
You...

862
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,410
I'll cooperate.

863
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,320
But I have my conditions.

864
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:15,800
Speak.

865
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,800
First,

866
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,800
I will never do anything

867
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,000
to harm Jinxiu.

868
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,320
If you want me to betray them,

869
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,510
you'll have to kill me.

870
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,000
Agreed.

871
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,110
Second,

872
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,290
if we uncover the person behind it all,

873
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,000
I'll interrogate them myself.

874
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,710
You must not hide anything from me.

875
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,310
Of course.

876
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,360
Third,

877
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,110
I can go whenever I want.

878
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,680
You must not stop me.

879
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,410
In addition to that,

880
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,000
I'll find someone

881
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,530
to treat your injured hand,

882
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,480
so you can defend yourself.

883
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,670
It's a deal.

884
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,110
A deal.

885
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,770
We're even

886
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,030
now.

887
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,250
What are you doing?

888
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,440
Why so anxious?

889
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,280
There's still one more debt to settle.

890
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,570
♪ Take down the setting sun as my heart ♪

891
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,130
♪ Fold the heavens and earth
to make my wings ♪

892
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,400
♪ If fate shows no mercy ♪

893
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,110
♪ Then don't blame my recklessness ♪

894
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:33,320
♪ I thought this life
would drift like a solitary sail ♪

895
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,790
♪ Yet I chanced upon you
in the smoke-filled alleyway ♪

896
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,320
What kind of play is this?

897
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:47,870
Come.

898
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,030
-Turn around.
-Don't look.

899
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,540
Don't look. Don't look.

900
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:08,000
Now we're truly even.

901

[Wutong Mansion]

902
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,050
Why are you smiling?

903
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,530
I'm not.

904
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,720
You clearly smiled.

905
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,590
Did I?

906
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,280
But I saw you smile.

907
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,920
There's nothing to be happy about.

908
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,920
Why would I smile?

909
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,720
See? You're smiling again.

910
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,440
Come in.

911
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,000
[To the Marshal: Our forces retreated
from Pingling City to the eastern woods,]

912
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,510
You all think that we lost

913
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,270
[where we were ambushed by the Zhennan
Army, numbering over 1,000.]

914
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,810
the Battle of Pingling

915
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,030
because Fu Yixiao

916
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,400
shot me with an arrow.

917
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,400
But have you ever considered

918
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,280
why Jinxiu was able to immediately

919
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,800
mobilize their troops

920
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,860
and launch a massive counterattack?

921
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,920
And they attacked from both flanks,

922
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,150
surrounding us on three sides.

923
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,190
They even knew

924
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,030
our retreat route

925
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,230
perfectly.

926
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,750
At these three strategic passes,

927
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,280
Jinxiu had already planted ambushes

928
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,940
before the battle even began.

929
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,600
Your Highness, are you saying

930
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,510
Jinxiu knew from the start

931
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,570
that we would lose?

932
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,930
That's impossible.

933
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,440
If you hadn't taken that arrow,

934
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,550
we would've captured

935
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:26,920
Zhennan Pass...

936
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,360
No.

937
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,960
If we had taken Zhennan Pass,

938
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,760
our next move
would've been to march into the city.

939
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,510
The fact that Jinxiu was able to

940
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,150
mobilize all forces

941
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,150
instantly

942
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,280
proves that the city

943
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
was already heavily fortified.

944
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,280
If we had entered,

945
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,110
they only needed to close the gates,

946
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:38,840
and our entire army

947
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,630
would've been
slaughtered with no burial ground.
