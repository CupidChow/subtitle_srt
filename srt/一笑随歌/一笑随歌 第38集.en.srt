[Episode 38]

3
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,520
Did you kill her?

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,509
Mother,

5
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,590
we've

6
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,800
killed her.

7
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,039
Good.

8
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,970
Very good.

9
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,440
Prince of Zhennan,

10
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,300
you really didn't disappoint me.

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,039
I've never forgotten

12
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,950
your kindness,

13
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,510
and I dare not slack

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,730
in meeting your expectations.

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,230
It is my honor

16
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,060
to help ease your burdens.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,860
Good boy.

18
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,120
I know your filial devotion.

19
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,590
Hurry.

20
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,940
Rise and speak.

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,740
Thank you, Mother.

22
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,590
Bring it in.

23
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,700
Mother,

24
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
I have brought her

25
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,470
back to you.

26
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,870
You wretch,

27
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,190
your miserable state today

28
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,670
is what you get for opposing me.

29
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,000
Open it.

30
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,320
Let me see.

31
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,960
Jingyan!

32
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,120
Jingyan!

33
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,430
Jingyan!

34
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,820
Jingyan!

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,800
What's wrong with you, Jingyan?

36
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,300
Wake up.

37
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,360
Jingyan, wake up!

38
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,800
Jingyan!

39
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,680
Jingyan!

40
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,430
Mother,

41
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,490
are you satisfied

42
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,130
with my filial devotion?

43
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,520
His Majesty...

44
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,650
His Majesty is dead!

45
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,400
His Majesty has passed away!

46
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,640
Jingyan!

47
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,610
It was you.

48
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,720
Xia Jingshi!

49
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,430
Kill him.

50
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,110
Kill him!

51
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,600
Kill!

52
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,240
You...

53
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,190
You're committing treason!

54
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,220
You dog!

55
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,130
I have long wanted you dead!

56
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,440
Heaven shows no mercy,

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,000
and darkness draws near.

58
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,360
Only you

59
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,040
can save all living beings.

60
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,390
You...

61
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,270
You...

62
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,270
Protect me!

63
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,360
Guards!

64
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,840
Protect me!

65
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,630
The Jinxiu Royal Guards' Whistling Flare?

66
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,190
They only use it

67
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,680
in dire emergencies.

68
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,560
It must be Xia Jingshi
causing trouble over there.

69
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,110
Let's go.

70
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,040
Protect me.

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,310
Guards!

72
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,830
Guards!

73
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,750
Protect me!

74
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,480
Guards!

75
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,260
Mother,

76
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,120
isn't it enough that I'm here

77
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,980
to protect you?

78
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,530
Xia Jingshi,

79
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,840
I'll kill you!

80
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,570
Why are you so angry, Mother?

81
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,480
Isn't this

82
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,580
what you want?

83
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,680
Xia Jingshi,

84
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,430
you heartless,

85
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,190
ungrateful traitor.

86
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,080
I treated you as my own,

87
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,800
yet you repaid kindness with betrayal!

88
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,000
Give me back my Jingyan.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,060
Give me back my Jingyan!

90
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,940
You treated me as your own?

91
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,920
Would you

92
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,070
feed poison

93
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,140
to your own child?

94
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,000
Xia Jingshi, have you forgotten?

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,800
You're only alive because I give you

96
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,260
the antidote every month.

97
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,130
Are you insane?

98
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,690
How dare you hold a grudge against me?

99
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,630
Should I be grateful instead?

100
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,950
Do you know how long I've waited

101
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,900
for this day?

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,240
Do you know

103
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,190
how long I've waited

104
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,120
to see you crawl at my feet,

105
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,300
begging for mercy?

106
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,970
Cry. Scream.

107
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,830
If you don't cry or scream,

108
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,230
how can I feel satisfied?

109
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,270
Xia Jingshi, you're heartless.

110
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,730
Everyone wanted you dead,

111
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,400
but I spared your life.

112
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,750
You're insane.

113
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,040
I should've killed you long ago!

114
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,800
Otherwise,

115
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,820
my Jingyan wouldn't have died.

116
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,270
Mother,

117
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,800
that's quite unfair.

118
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,730
I once swore

119
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,350
that one day

120
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,890
I would repay kindness and avenge hatred.

121
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,830
Mother, I have never forgotten

122
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,210
your kindness.

123
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,190
Today,

124
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,190
I'm here to repay it.

125
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,000
Mother,

126
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,190
do you know

127
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,310
what I just fed you?

128
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,310
It's a poison

129
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,190
I prepared especially for you.

130
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,190
Xia Jingshi,

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,840
you vile, rotten bastard!

132
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,870
After taking this poison,

133
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,830
you'd better not get too agitated,

134
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,270
or your blood will surge

135
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,760
and flow faster.

136
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,190
Mother,

137
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,640
I don't want you to die too quickly.

138
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,430
What do you want?

139
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,510
What do I want?

140
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,480
Back then, when you poisoned me,

141
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,120
you didn't take my life right away.

142
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,860
So now, to show my filial piety,

143
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,750
I won't

144
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,410
take yours right away either.

145
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,240
You have 10 to 15 minutes.

146
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
Within that time,

147
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,360
the poison

148
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,870
will spread through your entire body,

149
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,600
gradually

150
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,220
corroding your organs.

151
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,909
Your heart, liver, and lungs

152
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,430
will all dissolve into blood.

153
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,000
You'll feel pain

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,510
in every part of your body,

155
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,290
unable to live or die as you wish.

156
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,950
See how filial I am?

157
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,680
You tormented me for so many years,

158
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,070
but I'll torment you

159
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,030
for just 10 to 15 minutes.

160
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,700
Your Eminence!

161
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,990
Your Highness,

162
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,950
the Imperial Guards
have fired the Whistling Flare.

163
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,610
Their reinforcements
could arrive any moment.

164
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,200
Protect His Highness!

165
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,120
Yixiao?

166
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,870
Yixiao is here.

167
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,360
Yixiao,

168
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,120
you've come at the perfect time.

169
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,080
This is the most important

170
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
moment of my life.

171
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,320
I'm glad

172
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,570
you're here to witness it

173
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,520
and be with me.

174
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,790
How many more people

175
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,670
must die

176
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,620
for this so-called
important moment of yours?

177
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,490
No, no.

178
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,910
I think there's
a misunderstanding between us.

179
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,120
Now that my great revenge
is finally complete,

180
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,030
I can finally clear up

181
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,200
all these misunderstandings with you.

182
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,750
There's so much

183
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,910
I want to say to you.

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,930
There's no need.

185
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,090
I only have one thing to say:

186
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,560
those who commit too many evil deeds
will destroy themselves.

187
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,420
What is "evil?"

188
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,930
I rid Jinxiu

189
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,260
of a tyrannical ruler.

190
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,660
How is that evil?

191
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,220
I endured years

192
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,910
of pain and humiliation,

193
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,550
and now I've paid it

194
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,150
all back in full.

195
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,450
How is that evil?

196
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,910
As the eldest son
of Jinxiu's late emperor,

197
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,550
I took back

198
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,450
what was rightfully mine.

199
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,980
How is that evil?

200
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,790
Haven't you always wanted to know

201
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,970
why I was poisoned?

202
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,910
It was all thanks to her.

203
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,560
To seize my throne,

204
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,070
she poisoned me

205
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,720
and drove me out of Shengjing.

206
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,870
I hate her to the bone.

207
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,630
But every month

208
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,440
when I had to get the antidote,

209
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,670
I had to beg her

210
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,480
like a dog.

211
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,280
What for?

212
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,590
I just wanted to live.

213
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,090
I wanted to survive!

214
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,320
Yes.

215
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,260
I know

216
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,910
my hands are stained with

217
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,920
the blood of countless innocent people.

218
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,110
But I had no choice.

219
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,330
This path I've taken

220
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,630
is one I must walk through

221
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,720
mountains of corpses and seas of blood.

222
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,200
So,

223
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,800
I don't care how many people I kill.

224
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,150
Yixiao,

225
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,420
now that I've told you all this,

226
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,440
can you understand me?

227
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,990
I didn't tell you before

228
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,210
because I didn't want my suffering

229
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,900
to become your pain.

230
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,070
Your suffering

231
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,040
has become your obsession.

232
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,360
You believe that since you're in hell,

233
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,030
everyone else should

234
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,230
be dragged there too.

235
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,910
But you don't know

236
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,610
you've become a prisoner
of that obsession.

237
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,720
Do you really want

238
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,200
to make me your enemy?

239
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,120
It seems you still

240
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,750
have no intention of repenting.

241
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,950
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

242
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,480
Your Highness,

243
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:15,960
we're out of time!

244
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,480
Yixiao,

245
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,480
I don't believe you will kill me.

246
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,450
I don't believe you actually will!

247
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,360
-Yixiao...
-Your Highness, let's go!

248
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,390
Let's hurry back

249
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,920
and meet up with Feng Suige.

250
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,630
Okay.

251
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,010
Please rest assured.

252
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,720
Her wounds have been treated.

253
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,550
Her life will no longer be in danger.

254
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,930
She just needs proper rest to recover.

255
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,590
Thank you for your help.

256
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,610
See the doctor out

257
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,200
and reward him generously.

258
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,660
Yes.

259
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,210
I'll take my leave.

260
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,460
Doctor,

261
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,630
this way, please.

262
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,960
When I just woke up,

263
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,870
I heard your conversation with the doctor.

264
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,910
He said the child in my womb

265
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,120
was gone

266
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:28,870
and that

267
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,200
I'll never be able to have children again.

268
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,680
Don't think about that now.

269
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,650
Just focus on recovery.

270
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,710
Don't worry, Xiyang.

271
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,270
I will definitely tear Xia Jingshi

272
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,480
to pieces.

273
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,600
Whether Xia Jingshi lives or dies

274
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,870
no longer matters to me,

275
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,840
and not being able to have children

276
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,290
doesn't matter either.

00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,600
I couldn't keep his child.

tomorrow I'll have someone

294
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,560
send you to Zhengnian Villa.

295
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,200

00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,240

you're determined to kill Xia Jingshi.

304
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:38,720
Promise me,

305
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
don't put yourself in danger.

306
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,030

I'm sorry, Xiyang.

314
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,120
I failed to protect you.

315
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,510
But don't be afraid.

316
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,330
As long as I'm here,

317
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,200
all of this will pass.

318
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,490
Your Highness,

319
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,810
Miss Yixiao and her group have returned.

320
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,400
Thank you. Thank you.

321
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,200
You helped me

322
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,300
get rid of that tyrant,

323
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,100
which has finally lifted
the hatred from my heart.

324
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,960
Do you really want

325
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,410
to make me your enemy?

326
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,390
It seems you still

327
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,010
have no intention of repenting.

328
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,450
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

329
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,120
I don't believe

330
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,580
you will actually kill me!

331
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,480
Please rise.

332
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,030
Now that the Emperor
and Empress Dowager have been executed,

333
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,080
Your Highness,
as the eldest son of the late emperor

334
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,740
and an accomplished general,

335
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,180
you are the only choice for the throne.

336
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,620
When the His Highness ascends the throne,

337
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,870
everything you've done

338
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,870
will be rewarded.

339
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,720
Your Highness,

340
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,120
what are your plans next?

341
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,600
You must have come to me
to entrust a matter to me.

342
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,460
I am at your service
even at the cost of my life.

343
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,100
Yes.

344
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,370
We will leave Shengjing immediately

345
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,840
and return to Pingling City.

346
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,670
During this time,

347
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,480
we need you to mediate in the court

348
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,410
and help us win over the ministers.

349
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,000
Shengjing is now without a leader

350
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,770
and desperately needs you
to take control of the situation.

351
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,370
You're leaving at this time?

352
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,020
Do you think

353
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,240
he will return to Pingling City?

354
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,100
It's possible.

355
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,990
The Emperor and Empress Dowager are dead.

356
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,790
Only Xia Jingshi

357
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,200
is qualified to succeed the throne.

358
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,790
Once the news of their deaths

359
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,480
spreads,

360
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,800
Shengjing City
will surely fall into chaos.

361
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,870
In the capital region,

362
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,390
there are still

363
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,770
some ministers who hold military power.

364
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,220
They will surely harbor
treasonous thoughts.

365
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,270
When he returns with his army

366
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,440
to Shengjing,

367
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,510
no one will be able

368
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,440
to stop him from taking the throne.

369
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,810
Then I will stay in Shengjing City

370
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,210
waiting for your return.

371
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,790
No.

372
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,530
I'm not leaving.

373
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,670
Your Highness,

374
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,750
according to our plan,

375
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,680
we should return to Pingling City

376
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,750
after we succeed.

377
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,569
Mr. Wang, you may leave us now.

378
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,720
Yes.

379
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,589
I'm staying here.

380
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:20,920
I have

381
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,720
something more important to do.

382
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,410
I never imagined

383
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,829
Xia Jingshi held

384
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,359
so much hatred in his heart,

385
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,720
and that he's carried it
for so many years.

386
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,440
He is even more patient and enduring

387
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
than I thought.

388
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,260
Whatever he wants to do,

389
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,310
he will do it at any cost.

390
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,440
Even if he kills

391
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,620
all the Imperial Guards from before,

392
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,560
what about us?

393
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,310
Isn't he afraid

394
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,070
we'll expose

395
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,850
his regicide?

396
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,390
Exactly.

397
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,480
Who would believe us?

398
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,730
With Weiran's tactics,

399
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,090
he would surely label Yixiao and me

400
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:49,640
as

401
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,830
traitorous generals who defected to Susha.

402
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,050
You are from Susha.

403
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,030
We, the people of Jinxiu,

404
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,030
naturally trust the Prince of Zhennan
who protects our land

405
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,830
more than you.

406
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,920
Xia Jingshi won't leave.

407
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,460
As you just said,

408
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,880
whatever he wants to do,

409
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,440
he will do it at any cost.

410
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,560
What he wants most right now

411
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,940
is probably to kill me.

412
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,530
As long as I'm still here,

413
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,380
he won't leave.

414
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:14,720
Your Highness, how could you

415
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,320
stay just to kill Feng Suige?

416
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,190
He destroyed my Yixiao.

417
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,960
I will tear him to pieces.

418
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,250
Your Highness!

419
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,480
The look Yixiao gave me today

420
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,920
was familiar.

421
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,100
That's how she looks at enemies.

422
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,480
Yixiao and I

423
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,200
have faced death together countless times

424
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,960
and trusted each other

425
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,890
with our backs on the battlefield.

426
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,200
Whenever someone hurt me,

427
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,680
Yixiao would give them

428
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,530
a hateful stare.

429
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,160
But today,

430
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,030
I was the one she hated.

431
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,890
Your Highness,

432
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,880
Yixiao has already

433
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,190
become our enemy.

434
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,920
No.

435
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,110
Yixiao has never

436
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,240
been my enemy.

437
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,540
I could have won Yixiao back.

438
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,440
I could have waited

439
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,970
until my plan succeeded

440
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,400
and then told her

441
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,350
why I did everything.

442
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,880
I could have

443
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,030
earned her forgiveness

444
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,630
and had her return to my side.

445
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,830
But Feng Suige...

446
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,050
Feng Suige changed her.

447
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,760
If it weren't for Feng Suige...

448
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,010
Without Feng Suige,

449
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,720
Yixiao wouldn't

450
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,020
be like this now.

451
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,400
Now that my great revenge is complete,

452
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,160
I could have

453
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
taken back everything that was mine—

454
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,600
the throne,
the realm, my dignity, my freedom.

455
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,480
But I will never

456
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,640
get Yixiao back.

457
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,300
Yixiao never belonged to anyone.

458
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,260
She belongs to me!

459
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,160
If not for Feng Suige,

460
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,750
no matter what happened

461
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,640
between us,

462
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,240
she would never have left me.

463
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
Feng Suige...

464
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,830
I will kill Feng Suige

465
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,880
and win Yixiao back.

466
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Otherwise, what kind of victor am I?

467
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,060
Have you forgotten

468
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,960
how much hardship we've endured,

469
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,550
how much humiliation we've suffered,

470
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,350
and how much blood we've shed

471
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,620
to get here?

472
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,650
I'm begging you,

473
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,160
return to Pingling City

474
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,700
and bring the Zhennan Army back
to reclaim the throne.

475
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,440
We're only one step away from success!

476
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,480
You can wait
until you've secured the throne

477
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,160
before killing Feng Suige.

478
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,570
I will not leave this place either.

479
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,810
He wants to kill me.

480
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,270
And who said I don't want to kill him?

481
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,510
This is my best opportunity.

482
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,030
Once Feng Suige returns to Susha...

483
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,200
Once Xia Jingshi returns to Pingling,

484
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,400
who knows...

485
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,680
When we'll have another chance
to kill him.

486
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,030
But I can't wait even one day.

487
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,690
Your Highness,

488
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,810
please reconsider it.

489
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,880
Weiran,

490
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,560
I've made up my mind.

491
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,530
Go back by yourself.

492
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,050
Go back to Pingling.

493
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,680
If I lose to Feng Suige,

494
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,820
the Zhennan Army will be yours.

495
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,860
I trust you.

496
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,350
With your abilities...

497
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,680
I'm not going anywhere.

498
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,910
Do you think I follow you

499
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,980
for wealth and glory?

500
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,160
Only I know

501
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,620
what you've been through.

502
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,510
Only I

503
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,920
have devoted myself wholeheartedly

504
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,050
to helping you reclaim everything.

505
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,160
I've given up

506
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,400
my two best brothers

507
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,790
and sworn to serve you to the death.

508
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,320
If you're right, I'm right.

509
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,080
If you're wrong, I'm wrong.

510
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,790
But what am I, Xiao Weiran, after all?

511
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,120
Am I a loyal man,

512
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,660
or just blindly obedient?

513
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,750
I've already betrayed my principles.

514
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,150
I cannot be disloyal too.

515
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,540
Since you've decided to stay,

516
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,500
I will stay as well.

517
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,650
Life or death, success or failure—

518
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,110
I will bear it all with you.

519
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:49,720
Okay.

520
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,650
We will not fail.

that Wang Encheng,

has somehow obtained information

527
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,550
and spread the news that the Emperor

528

Now they are searching

to the royal ancestral residence.

00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:39,920
So impressed!

693
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,780
I'm impressed too. Come, cheers!

694
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,630
Well, well, well. Who's back?

695
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,220
General Lu!

696
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,110
You truly deserve the title

697
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,860
of Grand Commander of our Imperial Guards.

698
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,270
You look full of energy.

699
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,560
Are you on duty tonight?

700
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,570
Then you can't drink.

701
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,550
Really?

702
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,320
Not even one cup?

703
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,990
Yun Qing.

704
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,760
He has his duties.

705
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,400
Don't make such a fuss
about it in the future.

706
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,000
Alright.

707
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:04,880
Indeed.

708
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,110
I'm a third-rank official

709
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,190
with important responsibilities.

710
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,070
My brother was promoted to a commander

711
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,310
in the Feng Battalion—

712
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,310
also third-rank.

713
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,190
Yes.

714
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,320
I heard about it.

715
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,550
No wonder I think

716
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,370
His Highness

717
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,710
is brilliant most of the time,
but sometimes clueless.

718
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,230
You brat,

719
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,110
how did you manage to become a commander?

720
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,820
You brat.

721
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,400
I praised you a bit
and you started showing off again,

722
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:21,960
huh?

723
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,190
I don't care if you're on duty or not.

724
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,800
Tonight,

725
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,000
I'd like to see who gets drunk first.

726
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,530
Let's go.

727
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,150
I quit drinking

728
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,150
after the celebration banquet

729
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,410
at the Storm Alliance.

730
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:31,800
Oh, right.

731
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,750
Save your appetite and eat more meat—

732
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,960
that's better than anything.

733
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,440
Yes.

734
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,150
Yes.

735
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:35,710
Yes.

736
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,110
Ning Fei, you're here?

737
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,070
Hurry up and join us for a drink.

738
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:41,710
Have a drink with us.

739
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,170
Come on!

740
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,320
Maybe next time.

741
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,630
I've just rushed back

742
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,510
from the Storm Alliance day and night

743
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,440
so as not to delay

744
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,360
what your boss and Yixiao

745
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,740
entrusted to me.

746
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,400
You

747
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,510
must be eager to reunite

748
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,510
with Young Mistress Ling.

749
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,000
See?

750
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,710
I am. So what?

751
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:55,510
You

752
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,000
can just keep being jealous.

753
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,660
Look at him.

754
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,960
I have something to talk to you.

755
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,070
Have you relayed to Elder Lei

756
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,510
what His Highness asked you to?

757
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,110
Of course.

758
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,430
I told them that

759
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,880
it was the Kui Battalion of Susha

760
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,320
who hunted the Storm Alliance back then.

761
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,440
It was an order from Zhuang Shen.

762
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,770
The evidence is ironclad.

763
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,250
Right.

764
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,840
When Elder Zhang heard that Feng Suige

765
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,850
helped them take revenge,

766
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,000
she said she'd thank him in person

767
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,110
if she had the chance.

768
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,780
Really?

769
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
That's good then.

770
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,960
Then the matter with the Storm Alliance

771
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,800
is over now,

772
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,840
and the grudge of Elder Lei and the others

773
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,630
has finally been resolved.

774
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,110
I...

775
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,760
Look how eager you are.

776
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,190
Alright.

777
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:22,960
I'll help you pass this news

778
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,190
on to His Highness.

779
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,570
Hurry up and go now.

780
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,890
Look how eager you are.

781
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,800
Thank you.

782
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,170
Give my regards to them.

783
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,590
Sure.

784
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,210
Right?

785
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,920
While I've been away these days,

786
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,000
Xueying is taking care of 3 children
alone.

787
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,880
You even have children now?

788
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,510
Three?

789
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,510
Don't talk nonsense.

790
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,440
They're not our children.

791
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,710
Alright, alright. You'd better go now.

792
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,710
If you're late, you won't even be able
to enter your mansion.

793
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,230
Alright.

794
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,020
I'll be going then.

795
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,420
Go.

796
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,010
Wait...

797
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,030
Ning Fei, hold on.

798
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,400
Miss Yixiao

799
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,670
specially asked me

800
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,880
to prepare this for you.

801
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,400
Inside,

802
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,840
there's braised meat and wine,

803
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,670
and candies and preserves

804
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,110
that Nine, Fang, and Shunzi like.

805
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,000
Since you're out here,

806
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,600
don't go back empty-handed.

807
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,450
Where is Yixiao?

808
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,520
Do you even need to ask?

809
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,840
She's surely...

810
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,140
Reuniting with His Highness.

811
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,920
What are you thinking about?

812
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,510
The bustle of the world

813
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,510
and its splendor.

814
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,710
To you.

815
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:37,810
Why?

816
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,170
Jinxiu is in chaos,

817
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,670
with a weak prince ascending the throne.

818
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,280
It should have been

819
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,710
the perfect chance for you
to attack Jinxiu.

820
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,440
But you agreed

821
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,460
with Jinxiu

822
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,280
that for ten years neither side

823
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,050
would attack so the people

824
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,800
could recover.

825
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,640
I should toast to you.

826
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,520
The novel Pei wrote about you

827
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,530
is selling like hotcakes.

828
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,480
The story of the heroine Fu Yixiao

829
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,010
has spread across the land.

830
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:02,800
Who doesn't know

831
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,130
how much you sacrificed

832
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,800
for this peace?

833
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,590
Do you really not want to be emperor?

834
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,670
Chengyang has gone to Youqi Temple

835
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,920
to live in seclusion.

836
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,320
He wanted to return the throne to you,

837
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,130
but you refused it.

838
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,860
Things are fine as they are now.

839
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,760
I want to wait 3 years

840
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,480
until the mourning period ends

841
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,340
before deciding the succession;

842
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,960
in the meantime Xiyang
will handle state affairs.

843
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,240
Xiyang was previously

844
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,640
in complete despair.

845
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,630
Now, focusing on governance

846
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,740
and the people

847
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,920
is good for her

848
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,130
and for Susha.

849
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,670
If, after 3 years,

850
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,230
she likes it

851
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,290
and rules well,

852
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,740
I'll let her be the empress.

853
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,900
When the three-year mourning period ends,

854
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,700
♪ The world is vast and far ♪

855
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,360
I will give you

856
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,810
the grandest wedding in the world.

857
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,240
I have a gift

858
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:54,030
♪ Time is unbearable to endure ♪

859
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,990

860
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,100

861
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,480
♪ Lost in the wilderness ♪

862
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,440
Susha's First Prince

863
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,210
or the Regent?

864
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,470
