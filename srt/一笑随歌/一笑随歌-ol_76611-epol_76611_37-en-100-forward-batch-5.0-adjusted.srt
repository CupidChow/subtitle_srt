[Episode 37]

3
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,120
If you don't agree to my terms,

4
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,520
I'll die right here today

5
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,680
along with the child in my womb!

6
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,950
You're threatening me again!

7
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,280
I'm just reminding you!

8
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,759
Fine.

9
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,000
Xia Jingyan!

10
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,590
Don't.

11
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,650
Alright.

12
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,740
Put the knife down.

13
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,360
Didn't you say

14
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,870
what's between us is just a deal?

15
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,520
Then I will make

16
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,850
one final deal with you.

17
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,490
My birthday is coming soon.

18
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,320
Stay with me until my birthday is over,

19
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,910
and I will

20
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,880
give you a border pass

21
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,640
and let you all leave.

22
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,910
Is that all?

23
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,280
Good.

24
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,610
Then it's a deal.

25
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:47,590
But first of all,

26
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,450
I need to see my brother tomorrow.

27
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,030
Okay.

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,070
I'm going to visit
my ancestral residence tomorrow,

29
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,930
and I'll allow you to see him then.

30
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,750
However,

31
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,079
don't ever think about seeing your brother

32
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,960
and using that chance to flee away.

33
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,030
This is Jinxiu,

34
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,780
the city under my rule,

35
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,340
and you cannot escape.

36
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,190
Neither do I want to harm Feng Suige.

37
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,990
But if you do something foolish,

38
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,440
you know what I'm capable of.

39
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,040
Xia Jingyan made her

40
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,000
settle down

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,560
in a palace of the harem.

42
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,040
It's said...

43
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,840
It's said that Empress Dowager Jing

44
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,870
has had several fights

45
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,000
with Xia Jingyan
because of Princess Xiyang.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
As far as I can see,

47
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,280
at least Xia Jingyan is

48
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,810
on Princess Xiyang's side.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,840
She should be safe for now.

50
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,560
I'm going to kill Xia Jingshi.

51
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,470
Feng Suige,

52
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,440
you must stay calm.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,750
I was the one who handed

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,950
my sister over to him.

55
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,000
I've always known

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,030
that Xiyang wouldn't be happy
marrying him.

57
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,120
And I never expected

58
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,520
him to make Xiyang happy.

59
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,320
My sister cares for him so much.

60
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:25,120
For him, she was willing to abandon Susha

61
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,920
and betray her father and brother.

62
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,120
She even threatened to commit suicide

63
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,980
just to help him out of his misery.

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,780
But what about him?

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,560
He's ungrateful.

66
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,610
Xia Jingshi doesn't deserve
to be called human.

67
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,750
I will tear him to pieces.

68
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes,

69
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,350
Xia Jingshi deserves to die.

70
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,310
But we're in Jinxiu,

71
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,159
not Susha.

72
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,870
Also, we're here

73
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,310
to rescue Princess Xiyang

74
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,310
from her predicament,

75
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,830
not to put you in danger.

76
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,530
Calm down first.

77
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,350
We can surely figure out a way.

78
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,920
Xia Jingyan refuses to see you

79
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,560
and must have

80
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,310
kept your arrival

81
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,570
in Jinxiu under wraps.

82
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,610
But don't worry.

83
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:03,510
I've already told Pei

84
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,390
to inform Princess Xiyang

85
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,880
of your rescue plan.

86
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,160
Okay.

87
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,950
Xiyang has led a luxurious life
since childhood.

88
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,610
She's never suffered
such humiliation before.

89
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,630
No one knows her better than I do.

90
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,070
She appears gentle on the surface,

91
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,950
but she's actually quite tough inside.

92
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,510
Having endured all this,

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,400
she must be planning
to take revenge for me.

94
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,390
That's why

95
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,250
you must trust her, too.

96
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,160
If she receives the message,

97
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,920
she'll surely find a way

98
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,800
to meet with us.

99
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,980
Your Highness.

100
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,220
Your Highness,

101
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,870
the Ministry of Rites told us

102
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,430
that the Princess

103
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,600
will come to see you tomorrow

104
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,920
right at the Yunlai Inn.

105
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,120
Princess Xiyang must have

106
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,430
received our message already.

107
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,190
Anyway,

108
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,610
let's meet with Xiyang first.

109
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,830
You've waited for so long.

110
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,430
Have a little more patience

111
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,030
and wait just one more night.

112
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,920
Soon,

113
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,240
you will be able

114
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,300
to see your sister.

115
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,950
Can't believe you've been through so much.

116
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,750
But Yixiao,

117
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,940
no matter what,

118
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,940
you are still from Jinxiu.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,190
Jinxiu is your home.

120
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,870
If one day

121
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,070
Susha and Jinxiu go to war again,

122
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,310
how will you choose?

123
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,520
The former Fu Yixiao is already dead.

124
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,970
It was Feng Suige who kept me alive.

125
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,160
The old Fu Yixiao

126
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,970
risked her life for Jinxiu

127
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,210
with nothing to repent of.

128
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,080
Xiyang,

129
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,100
your brother has come to pick you up.

130
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,970
Tomorrow, I will take you home.

131
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,420
So it was all

132
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,510
my wishful thinking,

133
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,830
my one-sided love.

134
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,950
"Shi'an" is good.

135
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,000
"Shiyou" is better,

136
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,430
suitable for both princes and princesses.

137
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,750
Am I still

138
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,610
the Princess of Susha I used to be?

139
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,950
Brother,

140
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,120
am I still your younger sister?

141
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,430
Yixiao,

142
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,920
do you know

143
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,120
that I've been scheming all these years

144
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,920
just for this day?

145
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,360
Xiyang,

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
no matter how much you've suffered,

147
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,270
I will

148
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,360
settle the score for you one by one.

149
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,960
My hands are stained with blood.

150
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,070
I'm no longer who I used to be.

151
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,270
Brother,

152
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,930
I don't deserve to be your sister anymore.

153
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,840
It's just a deal.

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,430
I don't care about it either!

155
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,159
Feng Xiyang,

156
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,000
I have no concern for you at all!

157
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,790
Yixiao,

158
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,360
wait for me.

159
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,430
Wait until I finish all this,

160
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,850
and I will bring you back to my side.

161
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,780
From now on, I, Fu Yixiao,

162
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,090
will only live for myself.

163
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,310
Why don't you understand what I'm saying?

164
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,070
The inn is closed.
We're not serving any guests.

165
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,510
And do you understand me?

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,360
I told you I'm not here to book any rooms.

167
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,680
I'm looking for someone.

168
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,830
I'm looking for someone about this tall,

169
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,560
usually in red.

170
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
-Ning Fei.
-Or...

171
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,830
Yixiao.

172
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,980
Ning Fei, you're here.

173
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,090
Where are Xueying,

174
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,920
Fang, and the others?

175
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,510
How are they?

176
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,450
Are they all doing well?

177
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,650
Don't worry, Yixiao.

178
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
They're all fine.

179
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,640
By the way,

180
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,240
Xueying asked me to tell you

181
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,560
that she's tied up right now.

182
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,630
After you wrap things up,

183
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,030
you can go back to see her.

184
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,620
You scared me.

185
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,270
I'm glad they're all doing well.

186
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,480
That puts my mind at ease.

187
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,000
I was planning to settle down first,

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,480
then go to Yujing City to help you.

189
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,030
Fortunately, I received your reply

190
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,390
and learned that you'd come to Shengjing.

191
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,080
So I hurried here

192
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,030
without delay

193
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,090
to meet up with you.

194
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,530
Long time no see.

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,930
Long time no see.

196
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,030
When you meet your sister later,

197
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,200
remember not to act on impulse.

198
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,390
Talk things through calmly.

199
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,590
Don't make her worry.

200
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,250
Actually,

201
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,150
I haven't been
back to Shengjing for a while.

202
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,030
Ning Fei and I

203
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,610
will go out for a walk later.

204
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,510
You and your sister haven't

205
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,550
seen each other for a long time.

206
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,350
You must have a lot to catch up on.

207
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,820
I'll leave you two to talk.

208
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,300
Be careful when you hang out.

209
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,540
Stay safe.

210
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,930
Don't worry.

211
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,120
It's good
that Xiyang can come out to see you.

212
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,020
Make her stay,

213
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,200
and tomorrow morning,

214
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,330
we'll take her away.

215
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,440
All right.

216
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,600
Yixiao,

217
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,240
do you remember

218
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,000
when we came to Shengjing once before?

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,480
Yes.

220
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,120
His Highness sent the three of us

221
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,510
to meet someone in Shengjing.

222
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:44,910
Right.

223
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,870
Right on this street,

224
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,510
the three of us

225
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,910
feasted on a roast lamb together.

226
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,710
It was so good.

227
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,240
I wonder

228
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,160
if that restaurant is still open here.

229
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Steamed buns.

230
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,870
Xiao Weiran?

231
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,770
Let's split up and search.

232
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,260
Okay.

233
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:48,850
[Yunlai Inn]

234
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,230
[Yunlai Inn]

235
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,460
Your Highness,

236
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,080
please.

237
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:13,000
[Yunlai Inn]

238
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,980
Your Highness.

239
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,290
Your Highness,

240
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,260
the Prince is waiting for you upstairs.

241
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,790
The Emperor of Jinxiu

242
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,150
has brought a squad of soldiers with him,

243
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,550
standing guard outside.

244
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,120
Ignore them.

245
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,750
Xiyang.

246
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,440
Brother!

247
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,720
I thought I would never see you again.

248
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,870
I missed you so much.

249
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,870
I thought I was

250
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,150
left all alone

251
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,790
in this world.

252
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,320
Living that way was
more painful than dying.

253
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,660
I know.

254
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,270
I know, Xiyang.

255
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,790
It's all over now.

256
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,570
It's all behind us.

257
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,630
See? I'm standing here

258
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,090
safe and sound before you.

259
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:07,870
Xiyang.

260
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,480
I failed to well protect you.

261
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,150
No.

262
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,720
It was my fault.

263
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,840
Brother, it was my fault.

264
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,920
I was too headstrong, too foolish.

265
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,290
I didn't listen to you back then.

266
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,910
Everything that happened to me

267
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,150
was my own doing.

268
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,410
I brought it on myself.

269
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,580
This is the punishment I deserve.

270
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,020
Don't talk nonsense, Xiyang.

271
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,910
Since hearing that terrible news,

272
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,520
I've prayed to heaven every day.

273
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,390
I begged God

274
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,240
to show mercy and protect you.

275
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,800
I wished it had been me who died instead.

276
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,720
I would rather have

277
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,800
all the suffering fall upon me.

278
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,600
I don't want you

279
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,330
to go through any danger again.

280
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,910
It must've been your sincerity and piety

281
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,120
that moved God.

282
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,810
Throughout my journey,

283
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,640
I escaped danger at every turn.

284
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,310
See, I'm perfectly fine.

285
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,910
I hate myself so much.

286
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,320
I hate that I made you worry so much.

287
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,200
I hate that I was so bewitched

288
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,730
that I fell for Xia Jingshi.

289
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,960
I hate that the last time I saw you,

290
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,680
I broke your heart.

291
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,750
Brother,

292
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,390
I've made

293
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,400
too many foolish mistakes.

294
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,960
Not even my death

295
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,550
can make up for them.

296
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,960
You tried to make me see Xia Jingshi
for who he was.

297
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,550
But I turned a deaf ear.

298
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,550
I was such a fool that I thought

299
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,960
I could change him.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,390
But later I realized

301
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,870
how stupid I was.

302
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,000
But by the time I woke up,

303
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,670
it was already too late.

304
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,860
If I had come to my senses earlier,

305
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,840
I could have come back to you.

306
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,120
At least when you

307
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,750
went through all those things,

308
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,620
I could have been by your side.

309
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,750
But all I did was make you angry.

310
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,200
I've never done anything for you.

311
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Listen to me.

312
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,790
I have never blamed you.

313
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,970
When you're with me,

314
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,000
you can be willful; you can make mistakes;

315
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,730
you can do anything as you like.

316
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,080
Even if you make all hell break loose,

317
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,480
I've still got your back.

318
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,220
So let bygones

319
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,790
be bygones.

320
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,720
What matters most to me now

321
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,840
is that you can come back to me

322
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840

384
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,480
nothing else matters to me now.

385
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,750
I'm missing home.

386
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,680
I didn't even get

387
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,400
to see Father one last time.

388
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,350
I know.

389
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,030
I know it all.

390
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,960
Rest for tonight.

391
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,080
When the city gates open at dawn tomorrow,

392
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,750
I'll take you home.

393
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,750
Don't worry, Xiyang.

394
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,310
Come what may,

395
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,880
I'll always be by your side.

396
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,550
You should cherish this second chance

397
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,010
at life you've been given.

398
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,810
Why were you tailing me?

399
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,940
Xiao Weiran,

400
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,880
are you going to kill me?

401
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,750
We were like brothers.

402
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,680
Don't force my hand.

403
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,000
So there's finally a day

404
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,310
when you, Xiao Weiran,
can't bring yourself to act.

405
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,840
You're not worthy of saying

406
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,030
"brother."

407
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,860
Do we, the Three Heroes of Jinxiu,

408
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,040
have to turn against each other?

409
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,730
How dare you mention
the Three Heroes of Jinxiu?

410
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,330
Weren't you the first to draw your blade?

411
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,240
What are you doing in Shengjing City?

412
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,500
None of your business.

413
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,510
Feng Suige is also here, right?

414
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,370
I guess it's for Princess Xiyang.

415
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,110
Though I don't know

416
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,570
what you've been through,

417
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,440
we grew up together,

418
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,270
and with just one look from you,
I can tell

419
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:48,930
that you're

420
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,060
no longer the Ning Fei I once knew.

421
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,880
But I can also tell

422
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,640
that you're still

423
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,370
the same Xiao Weiran as before,

424
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,510
still stubbornly

425
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,510
following your master, the Prince.

426
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,130
You're not

427
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,110
going to talk me out of this, are you?

428
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,500
You're overthinking.

429
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,240
You're hopeless

430
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,300
and beyond saving.

431
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,410
I won't waste my breath on you.

432
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,230
Where is Xia Jingshi?

433
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,870
Tell me where Xia Jingshi is.

434
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,680
What is he plotting?

435
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,560
I know him well.

436
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,200
Enduring all this
and staying in Shengjing,

437
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,660
he must be up to something.

438
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,070
You shouldn't have

439
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,400
come to Shengjing City.

440
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,210
But since you're already here,

441
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,780
just stay out of it and don't ask around.

442
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,070
Xiao Weiran, you're implying something.

443
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,600
You're concerned about us.

444
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,530
Don't read too much into it.

445
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,680
I just want to advise you

446
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
to stop going against His Highness.

447
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,160
You've all

448
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
died once before.

449
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,040
Don't court death again.

450
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,000
So in your heart,

451
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,360
we're always your enemies.

452
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
Isn't that the truth?

453
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,070
You may leave.

454
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,590
Your encounter with us today

455
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,050
was purely a coincidence.

456
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,640
There's no old bond to reminisce about.

457
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,860
Never mind.

458
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,590
From now on,

459
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,370
we'll split up like strangers.

460
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,770
What else do you want to say?

461
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,370
It's not safe in Shengjing City.

462
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,830
Leave as soon as possible.

463
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,050
Weiran...

464
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,620
Let's go.

465
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,120
Hurry back to find Feng Suige.

466
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,580
Something big is about to happen
in Shengjing City.

467
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,110
Alright.

468
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,640
Tong,

469
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,720
go get Xiyang

470
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,800
a new pillow.

471
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,220
She prefers soft ones.

472
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,630
Also,

473
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,090
go ask Yu Qi

474
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,330
for a sachet with turmeric fragrance

475
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,750
to put under her pillow.

476
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,200
Yes.

477
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,310
Your Highness, please rest assured,

478
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,440
I'll keep it in mind.

479
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,520
You may go.

480
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,550
Brother,

481
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,270
you actually remember all these details.

482
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,960
Of course.

483
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,310
Just stay here and take it easy.

484
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,440
Don't overthink things.

485
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,300
Just rest well.

486
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,760
Seeing you

487
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,160
just puts my mind at ease.

488
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,380
And I start to feel a bit tired.

489
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,580
Then get some good rest first.

490
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,790
I'll leave you alone.

491
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,030
[Hidden Dragon Mansion]

492
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,430
[Hidden Dragon Mansion]

493
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,940
By order of the Empress Dowager,

494
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,470
withdraw all the soldiers.

495
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:53,930
Let's go.

496
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,830
I'll be in charge of security here.

497
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,230
You saw Xiao Weiran?

498
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,600
He was in a hurry,

499
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,550
definitely still working for Xia Jingshi.

500
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,310
I asked him on purpose

501
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,750
what Xia Jingshi was planning.

502
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,920
I knew he wouldn't tell me.

503
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,400
I just wanted to see his reaction.

504
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,330
When I asked him,

505
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,550
he unconsciously
avoided eye contact with me.

506
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,400
That's what he usually does when he's

507
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,460
hiding something.

508
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,400
In this case,

509
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,680
Xia Jingshi

510
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,410
is indeed planning something.

511
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,630
That's right.

512
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,590
And the Emperor of Jinxiu, Xia Jingyan,

513
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,070
takes pleasure in torturing Xia Jingshi.

514
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,250
If Xia Jingshi were

515
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,640
under his control,

517

at his birthday celebration

518
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,140
just to humiliate him.

519
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,400
Xiao Weiran should be

520
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,880

521

524

What Xia Jingshi wants most

531

is to kill Xia Jingyan.

During the Qianqiu Festival,

533

Xia Jingyan will be
away from the imperial palace,

534

that if she went to meet him,

546

she could safely leave with you,
Your Highness.

861
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,280
to all Susha spies
hiding in Shengjing.

862
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,070
Tell them to find
Fu Yixiao as soon as possible

863
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,440
and ensure her safety at all costs.

864
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,170
Understood.

865
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,190
Your Majesty,

866
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,510
the Prince of Zhennan is back.

867
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:39,960
Bring him in.

868
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,360
Yes!

869
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,150
Greetings, Mother.

870
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,300
Did you kill that guy?

871
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,150
Yes, Mother.

872
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,360
We've

873
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,360
killed that person.
