After rescuing you

175
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,970
from the death camp,

176
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,270
you were jumpy all the time

177
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,870
with unbearable headaches.

178
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,840
The army physician said

179
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,000
massaging the Baihui acupoint

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,080
on your head could help.

181
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,000
But you wouldn't allow

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,310
anyone to come near you,

183
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,910
not even the army physician,

184
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,880
except for me.

185
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,000
It seems that back then,

186
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,520
I trusted you a lot.

187
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,550
You just said

188
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,720
you rescued me

189
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,850
from the death camp.

190
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,660
What is the death camp?

191
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,120
Your experience there

192
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,870
left a mark on you for life.

193
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,690
You don't remember any of it?

194
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,510
No.

195
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,760
In Jinxiu City,

196
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,620
there was once a lesser noble.

197
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,270
He wanted to groom a force

198
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,750
that would be loyal only to him,

199
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,200
so he secretly abducted orphans

200
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,460
and sent them to the death camp,

201
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,080
forcing each of them to learn how to kill.

202
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,480
You have no parents,

203
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,960
no family, and no ties.

204
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,670
Your life

205
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,220
is worth less than an ant's.

206
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,900
From time to time,

207
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,980
they'd send in condemned prisoners.

208
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,010
Only the victors

209
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,630
got to survive.

210
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,550
I guess

211
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,480
it must be because you rescued me

212
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,840
from the death camp

213
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,080
that I only trusted you

214
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,720
back then.

215
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,350
That's right.

216
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,200
Then you served in my army

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,480
and made the military camp your home.

218
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,790
You considered Ning Fei and Weiran

219
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,720
as your family.

220
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,760
So that's how it was.

221
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,240
All those years, you and I

222
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,390
fought on the battlefield
and risked our lives.

223
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,590
I don't know how many times you saved me.

224
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,800
Do you still remember

225
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,000
when you insisted on

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,870
wearing a red battle robe
on the battlefield?

227
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,080
That's why you were called

228
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,480
the Red-Clad General.

229
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,870
I guess it was because on the battlefield,

230
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,000
one was bound to get wounded and bleed,

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
and wearing a red robe meant

232
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,720
even if I bled,

233
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,440
the enemy wouldn't notice,

234
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,790
it wouldn't hurt morale,

235
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,190
and I wouldn't look weak.

236
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,870
No.

237
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,550
You did it for me.

238
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,210
You insisted on wearing red

239
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,280
to stand out on the battlefield.

240
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,500
You wanted

241
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,020
to draw the enemy's attention

242
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,420
and take the blows for me.

243
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,560
Unfortunately,

244
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,130
I don't remember anything.

245
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,880
It's alright.

246
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,130
There's no rush.

247
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,850
We have plenty of time.

248
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,390
I'll help you remember everything—

249
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,120
everything

250
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,580
we went through together.

251
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,960
Trust me,

252
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,790
will you?

253
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,030
Okay.

254
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,080
Xia Jingshi,

255
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,450
so it was you who tried to kill me.

256
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
But why do you want me dead?

257
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,840
Your Highness.

258
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,150
Fu Yixiao

259
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
is so ungrateful.

260
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,320
Your Highness,

261
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,510
don't stoop to her level.

262
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,360
There's no need to get upset

263
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,200
with a woman
who can't tell right from wrong.

264
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,960
She doesn't remember anything,

265
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,240
but the moment she saw her old master,

266
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,980
she was desperate

267
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,240
to return to him

268
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,770
and serve in his army again.

269
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,600
She seemed smart enough before,

270
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,570
but at the critical moment,

271
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,750
she's clueless,

272
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,390
not even knowing

273
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,240
the one who wants her dead

274
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,150
is Xia Jingshi.

275
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,240
No.

276
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,790
She already knows.

277
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,800
Lu Ke.

278
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,780
No need.

279
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,640
Help me.

280
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,850
I'll go to find Xueying myself.

281
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,860
Wait…

282
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,270
What about that letter?

283
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,140
Well,

284
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,840
it's been successfully
delivered to Jinxiu.

285
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,360
By now,

286
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,560
the Emperor of Jinxiu must have read it.

287
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,660
[Yifeng Hall]

288
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,390
So,

289
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,630
the Prince of Zhennan and Xiyang

290
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,310
shot arrows together.

291
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,570
They truly seem like a loving couple.

292
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,440
Did a lot of people

293
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,840
see that?

294
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,720
Quite a few people saw it.

295
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,050
I personally heard

296
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,390
many of the commoners present

297
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,480
praising the two of them,

298
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
saying they look perfect together.

299
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,350
The people of Susha

300
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,720
have prejudices
against the Prince of Zhennan

301
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,580
that won't disappear overnight.

302
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,550
Luckily,
because of this marriage alliance,

303
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,080
His Majesty granted a general amnesty,

304
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,580
which eased

305
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
some of the resentment against him.

306
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,100
It's just a pity

307
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,170
that Fu Yixiao

308
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,250
got into the Prince of Zhennan's carriage
in the end

309
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,790
and headed back with him.

310
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,740
The Prince of Zhennan actually left

311
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,910
Princess Xiyang alone.

312
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,050
I'm afraid those with ill intentions

313
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,360
who noticed this

314
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,720
will spread rumors.

315
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,430
I'd like to see

316
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,140
which fool out there

317
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,480
dares to spread rumors and start trouble.

318
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,050
All right, go back.

319
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,790
Don't come here for the next few days

320
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,920
unless I summon you,

321
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,390
lest the Princess become suspicious.

322
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:39,920
Yes,

323
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,090
I'll take my leave.

324
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,870
I heard a rumor from the court today

325
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,790
about Fu Yixiao.

326
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,440
Your Majesty,

327
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,820
that's true.

328
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,930
The Prince of Zhennan,
under the pretext of exchanging prisoners,

329
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,080
has requested to take Fu Yixiao

330
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,960
back to Jinxiu.

331
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,240
Summon Xun Xiang to see me.

332
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,480
Yes.

333
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,370
Your Highness.

334
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,720
Yixiao.

335
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,080
I heard you're ill,

336
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,410
so I came to check on you.

337
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,000
Weiran is still

338
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,960
handling some official matters

339
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,220
and will be here later.

340
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,520
Miss Ling,

341
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,600
how is she?

342
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,870
Not good.

343
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,420
Is there anything wrong

344
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,660
with Yixiao's pulse?

345
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,240
Yixiao is fine.

346
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,750
I'll just give her something
to calm her nerves.

347
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,720
I mean,

348
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,790
Prince of Zhennan,

349
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,670
you're not looking good.

350
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,590
His Highness?

351
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,480
Stop pretending to be fine.

352
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,440
If you keep holding the blood in,

353
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,390
when the toxins hit your heart,

354
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,510
even the gods won't be able to save you.

355
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,440
What do you mean?

356
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,300
Your Highness!

357
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,750
Your Highness.

358
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,360
Your Highness!

359
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,710
Your poison is flaring up again.

360
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,860
Your Highness,

361
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,820
hang in there.

362
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,200
Reinforcements will arrive soon.

363
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,890
Hang in there.

364
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,650
Yixiao,

365
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,120
go on without me.

366
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,690
No.

367
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,550
I'm not leaving.

368
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,390
Listen to me,

369
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,700
after I die,

370
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,720
the Emperor certainly won't

371
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,730
spare any of you.

372
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,260
Take this.

373
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,150
With it, you can command
the Zhennan Army.

374
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,010
Get out of here.

375
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,680
Now.

376
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
I don't want this!

377
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,510
I'm not leaving you behind.

378
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,510
Don't worry about me.

379
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,260
Just go.

380
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,470
Go!

381
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,840
I'll live or die with you, Your Highness!

382
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,120
It's a military order!

383
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,840
Stay alive.

384
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,760
His poison has flared up.

385
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,020
What kind of poison

386
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,400
is he suffering from?

387
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,349
There's no cure for that poison.

388
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,109
Each month when the poison strikes,
he suffers greatly.

389
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,310
He must take the antidote immediately.

390
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
And the antidote?

391
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,790
Where is it?

392
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,030
The wedding procession

393
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,400
will soon arrive in Yujing.

394
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,600
The antidote will be delivered with it.

395
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,730
Don't worry.

396
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm fine.

397
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,960
Xueying,

398
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,470
can you make an antidote?

399
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,270
I can only prepare medicine

400
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,200
to ease his pain

401
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,040
and make him feel better.

402
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,230
Thank you, Miss Ling.

403
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,690
Don't just stand there.

404
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,420
Come with me.

405
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,350
Give me a hand.

406
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,880
Okay.

407
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,920
Do you really have a way

408
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,520
to ease His Highness's pain?

409
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,770
Of course.

410
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,330
I tasted hundreds of herbs
when I was 5,

411
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,480
learned diagnostics at 10,

412
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,400
and by 13, I had mastered

413
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,880
all of my father's medical skills.

414
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,410
My treatments always work.

415
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,830
How dare you doubt me?

416
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,560
I just do.

417
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,680
I...

418
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,080
Are you really that good?

419
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,590
Of course.

420
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,330
I run the entire Zhengnian Villa
on my own.

421
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
I can't do that with just empty talk.

422
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,280
That's true.

423
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,030
If the First Prince of Susha trusts you

424
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,240
to treat Yixiao,

425
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,160
you must have some skill.

426
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,160
Yixiao.

427
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,550
Don't worry.

428
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,200
I'll be fine.

429
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,480
If you have any questions,

430
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,410
go ahead and ask.

431
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,120
How did you get poisoned?

432
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,170
It's so severe.

433
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,390
You're still the same,

434
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,500
just like before.

435
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,000
When you have doubts,

436
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,130
you'll stop at nothing to get answers.

437
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,330
You can't keep anything to yourself.

438
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,960
The poison in me is a secret.

439
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,880
I remember

440
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,440
the first time you saw me

441
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,560
suffering from the poison.

442
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,110
You kept asking me why.

443
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,680
I wouldn't tell you,

444
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,000
but you just wouldn't give up

445
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,960
and kept asking.

446
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:42,880
So,

447
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,840
you're still not planning to tell me?

448
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,960
Not now.

449
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,270
One day I will tell you.

450
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,410
Is that

451
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,100
what you told me back then too?

452
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,440
Yes.

453
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,880
The truth behind my poisoning—

454
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,310
you,

455
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,790
Ning Fei, and Weiran—

456
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,190
none of you know about it.

457
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,630
Have you remembered something?

458
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,830
Bits and pieces.

459
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,030
I remember one time your poison flared up.

460
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,540
You thought you were going to die

461
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,880
and told me to leave you behind

462
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,140
and escape for my life.

463
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,160
That was the battle

464
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,620
at Shahekou two years ago.

465
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,550
We were in a hopeless situation.

466
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,720
I ordered you to leave me behind.

467
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,310
That was the first time

468
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,640
you disobeyed my order,

469
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,000
staying by my side no matter what

470
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,030
until the reinforcements arrived.

471
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,170
I never thought

472
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,920
we'd been through so many brushes

473
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,120
with death together.

474
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,400
Yixiao.

475
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,130
Don't worry.

476
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,160
I'll help you remember

477
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,760
everything you want to know.

478
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,150
Ask me anything you want to know.

479
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,070
I'll tell you.

480
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,960
From now on, with me by your side,

481
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,730
you won't get hurt again.

482
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,920
Trust me,

483
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,270
will you?

484
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,160
Of course I trust you.

485
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,170
There's a scar on my left leg.

486
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,260
I didn't even remember how I got it

487
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,480
until Ning Fei

488
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,270
told me.

489
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,040
It turns out

490
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,420
I was once ambushed and captured.

491
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,790
If you hadn't risked your life to save me,

492
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,680
my leg would have been crippled.

493
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,070
I don't remember any of that myself.

494
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,310
That's not right.

495
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,590
What Yixiao heard was

496
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,510
that she was captured

497
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,200
while trying to save His Highness.

498
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,160
Why is she turning it around

499
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,550
to say His Highness risked his life
to save her?

500
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,080
Is she testing His Highness

501
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,120
or trying to gain his trust?

502
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,170
You're still very weak.

503
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Talking less will help you recover.

504
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,190
Rest well.

505
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,750
I'll stay here

506
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,050
with Xueying for now

507
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,640
until you've recovered.

508
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,200
Sir.

509
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,030
I'm here.

510
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,200
You're an hour late.

511
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,770
There were soldiers on duty near the inn.

512
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,640
On my way here,

513
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,880
I had to be extra careful

514
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,080
not to expose myself,

515
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,550
so it took longer.

516
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,200
The inn where you're staying

517
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,270
is guarded
by the Imperial Guards' Bing Division.

518
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,720
I scheduled our meeting

519
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,790
for the time

520
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,310
when the Bing Division changes shifts.

521
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,160
Shouldn't it be easy

522
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,430
to escape their notice

523
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,440
at that time?

524
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,440
I also had to watch out

525
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,690
for Feng Suige's spies
lurking in the dark.

526
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,310
Feng Suige hasn't placed any men there.

527
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,880
How do you know that?

528
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,110
Nothing that happens in Yujing City

529
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,510
escapes me.

530
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,030
Since your master

531
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,160
arrived in Yujing,

532
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,350
he's met with the Emperor, the Empress,

533
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,610
and even the Princess.

534
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,400
Right now, he's probably
so busy arranging his marriage

535
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,240
that he's forgotten everything

536
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,930
I told you to do.

537
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,830
Rest assured.

538
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,580
We'll never go back

539
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,990
on our word.

540
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,260
Why is Fu Yixiao still alive?

541
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,440
You can't even take down one woman.

542
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,290
If you're so incompetent,

543
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,490
I'll have to do it myself.

544
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,290
And I'll have to reconsider

545
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,200
whether you're still

546
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,640
worth cooperating with.

547
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,500
With Feng Suige around,

548
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,960
killing her isn't so easy.

549
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,990
I need the right opportunity.

550
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,930
Such cowardice.

551
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,660
How can you get anything done?

552
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,070
I know you'll meet

553
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,000
Fu Yixiao again.

554
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,060
That's your chance.

555
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,670
But if I act rashly,

556
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,490
Feng Suige may learn of

557
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,070
His Highness's plans too soon.

558
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,190
Cut the crap!

559
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,940
I want Fu Yixiao dead.

560
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,070
Stop hesitating

561
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,330
and being indecisive.

562
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,920
Just follow my orders.

563
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,830
Sir, don't forget

564
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,590
this is only a partnership.

565
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,210
I don't take orders from you.

566
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,920
Don't you forget

567
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,400
where you are now.

568
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,830
Offend me,

569
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,640
and the consequences will be far worse

570
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,170
than offending Feng Suige.

571
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,130
Please give me more time.

572
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,030
I don't want to hear your excuses.

573
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,740
I only care about the results.

574
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,640
I know every move

575
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,290
each of you makes.

576
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,930
This time,

577
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,490
don't disappoint me again.

578
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,790
[Zhengnian Hall]

579
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,410
Yixiao,

580
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,240
don't worry.

581
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,110
I'll help you remember

582
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,710
everything you want to know.

583
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,340
Don't forget,

584
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,890
you're still my concubine now.

585
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,040
Don't push your luck.

586
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,810
I want Xia Jingshi to see

587
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,330
that his beloved general

588
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,390
is now mine.

589
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,480
Sister.

590
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,360
Sister,

591
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,190
what's wrong?

592
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,420
I remembered something.

593
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,600
Tell me.

594
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,990
What did you remember?

595
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,080
The one who shot me off the cliff

596
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,750
was Xia Jingshi.

597
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,360
What did you say?

598
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,870
Are you sure it was him?

599
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,830
I've wondered

600
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,380
if my memories are confused,

601
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,840
if I was imagining things.

602
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,550
But I went over every conversation

603
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,750
I've had with Xia Jingshi

604
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,790
since we met.

605
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,550
He always seemed

606
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,590
to be subtly testing

607
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,320
what exactly I had remembered.

608
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,070
Have you remembered something?

609
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,260
Ning Fei and Xiao Weiran told me

610
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,270
that the moment

611
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,870
they heard I was still alive,

612
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,290
they rushed to Yujing.

613
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,080
Don't you find that strange?

614
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,080
Isn't it because he was worried about you?

615
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,190
I hope I'm overthinking this,

616
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,680
but I feel

617
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,170
it's more than just worry.

618
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,480
I did think

619
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,110
it was someone close to you.

620
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,350
I suspected Ning Fei.

621
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,640
I suspected Xiao Weiran.

622
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,290
But never have I

623
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,620
suspected Xia Jingshi.

624
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,100
I always thought

625
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,660
he was a good man.

626
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,940
If I hadn't remembered

627
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,440
the moment before I fell off the cliff,

628
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,170
I'd also think he was a good man.

629
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,510
In some of the memories I've recovered,

630
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,160
we fought side by side

631
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,840
and looked out for each other.

632
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,480
He showed me

633
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,590
a lot of kindness.

634
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,750
But why did he do that?

635
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,550
I don't know.

636
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,480
I don't know

637
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,740
why he did that either.

638
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,480
That's why

639
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
I need to stay by Xia Jingshi's side.

640
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,420
Ever since I met him,

641
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,190
he's been guarded around me.

642
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,720
Only when he completely
lets his guard down

643
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,440
will I get the truth.

644
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,340
Your Highness.

645
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,510
It's me, Weiran.

646
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,200
Come in.

647
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,020
Your Highness.

648
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,020
I went to the inn

649
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,160
and retrieved this.

650
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,400
Have you forgotten

651
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,440
what I told you?

652
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,680
Of course not.

653
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,010
I just can't bear to see you

654
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,460
suffer from the poison.

655
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,630
You've saved up

656
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,430
these antidotes over the years.

657
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,340
Please,

658
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,500
take one this time.

659
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,900
Before my grand plan begins,

660
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,030
these antidotes must not be touched.

661
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,690
I don't want

662
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,350
to repeat myself again.

663
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,440
Understood.

664
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,560
By the way,

665
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,160
any changes

666
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,240
with the prisoner exchange
to rescue Yixiao?

667
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,830
No.

668
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,410
Susha has agreed to release Yixiao

669
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,970
and let her return with us.

670
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,590
What's wrong?

671
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,060
Your Highness,

672
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,590
don't you think

673
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,890
something's off about Yixiao?

674
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,570
When I met her that day,

675
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,550
she had no interest in catching up.

676
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,640
All she cared about
was recovering her memories.

677
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,960
I don't think she even remembers

678
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,070
the bond we once shared.

679
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,240
She only wanted

680
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,870
to extract the truth from me.

681
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,510
Don't you feel the same, Your Highness?

682
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,070
Were you

683
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,270
eavesdropping on us?

684
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,680
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

685
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,460
Put yourself in her shoes.

686
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,720
If I were Yixiao,

687
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
seeing my former

688
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,440
friends and comrades now,

689
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
I'd also want to ask

690
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,170
what happened to me in the past.

691
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,070
I believe Yixiao knows deep down

692
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,740
that she's still one of us.

693
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,310
Besides, she's now in enemy territory,

694
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,720
constantly on guard against
her mortal enemy,

695
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,400
Feng Suige.

696
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,960
She definitely sees us

697
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
as her own people.

698
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,750
But...

699
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,620
Enough.

700
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,050
I've said all I need to say.

701
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,640
I finally got some trust

702
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,790
with Yixiao.

703
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,030
I don't want

704
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,350
this hard-won trust

705
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,170
to be ruined.

706
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,960
Weiran.

707
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,310
Your caution and persistence

708
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,020
are your strengths.

709
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,480
But you don't need to suspect everything.

710
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,430
Even the wisest can make mistakes.

711
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,720
I don't think there is

712
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,250
anything off about Yixiao.

713
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,150
You're overthinking it.

714
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,370
Yes, Your Highness.

715
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,750
I'm just worried

716
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,090
she might remember

717
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,500
the truth about that day on the cliff.

718
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,430
After all…

719
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,300
Your Highness!

720
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,750
I also hope

721
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,610
she never remembers that moment.

722
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,700
Come.

723
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,440
No matter what happened in the past,

724
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,480
I don't want Yixiao

725
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,410
to suffer even the slightest harm.

726
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,890
Understood.

727
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,410
Your Highness,

728
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,400
rest early.

729
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,130
I'll take my leave.

730
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

731
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,160
Rise.

732
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,200
Get rid of someone for me
as soon as possible.

733
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,250
Who is it?

734
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,120
A girl from the Jinxiu Kingdom.

735
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,470
Her name is Fu Yixiao.

736
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,100
The female prisoner

737
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,480
brought back by the First Prince?

738
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,240
What?

739
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,910
Having second thoughts?

740
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,750
You don't dare to harm Feng Suige's woman?

741
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,650
The Xun family

742
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,480
may be only distant relatives
of Your Majesty,

743
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,530
but for years,

744
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,400
we've benefited from your grace.

745
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,570
To serve you

746
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,070
is my honor

747
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,130
and my family's blessing.

748
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,270
You have no choice but to succeed.

749
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,570
And no one shall ever know about it.

750
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

751
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,020
Prime Minister Zhuang.

752
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,880
Prime Minister Zhuang.

753
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,920
You're finally here.

754
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,250
Prime Minister Zhuang.

755
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,570
Prime Minister Zhuang.

756
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,110
We're in the heart of the capital.

757
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,460
You're the dignified Minister of Rites.

758
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,960
Stop shouting. Show some decorum.

759
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,640
The First Prince

760
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,350
proposed

761
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,790
a shocking plan.

762
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,160
He said that after the marriage alliance
is formed,

763
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,760
he wants the Prince of Zhennan
to stay in Susha.

764
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,370
Explain.

765
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,180
He wants the Prince of Zhennan
to marry into Susha

766
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,510
and be the Emperor's live-in son-in-law!

767
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,630
Your Majesty.

768
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,660
Shen Wu has already spoken to you?

769
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,030
Yes.

770
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,350
I assume you're aware of the situation.

771
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,260
Then tell me,

772
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,750
what do you think?

773
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,460
In my humble opinion,

774
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,620
forcing the Prince of Zhennan

775
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,190
to stay in Susha

776
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,480
is unwise.

777
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,150
Jinxiu proposed the marriage alliance,

778
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,580
and we agreed.

779
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,090
But neither side ever said

780
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,960
that it had to be
Jinxiu's Prince of Zhennan

781
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,750
who takes our princess away.

782
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,300
That means

783
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,280
we can propose instead

784
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,240
that the Prince of Zhennan

785
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,370
stay in Susha as a live-in son-in-law.

786
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,790
Prime Minister Zhuang,

787
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,199
what's wrong with that?

788
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,030
It's a marriage alliance
between two nations.

789
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,800
Even among the common folk,

790
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,960
it's always the bride
who moves in with the groom.

791
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,139
That's long been the custom.

792
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,530
Who set that custom?

793
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,790
Your Highness,

794
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,440
this concerns two nations.

795
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:25,280
Please think of the bigger picture.

796
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,989
Marriage is not war.

797
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,449
It isn't about victory or defeat.

798
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,630
Exactly.

799
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,429
It's precisely for the bigger picture

800
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:34,170
that I want Xia Jingshi to stay in Susha.

801
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,110
This way, we won't break
the marriage alliance

802
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,690
or ruin the peace between the two nations.

803
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,290
We gain nothing but benefit.

804
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,960
We can't do that.

805
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,100
Why not?

806
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,810
The war has only just stopped.

807
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,440
If you kept Xia Jingshi in Susha,

808
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,000
wouldn't that reignite the flames of war?

809
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,480
Without Xia Jingshi, the Zhennan Army

810
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,650
will be leaderless.

811
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,190
I don't believe the Emperor of Jinxiu

812
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,280
would dare declare war on us.

813
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,409
And even if he dares,

814
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,300
why should we be afraid?

815
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,260
Even in war, we don't kill the envoys.

816
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,290
Yet now, under the guise

817
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,190
of a marriage alliance,
you want to detain their prince.

818
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,000
Wouldn't that be going back on our word

819
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,010
and make everyone

820
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,110
despise us?

821
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,840
How is it going back on our word?

822
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,000
When the Emperor of Jinxiu
proposed the alliance,

823
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,070
did he ever say

824
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,880
we couldn't have the Prince of Zhennan

825
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,480
marry into Susha?

826
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,160
But it's against custom.

827
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,310
Which custom exactly?

828
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,070
Does Susha have any law forbidding

829
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,150
a man from being a live-in son-in-law?

830
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,030
Are you objecting

831
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,290
in Susha's interests,

832
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,030
or are you actually

833
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,920
on Jinxiu's side?

834
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,800
You…

835
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,800
Enough!

836
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,320
Your Majesty, please judge wisely.

837
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,710
I believe the First Prince

838
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,710
proposed this reckless plan
out of personal resentment.

839
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,880
Because Xia Jingshi

840
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,550
demanded to take away

841
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,230
the female general called Fu Yixiao,

842
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,400
the First Prince is deliberately

843
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,260
making things difficult for him.

844
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,840
Fu Yixiao is your prisoner.

845
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,880
Xia Jingshi wants a prisoner exchange.

846
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
What do you think?

847
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,800
Fine.

848
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,510
As long as Your Majesty decrees

849
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,360
that Xia Jingshi be held in Susha,

850
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,480
that woman

851
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,940
can be returned to Jinxiu.

852
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,930
Your Majesty, you must not!

853
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,080
I want Xia Jingshi detained,

854
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,470
yet you keep obstructing me.

855
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,890
Could it be
that keeping Xia Jingshi here

856
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,720
would ruin some scheme of yours,
Prime Minister Zhuang?

857
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,260
What nonsense is that?

858
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,190
As the Prime Minister,

859
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,070
you oppose

860
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,550
a plan that clearly benefits Susha

861
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,880
at every turn.

862
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,970
Instead of focusing on state policy,

863
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,440
you worry whether marrying into Susha

864
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,320
might damage

865
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,790
Xia Jingshi's pride.

866
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,000
You might as well resign
from your position

867
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,030
and go serve

868
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,070
as Xia Jingshi's strategist instead.

869
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,320
Your Highness targets me at every turn.

870
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,000
Is it because of that matter

871
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,970
from years ago?

872
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,150
I have said before—

873
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,960
what happened back then

874
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,280
is not

875
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,230
to be mentioned again.

876
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:56,830
Your Majesty,

877
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,380
I spoke out of turn
in the heat of the moment.

878
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,920
Please forgive me.

879
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,040
This is a serious matter

880
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,550
that requires careful consideration.

881
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,400
We need to discuss it
with the Emperor of Jinxiu.

882
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,030
Your Majesty,

883
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,920
I've already sent a letter

884
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,430
to the Emperor of Jinxiu,

885
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,570
formally raising the matter

886
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,320
of Xia Jingshi marrying into Susha.

887
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,430
Soon enough,

888
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,280
we will have

889
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,730
his reply.

890
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,480
Your Majesty…

891
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,810
Prime Minister Zhuang,

892
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,360
you may leave.

893
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

894
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,110
[Yujing City]

895
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,960
The wedding procession
of the Prince of Zhennan from Jinxiu

896
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,560
is about to arrive in Yujing!

897
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,710
[Peace]

898
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,320
The wedding procession
of the Prince of Zhennan from Jinxiu

899
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,920
is about to arrive in Yujing!

900
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,360
When did you write to Xia Jingyan?

901
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,680
Three days ago.

902
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,130
By calculation,

903
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,000
he should have read

904
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,260
the letter last night.

905
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,310
Here is the exact message I sent,

906
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,850
word for word.

907
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,840
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

908
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,480
Read it.

909
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,150
"The Prince of Zhennan is
both wise and brave,

910
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,440
a talent sent by Heaven.

911
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,510
In him, I see brilliance

912
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,800
beyond compare—

913
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,080
even Song Yu cannot surpass him,

914
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,210
nor can Zhou Gongjin rival him.

915
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,640
My father once said

916
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,260
gaining such a son-in-law

917
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,400
is better than gaining 100,000 scholars.

918
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,750
He cherishes him

919
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,380
as his own flesh and blood.

920
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,000
As for my sister Xiyang,

921
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
apple of Father's eye,

922
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,290
she once attended Father on his sickbed.

923
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,800
Her filial piety and virtue
are rare in this age.

924
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,550
Father cannot bear
to marry her off to a distant land,

925
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,030
and he treasures the brilliance
of the Prince of Zhennan too.

926
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,350
In Yujing,

927
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,150
we'll present grand estates
and fertile lands as gifts,

928
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,070
hoping the Prince of Zhennan
may remain in Susha—

929
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,000
father and daughter together,

930
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,330
brothers close, husband and wife united.

931
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,440
Your wish to strengthen bonds
between our two nations can be fulfilled.

932
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Everyone in Susha

933
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,240
admires the Prince of Zhennan.

934
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,750
We earnestly request you
to consider it

935
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,730
and graciously give your assent."

936
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,840
Not easy.

937
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,320
Not easy at all.

938
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,400
Writing such high praise
for the Prince of Zhennan—

939
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,890
you really know how to bend when needed.

940
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,670
Among all the civil officials in my court,

941
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,510
I can hardly

942
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,840
find anyone who can flatter

943
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,440
Xia Jingshi better than you.

944
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,820
Thank you for your praise.

945
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,390
How dare you!

946
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,400
Your Majesty, you should wait

947
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,860
until the Emperor
of Jinxiu's reply arrives

948
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,360
and then see whether my move

949
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,750
was bold

950
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,320
and reckless.

951
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,380
You sure can keep your cool.

952
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,660
It seems

953
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,630
you already know how Xia Jingyan

954
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,760
will handle this.

955
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,180
He will agree.

956
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,480
Actually, Xia Jingyan

957
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,110
may even fan the flames

958
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:01,460
to push Xia Jingshi
into marrying into Susha.

959
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,510
After all, whether for us

960
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,350
or for the Emperor of Jinxiu,

961
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,190
keeping the Prince of Zhennan,

962
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,630
who's backed by an army, in Susha

963
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,680
brings only benefits and no harm.

964
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,760
I bet Xia Jingyan

965
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,090
would have been pleased

966
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,840
when he read this letter.

967
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,230
The letter has been sent,

968
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,550
so there's no taking it back.

969
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,710
Xia Jingshi

970
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,030
wouldn't like

971
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,710
what the letter will bring forth,

972
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,140
but Susha

973
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,840
will benefit a lot from it.

974
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,470
Yet still, you acted on your own,

975
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,480
interfering with the major affairs
between the two nations.

976
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,010
Your Majesty once taught me

977
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,440
that the wise weigh gains and losses.

978
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,190
That letter was written

979
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,400
after I thought it through carefully

980
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,630
and analyzed the pros and cons.

981
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,630
Enough.

982
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,070
Don't fob me off

983
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,230
with those high-sounding words.

984
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,960
I'm not Prime Minister Zhuang.

985
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,680
I don't have the patience
to argue with you.

986
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,000
I did act on my own.

987
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,490
For the nation,

988
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,630
I want to understand
why Jinxiu is so eager

989
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,800
to form a marriage alliance with Susha.

990
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,460
For myself,

991
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,900
I want to see

992
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,230
how Xia Jingshi will treat Xiyang

993
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,350
after marrying her.

994
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,150
I don't expect

995
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,470
to keep him long.

996
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,150
A year or two is enough

997
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,800
to see everything clearly.

998
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,320
If this letter

999
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,360
damages

1000
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,030
the peace between our two nations,

1001
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,800
I will accept the blame.

1002
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,400
All right.

1003
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,630
You may leave.

1004
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,630
Your Majesty, you look so pleased.

1005
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,290
Has something good happened?

1006
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,180
He didn't disappoint me.

1007
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,710
Your Majesty, you mean

1008
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,920
the First Prince?

1009
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,430
[Emperor, the Prince of Zhennan is both
wise and brave, a talent sent by Heaven.]

1010
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,650
[In him, I see brilliance beyond compare—
even Song Yu cannot surpass him,]

1011
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,390
[nor can Zhou Gongjin rival him.
My father once said]

1012
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,110
[gaining such a son-in-law
is better than gaining 100,000 scholars.]

1013
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,030
[He cherishes him
as his own flesh and blood.]

1014
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:08,240
[Shengfu Hall]

1015
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:15,990
[Shengfu Hall,
the Imperial Palace of Jinxiu]

1016
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,100
[Shengfu Hall]

1017
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,940
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

1018
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,160
[Empress Dowager Jing of Jinxiu]

1019
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:38,300
You…

1020
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,480
Clear everyone out.

1021
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,840
All of them?

1022
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,910
Such disgraceful behavior

1023
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,680
must never be known outside these walls.

1024
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:55,740
[Shengfu Hall]

1025
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:50,960
Yes.

1026
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,980
Empress Dowager, please wait.

1027
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,960
His Majesty is occupied at the moment.

1028
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,760
His Majesty is in rare good spirits today.

1029
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,540
