00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
She's also a close aide

174
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,440
of Prince of Zhennan, Xia Jingshi.

175
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,510
The Three Heroes of Jinxiu

176
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,000
are her,

177
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Ning Fei, and Xiao Weiran.

178
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,320
They're held in high esteem in the army.

179
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,080
Exactly.

180
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,870
Within Zhennan Pass of Jinxiu,

181
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,240
who would dare to lay a hand on her?

182
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,960
[Prince Zhennan's Mansion
in Jinxiu Kingdom]

183
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,400
This belonged to my mother.

184
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,390
With it as my betrothal gift,
witnessed by Heaven and Earth,

185
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,840
with the mountains
and rivers as our matchmaker,

186
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,840
I vow to stay by your side till death.

187
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,270
Will you marry me

188
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,600
in the phoenix crown and red bridal dress?

189
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,670
After the Battle of Pingling,

190
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,320
once I return with military honors,

191
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,390
give it to me then.

192
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,300
I'll listen to you.

193
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,840
You all bear a blood feud.

194
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,360
You have no family, no ties.

195
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,960
Your lives

196
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,600
are worth less than dirt.

197
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,790
If you wish to survive here,

198
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,360
you must become

199
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,960
the bravest death warriors.

200
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,440
Don't be afraid.

201
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,020
It's all right now.

202
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,720
I, Fu Yixiao,

203
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,910
from this day on, join the Zhennan Army.

204
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,670
[Nan]

205
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,870
I swear loyalty
unto death to His Highness.

206
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,480
I shall tear apart those

207
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,720
who kill the people of Jinxiu,
and drink their blood.

208
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,320
I shall execute those who slay
even one soldier of the Zhennan Army

209
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,240
without mercy!

210
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,550
Kill! Kill!

211
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,440
That's not how you looked before.

212
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,050
Though there was anger,

213
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,200
resentment,

214
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,480
your eyes held
more confusion than anything else.

215
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,910
Looks like you've remembered

216
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,750
who you are.

217
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,750
You earned great merit
in the Battle of Pingling,

218
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,000
yet as a hero of Jinxiu,

219
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,390
you ended up like this.

220
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,860
What happened to you wasn't an accident.

221
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,200
Someone in Jinxiu wants you dead.

222
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,030
Who is it, and why?

223
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,670
Do you truly not remember,

224
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,910
or are you just unwilling to say?

225
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,030
Fu Yixiao,

226
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,390
tell me everything you know.

227
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,360
That's the only reason

228
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,720
I've spared your life.

229
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,910
Since you put it that way,

230
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,630
I do recall

231
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,600
something else.

232
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,720
Speak.

233
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,080
47.

234
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,630
What?

235
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,390
I'll take it back.

236
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,080
You want to die?

237
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,270
Let go of His Highness!

238
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,080
Your Highness!

239
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,940
Your Highness!

240
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,510
Kill her!

241
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,270
Avenge our fallen brothers!

242
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,030
Stop!

243
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,320
Your Highness!

244
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,390
I said keep her alive!

245
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,270
The Battle of Pingling

246
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,440
was far more complicated than you think.

247
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,840
She may be the only one

248
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,040
who can unravel the mystery behind it.

249
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,550
And that mystery

250
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,790
concerns not only her life or death,

251
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,630
but ours as well.

252
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,850
[Prince Zhennan's Mansion]

253
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,240
Prince of Zhennan,
receive the imperial decree.

254
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,150
By the mandate of Heaven,
His Majesty of Jinxiu

255
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,320
declares:

256
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,640
Out of care for the people of the world,

257
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,030
I cannot bear to see the common folk

258
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,630
suffer further from war.

259
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,360
Therefore,

260
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,120
I have decided
to end the war with Susha Kingdom

261
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,440
and establish lasting diplomatic ties.

262
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,840
I hereby bestow a marriage alliance

263
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
between Prince Zhennan
and the Princess of Susha.

264
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,360
For the sake of the state above,
and the people below,

265
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,390
this act reflects the curbing of my
paternal love and serves the greater good.

266
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,790
Thus decreed.

267
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,220
Your Highness.

268
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,630
Your Highness, you're not thinking of
defying the imperial decree, are you?

269
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,490
Your Highness.

270
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,710
I thank His Majesty for his great grace.

271
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,670
Don't waste your energy.

272
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,160
You might faint again from the pain.

273
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,760
So I gave you some decoction.

274
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,480
The numbness and weakness you feel

275
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,880
are just from the medicine.

276
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,829
You won't die.

277
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,510
What exactly do you want?

278
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,960
To dress your wounds, of course.

279
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,829
Otherwise,

280
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,569
you'll be left with scars.

281
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,680
If you want to kill me, just do it.

282
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,160
Why humiliate me?

283
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,920
I've never had a maid with me in the army.

284
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,270
So if anyone's dressing your wounds,

285
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,720
it'll have to be me.

286
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,410
Shall I blindfold myself then?

287
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,380
But if I blindfold myself,

288
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,350
how can I help you properly?

289
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,070
As a seasoned officer, Commander Fu,

290
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,480
surely you're not

291
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,560
overly bothered by propriety.

292
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,510
You might as well kill me.

293
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,880
If I were you,

294
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,200
in such a situation,

295
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,000
I wouldn't seek death so easily.

296
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,000
After all, death

297
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,310
is far too simple.

298
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,550
Heaven has given you a second chance.

299
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,310
You should treasure it.

300
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,070
Better to just kill me.

301
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,930
Don't think that by sparing me,

302
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,480
I'll feel grateful.

303
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,600
It took great resolve

304
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,750
not to kill you.

305
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,590
I didn't spare you

306
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,920
to earn your gratitude.

307
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,510
If you've got the strength,
then take a guess why.

308
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,370
There's a reward if you're right.

309
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,590
Has His Highness

310
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,440
ever personally dressed
anyone's wounds before?

311
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,260
[Yun Fang, of the Feng Battalion
in Susha Kingdom]

312
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Never.

313
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
So he never intended to kill her.

314
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,480
Then why hit her so hard?

315
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
How should I know?

316
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,320
To avenge that arrow, maybe?

317
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,190
A bit petty, don't you think?

318
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,000
How dare you judge His Highness?

319
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,200
His Highness's not usually

320
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,550
so small-minded.

321
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,550
That's what I'm curious about.

322
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,480
Wait, what are you saying exactly?

323
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,230
Do you have nothing to do?

324
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,880
Why are you eavesdropping?

325
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,720
I...

326
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,720
Feng Suige didn't die.

327
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,680
But my men

328
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,030
saw with their own eyes

329
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,790
his carriage fall off the cliff.

330
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,000
How could he be alive?

331
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,480
Feng Suige is cunning and elusive.

332
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,940
He wouldn't die so easily.

333
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,880
Even if he survived, so what?

334
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,920
He doesn't know

335
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,120
I sent the assassins.

336
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,510
Even if he suspects it,

337
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,440
without evidence,

338
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,960
what could he do to me?

339
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,920
He's Feng Suige, the Killer God.

340
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,200
When has he ever needed a reason to kill?

341
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,920
I can't sit and wait.

342
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,200
Ming, you must help me.

343
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,830
Right now,

344
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,160
you've got no choice but to strike first.

345
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,420
What do you mean, Ming?

346
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,110
Before he comes for you,

347
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,400
you go after him.

348
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,780
He lost the battle.

349
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,890
Someone has to answer for that.

350
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,790
We may not be able

351
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,160
to touch Feng Suige,

352
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,510
but his officers,

353
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,720
his Feng Battalion,

354
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,680
must pay for the defeat.

355
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,790
In the Battle of Pingling,

356
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,550
they'd already broken
through Zhennan Pass,

357
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,480
yet they returned in utter defeat.

358
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,000
His Majesty won't let it go,

359
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and the court won't let it go either.

360
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,610
Someone must be held accountable.

361
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,380
There must be a scapegoat.

362
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,920
As long as members of the Feng Battalion

363
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,350
fall into my hands,

364
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,780
guilty or not, I can make them guilty.

365
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,460
If he wants to save his men,

366
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,320
he'll have no choice
but to back down. Then...

367
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,050
The crisis is resolved.

368
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,070
Brilliant, Ming!

369
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,310
I'll make him beg me

370
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,210
on his knees.

371
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:05,030
[Post Station]

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,860
Your Highness,

373
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,370
what are your plans

374
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,590
for Fu Yixiao?

375
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,680
We set out tomorrow.

376

She's coming with us to the capital.

377

Your Highness,

378
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,440
we're not returning to Qingye Camp?

379
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,680
His Majesty hasn't summoned you.

380
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,270
There's no need to rush back.

381
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,750
I just think

382
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,920
if we go back now,

383
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,640
some people will surely

384
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,510
make a big fuss

385
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,920
about the Battle of Pingling.

386
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,480
This...

387
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,270
You forgot what day

388
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,550
the fifth is, didn't you?

389
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,640
Still so careless.

390
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,160
I... I've been so busy

391
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,880
that I lost track of things.

Quickly compile
the list of fallen soldiers

393

from the Battle of Pingling.

394
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,830
Our brothers died for the nation,

395

wrapped in horsehide.

396

We must not
let their families feel abandoned.

Rest assured, Your Highness.

404
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,450

If I were you,

407

I wouldn't act rashly.

408
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,960
You've lost your memory
and you're severely injured.

409

You're no better than a cripple.

410

If you resist,

411
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,600
you'll only hurt yourself.

412
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,790
I didn't spare you out of kindness.

413
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,190
I simply hope you'll surrender willingly.

414
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,790
Enough nonsense.

415
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,480
I wasn't the one who shot you

416
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,340
off that cliff.

417
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,550
Nor did I send anyone

418
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,350
to kill you.

419
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,920
Though you and I
come from different nations,

420
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,880
and our hatred runs deep as the sea,

421
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,550
right now, there is someone

422
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,610
who wants you dead even more than I do.

423
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,110
That you ended up in my hands

424
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,790
may be the will of Heaven.

I hope you'll
turn back before it's too late.

426

But if you remain stubborn

427
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,240
and seek death with all your heart,

Next, the leather cap is bestowed.

no need for formalities.

Until the truth is uncovered,

491

no one may enter the city.

492

What did you say?

493

In the Battle of Pingling,

494
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,830
Susha was on the verge of victory,

495
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,000
but suddenly suffered
a strange and total defeat.

496
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,400
The First Prince was even gravely wounded.

497
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,550
Since the age

498
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,240

499
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,590
he's never lost a battle.

He's Susha's Killer God.

501

This sudden turn from victory to defeat

502
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,980
is highly suspicious.

503
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,640
We cannot help but suspect

504
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,240
there is a traitor

505
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,550

506
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,730
How dare you!

507
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,480
It seems

508

that you, the First Prince of Susha,

509
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,080
aren't faring too well.

510

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,160
Arrest the members of the Feng Battalion.

513
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,920
Yes!

514
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,830
Who dares?

515
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
By order of the Prime Minister,

516
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,310
I am here to escort the Feng Battalion

517
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,770
to the Ministry of Justice
for questioning.

518
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,200
Mr. Ma.

519
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,700
It's the First Prince.

520
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,220
Understood. Go ahead.

521
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,720
Your Majesty,

522
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,960
the First Prince and the Feng Battalion

523
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,020
have been stopped.

524
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,030
If he can't even protect

525
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,360
his own Feng Battalion,

526
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,960
he'll be at the mercy
of others once he returns.

527
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,720
Let it be.

528
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,640
The Prime Minister's order

529
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,480
is backed by the Empress's edict,

530
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,610
and carries the intent of His Majesty.

531
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,350
What now?

532
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,580
Does the First Prince
intend to defy a royal decree?

533
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,400
Watch your words.

534
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,230
His Highness will surely

535
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,040
explain himself to His Majesty.

536
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,790
Move!

537
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,310
You're just a lieutenant.

538
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,290
How dare you block my path?

539
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,590
If the First Prince won't hand them over,

540
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,320
then he's defying the Emperor.

541
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,920
I am Deputy Commander
of the Feng Battalion.

542
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,050
I know every person in this battalion.

543
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,550
Let me go alone

544
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,080
to answer the questioning.

545
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,440
You're out of your mind.

546
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,350
It's all right.

547
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,200
I'd like to hear

548
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,750
what they want to ask.

549
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,510
Ask questions?

550
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,750
And after the questioning, will my men

551
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,010
from the Feng Battalion
be able to leave?

552
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,450
Commander Yun,

553
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
this is too risky.

554
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,610
Let me go in your place!

555
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,640
Let me go! Let me go!

556
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,830
Let me go!

557
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,780
I'll go! I'll go! Please let me go!

558
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,750
Please let me go!

559
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,310
Let me go! Let me go!

560
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,110
Everyone stop fighting.

561
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,830
Let me go!

562
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,790
I'll go.

563
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,590
Mr. Cao.

564
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,830
I joined the army at 20.

565
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,510
First, I served His Majesty.

566
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,070
Later,

567
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,400
I joined
the First Prince's Feng Battalion.

568
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,070
Within this unit,

569
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,400
I know every person's background

570
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,530
better than anyone.

571
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,750
I've fought for 30 years.

572
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,400
These old bones have

573
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,400
visited the gates of the underworld

574
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,070
more times than I can count.

575
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Going to the Ministry of Justice...

576
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,890
Is easier than a trip to the outhouse.

577
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
You young lads,

578
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,090
either full of fire,

579
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,720
or with families to care for,

580
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,920
none of you fit the part of a traitor.

581
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
Too complicated.

582
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,790
But me, I'm alone,

583
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,030
no family, no attachments.

584
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,270
Most like a spy.

585
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,350
So

586
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:39,880
I'll go.

587
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,510
Cao...

588
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,440
Feng Battalion, hear my order!

589
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,160
Yes!

590
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,980
Remove your armor.

591
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,960
Remove your armor!

592
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,550
Yes!

593
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,590
Veteran Cao Yuan

594
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,200
followed His Majesty 30 years ago

595
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,030
and led a thousand riders
to break into the Central Plains.

596
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,880
He beheaded

597
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,510
five Western scouts with his own hands.

598
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,970
In the Battle of Pingling,

599
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,750
he shielded me

600
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,680
from a fatal blow during the siege.

601
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,030
The wound on his neck,

602
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,920
if half an inch closer,

603
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,580
and his head would've rolled.

604
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,920
Call him a traitor?

605
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,230
Who would believe it?

606
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,510
I don't!

607
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,350
Hong Shan.

608
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,000
Here!

609
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,480
Six times as a vanguard

610
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,170
death warrior,

611
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,160
he personally planted the Phoenix flag

612
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,400
on enemy walls.

613
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
He was crushed by a 25-kilo boulder.

614
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,550
To this day,

615
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,680
his left ear is deaf.

616
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,000
Say he's a traitor?

617
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,830
Do you believe it?

618
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,070
I don't believe it!

619
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,160
I don't believe it!
I don't believe it!

620
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,370
I don't believe it!

621
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,770
What are you all doing?

622
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,570
Are you rebelling?

623
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,310
Take them all away!

624
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,880
Lord Zhuang!

625
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,540
Long time no see, Lord Zhuang.

626
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,350
Your Highness!

627
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,220
Are you defying an imperial order today?

628
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,930
Let Lord Zhuang come forward.

629
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,260
Speak with me up close.

630
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,750
Step closer.

631
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,720
Your Highness.

632
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,700
I act under the Prime Minister's orders.

633
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,640
Who?

634
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,470
Come closer and say it.

635
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,030
I said

636
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,550
I act under the Prime Minister's orders.

637
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,640
Choosing today...

638
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,850
Well, that's just bad luck for you.

639
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,200
What do you mean?

640
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,200
A death anniversary deserves a sacrifice.

641
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,920
You...

642
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,510
Then be the offering

643
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,070
for your godfather.

644
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,110
Enter the city.

645
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,960
[The streets of Yujing City,
Susha Kingdom]

646
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,800
I admit,

647
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,730
I was a bit harsh toward you before.

648
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,630
Going forward, I hope

649
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,400
we can interact in a new way.

650
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,760
Return to my residence to rest.

651
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,719
Once your injuries have healed,

652
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,150
we can discuss in detail

653
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,680
how we might work together.

654
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,760
You want to work with me?

655
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Don't you want to know

656
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,960
who shot you on the cliff

657
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,290
and who wanted you dead?

658
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,630
Back at Zhengnian Villa,

659
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,850
you were quite curious about that.

660
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,500
Lu Ke, come with me.

661
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,260
You, get someone
to look after Commander Fu.

662
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,840
What, afraid I'll run?

663
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,190
Well?

664
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,320
Is it her?

665
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,280
Yes.

666
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,190
So when do we strike?

667
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,110
Not yet.

668
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,560
We wait for the right moment.

669
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,670
Your Highness,

670
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,880
you can't go in!

671
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,410
Brother.

672
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,360
Greetings, Father.

673
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You lost the battle,

674
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,440
instead of reflecting at home

675
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,880
and waiting for my sommoning,

676
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,550
you barged into the Chengde Hall.

677
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,630
Today is my second brother's
coming-of-age ceremony.

678
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,800
As his elder brother,

679
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,730
if I didn't come,

680
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,400
wouldn't

681
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,880
people think

682
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,360
we're at odds?

683
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,630
Brother. You're back.

684
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,630
Today isn't your birthday.

685
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,480
Why hold

686
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,610
the ceremony today?

687
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,070
I don't know either.

688
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,510
Mother chose the date.

689
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,230
She said

690
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,880
today's a good day,

691
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,270
perfect for a coming-of-age ceremony.

692
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,440
Fine.

693
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,800
Second Brother doesn't know

694
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,110
what today is.

695
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,000
Father, do you not know either?

696
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,400
Today

697
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,800
is your second brother's coming-of-age.

698
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,150
Then it's

699
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,890
has been chosen quite unfortunately.

700
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,360
I have to

701
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,440
spoil

702
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,340
this ceremony,

703
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,940
but will make it up to you another day.

704
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,630
Oh,

705
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,440
I sent you a nice sword

706
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
to your quarters.

707
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,960
Go have a look.

708
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,190
Really?

709
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,710
Thanks, Brother!

710
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,030
Father.

711
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,070
Go on.

712
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,370
I take my leave.

713
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Since you're here,

714
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,840
explain,

715
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,280
why did we lose

716
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,770
the Battle of Pingling?

717
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,110
Your Majesty,

718
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,030
I suspect there's a spy

719
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,120
within the Feng Battalion.

720
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,760
What evidence do you have?

721
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,150
On His Highness's retreat,

722
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,590
he was ambushed multiple times.

723
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,510
Had someone in the Feng Battalion

724
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,070
not leaked the route,

725
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,370
how could that happen?

726
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,840
If there was

727
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,230
a leak during retreat,

728
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,120
then perhaps the siege plan

729
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,150
was already betrayed

730
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,450
to Jinxiu beforehand.

731
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,320
I've already sent Zhuang He,
the city gate official,

732
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,250
to take the Feng Battalion to the Ministry
of Justice for questioning.

733
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,880
Do you have anything to say?

734
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,630
I think

735
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,630
what he says makes sense.

736
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,000
However, I've already found

737
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,550
the spy in the army.

738
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,630
Your Majesty,

739
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,660
Lu Ke from the Feng Battalion
requests an audience.

740
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,320
Summon him.

741
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,230
I'm subordinate Lu Ke.
Greetings, Your Majesty.

742
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,490
You're wearing armor.

743
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,950
No need for formalities.

744
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,910
Thank you, Your Majesty!

745
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,830
Show this to the Prime Minister.

746
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,070
He might

747
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,840
recognize this traitor.

748
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,880
What's in the box?

749
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,550
Your Highness, do speak plainly.

750
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,000
No need for riddles

751
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,570
before His Majesty.

752
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,920
Since you don't wish to see it,

753
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,070
perhaps Vice Minister of Justice,
Zhuang Ming,

754
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,510
would be interested.

755
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:19,880
It's... It's He...

756
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,360
Yes.

757
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,510
Inside

758
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,440
is the severed head
of Zhuang He, the city gate official.

759
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,670
He's the one who tried to assassinate me

760
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,280
along the way.

761
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,190
When I entered the city earlier,

762
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,450
he confessed in person and was executed.

763
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,400
He also claimed

764
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,150
he acted

765
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,840
alone.

766
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,560
Your Majesty!

767
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,510
This is only the First Prince's word.

768
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,070
There's no proof.
On what grounds was He killed?

769
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,670
I ask Your Majesty
to investigate thoroughly.

770
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,280
What say you, Prime Minister?

771
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,960
Did I have reason to kill him?
