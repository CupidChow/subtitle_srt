(Episode 8: Fling and Fight)

8
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,360
I... I think we should

9
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,680
check out the filming location

10
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,600
next time.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,080
Okay.

12
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,039
(Standard FM, Metropolitan Area)

13
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,880
-Thank you.
-Hey.

14
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,520
Don't you have anything to say to me?

15
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,680
-No, I don't.
-What? "No"?

16
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,360
Hey, wait. But...

17
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,920
She's unbelievable.

18
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,160
What's her deal?

19
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,960
Dong-chan and that woman
went there by themselves?

20
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,680
It's the assistant director's job to help
the director find a location.

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,840
Ha-young,
do you still have feelings for Dong-chan?

22
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,440
I don't think I need
to answer that question.

23
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,960
Isn't he a little out of your league?

24
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,920
Even if it's the trend to date
younger men, let's be realistic.

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,640
Watch what you say.

26
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,560
He sets his own standards.

27
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,840
He doesn't care what other people think.

28
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,600
That's why I fell in love with him.

29
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,079
But that's not the problem.

30
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,440
Yes, of course.
That's not the actual problem.

31
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Hello?

32
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,480
Today, don't worry about anything else

33
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,240
and just get some rest.

34
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,480
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,160
(I really have no excuses,)

36
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,360
but I thought I should at least apologize.

37
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,880
What exactly are you apologizing for?

38
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,839
For kissing you.

39
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,840
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,280
I thought I was going to die.

41
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,560
I wanted to kiss someone before I died.

42
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,360
But I didn't die.
I ended up staying alive.

43
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,440
Right. Well...

44
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,120
I'm relieved that you didn't die.

45
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
You should get some rest.
We can talk about it later.

46
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,080
What do you mean?

47
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
Let's just wrap it up here.

48
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,400
Will you accept my apology?

49
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,360
Is that something
you have to apologize for?

50
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,800
That's what I think.

51
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,120
You refused.

52
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,640
You're so petty.

53
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,640
I thought I was dying.

54
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,400
Hold on.

55
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,760
What is going on?

56
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,800
Fine, then. I'll wait for my punishment.

57
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,320
Do as you wish.

58
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Hello? What? Hello?

59
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,680
What was that?

60
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,040
What does she want?

61
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,920
What should I do?

62
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,840
I should've just died then and there.

63
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,920
I'm so irritated.

64
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,920
I'm so embarrassed!

65
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,159
What is this?

66
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,520
-Hello?
(-It's me.)

67
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,600
Hey, did you meet that NIS executive?

68
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,360
That's why I called you.

69
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,800
Are you busy?

70
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,080
I think Nikolai died last year.

71
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,040
Since he was
the strongest presidential candidate,

72
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,560
people are trying to cover this up
due to political reasons.

73
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,080
But they believe he was assassinated

74
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,520
by the opposing party.

75
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,320
The CIA said so.

76
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,800
Then is Nikolai the one
who blew up Professor Hwang's car?

77
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't think so.

78
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,000
Apparently,
there's a book about the individuals

79
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,960
he had killed during his mafia days.

80
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,120
It's like an epic that the mafias have.

81
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,160
It wasn't published,

82
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,720
but it says, during the attack
of Professor Johnson McCarthy,

83
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,600
he claimed to have killed

84
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,200
Professor Hwang who was his assistant.

85
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,600
So you're saying

86
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,240
in 1984,
he believed Professor Hwang was dead?

87
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,440
That's right.

88
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,800
I knew it.

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,760
Nikolai wasn't the culprit.

90
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,440
Do you have a hunch?

91
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,720
I'm not sure.

92
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,360
I'll know for sure once
Professor Hwang regains his memory.

93
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,680
Anyway, I'll be going.

94
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,680
(October 24, 1998)

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,240
(Hwamin Bank)

96
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,159
Should I look for
a studio apartment or a rooftop?

97
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,840
I need to live near my love.

98
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,640
She must see me often.
She must get used to me.

99
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,480
I'll plan out my own fate.

100
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,000
(Monthly rent 220,000 won)

101
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
(Monthly rent 220,000 won)

102
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,960
Lady Luck is on my side.

103
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,200
How could the rooftop house
at Mi-ran's place be vacant?

104
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,320
The deities are doing their best
to help my love life.

105
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,080
I can't believe this.

106
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,720
This is fate.

107
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,400
Hello?

108
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,000
I called to say that I'm interested in
moving into the rooftop house.

109
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,960
Gosh, that was quick.

110
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
Hello?

111
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,320
But you see, we'd prefer our tenant

112
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,799
to be a college student.

113
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,080
And if possible, female.

114
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,799
How old are you?

115
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,480
I'm 44 years old.

116
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,080
I'm sorry,

117
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,560
-but we're only interested--
(-I'm not a student,)

118
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,280
but I am a professor.

119
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,160
Oh, are you?

120
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,560
Yes. I need to experience

121
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,520
the life in a rooftop house.

122
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,080
I'm studying the correlation
between isolation

123
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,680
(and psychological emancipation.)

124
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,320
I'd like to visit.

125
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,320
Do you have time?

126
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,400
(Kim Hong-suk)

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,960
-Hello?
(-Hey, it's me.)

128
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,680
(Where are you? Are you doing field work?)

129
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,960
(Would you like to have dinner with me?)

130
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,680
All right.

131
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,760
-Did he agree to come?
-Of course, sir.

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,240
He always listens to me.

133
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,800
You see, I helped him a lot in the past.

134
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,600
Don't be ridiculous.

135
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,320
You don't have to bluff in front of me.

136
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,600
I know he's not the type
to leech off of others.

137
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Right.

138
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,440
-Do you need to get on his good side?
-Yes, sir.

139
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,280
Okay. Let's go.

140
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,680
Yes, sir.

141
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,840
This is an important day for us

142
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,400
to meet with our savior.

143
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,320
"Savior"?

144
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,560
Being smart won't get you far in politics.

145
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,560
Neither does being passionate.

146
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,760
It's all about the money.

147
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
I see.

148
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,400
Why is he acting so friendly?

149
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,160
By the way, what is she up to?

150
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,600
Is she doing all right?

151
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,680
I'm worried when she's quiet
and when she calls.

152
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,120
She's the essence of my worries.

153
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,280
(I wanted to kiss someone before I died.)

154
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,920
Could it have been her first kiss?

155
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,720
There's no way.

156
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,320
No way. No.

157
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,760
We're having soy bean stew for dinner.

158
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,720
Nam-tae called and said he was craving it.

159
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,560
I'm getting really heated,
so I'm going to get some air.

160
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,880
Let's go out together after having dinner.

161
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,560
No, I'll go alone.

162
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,520
I don't deserve to eat.

163
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,680
What's wrong? Did something happen?

164
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,240
You're going to break your teeth.
Be gentle.

165
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,000
We have a candidate for our rooftop house.

166
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,040

Hi. You know me, right? I'm Kim Si-seok.

Hello, sir. It's been a long time.

Sit down.

173
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,920
I remember how you caused
a commotion when you first joined.

174
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,320
They said a variety show director

175
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,440
was more handsome than the actors.

176
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,360
The female reporters
and employees at the station

177
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,080
were head over heels for you.

178
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,840
That's right.

179
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,440
People thought he got in solely
because of his good looks

180
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
back when I was the chief,

181
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,880

A salaryman like me

188
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,560
can't dare to have something this
expensive for dinner.

189

being 30,000 won or less.

I mean, really?

I have a son who is over 30 years old

You know about the sexual harassment case
in the Drama Department, right?

283
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,920
I've just received a new guideline.

284
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,000
Each department
received specific instructions.

285
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,200
From now on, you can't have
physical contact with other staff.

286
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,200
Especially when it comes to
the female staff. Remember that.

I'm already being extra cautious.

Since Director Ma is old-fashioned,

You should always dress like this.

292

You have such beautiful legs. Cut.

293
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,040
This is also considered sexual harassment.

294
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,400
Don't go up to your female colleagues

295
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,880
and massage their shoulders to say
they did a good job.

296
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,760
Director Jung was in great demand
in the Drama Department,

297
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,880
but he kissed
an assistant director while drunk.

298
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,920
He was suspended,
and he might be sent to jail.

299
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,320
You must suppress your desires.

300
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,920
Is it only sexual harassment
if a drunk man kisses a woman?

301
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What if a woman kisses a man while drunk?

302
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,720
It's all the same.

303
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Why would a man let a woman
kiss him against his will?

304
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,160
Is he stupid?

305
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,560
Right? He'd be a fool.

306
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,960
I should let women take advantage of me.

307
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,560
What are you saying?

308
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,200
-What you said earlier was bad.
-What did I do?

309
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
You shouldn't even bring it up.

310
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,920
-It was her fault.
-You don't make any sense.

311
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,120
I got you good this time.

312
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,000

I'm sorry.

322
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,200
All right. Okay. Tell me what

323
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,200
you're sorry about.

324
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,480
So...

325
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,360
I initiated a physical contact
that the opposite party didn't want.

326
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,440
I'm sorry about that.

327
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,480
You're probably
the only woman in this world

who'd apologize after kissing a man.

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,720
While we're on that,

330
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,640
I'll give you a 1.5 billion-won discount.

331
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,400
-What?
-The station owes me 70 billion won,

332
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,600
and I'm willing to take
1.5 billion won off.

333
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,040
Is a kiss worth 1.5 billion won?

334
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,440
It's definitely not worth that much.

335
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,760
I know it is too much,

336
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,960
but I need to do this
to make myself feel better.

337
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,080
1.5 billion won?

338
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,960
Do I look like a joke?
Do I look that easy to you?

339
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,160
It's not like that.

340
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,840
If I thought that, I wouldn't give you
a 1.5 billion won discount.

341
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,400
I'd call it even with 150,000 won.

342
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,760
Why don't you kiss me 10 times
and give me a 15 billion-won discount?

343
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,880
That's okay.
I don't intend on doing it again.

344
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,000
Gosh.

345
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,960
You're really crazy, aren't you?

346
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,080
Did you treat me
as an object of sexual desire?

347
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,400
What?

348
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,560
Honestly, I'm not thrilled either.
I wasted my first kiss like that.

349
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,000
Anyway, I believe
I apologized enough already.

350
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,560
-I hope you accept it.
-Accept what? Hey, accept what?

351
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,280
Hey, I...

352
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,560
Is she crazy? Hey, come back here. Hey!

353
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,560
Hey! Hey, Mi-ran.

354
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,280
You little...

355
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,280
Hey, running away won't solve this.
Come here. Follow me.

356
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,160
Hey, you.

357
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,520
Our conversation is over.
What's the matter with him?

358
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,800
You keep trying to brush this off,
but I was sexually harassed.

359
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,960
I think we need to talk about that.

360
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,320
You're sorry for kissing me
against my will?

361
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,080
You normally tell someone
that you're sorry

362
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,720
when you accidentally step on their foot,

363
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,680
hit their head with something,

364
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,000
or get drunk and bite their arm like this.

365
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,480
Those are the stuff
you normally apologize for.

366
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,640
But a kiss...

367
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,560
Does a kiss mean that little to you?

368
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,840
Let me tell you something. Kissing someone

369
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,040
is something emotional.

370
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,520
I...

371
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,480
I've never had a girl kiss me first.

372
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,320
So I needed some time
to understand what happened.

373
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,240
But it just seems like you think
of it as a joke.

374
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,240
Are you harassing me right now?

375
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
I don't think of it as a joke.

376
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,480
I was just really embarrassed.

377
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,960
That's why I said all of that.

378
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,200
It was weird for me
to sincerely apologize,

379
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,720
but I couldn't joke about it
and act like it was nothing either.

380
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,880
Well, okay.

381
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,640
I'm sorry.

382
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,800
You're apologizing again.

383
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,360
I'm sick and tired of
hearing you apologize.

384
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,760
Hey.

385
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,040
You'd better not

386
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,160
boast about this to anyone.

387
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,760
Why would I even boast about this?

388
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,640
You're the one who shouldn't
go around boasting about this.

389
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,040
Why in the world

390
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,360
would I boast about this?

391
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,400
I got kissed by a girl
when I least expected it.

392
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,240
I feel so humiliated.

393
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,560
Those two are so similar.

394
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,520
No wonder they fight all the time.

395
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,360
They're like twins.

396
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,680
I'm sorry for making you feel humiliated.

397
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,960
I apologize.

398
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,960
Let me ask you something.

399
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,760
You said you missed me because you wanted
to kiss someone before you died, right?

400
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,480
Then what if you were

401
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,240
with someone other than me
at that exact moment in that situation?

402
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,680
Do you think you would've
kissed that person?

403
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,600
Answer me.

404
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,800
Would you have done the same
to someone else?

405
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,360
What does that even matter?

406
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,680
It matters. I'll decide whether to
accept your apology or not

407
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,840
based on your answer.

408
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,320
No.

409
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,080
If I was with another guy,

410
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,560
I wouldn't have kissed him.

411
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,320
Okay, then.

412
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,800
You don't need to apologize.

413
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,240
So are you saying Mi-ran

414
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,600
was stuck in a frozen capsule?

415
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,200
You can't tell this to anyone.

416
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,520
I won't.

417
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,720
Oh, right.

418
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,080
What are you doing?

419
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,440
I need to shoot my vlog today.

420
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,200
I need to show everyone
my daily life today.

421
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,320
Hello, everyone.
This is the extremely fun Kyung-ja.

422
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,920
I'd like to introduce you

423
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,600
to my older sister today.
Her name is Park Yu-ja.

424
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,840
She used to be a shaman.

425
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,960
But now, she's a deaconess.

426
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,280
She's been living a very dramatic life.

427
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,080
Let me introduce you to my sister.

428
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,680
This is Park Yu-ja, my older sister.

429
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,960
Say hello, Yu-ja.

430
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,600
Hello, my brothers and sisters.

431
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,640
May the Lord bless all of you.

432
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,880
-Amen.
-Amen.

433
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,920
We're going to head to
the broadcasting station

434
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,640
after we finish drinking our tea.

435
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,720
Ms. Na, you need to talk to someone.

436
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,640
She watched yesterday's news
and called to tell us something.

437
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,080
I don't think she's joking.

438
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,960
Yes, this is Na Ha-young speaking.

439
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,680
(I know who bombed Professor Jo's car.)

440
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,600
(I know who the culprit is.)

441
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,360
Is it difficult for you to tell us
who it is over the phone?

442
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,840
(Yes.)

443
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,880
Then I'll go to where you are.

444
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,320
(No, don't do that.)

445
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,960
(I'll just meet you
at the broadcasting station.)

446
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,200
I'd like to meet you as soon as possible.

447
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,680
(But there's one condition.)

448
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,240
(I want Director Ma Dong-chan)

449
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,040
(to come with you.)

450
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,640
We need to divide the projects by time,

451
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,520
-and we need advertisements.
-You can manage it on your phone.

452
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,600
("Go Go 99")
-and we need advertisements.
-You can manage it on your phone.

453
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:27,680
("Go Go 99")

454
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,560
Give me the list once you're done.
("Go Go 99")

455
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,520
Give me the list once you're done.

456
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,200
-Okay.
-Like this?

457
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,400
Yes.

458
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,000
-Okay, then.
-Thank you.

459
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,520
Do you think you can do it?

460
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,040
Yes, of course. It'll be a piece of cake.

461
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,960
Is everything a piece of cake to you?

462
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,520
Hey.

463
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,640
You shouldn't surf the web
too much on your cell phone.

464
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,040
Why?

465
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,320
Will it make my body temperature rise?

466
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,960
My gosh, no.

467
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
There's a limit to how much Wi-Fi
we can use every day,

468
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,920
so if you use too much of it,

469
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,520
the other people in the office

470
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,240
won't be able to use the internet.

471
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,560
People won't be able to reach them.

472
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
It'll be a dystopia.

473
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,600
-Really?
-Yes, I'm serious.

474
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,320
We have a set amount of data
we can use each day.

475
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,480
So if you use too much data,

476
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,400
the others won't be
able to use the internet.

477
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,280
I've never heard of that before.

478
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,520
Why is there a limit?

479
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,760
Then what about
the unlimited data service?

480
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,080
It's not unlimited.

481
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,800
It's very limited.

482
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,320
So don't even think about

483
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,240
using your cell phone
to remotely manage the webpage.

484
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,680
Just sit here and use your computer.

485
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,800
Is the service unlimited for computers?

486
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,640
Yes.

487
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
I think it just applies for cell phones.

488
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,920
The broadcasting station isn't
making a lot of money these days.

489
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,120
And it seems like the Wi-Fi service
is really expensive.

490
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,520
Then I guess I should cooperate.

491
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,160
Yes, of course. Being cooperative
is very important for an intern.

492
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,600
So don't go anywhere
and write up a casting list.

493
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,960
Call everyone on the list
and pick out the candidates.

494
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,080
-Okay.
-Keep it up.

495
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,200
-Good luck.
-Right.

496
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,080
Hello?

497
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,480
(Hey, it's me.)

498
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,520
Hey.

499
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,360
(I need to discuss something
with you regarding Professor Jo.)

500
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,520
(Can you come to my office?)

501
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,200
Okay, I'll be right there.

502
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,240
(Chief of News Bureau, Na Ha-young)

503
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,880
Hey, take a look at this.

504
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,240
An anonymous person

505
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,960
sent us a video file
after she saw the news yesterday.

506
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,200
How did anyone manage to film this video?

507
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,920
The person asked me
not to report this to the cops.

508
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,240
It probably means they can't be trusted.

509
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,360
That person also asked me
to bring you along.

510
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,840
Me?

511
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,480
When are we scheduled to meet them?

512
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,920
They said they'd call me again

513
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,920
and just hung up.

514
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,360
Was it a guy?

515
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,320
It sounded like a middle-aged woman.

516
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,200
Hey.

517
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,600
Can you get me some
off the record information

518
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,520
on Lee Seok Du,
the chairman of Unsung Group?

519
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120
-What do you mean?
-Like I said,

520
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,920
unofficial information about him.

521
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,520
Not the things that everyone knows about.

522
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,720
Can I ask you why?

523
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,440
I'll tell you once it's the right time.

524
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
But right now, I'm not sure of anything.

525
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,720
You seem to have come back to the old you.

526
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,360
And it's making me feel weird.

527
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,800
I remember when we first met.

528
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,160
We had our first meeting
because I was scheduled

529
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,960
to narrate your show.

530
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,440
My heart still flutters

531
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,680
when I think about that day.

532
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,880
What are you doing tomorrow?

533
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,640
I'm going to look for a location to shoot.

534
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,720
Will it be just you and her again?

535
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,800
No, I'm going alone.

536
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
I should get going.

537
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,120
When she calls again,
tell her you want to meet immediately.

538
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,360
And call me.

539
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,280
This is so annoying.

540
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,199
How's work? Is it bearable?

541
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,360
Yes, I'm giving it my best.

542
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,600
I'm glad to hear that.

543
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,000
I hope you will improve.
I'm rooting for you.

544
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,360
Of course.
I need to help this station flourish

545
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,679
in order for them to pay me back.

546
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,080
I'm giving it my best.

547
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,040
Well... All right.

548
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,000
Listen.

549
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,040
You and Dong-chan don't get along, do you?

550
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,679
Not really.

551
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,120
I'll let you pick the director
you'd like to work with.

552
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,440
Just say the name.

553
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,280
No, thank you.

554
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,800
I think he's the best director out there.

555
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,679
Ever since he did "Infinite Experiment
Paradise" 20 years ago,

556
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,239
I have admired his passion and competence.

557
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,640
I want to learn from him.

558
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,960
You want to keep working with him
even though you guys fight so much?

559
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,240
Yes.
It's not like he'll become my husband.

560
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,120
He's an excellent worker,
and that's enough.

561
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,680
Why do you want to keep her by your side

562
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,880
when you guys fight so often?

563
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,520
I think she has always wanted
to become a director.

564
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,720
She's got talent.
She has good sense and imagination.

565
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,120
She seems promising
as long as she's guided well.

566
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,000
But you two have an awful relationship.

567
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,960
I don't work with people
because I like them.

568
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,120
-It's just work.
-You're right about that.

569
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
Hey.

570
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,520
Her DNA screams, "variety show".

571
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,040
I've never seen someone like her.

572
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,160
Anyway, make sure to
take care of her personal details.

573
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,240
I heard the Administration Team wanted
a copy of her resident registration.

574
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,280
It'll be a problem
if they find out about her age.

575
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,960
All right. I'll take care of that.

576
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Thanks.

577
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,560
Do take care of her.

578
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,960
She may seem strong,

579
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,920
but she's sensitive like me.

580
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,400
Ta-da. I'm in the hallway
of TBO Broadcasting Station

581
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,760
where my best friend works.

582
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,120
If you look behind me,

583
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,280
I think that's the bathroom.

584
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,680
And...

585
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,040
Did you see him?

586
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,640
The renowned cryonics man, Ma Dong-chan,

587
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,040
just entered the bathroom.

588
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,320
I can't believe I'll be seeing him
in person! Let's go inside.

589
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,520
-Yu-ja!
-Mi-ran!

590
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,120
Let's pray first.

591
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,520
You've been frozen for 20 years,
so let's pray to warm you up.

592
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,640
I'm fine--

593
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,680
Lord, Mi-ran has come back.

594
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,640
Until the day her temperature goes up--

595
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,760
Amen. That's him.

596
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,160
I told you 20 years ago

597
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,760
that you'd meet your soulmate in 20 years
and that you'd be freezing before then.

598
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,600
He's your soulmate.

599
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,440
What is this? Are my powers coming back?

600
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,200
Move this here, okay?

601
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,160
-Okay.
-There are many locations,

602
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,480
so check well.

603
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,120
Just book a nice place for me to stay.
I just need a good air conditioner.

604
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,800
-Okay.
-Okay.

605
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,200
I found a writer.

606
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,040
I'll give you the number.
Get along well with them.

607
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,760
-Okay.
-Go to Hongdae tomorrow

608
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,000
and check out the latest trends.

609
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,120
Observe how those in their 20s are like.

610
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,640
You need to start living

611
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,360
like them.

612
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,880
I'm going to stop by the lab
and look for a location.

613
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,560
-Are you going alone?
-Yes, I am.

614
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Okay, goodbye.

615
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,400
Hey.

616
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,200
Make sure you carry
your fever-reducing shot.

617
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,040
And stay away from the sun.

618
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,880
-Okay.
-Good.

619
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,720
Don't get sick.

620
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,280
I still have some
important luggage to bring.

621
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,960
My official move in will be in two days.

622
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,880
In the meantime,
please secure this rooftop house as is.

623
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,920
Of course, professor.

624
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,000
I'll be back, Father.

625
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,520
Professor.

626
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,040
Doesn't this hurt?

627
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,320
What?

628
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,440
It hurts.

629
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,200
I hope

630
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,960
I researched cryonics
because I wanted to help

631
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,440
sick people like you.

632
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,200
I hope it wasn't because of anything else.

633
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,840
Professor, I'm sure that's the case.

634
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,800
You have a kind heart.

635
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,480
-I'm back.
-It's Mi-ran.

636
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Mi-ran!

637
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,480
This looks like me.

638
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,160
It's like the inside of my head.

639
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,440
(Hwang Ji-hun)

640
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,440
(Mi-ran, can we talk?)

641
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,800
-Hello?
(-Hey, Mi-ran.)

642
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,080
Have you been well?

643
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,520
Yes. I handed in my assignment.

644
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,920
Do you have any plans tomorrow?

645
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,480
I'm in charge of a new project.

646
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,960
I need to go to Hongdae tomorrow.

647
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,920
(I have to observe the trends
of people in their 20s.)

648
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,120
I called to ask if you were free tomorrow.

649
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,520
Let's go together.

650
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,080
-Are you serious?
(-Of course.)

651
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,680
It feels great to think
that I'll be meeting you somewhere

652
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
outside of school.

653
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,360
All right.

654
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,760
Take me around and be my guide tomorrow.

655
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,320
It's a deal.

656
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,040
Only Professor Hwang knows the
personal details regarding the cryonics.

657
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,200
Forget about that.

658
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,240
Why are we only allowed
to take one fever-reducing shot a day?

659
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,720
Your bodies will eventually
build tolerance to those shots,

660
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,600
and they will become ineffective.

661
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,480
We need to ultimately raise
your body temperature to 36.5Â°C.

662
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,920
In your current state...

663
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,600
By "ineffective",

664
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,280
do you mean

665
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,120
we could die?

666
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,920
I just hope that
your temperatures don't rise.

667

(Cold-hearted Punk)

668
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,840
(You shouldn't take the fever-reducing
shot more than once a day.)
(Cold-hearted Punk)

669
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,960
(Since you got a shot today,
you must not take another.)

670
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,840
(That can't be.)

671
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,000
(Did he administer his shot to me?)

672
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,800
Okay, then.

673
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,680
You don't need to apologize.

674
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,120
(No.)

675
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,360
If I was with another guy,

676
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,960
I wouldn't have kissed him.

677
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,560
No.

678
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,400
No...

679
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,280
Come play a game.

680
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,000
We're giving away
free dried rose petal lipsticks.

681
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,680
Play a game and get your
free dried rose petal lipstick.

682
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,600
Do they make lipsticks
these days with dried rose petals?

683
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,720
-I'm not sure.
-In any case, it's free. Right?

684
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,800
(We have all the hottest colors of 2019.)

685
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,680
I got it! I got it.

686
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,960
Thank you.

687
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,200
If you post a picture of it
on your social media account,

688
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,960
we also give away blush.
Do you want to do it?

689
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,400
What's "social media"?

690
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,040
One, two, three.

691
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,520
"Dried rose petals".

692
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,600
"Hashtag, pretty".
"Hashtag, date in Hongdae".

693
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,920
(Dried rose petals, pretty,
date in Hongdae)

694
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,240
This is really cool.

695
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,280
You're good.

696
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,840
Do you want to give it a try?

697
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,400
Put your feet on it.

698
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,920
-It's hard.
-Move forward.

699
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Take your time.

700
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,960
-It's moving. It's moving!
-Yes.

701
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,520
Mi-ran, this is what they call a fling.

702
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,640
What?

703
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,080
He went alone?

704
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,240
-Do you know where he's staying?
-Of course I do. I booked it for him.

705
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,200
Okay.

706
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,840
I don't want Dong-chan
to know that we had this call.

707
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,440
I don't want him to know either.

708
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,160
Do you still get scared
when you see Dong-chan?

709
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,520
This is why they say old habits die hard.

711

This place is nice.

712
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,440
I hope you keep on smiling like that.

713
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,680
Here is your key.

714
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,800
Thank you.

716

(You must really love Ma Dong-chan.)

717
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,600
Actually, what we remember the most

718
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,640
from our university years are the trips.

719
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,560
Could you come up with the log line
and the teaser text

720
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,040
and send them to my assistant director?

721
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,000
Did you speak to her on the phone?

722
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,360
Her age?

723
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,040
She's 24.

724
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,960
She hasn't graduated from university yet,
so she's an intern.

725
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,640
Yes.

726
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,440
I'll call you once I'm back in Seoul.
Okay.

727
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,520
Hello?

728
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,040

Hey.

730
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,120
Now I'm

731
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,440
in the same hotel as you are.

732

733

Hello, I'm calling from TBO.

739
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,120
You applied to appear
on "Go Go 99", right?

740
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,440
Yes. I'm sorry about that.

741
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,800
How about tomorrow?
What are you doing then?

742
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,600
Yes.

743
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,360
Good morning.

744

747
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,320
Nice.

748
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,800
-Why did you lie?
-Lie about what?

749
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,000
You told me that there's a limit to
how much data we can use.

750
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,520
But that was a lie.

751
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,960
You can't exactly call that a lie.
It was more like a joke.

752
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,400
It wasn't funny.

753
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,360
Yesterday, I memorized practically
all of the trends this year.

754

I'm as fast as 5G
when it comes to learning stuff.

You don't know what "5G" is, do you?

00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,960
I think

812
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,480
I'm having a hard time adjusting
to this world.

813
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,920
I try hard not to let it bother me,

814
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,320
but I keep falling down
and making a fool of myself.

815
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,520
I can't even go back to my old life.

816
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,600
Is that why

817
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,920
you drank?

818
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,720
Yes, that's right. I drank.

819
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,000
But I took the fever-reducing shot
before I drank.

820
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,520
I was so upset.

821
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,440
I drank because I wanted to try
doing what everyone else does.

822
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,200
Hey, why...

823
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,840
Why do you keep tormenting me?

824
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,800
When did I ever torment you?

825
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,240
Even if you stay still
and don't do anything

826
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,840
I'm having a hard time because of you.

827
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,440
You don't need to feel that way.

828
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,520
Don't feel responsible for me.

829
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,160
It was my choice.

830
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,960
So it's okay.

831
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,760
Just forget about me
and live your life the way you want.

832
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,600
Stop making me feel so weak

833
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,280
by always looking at me
as if you owe me something.

834
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,160
From now on,

835
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,600
you don't need

836
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,400
to worry about me.

837
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,760
I won't resent you

838
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,320
even if something happens to me.

839
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,760
Hey, stop acting up.

840
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,200
Did you hear me? Don't act up.

841
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,080
If you keep acting up, I might just

842
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:26,600
start liking you.

843
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,560
(Melting Me Softly)

844
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,240
-You're a playboy, aren't you?
-No, I'm not.

845
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,280
(You're a typical womanizer
who toys with women.)

846
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,040
You can make people happy.

847
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,720
(Achieving your dream starts
with "Go Go 99".)

848
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,080
(You've never worked with him.)

849
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,960
You have no idea how much he harasses you.

850
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:41,960
My gosh.

851
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:45,320
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you
for the past 20 years.

852
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,760
Make sure you don't get caught.

853
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,680
(I don't want Dong-chan
to get into trouble.)

854
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,560
Mi-ran, I'll protect you.
You don't need to worry.
