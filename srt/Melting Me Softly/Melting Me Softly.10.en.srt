00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,880
Why do you keep making me look for you?

16
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,760
Why are you crying? It's not like you.

17

It's nothing to laugh about.

18
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,200
I'll protect you.

19
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,360
What do you mean by that?

20
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,400
I'm the person who's responsible,

21
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,760
so I'll do whatever it takes

22

to prevent you from crying.

23
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,920
So don't worry.

24
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,800

doing what you want.

I'm sorry.

Don't be sorry.

30
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,240
Don't you regret it?

31
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,960
Stand up straight.

You did nothing wrong.

I'll deal with this in my own way.

Let's just be ourselves
and face what's in front of us.

Shouldn't we cover the article
about Ko Mi-ran on the news?

46
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's think about it.

47
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,760
I knew something was weird
the moment she mentioned BTS.

48
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,680
No wonder she seemed strange.

49
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,320
The broadcasting station gave her a job,

50
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,960
so they could keep this a secret.

51
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,680
I really don't think this is right.

52
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,840
This means all those rumors
were actually true.

53
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,960
-I heard about another participant.
-Really?

54

How do you think Dong-chan
will overcome this issue?

55

What are you talking about?
There's no way out of this.

Let's finish our meeting.

57
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,480
We haven't decided on our final location.

58
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Director Ma.

59
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,800
Is the post on
the online bulletin board true?

60
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,560
Yes, partly.

61
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,560
Then did you really hire her
as an assistant director

62
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,120
because she participated in
the cryonics experiment too?

63
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,240
Yes.

64
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,760
You didn't consider anything else
such as her competence,

65
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,000
major, or work experience?
You just hired her because of that?

66
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,680
Mi-ran participated
in every single experiment

67
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,000
that took place in the show
that I directed 20 years ago.

68
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,000
I think the biggest strength
of a variety show director

69
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,120
is to be able to challenge oneself.

70
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,600
A person who walks a path
that no one else walks,

71
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
dreams a dream that no one else dreams,

72
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,240
and does things that no one
else ever dares to do.

73
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,680
(If I were to tell you that we're going to
do a cryonics experiment,)

74
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,040
(who here would have the courage
to volunteer and be a subject?)

75
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,920
Anyone?

76
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,440
In my personal opinion,
Mi-ran is a rare talent

77
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,240
that's hard to come across
in our broadcasting station.

78
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,160
(But even so, you can't just hire
someone because of that.)

79
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,400
Yes, I know. That's why she's an intern.

80
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
A variety show is
all about keeping up with the trends.

81
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,440
She was frozen for 20 years.

82
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,960
How can someone like her participate
in making a variety show?

83
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,320
Ms. Yoon, do you remember
what you said in our first meeting?

84
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,320
You told me that I'm the reason
why you decided to join this show.

85
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,600
You told me you trust me.

86
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,800
I was also in a capsule
for the past 20 years.

87
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,520
So why do you trust me
when I'm old-school as well?

88
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,520
-That's because--
-The reason why I chose you

89
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,120
among all the other competent writers

90
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,720
is because I saw something in you.

91
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,240
When it comes to people I'll work
with such as the assistant director,

92
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,360
writers, camera, and audio crew members,

93
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,040
I am very picky.

94
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,200
If I didn't think you could do it,

95
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,920
I wouldn't have given you a chance.

96
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,640
If you trust me,

97
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,920
trust in my judgment as well.

98
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,160
After that, you may judge as you like.

99
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,080
Don't give me such looks of disapproval.

100
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,680
Just say it to my face.

101
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,600
If I catch you talking about this
behind my back,

102
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,960
I will make sure you all pay for it.

103
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,360
I'm pretty good at talking down to others.

104
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,200
Then is she our junior or senior?

105
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,560
Based on her age, she's--

106
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,120
Why is that important?

107
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,400
-What?
-This industry is based

108
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,120
on our achievements and outcomes.

109
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,640
She's 44 years old
and hasn't been working.

110
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,960
She's an intern with
no experience in this field.

111
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,080
Focus on what you can do,
so you don't fall behind.

112
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,880
Let's resume our meeting.

113
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,800
Hello.

114
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm the assistant director for
"Go Go 99" at TBO, Ko Mi-ran.

115
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,600
I called to ask about the location.

116
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,840
I'll email you the schedule
once it's confirmed.

117
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,160
Okay.

118
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,080
Yes.

119
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,000
Mi-ran, we need to talk.

120
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,240
Mi-ran, before we make an announcement,

121
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,160
I need to hear your take on this.

122
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,560
What do you think we should do?

123
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,720
I'll take care of it.

124
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,600
I'm 44 years old.

125
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,480
Why would I expect someone else
to take care of this?

126
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,680
This isn't something personal.

127
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,520
I know you're going through a lot.

128
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,480
You're probably worried about
what I'd say.

129
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,480
And you're also worried about
everyone finding out

130
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,360
about the things you've done.

131
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,760
I'll take care of all of it.

132
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,440
What did she say?

133
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,440
She doesn't seem to
want to use this chance

134
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,600
for her own benefit

135
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,160
or make money by making
the situation worse.

136
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,320
Really?

137
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,400
My future is so cloudy.

138
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,960
What should I do?

139
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,040
There's a thick layer of clouds.

140
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,120
It will rain soon.

141
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
You can't prevent that,
so do prepare an umbrella.

142
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,080
Stop talking so outlandishly!

143
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,680
Are you going through puberty right now?

144
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,080
What is that umbrella
you're talking about?

145
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,520
Let's just come clean about everything.

146
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,360
How? What should we say?

147
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,840
"Two cryonics experiment
subjects went missing."

148
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,880
"At that time,
the chief and the assistant director"

149
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,520
"covered up the case."

150
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,400
"They took disciplinary action
against those who spread rumors"

151
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,160
"and fired them.
They also bribed the police."

152
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,680
"Then one of them became the president,"

153
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,440
"and the other became the chief."
Is that it?

163
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,680
Why aren't they here working?

164
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,480
They all left to do their jobs.

165
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,000
They finally traced the ID

166
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,240
of the person who uploaded
those writing about Mi-ran.

167
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,680
It was an 8th grade girl in Class 3
at Mayeon Middle School.

168
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,240
-She's in middle school?
-But when the writing was uploaded,

169
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,360
she was in class, and she was deep asleep.

170
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,960
What do you mean?
Are you saying her account was hacked?

171
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,400
We're looking into it.

172
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,600
They knew a lot about Mi-ran.

173
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,760
They even knew about
how she got into this station.

174
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,640
It's someone who knows very well

175
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,400
about her and the cryonics experiment.

176
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,760
They called her shameless.

177
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,160
It's someone who hates her.

178
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,640
I'm going to catch them no matter what.

179
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,360
Where and what is she doing right now?

180
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,280
Dong-chan, Mi-ran has gone viral
on social media.

181
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,560
(Hello, I'm Ko Mi-ran.)

182
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,160
(About 20 years ago,)

183
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,600
(I agreed to a 24-hour experiment,)

184
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,680
(but due to an accident,
I woke up 20 years later.)

185
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,240
(Overnight, I went from being
a 24-year-old to a 44-year-old.)

186
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,480
(As a result, there was no place
that was willing to hire me.)

187
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,680
(The broadcasting station and I)

188
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,080
(had to find a reasonable solution.)

189
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,520
(And as a result, I began working
at TBO as an intern.)

190
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,880
(Although I didn't have to go through
the formalities,)

191
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,600
(I didn't think that)

192
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,800
(it was too much to receive
for being frozen for 20 years.)

193
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,160
(I admit that I took it)

194
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,120
(as a fair compensation for the 20 years)

195
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,440
(that I had lost.)

196
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,040
(However, the most that
I had received was a chance.)

197
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,880
(I'm not a full-time employee.)

198
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,280
(I'm an ordinary intern
who needs to be acknowledged.)

199
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,440
(Through this chance,)

200
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,040
(I'm going to work hard so
that I can catch up)

201
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,960
(for the 20 years that I've lost.)

202
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,600
(Could you please give me a chance
and watch me?)

203
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,040

(will cheer me up greatly.)

211
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,320
(From Ko Mi-ran, a 31.5℃ cryonics woman.)

212
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,640
(Hello, I'm Ko Mi-ran.)

213
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,280
Mi-ran is terrific at problem-solving.

214
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,960
Who in the world uploaded
something so heinous?

215
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,840
What did they want in return?

216
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,600
They ought to be killed.

217
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,480
Did you and Mi-ran make up?

218
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,360
There was nothing to make up for.

219
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,160
What will you do about Byung-sim?

220
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,560
I had wanted to get a divorce,
but I changed my mind.

221
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,240
I refuse to divorce him.

222
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,400
He's a lunatic.

223
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,080
Let's see who'll win.

224
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,160
What does he want to do
with Mi-ran anyway?

225
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,720
How could he dare to live in her house?

226
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,640
Mi-ran isn't that pretty, you know?

227
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,680
So why is everyone so crazy about her?

228
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,800
I'm so mad.

229
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,120
What do you mean? "Everyone"?

230
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,400
What is it?

231
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,400
I think Ji-hun has a crush on her.

232
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,240
-What?
-I was too afraid to ask more.

233
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,760
But I saw a photo of them on his phone.

234
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,720
Ji-hun likes Mi-ran?

235
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,480
That's unbelievable.

236
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,480
A father and his son like the same woman?

237
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,960
-This is insane.
-Hey.

238
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,760
Don't say that.

239
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,560
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

240
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,240
Did you, perhaps,

241
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,760
wrote that?

242
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,920
Did you upload that?

243
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,920
What do you take me for?

244
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,920
Is my fury a joke to you?

245
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,280
To be honest,

246
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,079
I am Mi-ran's first love.

247
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,760
What?

248
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,640
I can't believe this man.

249
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,520
Enough with your nonsense.

250
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,160
How dare you move in here
when you have a family?

251
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,880
I'm not a truly married man.

252
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,200
I'm just similar to one.

253
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,359
We're preparing for a divorce.

254
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,079
What are you blabbering about? You!!

255
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,680
Calm down, will you?

256
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,160
-Don't be so crude.
-Gosh.

257
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,280
Let's hear him out.

258
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,400
What's there to listen to?

259
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
We're going to get divorced.

260
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,880
Go discuss that with your wife.

261
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,440
I'm going to get a divorce,
then start over with Mi-ran.

262
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,680
I mean it.

263
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,200
Father, I want to get Mi-ran
back in my life.

264
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,520
Honey.

265
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,240
Listen, you playboy professor.

266
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,000
-I'll call the police.
-Honey. Honey.

267
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,800
-Mom!
-Don't stop me.

268
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,280
The Internet is going crazy

269
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,200
about Mi-ran.

270
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,960
They found out she participated
in the cryonics experiment.

271
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
-What?
-What?

272
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,360
But they're all encouraging her.

273
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,000
There are

274
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,960
21,473 likes.

275
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,480
She's so awesome.

276
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,400
Here are the headlines for today.

277
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,800
("Chairman Lee Seok-du's wife,
Park Hyo-woo Dies from Heart Attack")

278
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,960
What is this?

279
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,920
Chairman Lee's wife died?

280
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,920
Yes. His wife Park Hyo Woo passed away

281
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,680
due to a heart attack.

282
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,280
What a sad coincidence.

283
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,880
The wife of the person
you wanted me to look into suddenly died.

284
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,600
We better go to her funeral.

285
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,160
It'll be a family-only funeral.

286
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,920
There is no information about it,

287
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,800
and the news came to us
through an unofficial route.

288
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,960
She died suddenly,

289
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,760
but I find it strange that
the police aren't investigating.

290
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,720
You recorded her voice then, right?

291
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,320
-I did.
-We should air it on the news.

292
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,080
She told me not to.
She asked me to keep it confidential.

293
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,800
No. If it's kept confidential,

294
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,440
the investigation won't happen.

295
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,520
We must find out who it is.

296
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,240
Did you get your memories back?

297
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
No.

298
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,800
I just remembered a snippet of it.

299
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,000
All I could remember was that
there was something like this.

300
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,960
I don't have all of my memories back.

301
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,160
In case

302
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,320
something happens to me,

303
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,240
you should hold onto this.

304
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,120
(I need to go somewhere.)

305
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,080
(There's less than two hours
until the defrosting.)

306
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,240
(I'll be back before then.)

307
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,480
(Help me, Professor Yoon.)

308
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,600
Professor Hwang.

309
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,960
Don't tell anyone that I'm here.

310
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,960
Even to Director Ma? He should know.

311
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,640
Yes. We should tell him.

312
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,120
I need to tell him
what I couldn't back then.

313
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,600
I need to tell him who tried to kill me.

314
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Professor Hwang.

315
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,800
Did your memories come back?

316
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,080
(Hello, I'm Ko Mi-ran.)

317
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,200
(From Ko Mi-ran, a 31.5℃ cryonics woman.)

318
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,640
Professor Hwang Gab-su is alive.

319
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,760
Professor Hwang needs
to regain his memories

320
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,320
for things to become clear.

321
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,280
(The person Detective Baek Young-tak
requested guards for)

322
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,840
(was Professor Hwang.)

323
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,600
Where has Hwang Gab-su been all this time?

324
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,240
Since he's an American citizen,

325
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,800
he doesn't have a residence in Korea.

326
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,080
He had been hiding in Ko Mi-ran's house.

327
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
"Ko Mi-ran"?

328
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,760
The cryonic woman?

329
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,040
Here's the confirmed list of those
who will be appearing on the show.

330
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,880
The assistant director is in charge

331
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,080
of paying the fees
and handling their schedules.

332
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
Yes, ma'am.

333
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,960
-Let's do our best.
-Okay.

334
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,960
(Ko Mi-ran, good job!)

335
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,080
Ko Mi-ran, good job.

336
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,480
(Confirmed Cast List,
Professor Hwang Dong-hyuk)

337
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,640
This Hwang Dong-hyuk isn't
the Hwang Byung-sim I know, right?

338
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,560
No way.

339
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,720
It can't be.

340
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,480
(Psychological Consultant)

341
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
What is it?

342
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,600
(Editing Room A)

343
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,000
-Hello?
(-Dong-chan.)

344
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,040
(I found the current address and phone
number of the person you asked for.)

345
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,480
-Did you really find the person?
(-I did.)

346
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,600
Can you text the information to me?

347
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,560
Okay. I'll call when I'm nearby. Bye.

348
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,960
Hey--

349
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,520
Who is that punk?

350
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,800
Who is she smiling at?

351
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,680
Why isn't she working?

352
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,000
Mi-ran, you...

353
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,560
I look so pathetic right now.

354
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,320
But...

355
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,320
-Should we keep on tracking it?
-Gosh.

356
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,480
You startled me!

357
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,480
Can you make some noise
before you talk to me?

358
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
You gave me a heart attack.

359
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,720
I made a sound when I spoke to you.

360
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,040
Then should I have yelled,
"Here I come" or something?

361
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,160
Who's that guy over there

362
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,480
smiling next to Mi-ran?

363
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,000
He's the newest intern in your team.

364
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,000
He's 1 of the 10 interns
that got in this time.

365
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,640
He's really smart and hardworking.

366
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,120
All the interns are gathered today.

367
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,320
-How old is that punk?
-He's in his first year.

368
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,600
What? He's 20?

369
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,480
By the way, why are you calling

370
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,440
someone's precious son a punk?

371
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,120
What happened to your personality?

372
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,440
Look at how much she's smiling
in front of that young man.

373
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,960
About that middle school student

374
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,280
I spoke with the owner of the ID
that posted about Mi-Ran,

375
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,320
and I've never heard someone
swear so much.

376
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,200
Every other word she said was a curse.

377
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,000
She said she'd find the person
who stole her ID

378
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,120
and pull out their eyeballs.
She made such a big deal.

379
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,960
She might find the culprit
on her own then.

380
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,400
-I think so.
-What are you saying?

381
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,440
Are you going to leave it to
that foul-mouthed student?

382
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,760
I'm happy that we'll be working together.

383
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,080
I'm still going to treat you the same.

384
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,840
You seemed special
from the moment I met you.

385
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,280
You're not like girls these days.

386
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,120
That's why I liked it.

387
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,480
Were you surprised?

388
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,480
Mi-ran, I'll help you.

389
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,440
Who cares if you're 44 or 24?

390
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,640
I'll treat you the same as before.

391
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,120
Thank you, Ji-hun.

392
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,160
I found out that my mom knows you.

393
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
I didn't want to ask, so I didn't.

394
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,720
But now I think I know.

395
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,200
You're my mom's friend, aren't you?

396
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,000
-Your mom?
-I think I heard about you from her.

397
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,360
She said that she and Aunt Kyung-ja
were close to another person,

398
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,440
but they suddenly disappeared.

399
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,360
Aunt Kyung-ja?

400
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,240
Is your mom's name Oh Young-sun?

401
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
Yes.

402
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,000
You're Young-sun's son?

403
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,040
Yes, Mi-ran. Isn't it funny?

404
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,520
Wait.

405
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Then...

406
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,080
Does that mean Hwang Byung-sim
is your father?

407
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,920
Yes, that's my dad's old name.

408
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,640
You know my dad as well?

409
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,320
Are you also friends with him?

410
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,200
So you're telling me

411
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,680
that you're Byung-sim's son?

412
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,680
Mi-ran.

413
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,520
Bring over a chair and sit down.

414
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,680
I have something to tell you.

415
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,520
Okay.

416
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,040
I probably should've
told you this earlier.

417
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,600
I'd like to tell you something in advance

418
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,560
as Dong-chan's former assistant director.

419
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Okay.

420
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,160
It's nice to see you take notes.

421
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,520
When you're
Dong-chan's assistant director,

422
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,680
there are moments
when you shouldn't be too honest.

423
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,440
First, when he asks,

424
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,920
"Are you tired?"

425
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,400
-Good work.
-Good work.

426
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,600
-Thanks, guys. -Good work.

427
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,920
-Good work.
-Good work.

428
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,320
Good work.

429
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,800
Are you tired?

430
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,560
Yes, I'm tired.

431
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,800
Do you think you're the only one?
I'm tired as well, you know.

432
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,080
Plus, you didn't even do anything.

433
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,000
If this is enough to make you tired,
how will you finish the rest of the shoot?

434
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,720
If that's the best you can do,
just quit your job.

435
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,960
Go home and watch TV as a viewer.

436
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,040
(Don't ever tell him that you're tired.)

437
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
Second,

438
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,520
if he asks, "What do you think
our ratings will be?"

439
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
What do you think our ratings will be?

440
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,320
About 15 percent?

441
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,600
We have three more months
until the show airs,

442
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,320
but your target is only 15 percent?

443
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,920
Are you saying you're only going
to work hard enough to reach 15 percent?

444
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,960
No, that's not it...

445
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,360
Are you working with me to make
a show that only gets 15 percent?

446
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,640
What do you take me for?

447
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
Do you want me to retire?

448
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,000
-No, that's not it.
-Then what is it?

449
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,680
You need to tell him a high number
even if it seems unrealistic.

450
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,480
Then he becomes happy
and starts complimenting you.

451
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,280
If you manage to evade all of those
situations,

452
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,280
he'll eventually be the first one
to get exhausted.

453
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,080
Dong-chan may not seem like it,

454
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,680
but he's not very persistent.

455
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,280
Oh, I see.

456
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,600
The questions he asks

457
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,760
are like the riddles of the Sphinx.

458
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,280
He doesn't even know the answers,

459
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,640
but he asks them anyway.
And if he doesn't like your answer,

460
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,520
he just sucks the life out of you.

461
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,520
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

462
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,080
By the way, do you know

463
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,600
who casted
Professor Hwang Dong-hyuk and why?

464
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,200
After Dong-chan saw
the absurd video clip he uploaded

465
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,760
on the official webpage of "Go Go 99",

466
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,440
Dong-chan thought
he'd be great for the show.

467
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,440
When you're a director of a variety show,

468
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,920
it's your job to cast peculiar organisms.

469
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,720
I personally don't think

470
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,480
it's a good idea.

471
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,760
Do you know him?

472
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,040
Well

473
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,240
-Why don't you reconsider--
-Wait.

474
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,120
Hello? Oh, really?

475
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,120
Did the stock price increase today?

476
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,960
Darn it. It declined?

477
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,960
But you told me it'll rise.

478
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,160
One, two.

479
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,600
Kim Jin?

480
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,280
Dong-chan!

481
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,560
I really wanted to
know how you were doing,

482
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,080
and I wanted to call,

483
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,600
but I promised the chief...

484
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,040
Oh, wait. He's the president now. Right?

485
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,920
Yes.

486
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,600
I promised him that
I'd never talk about the experiment.

487
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,280
I know. You don't have to explain.

488
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,440
This is so cool.

489
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,320
That experiment really wasn't a joke.

490
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,800
You look exactly
like you did 20 years ago.

491
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
I told you that it wasn't a joke.

492
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,200
To be honest,
I had my doubts about the experiment.

493
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,560
Everyone did.

494
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,440
You taught me how
to use a camera properly back then,

495
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,000
and that totally changed my life.

496
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,240
Thanks to you,

497
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,960
I managed to become
a successful photographer.

498
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,200
It was a confidential project.

499
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,440
I couldn't hire a proper cameraman,

500
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,440
and you seemed like
the most trustworthy guy.

501
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,760
I was right, wasn't I?

502
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,240
Although I didn't know
you'd keep quiet about it for 20 years.

503
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,960
But why did you want to see me?

504
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,680
By any chance,

505
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,840
do you still have the tape of
what you filmed then?

506
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,480
Okay, I'll call you back. Bye.

507
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,120
I wonder what's wrong.

508
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,080
Hello, everyone.

509
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,680
You're watching "Newsline",
and this is Na Ha-young.

510
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,800
A recent online post about Ko Mi-ran,

511
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,520
a participant of the cryonics experiment,

512
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,320
has caused a huge controversy.

513
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,800
Why did the broadcasting station
keep her identity a secret?

514
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,520
It was because the broadcasting station

515
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,560
wanted to protect her
from an unknown threat.

516
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,720
(This is a video of the explosion
of Professor Jo Gi-bum,)

517
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,760
(a core member of
the cryonics experiment.)

518
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,640
(Due to the informant's request,)

519
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,640
(we had been keeping
this video confidential,)

520
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,680
and we also didn't ask the police
for an official investigation.

521
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,040
However, we've come to a conclusion

522
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,880
that our main priority is
to protect everyone who was involved

523
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,520
in the cryonics experiment.

524
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,080
Therefore, we are now going
to reveal the informant's voice.

525
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,000
(I know who bombed Professor Jo's car.)

526
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,120
(I know who the culprit is.)

527
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,480
(No, don't do that.)

528
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,800
(I'll just meet you
at the broadcasting station.)

529
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,480
-What is this?
(-But there's one condition.)

530
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,360
-What's going on?
(-I want Director Ma Dong-chan)

531
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,480
(to come with you.)

532
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,120
(Please save my husband.
The cryonic capsule--)

533
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,160
Ever since this last phone call,

534
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,800
we haven't been able
to hear from the informant.

535
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,200
She is our only clue
to find out who's behind these threats.

536
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,200
If anyone happens to
recognize this woman's voice,

537
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,400
(please call the News Bureau at TBO
and tell us who she is.)

538
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,320
(Ko Mi-ran)

539
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,200
(The receiver cannot be reached.
Please leave a message--)

540
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,080
My gosh, why isn't she picking up?

541
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,120
I saw the news. Thanks for that.

542
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,679
"Thanks"?

543
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,760
You're talking to the news bureau chief.

544
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,560
-Ha-young.
-What do you think

545
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,000
would've happened to us

546
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,360
if I had stopped you
from doing that experiment,

547
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,560
and you didn't do it?

548
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,880
-There's no point in talking about that.
-Then what's worth talking about?

549
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,680
Are we not allowed to talk to each other

550
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,600
about anything else other than the news?

551
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,320
Do you know what the only regret
I have is?

552
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,720
It's not being able to stop you
from doing that experiment.

553
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,920
What about you?

554
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,080
Don't you regret it?

555
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
Ha-young.

556
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,800
From now on, don't look back.

557
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,520
Live a life that makes you happy.

558
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,640
(Ko Mi-ran)

559
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,840
(Cold-hearted Punk)

560
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,720
Hey, Mi-ran.

561
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,160
Mi-ran.

562
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,880
Where did she go?

563
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,600
(I think I have a cold.
I'm going to get some rest.)

564
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,280
(I think I have a cold.)

565
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,600
(I'm going to get some rest.)

566
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,800
Are you sure it's a cold?

567
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,280
Did you take the shot?

568
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
I did.

569
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,720
I'm relieved.

570
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,120
I guess

571
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,120
we catch colds

572
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,160
like everyone else.

573
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I guess

574
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,200
we can die

575
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,520
like everyone else.

576
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,560
But still,

577
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,320
you shouldn't get sick. I told you not to.

578
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,680
You really don't listen, do you?

579
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,560
Shouldn't we

580
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,840
keep a distance of 50cm?

581
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,560
We're too close now.

582
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
I can't be

583
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,080
any farther away from you.

584
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,440
Let's

585
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,960
just go with it.

586
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,160
Let's not feign ignorance.

587
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,120
Let's just

588
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,120
do this.

589
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,880
Mr. Ma.

590
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,480
Then

591
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,880
can I like you?

592
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,920
If I say no,

593
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,440
will you stop?

594
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,360
But

595
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,560
why are you always doing things first?

596
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,680
You shouldn't have said that first.

597
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,680
Then what should I do?

598
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,200
What do you mean?

599
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,920
You just need

600
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,440
to like me as well.

601
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Tell me.

602
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,800
There's something you need to tell me.

603
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,640
You go first.

604
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,520
You have something to tell me.

605
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,360
I have so much to say.

606
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,640
I don't know where to begin.

607
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,560
-So--
-How do Dad and Mi-ran

608
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,840
know each other?

609
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,960
What is their--

610
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,520
She's his first love.

611
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,600
Because of that friend of yours,

612
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,600
your dad wants to divorce me.

613
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,760
Do you like her?

614
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,040
No, right?

615
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,680
How could you?

616
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,000
You're not pretending
like it doesn't work, are you?

617
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,120
I'm not that type.

618
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,880
-It's too tight.
-Hold on.

619
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,600
Hold on.

620
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,560
There.

621
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,520
You can look at me like that
during the day,

622
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,240
but don't do it at night.

623
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,080
I'm much healthier than you think.

624
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,280
Hey, come on. Mi-ran.

625
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,640
Yes?

626
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,760
The face you see in the mirror

627
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,160
and the one I see are different.

628
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,440
You're pretty, so don't smile like that.

629
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,880
We're going to the location tomorrow,
so I'll come pick you up.

630
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,760
Sleep tight.
Don't forget your fever-reducing shot.

631
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,560
-Okay.
-Bye.

632
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,160
He said I'm pretty.

633
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,200
I'll keep it short.

634
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,320
What?

635
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,520
Cut the power supply off

636
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,280
for the cryonic capsules in your lab.

637
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,920
We need to make the cryonics experiment

638
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,080
a failed experiment.

639
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,440
I can't... I can't do that.

640
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,280
Then you'll die.

641
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,480
Not in a cryonic capsule,

642
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,960
but in a real freezer.

643
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,200
Why are you

644
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,200
doing this to me?

645
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,560
You don't have a choice.

646
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,560
Just do as I say.

647
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,240
If you don't do it, I'll do it myself.

648
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,040
The survivors, Ma Dong-chan and Ko Mi-ran,

649
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,000
will also die.

650
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,520
You're good. Let's go.

651
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,320
Hello?

652
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,320
(Is this Ms. Ko Mi-ran's phone?)

653
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,760
Yes, that's me.

654
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,080
(I'm a cultural communications professor,)

655
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,600
(Seo Hyun-jung.)

656
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,880
I see.

657
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,440
Hello.

658
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,800
Yes.

659
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,080
Really?

660
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,680
Yes. I'll think about it.

661
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,400
Okay.

662
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,280
I'll give you a call back at this number.

663
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,000
Okay. Thank you.

664
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,600
What is it? Is it good news?

665
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,360
You're smiling, so it must be good news.

666
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,720
I recently handed in a report
as an assignment.

667
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,560
The professor who read it

668
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,680
called to tell me that
I wrote it really well.

669
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,920
I guess professors
these days are really sincere.

670
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,320
Did she call you just to compliment you
about an assignment?

671
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,720
It's not about that.
She's going to publish a book of essays,

672
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,240
and she wants to add my writing in it.

673
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,680
She asked me to write something.

674
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,800
I was always a good writer.

675
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,200
What does she want you to write about?

676
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,840
An essay on love.

677
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,440
Do you even know what love is?

678
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,520
I don't think you do.

679
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,880
You've never kissed before.

680
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,040
To me, that counts as a kiss.

681
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,160
Not me.

682
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,160
I'll be waiting on the first floor.

683
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,840
Come down when you've settled in.

684
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,440
Come on in.

685
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,680
No, no.

686
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,920
Are you going to shower first?

687
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,840
I mean... Are you going to shower

688
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,320
before location scouting?

689
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:24,000
No.
I'm going to shower before I go to bed...

690
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,960
Right. Yes, people usually shower
before going to bed.

691
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,760
Don't look at me like that
at a place like this.

692
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,160
Not even during the day.

693
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,360
Professor Hwang.

694
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,800
You should never come back here again.

695
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,440
-I'm sorry?
-You're fired.

696
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,000
Starting today,
I'll be the one controlling the lab.

697
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,320
One moment.

698
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,440
Ms. Na, you should take this call.

699
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,840
Hello, this is Na Ha-young.

700
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,960
(I know whose voice it is.)

701
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,280
Okay. Go ahead.

702
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,600
Do you think we're going on a picnic?

703
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,880
Did you pack a portable charger?

704
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,000
I packed a camera
and something to write notes on too.

705
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,640
I'm a well-prepared assistant director.

706
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,960
Sure.

707
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,360
Your hat is covering up your face.

708
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,000
Let's go.

709
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,480
From there to over there,
people can walk...

710
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,600
Also...

711
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,600
-Should I take a picture?
-Yes.

712
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,920
The lake and the mountains
look really nice here,

713
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
so we should take a full shot here.

714
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,720
Hold on. Let me take a picture.

715
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,840
Okay.

716
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,080
Hello?

717
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,320
(-It's me.)
-Yes.

718
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,840
I received three tips
about the owner of the voice.

719
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,160
They all named the same person.

720
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,760
(It means that it's the right person.)

721
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,520
Who is it?

722
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,880
The wife of Chairman Lee Seok-du

723
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,400
of Unsung Group, Park Hyo-woo.

724
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,880
(Hello?)

725
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,640
Yes. I got it. I'll be right there.

726
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,080
Professor Jo,
I think we found out something

727
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,240
about one of the people inside
the cryonic capsules.

728
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,480
-It's--
(-Mr. Ma.)

729
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,760
I think Professor Hwang's
memories came back.

730
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,120
I have to go back to Seoul.

731
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,520
Did something happen?

732
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,920
A lot has happened.
I'll tell you when I get back.

733
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,080
Stay right in your room.

734
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,840
-Let me come with you.
-No.

735
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,440
Stay in your room
and get some rest until I return.

736
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,440
Don't open the door for anyone.

737
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,040
Then I'll keep on
scouting locations by myself.

738
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,520
No. What are you talking about?

739
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,520
You can't go around alone.

740
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,000
Let's go.

741
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,200
You didn't forward the documents
to the police, did you?

742
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:19,560
(Chief of News Bureau, Na Ha-young)

743
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,840
No.
(Chief of News Bureau, Na Ha-young)

744
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,480
Good. I need to double check something.

745
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,800
Also,

746
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,360
there's something I haven't told you.

747
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,360
Professor Hwang

748
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,400
is alive.

749
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,640
(But Professor Hwang
is acting a little weird.)

750
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,760
(He won't let me near
the cryonics laboratory.)

751
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,000
Professor Hwang.

752
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,880
What are you doing?

753
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,880
I need to destroy all these capsules.

754
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,680
This experiment is a failure.
It's a complete failure.

755
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,840
You guys will eventually die as well.

756
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,560
You can't live a normal life.

757
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,920
It's impossible! It just can't happen!

758
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,200
It's

759
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,760
all over.

760
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,000
Professor Hwang.

761
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,440
Can you

762
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,280
save us?

763
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,280
Can you

764
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,680
help the two of us

765
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,000
live normal lives?

766
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,280
So that we can love each other

767
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,200
and

768
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,800
roll around in bed and sleep together.

769
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,640
Please help us live

770
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,440
like normal people.

771
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,480
Please.

772
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,680
Who is it?

773
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,760
Mr. Ma, is that you?

774
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,800
I told you not to open the door
for anyone.

775
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,080
Did something happen?
