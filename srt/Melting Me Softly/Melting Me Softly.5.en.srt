8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,400
Did you know about it?

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,360
-About what?
-You knew about it

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,720
but didn't bother to look for me

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,080
like others in the broadcast station?

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,040
What did you do

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,560
when I disappeared?

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,200
Do you have the right to ask me that?

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,160
What?

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,480
You're the one who disappeared!

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,280
What could I have done?

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,039
I felt trapped in between walls.

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,080
How do you think I felt
after you disappeared?

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,000
Do you know what I went through

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,840
and how I longed for you for 20 years

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,120
How do you think I felt
when I was left alone?

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,720
I stayed in the News Bureau,
hoping for the news

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,080
to tell me that you were alive,

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,920
that you were found abroad.

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,759
But I didn't hear from you
for an entire year.

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,680
Years passed by after that.

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,640
Okay.

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,200
But I thought that you'd look for me.

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,640
You know what.

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,400
I was taken aback when
I read the investigation records.

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,039
Because you didn't mention anything about

33
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,080
my cryonics experiment in your statement.

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,160
Shouldn't you have acted
differently from others?

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,920
You shouldn't be like others
in the broadcast station.

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,400
You're right.

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,759
I pretended to be clueless
about your disappearance.

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,000
That's what I did.

39
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,960
I felt guilty about it
for the past 20 years.

40
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,280
There wasn't one day when I felt at ease.

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,840
I even thought that the news

42
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,320
of your death would put me at ease.

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,200
So what's your point?

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,640
Are you disappointed
that I came back alive?

45
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,400
Dong-chan.

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
Right.

47
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,440
It's all my fault, isn't it?

48
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,000
No one forced me to do it.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,440
I did it because I wanted to.

50
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,160
I shouldn't be doing this to you.

51
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,520
Let's forget it.

52
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,880
What should I do?

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,600
What should I do

54
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,600
to make you feel better?

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Why do you think that

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,440
I haven't gotten married yet?

57
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
(Promise me)

58
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,240
(that you'll come back alive)

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,760
(from the experiment.)

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,760
This is driving me crazy.

61
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
My gosh. It's so hot.

62
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
What...

63
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
What in the world am I doing?

64
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,200
Gosh, it's so hot.

(Episode 5: The Destiny of 31.5℃)

66
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,080
What? Does she want us to give her a job?

67
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,040
At this rate,
she'll want us to find her a husband.

68
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,520
That's disgusting! Stop biting your nails.

69
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,440
If we let her have a tantrum,
she won't know when to stop.

70
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,480
She wants 70 million dollars.

71
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,920
She's a weirdo that's hard to
come by these days.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,480
Hey, don't you think she'll forget about

73
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,720
the 70 million dollars
if we give her the job?

74
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,200
What do you think, Dong-chan?

75
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,760
A job at a broadcast station isn't a joke.

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,560
Mi-ran isn't qualified
for the regular process.

77
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,680
Her employment would be corrupted.

78
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,440
-Exactly.
-You're right.

79
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,120
It's unfair to take the opportunity away

80
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,040
from other job-seeking individuals too.

81
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,120
We are all against what she's asking for.

82
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,600
-Yes.
-Yes, indeed!

83
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,400
On top of that,
if we constantly come across her at work,

84
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,880
it'd get more difficult to
clear up the problem.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,040
-That's right.
-Yes!

86
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,240
That's why we have to decline.

87
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,240
We should be fair and square.

88
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,480
I'll persuade her.

89
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,360
Will she be persuaded?

90
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,600
Of course not.

91
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,240
Alright.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,240
Angry Mi-ran

93
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,120
will put on a show.

94
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
It won't be a huge deal.

95
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,360
She'll demand 70 million dollars
from the broadcast station

96
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
and get interviewed by the media.

97
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,360
She'll confess that
she was in a cryonic capsule

98
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,040
for 20 years and
claim that we hid the truth.

99
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,040
Every time she fails to get employed,

100
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,840
she'll blame us for her situation.

101
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,280
It'll probably take her
two years to get employed.

102
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,680
Every time she fails,
she'll take out her rage

103
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,640
on the media from all over the country.

104
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,240
Right. She majored in Chinese Literature.

105
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,600
The People's Daily...

106
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Does it still exist, Hyun-gi?

107
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,120
Anyway, it's obvious that

108
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,280
she'll start reporting
to the Chinese media

109
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,520
like The People's Daily.

110
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,160
She'll start appearing on television too.

111
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,200
Things will be out of control in China.

112
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,600
It won't be too big a problem

113
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,160
I'll meet up with her.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,720
What's with your faces?

115
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,159
You look like you never
anticipated any of this.

116
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,120
You're offering me an internship
for three months?

117
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,680
So you're just trying to test me first.

118
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,640
No, that's not what I mean.

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,440
You haven't graduated from university yet.

120
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,200
You need to finish school while you work.

121
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,680
I just want you to be careful
with your choice.

122
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,280
You can only find out if
working here is your cup of tea

123
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,680
until you give it try.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,480
Okay, then. I'll do as you say.

125
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,080
By the way, why do you want to work here?

126
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,520
To become the Variety Team's director.

127
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,560
Why is it Variety Team of all places?

128
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,280
The Variety Team director ruined my life.

129
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,240
It's my way of getting over the trauma.

130
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,240
I'm going to fight face to face.

131
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,080
All right. Give it a go.

132
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,080
Let's see if it'll heal
or worsen your trauma.

133
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,360
Don't you think
I might have a talent for it?

134
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,640
Not at all.

135
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,280
Prepare three variety show proposals.

136
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,760
Is that okay with you?
No, this is an order.

137
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,760
Sure thing. That's a piece of cake.

138
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,960
Anything else?

139
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
"A piece of cake"?

140
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,400
Make sure you do it properly
since this is your first hurdle.

141
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,160
Okay. Trust me on this one.

142
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,120
Hey...

143
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,720
Are you feeling ill by any chance?

144
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,080
My body

145
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,040
feels hot.

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,200
I can't sleep without a fan.

147
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,080
It's exhausting when my body feels hot.

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,640
Listen carefully to what I say.

149
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,800
Our temperature was 31.5℃ when we froze.

150
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,760
If we don't maintain that temperature,

151
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,240
we could be in danger.

152
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,320
Professor Hwang needs to regain

153
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,960
his memory to resolve this.

154
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,680
Because of the cold-active protein,

155
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,120
it could be fatal

156
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,440
if our temperature rises.

157
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,280
Then...

158
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,920
Do we have to continue living like this?

159
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,760
No. I'll think of something.

160
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,520
Just be careful until Professor Hwang

161
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,280
regains his memories.

162
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,960
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,560
You should be careful too.

164
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,400
The more I think about it...

165
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,840
We didn't do anything wrong.

166
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,040
I grabbed him by the collar

167
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,080
and stopped him from doing that project.

168
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,040
Remember?

169
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
You did.

170
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,120
But he was so stubborn.

171
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,040
That's why things ended up like this.

172
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,000
Why must I be the bad guy

173
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,840
and suffer from insomnia?

174
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,640
Why am I the one suffering?

175
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,280
I'm being unnecessarily conscientious

176
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,240
at a workplace.

177
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,360
Sir, the essence of this problem...

178
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,800
I mean, that isn't the root of our sin.

179
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,960
What?

180
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,960
"Root of our sin"?

181
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,800
We hid the truth.

182
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,480
When Dong-chan went missing,

183
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,920
we hid the incident to
avoid getting in trouble.

184
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,960
I was selfish.

185
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,920
But even if we could turn back time,

186
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
I'd choose to do the same.

187
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,360
Me too.

188
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,760
But if that rumor is true,

189
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,760
how hasn't he aged after 20 years?

190
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,760
His ID says his birth year is 1968.

191

Is that why Chief Son...

What is the truth?

Gosh. With a mysterious background,
he looks even more attractive.

194
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,320
It looks like

195
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,040
the cooling device was overrun.

196
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,760
The motor broke too.

What is all this?

199
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,120
Don't you think

200
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,040
there's something wrong with Mi-ran?

201
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,800
Of course. She can't be normal.

202
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,280
I better get some herbal medicine for her.

203
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,680
Her hands and feet are cold like ice.

204
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,960
It upsets me so much.

205
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,360
By the way,

206
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,040
there was that man
who was frozen with Mi-ran.

-The director?
-Yes.

208

We should meet up with his parents.

209
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,040
Shouldn't we discuss this matter together?

210
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,760
What's the use?

211
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,960
If they find out that
we acted oblivious to it all,

212
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,520
they'll be upset.

213
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,440
We couldn't help it then.

I'm sure they'll understand.

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
Don't you think that was unnecessary?

332
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,240
It's not like I said anything wrong.

333
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,760
Let's be honest.
My brother didn't force her.

334
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,280
Your daughter

335
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
willingly participated
so she could get paid.

336
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,840
That's enough.

337
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,840
As if he shot her with a tranquilizer

338
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,200
and put her in the capsule.

339
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,480
My gosh, how dare you talk like that?

340
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,680
I noticed your nice car earlier.

341
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,040
Our family ended up going broke!

342
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,360
Will you stop? Why would you say that?

343
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,800
We're not broke but we used to be

344
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,840
well-off.

345
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,840
It's not our daughter's fault
that you ended up like this.

346
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,520
Things would've been better

347
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
if you told us that our brother was alive.

348
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,960
Think about it.

349
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,000
You knew your daughter was still alive.

350
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,160
Thanks to that hope,

351
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,200
you were able to save up and become rich.

352
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,960
But we thought our brother was dead.

353
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,720
We were in despair and
ended up stone-broke.

354
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,880
This is the difference
between hope and despair.

355
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,520
My sister said something
right in 50 years.

356
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,480
We came here to come up with a solution.

357
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,400
Our daughter and your son
are in the same situation.

358
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,560
Don't you think we should discuss this?

359
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,720
Something is wrong with Mi-ran's health.

360
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,280
This is all because
of that crazy professor!

361
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,960
He better not run into me.

362
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,400
You'll get to see a different side of me.

363
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,800
Mom, please calm down.

364
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,560
He's the one who got Dong-chan
out of the capsule.

365
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,160
He shouldn't have put him inside
in the first place!

366
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,880
I'm not going to be easy on him either.

367
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,280
I can't forgive him for what he did.

368
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
My goodness.

369
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Who is that?

370
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,520
Students dropped your class
since it's the drop add period.

371
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,160
This happens every year anyway.

372
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,400
Hey, can you be a little considerate?

373
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,800
I get hurt too.

374
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,280
Don't assume that people like me
who have everything

375
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,160
don't get hurt.

376
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,960
I'm sorry.

377
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,080
Ko Mi-ran.

378
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,000
What's wrong, Professor?

379
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,720
-Hey.
-Yes?

380
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,520
Go up to that student

381
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,520
and ask her who her mother is.

382
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,560
What?

383
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,000
Do you think that's a bit rude?

384
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,200
Ask her if her mother's name is Ko Mi-ran.

385
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,080
-Hurry.
-Ko Mi-ran?

386
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,400
Don't waste time. Hurry!

387
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,840
-Hurry.
-Excuse me.

388
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Yes.

389
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,160
What did she say? Did you ask her?

390
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,320
Yes, it's not her mother's name.
Ko Mi-ran is her name

391
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
What?

392
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,400
What's going on?

393
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,720
What kind of absurd situation is this?

394
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,600
Wait a minute. Is she a time traveler?

395
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,720
Or...

396
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,800
Did she get reincarnated?

397
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,720
Mi-ran, did you come
all the way here for me?

398
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,400
Mi-ran.

399
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,240
I reincarnated

400
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,480
for you.

401
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,880
I did it just to meet you again.

402
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,720
Why would you do that for me?

403
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,360
You should've just forgotten
about a jerk like me.

404
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,360
You reincarnated

405
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,560
to live another life just for me?

406
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,880
You are a fool.

407
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,040
Do you like me that much?

408
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,200
You're the only one

409
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,400
I'll ever love

410
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,120
even in my next life.

411
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,120
Mi-ran!

412
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,040
My gosh, you're frozen!

413
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,160
You're frozen!

414
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Mi-ran!

415
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,000
Ko Mi-ran!

416
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,480
Professor Hwang!

417
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,560
Professor Hwang!

418
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,880
What's wrong with him?

419
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,400
He's shocked because
students dropped his class.

420
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,800
He fainted out of nowhere.

421
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,840
Professor Hwang.

422
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,920
Students drop your class all the time.

423
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,840
What's the big surprise?

424
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,800
Who was it?

425
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,040
My husband's teaching assistant.

426
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,720
He fainted at school.

427
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,040
How crazy.

428
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,760
His pants got dirty.
He wants me to bring new ones.

429
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,840
How did his pants get dirty from fainting?

430
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,360
Did he pee his pants?

431
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,680
I don't know.

432
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,040
You should've asked why he fainted.

433
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,840
He has a weak heart.

434
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,200
Why should I?
I just need to know that he's alive.

435
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,920
How are you so cold-hearted?

436
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,520
Is he alive?

437
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,720
Yes, I guess so.

438
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,040
I wasn't told to attend his funeral.

439
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,680
You sound disappointed.

440
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,480
Why are you still married to him?

441
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,480
He says he's seeing things
and started taking oriental medicine.

442
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,120
I think he fainted due to a drug overdose.

443
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,480
He has tons
of unknown drugs in his drawer.

444
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,160
Wait. Mi-ran went back to school.

445
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,360
She'll come across your husband.
She attends the same school.

446
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,800
Hey, he even changed his name.

447
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,520
He looks different too
after the plastic surgery.

448
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,280
Mi-ran won't recognize him.
But he will recognize her right away.

449
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,040
Gosh, Byung-sim will have a heart attack.

450
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,720
Why didn't I think of that?

451
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,200
Should we try visiting the campus?

452
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,360
Why bother?

453
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,400
Your husband fainted.
We can check up on him too.

454
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,280
I'm not a doctor. Is this a call house?

455
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,680
You mean "house call".

456
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,240
It's not a call house. It's a house call.

457
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,840
Gosh, you're so dumb.

458
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,280
I saw that on the Internet.

459
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,600
Isn't it hard to find them these days?

460
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,920
I guess she collects retro stuff.

461
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,360
I saw you in psychology last time.

462
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,680
You must've dropped it.

463
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,920
Yes, it was so boring.

464
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,680
I couldn't bear to sit there.

465
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,960
Did you drop it too?

466
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,640
Oh, yes.

467
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,120
That's great. I hope we get along.

468
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,440
By the way, who's the team leader?

469
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,120
Should we pick the oldest person?

470
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,720
(Chinese Literature 96, Ko Mi-ran)

471
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,320
Were you born in 1996?

472
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,680
(Chinese Literature 96, Ko Mi-ran)

473
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,360
You can just call me Mi-ran.

474
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,240
We should exchange phone numbers.

475
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,160
Let's discuss this in our chat room.

476
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,800
Let's talk about our homework too.

477
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,480
I have a limited amount
of calls that I can make.

478
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,080
If you tell me which room it is,

479
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,720
I'll go to that room straightaway.

480
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,080
But...

481
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,560
Do we have to reserve a room?

482
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,760
Are you kidding me?

483
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,040
Calm down. Director Ma is right.

484
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
This man needs his memory back

485
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
to cure our kids and solve all of this.

486
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,480
So get rid of him only after
he gets his memory back.

487
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,040
We have no room
for this old man at our place.

488
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,160
Then we'll let him stay at our place.

489
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,320
What are you talking about?

490
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,240
I'd rather beat him to death!

491
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,880
I won't let him stay at ours.

492
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,280
Then what else can we do?

493
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,480
What if something happens and
he ends up dying?

494
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,280
You're all being very blunt

495
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,160
when I'm sitting right in front of you.

496
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,360
I'm hungry.

497
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,680
My gosh, this is unbelievable.

498
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,160
How about this?

499
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,120
We'll let him sleep at our place.

500
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,720
Let him stay here during the day.

501
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,880
Director Ma asked us for a favor.

502
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,440
Come on. This guy is completely nuts.

503
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,120
How are we going to keep him here?

504
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,880
Mom, let's just do it.

505
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,360
Even the most useless person
can be of good use.

506
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,720
I'm sorry, Dong-chan.

507
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,400
But we had no choice.

508
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,440
You would've done the same.

509
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,920
Fine. Let's assume that I found you.

510
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,120
What would have changed?

511
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,040
The professor is gone

512
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,080
and no one else is capable of thawing you.

513
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,000
Is that why you didn't look for me?

514
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,560
I'll take responsibility for my mistakes.

515
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,440
You can take responsibility for yours.

516
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,600
We'll deal with this.

517
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,760
Dong-chan!

518
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,160
My gosh, come on. Sit down.

519
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,120
Take a seat.

520
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,760
Listen. Everything is intertwined

521
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,440
like a huge sweet potato vine.

522
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,520
Congressman Kim Si-seok is getting

523
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,200
elected for the second time.

524
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,640
He made the final decision as

525
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,800
the president
of the broadcast station then.

526
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,760
He dreamed of becoming a politician.

527
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,800
His dream came true.

528
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,360
All the higher-ups
of every broadcast station

529
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,480
unanimously agreed
that we should cover up what happened.

530
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,520
Even the chiefs and presidents
of other broadcast stations

531
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,080
So what? What's your point?

532
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,600
Please don't cause a fuss.

533
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,880
It won't do you any good.

534
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,640
You know that threats like that
don't work on me.

535
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,000
Hong-suk, you've forgotten what I'm like.

536
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,240
Dong-chan.

537
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,720
Let's forget about the past

538
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,480
and start a new life.

539
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,240
We'll do everything we can to compensate.

540
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,760
We're willing to pay you 20 years' worth

541
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,720
of your unreceived paycheck in a lump sum.

542
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,120
We'll also pay you 500,000 dollars
to compensate for the accident.

543
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,160
It will add up to be a huge amount.

544
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,680
Also,

545
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,480
this is my car.

546
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,360
The broadcast station provides

547
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,720
a company car along with a driver for me.

548
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,720
I don't need it.

549
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,920
So you can drive it.

550
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,640
The entire country is talking
about you right now.

551
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,560
The director comes back alive
after 20 years.

552
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,080
Where has he been?

553
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,720
Things will become
a huge mess at this rate.

554
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,960
So what?

555
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,320
What do you want me to do?
What are the conditions?

556
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,960
You're making it sound so superficial.

557
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,680
Well, the thing is...

558
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,440
We want to interview you on the news

559
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,920
and share your story.

560
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,640
Tell them you got tired

561
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,760
of making the same type of shows
and that you left.

562
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,160
But say your resignation letter
got rejected.

563
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,760
Say you just left irresponsibly
and apologize for it.

564
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,840
How does that sound?

565
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,200
Why would I do that?

566
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,360
Why would I lie?

567
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,560
Hey, think about your future.

568
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,920
Does this sound like a joke to you?

569
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,960
Think about your mother.

570
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,120
Think about your family.

571
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,520
How long do you want them to make

572
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,080
a living by selling stir-fried chicken?

573
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,800
You need to be realistic.

574
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,840
They don't sell stir-fried chicken.

575
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,880
They sell pork ribs.

576
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,280
What is this?

577
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,679
This should...

578
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,400
"Engine start"

579
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,520
Please enter your destination.

580
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,080
(Cell Phone Market)

581
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,360
What is she doing?

582
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,480
Why isn't it working?

583
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,120
Gosh.

584
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,760
What do you want to eat?

585
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,760
-Where are you right now?
-Carbonara.

586
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,360
Which country?

587
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,560
No, I wasn't talking to you.

588
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,600
-Carbonara.
-I'm at the school cafeteria.

589
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,960
I'll head over there then. Wait for me.

590
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,360
-Thank you.
-No problem.

591
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,680
Not you, Mr. Ma.

592
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,160
Not only are you handsome,
but you're nice too.

593
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,360
Not you, Mr. Ma.

594
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,720
I ordered it because of its unique name,

595
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,400
but it tastes as greasy as it sounds.

596
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,760
Hey, Mi-ran.

597
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,160
I know this might sound rude,

598
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,840
but are you from North Korea?

599
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,280
No.

600
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,440
Is this your last semester here?

601
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,000
-You must be stressed with job hunting.
-I might intern at a broadcast station.

602
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,400
-At TBO.
-Really?

603
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,160
It's difficult to get a job there.

604
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,440
Good luck.

605
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,960
Do you study Journalism
and Public Relations?

606
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,120
Yes.

607
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,920
We used to call it
Journalism and Broadcasting.

608
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,680
My professor majored in
Journalism and Broadcasting.

609
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,200
I can't believe it was during your time.

610
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,600
There's something strange about her.

611
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,520
Everything she has is authentic.

612
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,560
You don't have to be so formal with us.
You're four years older.

613
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,800
-Should I?
-Yes. As you wish.

614
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,880
All right, let's do that.
I won't be so formal.

615
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,040
-Okay.
-Okay.

616
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,320
Since we're casual and all,

617
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,440
can I have some of your bibimbap?

618
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,440
I can't eat this. It's way too greasy.

619
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,040
Why don't we switch dishes?

620
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
What?

621
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,320
How nice of you.

622
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,480
-What was your name again?
-Hwang Ji-hun.

623
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,400
I'm Baek Young-jun.

624
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,800
Ji-hun, how are you so sweet?

625
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,360
It seems like your parents
had you out of deep love.

626
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,120
You are

627
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,120
completely wrong.

628
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
What?

629
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
(Chunwoo Frozen Goods)

630
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,560
Idiot.

631
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,680
Why does she look so happy?

632
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,640
Can you spare some time for me, Ms. Ko?

633
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,160
I'll text you about our group project.

634
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,440
Okay. I'll wait for your text.

635
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,680
Okay.

636
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,760
-Bye, Mi-ran.
-Bye.

637
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,640
"Okay. I'll wait for your text."

638
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,600
-How old are they?
-Freshmen. Aren't they cute?

639
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,640
I guess but aren't they young
enough to be your sons?

640
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,520
What are you saying? I'm 24 years old.

641
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,720
Don't add 20 years to my life
when I didn't live through them.

642
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,760
If we do, you'd be so old.

643
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,960
Ma Dong-chan?

644
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,160
Yes. Who...

645
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,600
You majored in Journalism
and Broadcasting in 1987.

646
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,360
I'm Seo In-seok. The student rep.

647
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,560
Don't you remember me?

648
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,800
I don't think so.

649
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,600
It's so nice to see you, my friend.

650
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,840
Hey, hey.

651
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,520
There are people around.

652
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,040
Hey, hold on. Yes.

653
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,040
I saw the article about you.

654
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,840
"Director Returns After 20 Years".

655
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,480
You haven't changed at all.
How is this possible?

656
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,360
It just happened to be this way.

657
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,760
How have you been? Did you get married?

658
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,400
I did then got divorced.

659
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,720
I got remarried after that.

660
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,600
-You've been busy.
-Yes indeed.

661
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,320
I have a grandchild now.

662
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,880
I got married early.

663
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,440
I see.

664
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,360
I have to run to a class right now.

665
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,960
Let's meet sometime soon.

666
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,120
You should join the reunions.

667
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,800
-Okay. Don't forget your bag.
-Bye.

668
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,600
Bye.

669
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,640
It's so strange.

670
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,440
How can someone not age at all?

671
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,200
Gosh.

672
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,080
Are you our school graduate?

673
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,000
I told you about it. Don't you remember?

674
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,000
I paid you extra since you were my junior.

675
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,200
I don't remember it.

676
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,880
I wonder if they still have
the bench of self-reflection.

677
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,200
I think it was that way.

678
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,960
We should adapt to the new technology

679
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,520
and live like our generation.

680
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,160
Let's do that.

681
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,240
How are the proposals going?

682
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,720
Good.

683
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,600
When is our first meeting?
I finished my classes for today.

684
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,760
Do you have them now?

685
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,680
Yes.

686
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,920
Did you finish them already?

687
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,240
I told you that it's a piece of cake.

688
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
Hello?

689
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,240
Where? School?

690
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,040
Okay.

691
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,800
My friends are at school.

692
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,640
Meet me at the broadcast station later.

693
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,880
You should meet my friends.

694
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,000
-Why should I?
-Come on.

695
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,800
My friends are really pretty.

696
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
Let's go.

697
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,880
They're my university friends.

698
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,200
I see. Hello.

699
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,080
Hello, I'm Oh Young-sun.

700
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,880
Hello, I'm Park Kyung-ja.

701
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,160
I see. Hello.

702
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,520
Hello. Nice to meet you.

703
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,400
Yes, hello.

704
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,640
I have a lot of work to do,
so I'll get going.

705
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,160
Enjoy your time.

706
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,840
Great.

707
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,760
-Hello?
-Hey.

708
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,240
The license plate number can't be tracked.

709
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,840
We looked up his ID number.

710
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,760
We found out he's just a thug.

711
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,640
He has two similar criminal records.

712
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,000
They could be related to
Professor Hwang's case.

713
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,400
But they might not be.

714
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,000
Okay. Best of luck.

715
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,960
I have to go on-site.
I drove here, so I can't drink.

716
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,960
Do you still have to go on-site?

717
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,840
You should get promoted to chief.

718
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,880
You should stop drinking.
Dong-chan is back too.

719
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,880
I'm so sick of living.

720
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,280
You took the words right out of my mouth.

721
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,240
You two are something.

722
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,960
Why get a divorce when
you still see each other so often?

723
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,040
Just get married again

724
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,200
and please take her with you, Young-tak.

725
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,640
How could you say something that horrible?

726
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,000
I parted ways with her because
I wanted a decent life.

727
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,480
I'm finally enjoying my life.

728
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,200
That's so hideous.

729
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,120
Stop your darn nonsense
before I make a mess.

730
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,640
I told you to hold your mouth
when you're with me.

731
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,480
Only let out 20 percent
of what's in your head.

732
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
Right.

733
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,600
Guess who's in my house right now.

734
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,520
Professor Hwang.

735
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,680
The one who conducted
my brother's experiment.

736
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,480
He's with us here.

737
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,440
Look.

738
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,440
I told you to peel the onions a while ago,

739
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,040
Why haven't you finished it yet?

740
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,680
I'm crying so much.

741
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,280
I can't peel them anymore.

742
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,760
Is that why you got divorced?

743
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,160
Yes.

744
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,080
He cheated on me with
a wench as young as his daughter.

745
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,920
She was 24 years old.

746
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,440
How sickening.

747
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,280
Am I getting old?
I have trouble with reading these days.

748
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,120
I haven't been able to
thread a needle for a while.

749
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,360
Start a medication.

750
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,840
-Okay.
-Gosh.

751
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,080
Guess whom she got married to.

752
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,240
You'll be stunned when you find out.

753
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,120
Who is it?

754
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,000
Yes. I gave your pants to your assistant.

755
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,520
Your low blood pressure has
nothing to do with me.

756
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,680
Don't you dare faint on the street again

757
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,880
or I'll put you down the gutter.

758
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
Shut it.

759
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,240
Who was it? Your son?

760
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,680
My husband.

761
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,160
Gosh, why did you get so mad at him?

762
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,760
It's not like he committed a crime.

763
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,960
Exactly.

764
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,720
He's so annoying.

765
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,920
Don't throw a fit when

766
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,360
he fainted in the streets
from low blood pressure.

767
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,520
Be nice to him.

768
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,960
My life is ruined because of him.

769
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,960
Let me tell you who her husband is.

770
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,880
I guess people lose their minds sometimes.

771
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,040
I used to go out with a jerk like
Hwang Byung-sim too.

772
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,080
I mean, I still think

773
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,800
he was a total psycho.

774
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,240
I pity his wife the most in the world.

775
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,880
So be good to your husband.

776
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,440
It can't be worse than Byung-sim's wife.

777
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,400
Oh, right.

778
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,360
Can you teach me how to use this phone?

779
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,800
I don't have a good feeling about this.

780
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,400
We got caught tailing him.

781
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,400
We shouldn't keep following him.

782
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,840
We must fight fire with fire.

783
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,400
He let his guard down
because of what happened earlier.

784
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,120
He wouldn't even imagine
that we'd follow him again.

785
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,880
You have got to use your brain.

786
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,320
But how is he 52 years old?

787
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,240
I'm so fascinated about that too.

788
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,320
When I saw him from up close,

789
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,600
his skin was so fair and nice.

790
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,720
What exactly is our job?

791
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,080
What does our client want?

792
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,280
I've told you many times already.

793
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,600
We've got to make him tell us
where Professor Hwang is.

794
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,960
Who is that?

795
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,160
Gosh.

796
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,000
How am I supposed to know?

797
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,480
It's our client's secret.

798
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,680
Do you know who he is?

799
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,400
Darn.

800
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,000
By the way,
why did he go to the bookstore?

801
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,600
To buy books, of course.

802
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,120
-I guess.
-Yes.

803
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,840
You're being annoying these days.

804
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,200
Do you need a beating?

805
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,640
(Snow White)

806
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,120
(Three Little Pigs)

807
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,040
He's out.

808
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,680
Let's follow him without getting caught.

809
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,320
-All right.
-Thank you. Call me.

810
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,200
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

811
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,000
Goodbye.

812
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,960
I better keep it a secret
for the time being.

813
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,040
About Byung-sim and I.

814
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,640
I guess so.

815
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,600
(Cold-hearted Punk)

816
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,320
(I'm at the broadcast station right now.)

817
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,040
(Cold-hearted Punk)

818
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,760
How cute.

819
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,440
(Ko Mi-ran)

820
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,560
(Who am I?)

821
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,120
I was waiting for you

822
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,000
and was about to give up and leave.

823
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,000
What brought you here?

824
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,680
The president told me.

825
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,040
The news is at 9pm today. Can you make it?

826
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,760
I have to do it for everyone's sake.

827
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,040
Are you busy tomorrow?

828
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,440
Let's have dinner together.

829
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,760
Sorry.

830
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,600
I'm going back home early
for the time being.

831
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,920
I want to spend more time with my family.

832
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,240
Did you see this?

833
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,080
This is so fascinating.

834
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,680
You can buy things with just a click.

835
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,920
And this helps you to
translate foreign languages.

836
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,440
And this...

837
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,360
This...

838
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,640
Let me see your proposal.

839
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,720
Okay.

840
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,960
I won't accept your proposal,

841
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,640
but I'll accept your internship.

842
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,320
That's unfair.

843
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,720
What? Unfair?

844
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,080
Accept them both.

845
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,800
Are variety shows a joke to you?

846
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,440
Of course, variety shows have to be funny.

847
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,720
That's not what I mean.

848
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,640
A variety show proposal can't be done

849
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,040
so easily like this.

850
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,440
Why are you offering me
an internship then?

851
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,480
I think highly of your wits and spirit.

852
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,200
Why are you suddenly talking informally?

853
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,560
What did I say?
I accepted you as an intern.

854
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,040
-Yes.
-That means

855
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,040
you're my staff.

856
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,840
I'm training my college junior
who's a lot younger than me.

857
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,240
It'd be weird to be formal with you.

858
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,040
Got that.

859
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,160
Good.

860
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,320
I'll give you a week. Revise this.

861
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,440
Okay.

862
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,440
-Let's go.
-Where?

863
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,280
Professor Hwang is at my house.

864
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,320
Why?

865
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,360
Let's go out so I can explain it to you.

866
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,840
I'll explain it on our way.

867
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,640
We've decided to let him stay

868
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,440
with my family in the daytime
and at yours during the night.

869
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,440
My place at night?

870
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,320
Wait. Why is he staying at my place?

871
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,280
You're too fast.

872
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,040
Can't you tell me right now?

873
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,280
Why aren't you saying anything?

874
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,680
This phone can tell me directions too.

875
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,040
Is it you again?

876
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,120
Do you know him?

877
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,480
(Chunwoo Frozen Goods)

878
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,920
Why did they take away my phone?

879
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,240
I took so many photos with it.

880
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,240
In case we'd call the police.

881
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,520
By the way,

882
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,120
why did they lock us in the freezer truck?

883
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,760
-Of all cars.
-Tell me about it.

884
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,280
I guess they're incredibly stupid.

885
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,040
I'll call you back in ten minutes

886
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,120
and tell you the whereabouts
of Professor Hwang

887
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,160
along with my bank account number.

888
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,480
Okay, bye.

889
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,360
How long has it been?

890
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,520
35 minutes.

891
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,440
Maybe they're dead.

892
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,880
I hope they aren't.

893
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,240
Let's go somewhere

894
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,720
without Internet connections or CCTVs.

895
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,600
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

896
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,080
I'm hungry.

897
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,960
Should we eat those?

898
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,120
-What?
-It's genuine Korean-style raw beef.

899
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,640
(Chunwoo Frozen Goods)

900
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,680
I wonder if they're dead.

901
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,120
My gosh, it's freezing.

902
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,920
What's going on? Why do you look so fine?

903
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,000
I don't know where Professor Hwang is.

904
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,920
Watch the news. Professor Hwang is dead.

905
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,400
I don't know about the dead guy.

906
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,040
Just tell me about the one who's alive.

907
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,560
-Where's Professor Hwang?
-We don't know.

908
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,280
Why're you talking disrespectfully?

909
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,360
How dare you yell at me?

910
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,440
You should behave like a hostage.

911
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,080
-You darn little.
-Gosh.

912
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,600
Are you wearing a wig?

913
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,520
You're right. He is in disguise
so he won't get caught by me.

914
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,840
By the way, aren't you guys cold?

915
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,120
How is this possible?

916
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,240
Aren't you cold?

917
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,640
I'm cold.
I also need to go to the bathroom.

918
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,640
She needs to go to the bathroom.

919
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,920
Let her go. You can talk to me.

920
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,040
-No.
-Then let me go.

921
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,480
-Seriously?
-It's a joke.

922
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,880
How can you joke about that?

923
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:32,960
It was just a joke.

924
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,120
How can you make a joke
when we're kidnapped?

925
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,160
Is life a joke to you?

926
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,960
Is this worth getting angry over?

927
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,240
Are you only capable of expressing anger?

928
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,280
-Why are you always angry?
-That isn't true.

929
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,760
You're the cause of my anger anyway.

930
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,840
What? Why am I the cause...

931
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,120
Where is

932
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,440
Professor Hwang?

933
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,520
-We don't know! -We don't know!

934
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,960
-Hey, let go!
-Give me that!

935
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,280
Give it back!

936
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,960
My gosh!

00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,000
You little jerk!

938
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,080
You jerk!

939
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,920
You darn little...

940
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,040
Hey, my hair!

941
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,120
You little...

942
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,440
What just happened?

943
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,320
Hey! Give it back to me.

944

(Chunwoo Frozen Goods)

945
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,280
You weren't joking about
leaving me behind, right?

946
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,040
Gosh, it was a joke.

947
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,640
You weren't joking about
eating raw meat, right?

948
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,480
Of course not. I wasn't joking.

949
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,280
Are you an animal?

950
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,200
Are you having fun?

951
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,400
Your friend is in the back.

This is a refrigerated truck
with a license plate.

-Did you steal it?
-No...

954
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,000
I'm going to report you to the cops.
I'm a model citizen.

955
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,720
Bye.

956

of the hot temperature.

You don't need to check her temperature.

Give her a fever reducer shot.

973
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,000
Check her temperature.

974

I told you not to!
I'll take responsibility.

975
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,440
Give her a fever reducer shot.

976

We can't let her body temperature rise.

My dream is to earn a living.

01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,040
Good luck.

993
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,000
Will you be okay?

994
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,920
Yes.

995
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,040
Standby.

996
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,120
Hello, everyone.

997
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,320
I'm Na Ha-young. You're watching Newsline.

998
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,440
Here's our first news.

999
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,120
Do you remember Director Ma Dong-chan,

1000
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,760
the famous director who
disappeared 20 years ago?

1001
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,480
Many speculations are being made about

1002
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,400
what might've happened to him

1003
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,240
during the past 20 years.

1004
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,760
Today, Director Ma is with us right now

1005
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,360
at the studio

1006
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,600
and he's going tell us an answer
to all these speculations.

1007
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,680
Director Ma.

1008
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,440
I heard you came here to
tell us something.

1009
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,880
I am

1010
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,160
Ma Dong-chan, the first person to
survive a cryonics experiment.

1011
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,680
Hey!

1012
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,160
(Melting Me Softly)

1013
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,680
He's pretending that
he didn't come to see me

1014
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,480
when he's recognizable from afar.

1015
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,360
Do you think they're telling the truth?

1016
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,240
We should cover this first.

1017
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,800
My ability will be acknowledged

1018
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,760
and I'll be offered a full-time job.

1019
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,880
Have you ever thought
about why Director Ma

1020
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,480
is protecting that subject?

1021
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,040
I plan on protecting her.

1022
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,880
Because I'm partly responsible
for her life.

1023
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,120
If you mess with Mi-ran one more time,

1024
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,560
I'll kill you.

1025
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,320
Hey!

1026
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,560
Let's start over again.

1027
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,720
Our love hasn't ended yet.
