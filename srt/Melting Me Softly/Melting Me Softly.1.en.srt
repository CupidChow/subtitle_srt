00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,840
If I help you out,

10
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,760
will you really be able to
make a better world

11
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,000
like you just explained?

12
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,160
Of course.

13
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,880
But how exactly are you going to help me?

14
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,280
I'll help your experiment become a success

15
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,040
and show it to the entire world.

(July 28, 1999, 02:17:43)

25
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,640
You are now witnessing

26
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,240
the beginning of not only Korea,
but the world's

27
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,040
first-ever cryonics experiment.

28
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,680
The glass of the frozen capsule that
you're looking at right now

29
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,840
was made of polycarbonate
which can withstand

30
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,720
150 times more impact than tempered glass.

31
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,520
And this frozen capsule

32
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,680
was made with a new material
called Teratanium.

33
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,880
As you can see,
there are a total of six frozen capsules.

34
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,680
This cryonics experiment

35
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,040
is being carried out
with the consent of the subjects.

36
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,560
And 4 out of the 6 subjects’ identities

37
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,640
will be kept confidential.

38
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,120
Therefore, the actual subjects
of this experiment

39
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,680
are inside these two frozen capsules

40
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,040
The experiment hour is exactly 24 hours.

41
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,280
1 of the 2 subjects of this experiment

42
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,640
is Director Ma Dong-chan

43
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,760
who first planned this program.

44
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,120
And the other is

45
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,680
Wait. Let me change the battery.

46
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
Okay.

47
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,800
Are they going to be okay?

48
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,440
Of course. In 23 hours and 31 minutes,

49
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,760
we'll be a legend.

50
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,200
Okay.

51
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,600
Hyun-gi!

52
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,160
Why would you bring it now?

53
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,240
Mi-ran waited for this so much.

54
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,360
I'll have to give it to her
when she wakes up tomorrow.

55
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,560
It took a while
to get all four's autographs.

56
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,480
Good work.

57
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,040
Let's continue.

58
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,200
By the way, is it okay
for Mi-ran's face to be on air?

59
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,440
Yes, she gave permission.

60
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,360
A little closer.

61
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Hello?

62
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,560
(Is this Mi-ran?)

63
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,880
Yes.

64
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,000
(Hello. This is Mario Electronics.
You had an interview with us before.)

65
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,560
Oh, yes.

66
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,640
(Thank you very much for applying.)

67
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,800
No problem. It was a matter of course.

68
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,440
(Mi-ran. Thank you
for your interest in our company,)

69
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,920
(but you did not pass the interview.)

70
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,000
(I'm sorry.)

71
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,320
It's fine. It's not your fault
that I didn't get the job.

72
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,920
(I'm actually a manager at HR department.)

73
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,560
(It was also my opinion.)

74
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,520
(I won't forget
the Chinese song you sang.)

75
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,960
Why won't you forget?

76
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,360
Just forget it.

77
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,480
Also, if you're going to
give a call like this again,

78
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,280
you can just send a text.

79
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,400
I'm not exactly happy
to receive a call like this.

80
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,720
(-I don't even have time
-Okay. Bye.)

81
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,560
Seriously.

82
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,000
She only called to go on a power trip.

83
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,360
There must've been so little people
who didn't pass

84
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,480
that she calls every one of them.

85
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,680
It's annoying.

86
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,920
So you're saying you sang a Chinese song?

87
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,159
In an interview?

88
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,200
That is just crazy.

89
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,120
Because I applied to a foreign division.

90
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,000
Do you have any idea
how the big Chinese market is?

91
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,680
Is that why you sang a Chinese song?

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,680
Why didn't you just sing a pop song?

93
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,480
I told you to major in English.

94
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,720
She majored in Chinese because
she was crazy about Leslie Cheung.

95
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,320
Chinese is going to be the trend.

96
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,520
You'll see.

97
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,920
-I'm going to do this.
-Goodness.

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Just go on a blind date
after you graduate and get married.

99
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,600
Never ever.

100
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,520
Good job.

101
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,320
-Aren't I good?
-My goodness.

102
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,840
Who is it?

103
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,800
Eat up.

104
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,160
Hello?

105
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,000
Mi-ran. You got a call
from a broadcasting station.

106
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,200
Hurry up and answer.

107
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,880

108
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,760

109

Yes?

110
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,679
Are you going to the broadcasting station?

111
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,880
Yes.

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,040
Can I go with you?

113
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,760
Not today.

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,080
I promise you to take you next time.

115
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Mi-ran.

116
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,240
What?

117
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,960
When you go to the broadcasting station,

118
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,720
get me Fin.K.L's autograph.

119
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,800
Okay. I'll make sure to get it.

120
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,920
Really?

121
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,440
Yes, really. Pinky swear.

122
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,440
Pinky swear.

124

Promise me one thing too.

125
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,080
If anyone ever bullies you again,

126
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,480
you must tell me, okay?

127
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Yes.

128
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,200

129
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,760
Pinky swear again.

130
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,960
Pinky swear.

131
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,600
By the way, Mi-ran.

132
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,920

What? Up there?

138
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,680
You want me to film up there?

139
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,320
I think so.

140
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,560

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,720
(Director Ma Dong-chan
of "Infinite Experiment Paradise")

170
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,280
Well done.

171
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,840
Congratulations.

172
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,080
"Infinite Experiment Paradise" combined

173
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,320
the elements of variety shows.

174
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,200
It caught three hares by adding reality
and information

175
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,760
in a variety show.

176
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,960
It opened a new chapter for variety shows.

177
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,520
It set a new record of the highest
viewer rating of 41.3 percent.

178
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,640
It opened a new era of variety show.

179
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,000
At the Festival in Germany,

180
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,120
it also received
the Grand Award for non-drama section.

181
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,680
Executive Producer Ma Dong-chan is

182
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,840
-on the stage to receive the award.
-Congratulations.

183
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,120
Congratulations.

184
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,040
Oh, my.

185
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,360
He's got the look.

186
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,560
Thank you.

187
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,880
Since this award
was given to me by the viewers,

188
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,720
I will be brazen and take it right away.

189
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,160
Above all,

190
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,880
I thank many of our test subjects

191
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,800
who gladly participated
in the difficult experiments.

192
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,480
And I wish to thank

193
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,680
my girlfriend who is always beside me.

194
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,040
Mr. Ma, please don't leave yet.

195
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,240
After the success of your first project,

196
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,400
your second project was also a mega-hit.

197
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,480
What kind of a program
do you have in mind next?

198
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,440
I'm thinking of making a program

199
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,920
that no one else would want to do,
something that only I must do.

200
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,640
Is your girlfriend here?

201
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,440
That's...

202
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,080
(Variety Director of the Year,
Ma Dong-chan)

203
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,000
-Really?
-My gosh.

204
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,960
The narrator
of "Infinite Experiment Paradise",

205
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,000
Announcer Na Ha-young
is bringing some flowers for him.

206
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,120
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

207
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,320
This is my girlfriend.

208
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,600
Yes, Ha-young.

209
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,720
Oh, well...

210
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,720
He just fell asleep.

211
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,520
So what? You're going to
do the experiment yourself?

212
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,520
You're going to go into the capsule?

213
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,960
I read his paper for 3 nights and 4 days.

214
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,560
And I saw the video of the experiment too.

215
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,600
This is revolutionary.

216
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,640
I don't care if it's something
more important than that.

217
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,440
The documentary team is saying
it's reckless. This is nonsense!

218
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,760
That's exactly why I'm doing this.
Because it's reckless.

219
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,120
I have to do this
because no one else is doing it.

220
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,040
You must be insane.

221
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,360
Ha-young, I'm not just
making a TV program.

222
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,480
It's a historical mission.
Someone has to do this.

223
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,400
Okay, fine.

224
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,319
But why does it have to be you?

225
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,760
You can use another test subject
if you must.

226
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,960
How can the director
do the experiment on himself?

227
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,599
Freezing people?

228
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,000
I can't believe this.

229
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Ha-young.

230
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,280
Please trust me.
I never failed, not even once.

231
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,800
You really aren't

232
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,240
concerned about me, are you?

233
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,360
I have something to show you.

234
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,640
This video is from a month ago.

235
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,880
After the freezing experiment,
the dolphin is healthier

236
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,800
and is in a better biorhythm than before.

237
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,120
That's a dolphin, not a person.

238
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,600
We're both mammals.

239
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,760
Ha-young, I'm perfectly healthy.
So don't worry about it.

240
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,320
You easily get cold.

241
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,520
You don't turn on the air conditioner
even in summer,

242
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,000
and you hate taking a shower
with cold water.

243
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,600
I mean, look at you.

244
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,120
How can you be frozen for 24 hours?

245
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,920
That's not even possible.

246
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,440
Just 24 hours.

247
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,760
Can you wait for me for just 24 hours?
Please?

248
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,920
Dong-chan, here's the problem.

249
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,320
We don't have any female volunteer
who wants to participate.

250
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,080
You're looking for another participant?

251
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,040
Yes.

252
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,000
I mean, if the director does this alone,

253
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,640
people may say that it was fabricated.

254
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,920
Above all, I need a female subject
whose body structure is different

255
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,960
for my experiment to be more trustworthy.

256
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,760
Who would ever do that?
I mean, unless they're crazy.

257
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,920
Exactly. Is there anyone
who's crazy among our colleagues?

258
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,760
How can you joke around right now?

259
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Wait, Hyun-gi, what about her?
The one who did the water rocket.

260
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,760
-What about her?
-Oh, Mi-ran?

261
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
That's her name?

262
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,080
Come on, what's with you?

263
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,080
She does the experiments
as if she has 10 lives.

264
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,840
How can you still not memorize her name?

265
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,240
She's the number one contributor
for our program.

266
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,920
She does all the difficult experiments.

267
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,440
Come on, keep it up!

268
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,080
(Can you fly by using balloons?)

269
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,200
(In a buffet, how much food
can you pile on a dish?)

270
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,200
(It took her three weeks to heal
from spraining her leg)

271
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,560
(when she tried to pull
an eight-ton truck with a tire,)

272
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,720
(but she returned in three days
for the strong wind experiment.)

273
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,720
(She's that persistent.)

274
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,600
Oh, so you're asking me

275
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,440
to be frozen, isn't that right?

276
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,400
I mean, we aren't playing freeze tag.

277
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,160
You're telling me to really be frozen.

278
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,760
You're right.

279
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Unbelievable.

280
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,080
Do you know why I participated
in such absurd experiments?

281
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,760
Well, do you want to be a part
in the progress of broadcasting

282
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,520
-of this country
-Why would I want to do that?

283
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,640
You might say I wanted to challenge myself
to things others don't do.

284
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,040
No way.

285
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,760
It was because of money.

286
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,400
No one wanted to do those experiments,

287
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,440
so I did it because you offered me
a lot of money.

288
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,640
Man, this is really sad and heartbreaking.

289
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,400
Everyone works for money. Me too.

290
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,040
I often felt like my human rights
were completely violated.

291
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,000
It was like that
on the human rocket experiment.

292
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,520
After that day,

293
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,320
I keep having a dream that I drop
from the sky to the ground.

294
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,600
And yesterday in my dream,
I went through the ground

295
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,240
and fell into the mantle underground,

296
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,960
then completely burned to death.

297
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,160
If you burn to death in your dream,
it means good luck.

298
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,280
I will

299
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,120
never be a part of an experiment
of "Infinite Experiment Paradise".

300
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,760
You think I'm a joke
because I worked hard?

301
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,840
You're telling me to be frozen?

302
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,440
Mi-ran, it's a misunderstanding.
It's not like that!

303
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,800
Do you think I'm a frozen fish?

304
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,800
Mi-ran, hear me out before you get angry.

305
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,400
It's a really safe experiment.
I can prove it too.

306
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,400
Safe? You can prove it?

307
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,840
-Yes. -This is unbelievable.

308
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,240
I can't believe
that director who only has a pretty face.

309
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,680
If it's that safe, he can do it himself.

310
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,560
Tell him to do it himself!

311
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,440
He's doing it himself.

312
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,840
He's participating himself.

313
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,640
He's going into the capsule for 24 hours.

314
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,600
He's completely insane,
just as I expected.

315
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,080
Five million won.

316
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,760
You can meet the doctor and talk to him.

317
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,560
You might change your mind.

318
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,000
What doctor?

319
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,200
What do you think?
Do you trust the experiment now?

320
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,360
No way. That has to be fabricated.

321
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,840
I plan on publishing this
on the "Science" magazine.

322
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,800
It cannot be fabricated.

323
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,920
Do you know why the fish
in the South Pole never freeze?

324
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,760
It's because of the cryoprotective protein
that the fish has

325
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,840
which prevents them from getting frozen.

326
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,160
But there is a limit
to the amount of protein

327
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,720
we can get from the fish.

328
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,000
That's why I created a new type of
compound cryoprotective protein

329
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,520
that prevents

330
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,000
the modification of fatty acids.

331
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,800
This special protein
will minimize cytolysis

332
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,240
when the human gets defrosted.

333
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,000
It's the core technology
in raising the percentage of survival.

334
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,800
You created that yourself?

335
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,280
I did.

336
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,760
Then no one else
other than you can defrost me?

337
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,880
Currently, I am the only person
who can defrost

338
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
a human when they are frozen.

339
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,760
That's why Dong-chan
proposed this program.

340
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,840
And on top of that,
he's participating in the experiment.

341
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,400
Mi-ran, please consider our offer
in a positive light, please?

342
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,000
Thanks for showing me this.

343
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,640
But still, I'm not doing this.

344
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,320
Mi-ran. Mi-ran!

345
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,360
She's very bold.

346
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,360
Goodness.

347
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,400
-Dong-chan.
-Yes?

348
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,280
-It's Ko Mi-ran.
-What did she say?

349
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,680
She said she won't do it,

350
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,440
but she agreed to discuss it
with a professional.

351
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
A professional?

352
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,720
I need to make a really big decision soon.

353
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,240
What should I do?

354
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,040
What kind of decision?

355
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,200
You're a fortune teller.

356
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,200
You should know that before I tell you.

357
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,240
Should I do it or not?

358
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,200
How much is the pay?

359
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,760
-Five million won.
-What?

360
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,640
What's there to think about?
You should take the offer.

361
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,960
Should I do it instead?

362
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,760
My gosh, come on!

363
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,240
I'm here because

364
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,080
I came to ask if it'll be okay
for me to take the job.

365
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,800
And you're telling me to do it
just because it pays good money?

366
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,480
How could you say that
as a fortune teller?

367
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,840
Are you sure you can read the future?

368
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,640
Are you doubting me right now?

369
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,680
Let's be honest here.
You used to sell insurance.

370
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,360
And you suddenly opened this place
saying you got possessed.

371
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,520
Is this place even registered
as a legitimate business?

372
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,040
Hey!

373
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,680
There's no need to doubt that.

374
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,600
She got possessed by a baby ghost.

375
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,560
She's really good at fortune telling.

376
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,040
Last time, she told me
to be careful of fire in May.

377
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,720
And on May 5, Children's Day,

378
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,320
I almost got hit by a fire truck.

379
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,120
What does that have
anything to do with fire?

380
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,800
You should've watched out for cars,
you idiot.

381
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,920
-It's regarding fire, you stupid!
-I mean...

382
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,240
You little brats! Hey!

383
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,160
Tell me your date of birth and time.

384
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,640
I was born at 2:35 a.m
on February 14, 1976.

385
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,000
Just for your information,
she mostly handles adultery.

386
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,880
She's a fortune teller
who specializes in love.

387
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,840
I see something big.

388
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,240
I see this huge ball of luck
coming your way.

389
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,240
It's really one of a kind.

390
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,040
I've never seen this kind of luck

391
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,040
during my entire life as a fortune teller.

392
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,160
Does that mean I should take the offer?

393
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,400
Take the offer no matter what.

394
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,040
Your life will change completely.
Just do it!

395
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,920
Okay, I get it.

396
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,240
Then when exactly
will my golden days come?

397
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,320
20 years later,

398
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,320
you'll meet the love of your life,

399
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,200
and that's when
you'll meet your ball of luck.

400
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,760
But before that,
it's going to be really cold.

401
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,240
"20 years later"?

402
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,280
20 years later, I'll be 44 years old.

403
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,840
I need to keep living like this
until then?

404
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,520
I won't get a job,
and I won't have any money?

405
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,720
Does Mi-ran have a boyfriend?

406
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,320
I think she does.

407
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,560
He once followed her to the filming site.

408
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,240
Oh, really?

409
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,440
Then she might not be able to do it.

410
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,440
-Why?
-Her boyfriend will be against it.

411
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,360
What kind of guy would let his girlfriend

412
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,000
participate in an experiment like this?

413
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,720
What? What is it?

414
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,840
No, it's nothing.

415
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,320
I feel very confident
about this experiment,

416
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,320
but other people
will definitely think I'm crazy.

417
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,880
That's why I'm having such a hard time
trying to convince people.

418
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,760
At least you know that
people think you're crazy.

419
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,640
Of course. That's exactly why
I'm participating in this experiment.

420
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,120
I wouldn't do it if
everyone was convinced about it.

421
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,480
Are you that confident that it'll work?

422
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,960
Yes.

423
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,680
Why? Do you also have doubts about it?

424
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,360
I mean, I'm not saying I'm not confident.

425
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,720
But I'm not exactly
that sure about it either.

426
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,080
Maybe it's because
I majored in Korean Literature.

427
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,880
But I'm having a hard time trying to
understand

428
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,240
the concept of this entire experiment.

429
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,920
You don't deserve to be
the assistant director of this program.

430
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,480
I want you to reread the materials
and get your mind straight.

431
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,480
If you're still not convinced
about this experiment,

432
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,480
-I want you out of the project.
-No, wait!

433
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,080
Dong-chan, I'm totally convinced.

434
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,200
-Right?
-Yes.

435
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,400
Then you should do it too.
Let's both enter the capsule.

436
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,240
My gosh, that's...

437
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,520
Then who's going to be
in charge of the shoot?

438
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,120
Plus, I get cold really easily.

439
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,160
I have a weak immune system,
so it's easy for me to catch a cold.

440
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,440
That's not even funny.

441
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,560
I know, right?

442
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,480
By the way, did Mi-ran talk about it

443
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,880
with a professional?

444
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,080
She won't reply to my texts.

445
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,760
She keeps avoiding me.

446
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,640
Who exactly is that professional?

447
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,240
A fortune teller.

448
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Oh, a fortune... A fortune teller?

449
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,400
What's wrong with her?

450
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,680
What?

451
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,600
If she doesn't do it,
you can take her place.

452
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,040
My gosh, come on.

453
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,440
But there's one thing that bothers me.

454
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,120
Back when Professor Hwang studied biology
in the States,

455
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,480
his supervising professor
apparently got murdered.

456
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,920
But the problem is

457
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,760
that Professor Hwang
refuses to talk about that

458
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,600
even though I asked him

459
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,320
about his supervising professor
numerous times.

460
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,600
He never mentioned that
during the interview either.

461
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,360
Something feels odd.
I should look into this.

462
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,000
Hey, Ha-young.

463
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,120
Let's meet in front of the theater.
I'll go once I'm done recording.

464
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,760
Okay, see you later.

465
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,400
My gosh, that's disgusting.
Don't bite your nails.

466
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,000
Let's go inside.

467
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,160
(Dungshin Theater)

468
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,200
So what did the fortune teller
say about your future?

469
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,280
She told me I'll meet
the love of my life after 20 years.

470
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,640
"20 years"?

471
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,000
Then are you saying
I need to wait for 20 years?

472
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,040
As a psychology major, I personally think

473
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,560
fortune-telling is a business

474
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,840
that uses people's weak mentality
to make money.

475
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,760
Because people are weak,
we created a deity.

476
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,880
And fortune tellers
are merely a by-product

477
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,240
of the deity that we created.

478
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,600
All you need to do is trust me.

479
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,920
Okay.

480
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,480
By the way, did you start
teaching Professor Kim's daughter?

481
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,880
Yes, we already finished
two lessons last weekend.

482
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,720
How is she?

483
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,400
She's a homo sapiens

484
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,480
who's more familiar
with using her body than her brain.

485
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,880
I'll just have to put in a lot of work.

486
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,840
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

487
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,800
How beautiful.

488
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,920
How beautiful.

489
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,360
This is what Freud once said.

490
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,240
"Unexpressed emotions will never die."

491
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,600
"They are buried alive "

492
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,680
"and will come forth later
in uglier ways.”

493
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,720
Why does Freud
always make things sound so hard?

494
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,080
If he kept things nice and simple,
his books would sell a lot more.

495
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,080
It means you should always

496
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,240
be honest with your emotions
instead of suppressing them.

497
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,680
Let's

498
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,400
kiss each other

499
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,560
until we break our front teeth.

500
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,320
(Murderer Wanted,
Prison Breaker Shin Jang Won)

501
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,000
Nam-tae, what are you doing there?

502
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,920
Were you waiting for me?

503
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,720
Okay, let's go inside.

504
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,040
I have a question.

505
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,640
Why do you live such a difficult life?

506
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,280
There's always an easier route.

507
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,480
Why do you always try to do things
that other people don't do?

508
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,040
I...

509
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,760
do what my heart tells me to do.

510
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,800
Whatever that is.

511
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,200
I listen to my heart rather than my brain.

512
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,680
Until now and that's how it will be.

513
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,080
So at the moment I die,

514
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,600
I wouldn't regret.

515
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,080
The reason I love you

516
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,360
is so.

517
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,800
Promise me

518
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,080
to come back alive.

519
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,760
From the experiment.

520
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,679
Yes, I promise.

521
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
By the way, Hyun-gi.

522
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,520
-Aren't you curious?
-About what?

523
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,040
That.

524
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,600
It's none of your business.

525
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,280
Who knows? Freddie Mercury
might be lying there

526
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,800
or the former president.

527
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,800
Why don't you just become a writer?

528
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,400
I'm so curious.

529
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,320
Should I go take a look at it?

530
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
Take a look?

531
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,880
Goodness.

532
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,480
What do you think you're doing?

533
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,520
Oh, I...

534
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,440
I thought I made it very clear.

535
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,280
Well...

536
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,760
I was too curious.

537
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,480
Can't you just tell me?

538
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,840
I won't tell anyone else.

539
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,440
Do you want to stop shooting?

540
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,360
No. I'm sorry.

541
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,760
Hey. We need to organize the tapes.

542
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,080
Where are you?

543
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,760
Doctor!

544
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,040
Doctor!

545
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,840
Johnson. Johnson. Doctor Johnson!

546
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Johnson.

547
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,160
(Cryonics?)

548
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,680
That's for documentary,

549
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,760
not variety show.

550
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,600
Haven't you noticed a paradigm shift
in shows?

551
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,400
The borderline between variety shows
and documentary is falling.

552
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,440
That means a variety show director
could film a drama one day.

553
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,640
Nonsense. Is that possible?

554
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,200
What is the drama director going to do?

555
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,480
Sir.

556
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,680
Variety shows should no longer
be for entertainment only.

557
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,200
I'm doing the cryonics experiment
no matter what.

558
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,520
Gosh.

559
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,120
It's the first project

560
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,440
that no TV show
has ever tried in the world.

561
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,680
I know that.

562
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,200
I see what you're getting at.

563
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,680
Yes, it's good.

564
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,400
But Director Ma.
Let's just stay with what we normally did.

565
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,840
The energy of the whole universe
is focused on you.

566
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,120
Every time you touch it, it becomes a hit.

567
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,160
Even a commercial
was sold out under a director's name.

568
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,480
Let's just stay with a soft one.

569
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,520
That's the show the broadcasting station

570
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,160
and the public wants.

571
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,440
(Chief Director Kim Hong-suk)

572
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,560
Don't you agree?

573
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
Sir.

574
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,040
I believe at least
one broadcasting station must

575
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,520
accept the fate of creating a show
with a sense of duty.

576
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,240
The moment you feel a sense of duty,
you become a fool.

577
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,400
Someone's got to become a fool.

578
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,080
That one fool can awaken the nation.

579
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,880
Don't you need a fool who cares about

580
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,320
the value of a show rather than money?

581
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,120
Why do we have to be that fool?

582
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,160
Because no one wants to.

583
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,720
See? Why do you think no one wants to?

584
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,160
It's our fate.

585
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,440
It's not that they didn't. They couldn't.

586
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,160
Sure. Fine.

587
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,640
Then what about the budget?

588
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,080
Who would sponsor such a project?

589
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,200
Good. That's the essence of this show.

590
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,160
What that doctor needs right now

591
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,360
is the nation's cheer
and the national support.

592
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,480
Our station will play as the catalyst.

593
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,760
I'm saying,
let's develop cryonics technology

594
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,760
without foreign capital.

595
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,080
Sure. About that doctor,

596
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,640
many places are against him

597
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,880
for human rights reasons.

598
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,160
What if things go wrong
and get marked by the government?

599
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,800
Gosh!

600
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,160
-I knew it.
-Director Ma.

601
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,680
What did you say?

602
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,360
Hey, Ma Dong-chan!
Are you out of your mind?

603
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,120
Hong-suk. You think fair media

604
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
worries about the government?
That's authority's dog.

605
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,960
What? Dog?

606
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,280
Because you always lay low,

607
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,400
you do nothing
but sitting behind the desk.

608
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,840
Hong-suk.
Let's have our own identity, please!

609
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,280
Why are you so worried?

610
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,120
What? What did you say?

611
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,760
If our show makes the world a better place

612
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,800
even for a little,

613
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,320
that's what we should do.

614
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,800
I believe as many people as possible

615
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,120
should watch this cryonics project
and learn.

616
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,280
Why?

617
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,120
Because it's a revolution
to Korea's biotechnology.

618
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,080
In order to do that,
we need the nation's interest.

619
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,200
This is going to be legend.

620
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,760
It's going to be history.

621
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,360
Hong-suk. Let's record

622
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,840
that history.

623
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Legend?

624
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,000
Dear Chief Director.

625
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,120
Let's show the power
of Korean broadcasting.

626
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,400
Just trust and follow me.

627
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,240
Trust me.

628
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,760
Dong-chan. That was awesome.
You're the best.

629
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,400
Remember.

630
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,280
A director is not just a cameraman.

631
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,480
We must not forget
our sense of duty as a creator.

632
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,600
Sincerity over money and honor. Got it?

633
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,640
Sincerity. I'll keep that in mind.

634
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,760
Dong-chan. About Mi-ran.

635
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,960
-Ko Mi-ran.
-Ko Mi-ran?

636
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,320
The cryonics experiment subject

637
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,960
-candidate.
-Oh, the water rocket.

638
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,400
She said no.

639
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,280
No matter how much you persuade?

640
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,360
She said no firmly and decisively.

641
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,440
Because it could be life-threatening.

642
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,080
We must do whatever it takes
to persuade her.

643
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,240
Nothing works.

644
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,800
She said no even if the sky falls.

645
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,120
Hyun-gi. This is the greatest thing
that could make the sky fall.

646
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,600
Where is she now?

647
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,920
She said she's going to follow her friend
taking a profile photo.

648
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,880
Why does she do that?

649
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,600
Where is her friend
taking a profile photo?

650
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,560
I'll go meet her in person
and persuade her.

('99 X Generation Popular Songs)

652
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,680
-That's good.
-Be sexy.

653
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,960
-Sexy?
-1, 2, 3.

654
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,840
What a scene.

655
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,080
Come on. Put more effort.

656
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,640
I'm going to send it
to the matchmaking company.

657

Oh, that's right.

658
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,960
My arms hurt. Mi-ran,
can you take the pictures?

659
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,640
Just do whatever you can.

660
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,840
Okay, fine.

661
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,600
I'll pay you 1,000 won per hour.

662

The minimum wage is 1,525 won.

Hey, lose the flowers.

666
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,840
Come on, show me a smile.

667
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,080
Yes, over here. Stand over here.

668
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,360
Okay? Right there.

What's wrong? Did you take it?

673
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,840
Wait.

674
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,160
Gosh, darn it.

Hey, where is she?

677
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,120
Are you sure this is the park?

678
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,800

she said she was here.

Mi-ran Hey, Mi-ran! Mi-ran!

683
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,440
-What are you going to do?
-Hey!

684
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,520
-Mi-ran!
-What are you doing?

685

Hwang Byung-sim! Stop right there!

-Hey, step on it.
-What?

692
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,600
-What?
-Step on it!

693
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,040
-Step on it!
-Step on it!

694

You! Hwang Byung-sim!

695

-Mi-ran!
-What's going on?

698
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,800
Darn it.

-Mi-ran.
-Byung-sim.

-What?

Hey, step on it.

702
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,240
Why? What's going on?

703
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,680
Just step on it!

704
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,800
Hurry up.

705
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,080
-Hey, step on it!
-Step on it!

706
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,560
Stop right there!

707
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,880
Byung-sim, stop right there!

708
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,840
Come on, step on it.

-You!

-You!

711
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,400
-Stop!
-Freud once said this.

712
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,800
You're dead!

713
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,280
-You jerk!
-Step on it!

714
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,080
-You, stop right there.
-You jerk.

715
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,680
-You're dead.
-Stop right there!

716
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,080
Hey, Mi-ran.

717
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,240
What are you doing?

718
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,680
Hey, are you insane?

719
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,680
What if you fall in the water?

720
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,920
Don't try to stop me.

721
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'm a human rocket
that soared up 30m into the air.

722
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,960
I'll kill both of you today.

723
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,680
Hey, get closer!

724
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,360
-My gosh!
-My gosh!

725
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,800
Let's just talk it out.
This is wrong. Let's talk it out.

726
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,840
-What's going on?
-What's happening?

727
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,200
What is she doing?

728
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,960
Oh, gosh.

729
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,640
Dong-chan!

730
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,280
Help me! I won't do that...

731
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,920
-Help me!
-Can you do that?

732
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,920
Hello? Is this the police?

733
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,000
There's this crazy woman
who chased after us,

734
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,040
and she kicked my boyfriend in the face,
trying to kill him.

735
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,480
Please come quickly.

736
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,320
-Help me!
-Is that guy whom she kicked

737
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,680
her boyfriend?

738
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,200
-Help!
-I think so.

739
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,440
Man, is that what she's really like?

740
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,400
Look at how much anger
she has in her heart.

741
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,600
She definitely needs to
go somewhere cold to cool down.

742
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,600
She's a perfect candidate
for the cryonics experiment.

743
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,000
Don't you think so?

744
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,920
Don't you?

745
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,800
-Oh, sure. Right.
-Yes.

746
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,520
That was tough.

747
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,880
(Establishment of Law and Order)

748
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,400
The guy, your name?

749
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,000
Hwang Byung...

750
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,960
What? Byung-shin?

751
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,240
Darn it.

752
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,360
Byung-sim, not Shin.

753
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,600
Oh, Sim.

754
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,720
Just as we expected,
her boyfriend must have had an affair.

755
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,960
Are you saying this woman
is the only one who beat up this man?

756
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,000
Yes, I'm telling you.

757
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,000
That crazy woman
beat up my boyfriend to death.

758
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,840
That idiot, Byung-sim.

759
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,760
This is so frustrating.

760
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,680
Why did you beat him up?

761
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,760
You tell him yourself.

762
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,680
What? Okay.

763
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,920
Freud once said this.

764
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,040
"If your desires are suppressed,
your unconscious mind "

765
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,680
"will cause you to do the unexpected."

766
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,320
Freud, Pink Floyd, forget them,
and tell him what you think.

767
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,720
I had an affair.

768
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,680
-What?
-You crazy idiot.

769
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,240
Mr. Hwang, you're the one who's at fault.

770
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,040
Mi-ran, please hear me out.

771
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,240
I love you.

772
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,520
But I have so many identities within me.

773
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,800
And one of them is this dark evil that is
within me...

774
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,360
Did I hit you in the wrong place?

775
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,760
This drives me insane too.

776
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,200
I'm such a hot-blooded guy in his 20s,
so I end up doing this.

777
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,040
Life is short, and there are
too many pretty women out there.

778
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,600
-Freud said
-You're insane. Unbelievable.

779
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,800
Stop turning Freud into a punk
and just shut your mouth!

780
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,520
Let us overcome this hardship together.

781
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,040
Please? You love me too.

782
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,880
You're happy to be with me, don't you?

783
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,880
Mr. Hwang, what about me?

784
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,480
When I'm done with her,

785
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,720
-I'll talk to you.
-Okay.

786
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,040
Why did I never realize
that you're like this?

787
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,400
So why did you come to the park?

788
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,800
-What?
-If you hadn't come,

789
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,520
we would be in peace right now.

790
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,160
You're unbelievable!

791
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,920
Darn it. Hey!

792
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Why do you keep hitting him?

793
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,320
Didn't you say you're taking
the college entrance exam this year?

794
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,320
-Aren't you underage?
-This is my fifth retake.

795
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,800
I'm probably older than you.

796
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,840
What are you going to do?
Are you going to settle the case?

797
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,040
Mr. Hwang. Hey, Byung-sim,
don't settle the case.

798
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,280
A girl like her needs to learn her lesson.

799
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,120
-People keep settling the case
-Listen to her.

800
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,480
and she keeps making more victims
like you.

801
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,440
How dare you cry?

802
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,040
Hey, stop crying.

803
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,080
Did Freud tell you
to cry in times like these?

804
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,640
May I leave?

805
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,200
Do I have to wait here
until he stops crying?

Here.

810
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,520
Hyun-gi told me that you like this drink.

the broadcasting company gives out.

00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,360
I only drank it
because they gave it to me.

813
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,920
I really like free stuff.

814
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,400
Just for your information,

815
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,720
I hate this drink.

816
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,200
Oh, I see.

817
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,920
Anyway,

818
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,680
I should've gotten to know you better.

819
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,320
I'm sorry for doing it now.

820
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,640
Mi-ran.

821
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,720
What's your dream?

822
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,320
My dream is to earn a living.

823
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,840
It's to make decent money
and live a happy life.

824
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,120
You and I really do think alike.

825
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,560
Director Ma.

826
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,040
You're trying to convince me

827
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,720
to participate in the experiment,
aren't you?

828
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,320
Do you know how pretentious you look?

829
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,480
I can see you're having a hard time
putting on a fake smile.

830
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,480
Yes, you're right.

831
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,880
I came to convince you.

832
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,040
But

833
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,480
this smile isn't fake.
I can't put on a fake smile.

834
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,120
Mi-ran.

835
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,200
You don't need to do it
if you don't feel like it.

836
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,800
I went to the park to convince you,

837
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,320
and that's where I saw you
beat up your boyfriend.

838
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,440
You did a great job.

839
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,520
It was an impressive way to take revenge

840
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,960
on your cheating boyfriend.

841
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,880
I saw the anger
and your spirit of challenge

842
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,520
that lies deep in your heart.

843
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,560
It was so impressive that I actually
dreamt of you that night.

844
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,280
I guess you get impressed
by really weird things.

845
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,560
Or maybe you're a pervert.

846
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,120
Do you want to get abused
by someone or something?

847
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,160
I've lived my life

848
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,840
doing things that other people don't do.

849
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,720
And whenever I see someone similar,
my brain releases dopamine.

850
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,920
That's why I got interested
in the cryonics experiment.

851
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,360
I started to think

852
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,560
that we could cure people
who have incurable illnesses

853
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,640
if this experiment succeeds.

854
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,520
We can't cure them now,

855
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,640
but they might be able to
get cured in the future.

856
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,640
Isn't it incredible

857
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,480
that you can actually take part

858
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,400
in such a historical event?

859
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,840
Do you really think

860
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,360
they can get cured?

861
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,880
Just a second.

862
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,160
Nam-tae!

863
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,960
Nam-tae!

864
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,160
Nam-tae, where are you?

865
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,960
Nam-tae! Nam-tae!

866
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,360

867
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,480

Nam-tae!

869
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,960
-Nam-tae!
-Mi-ran.

870
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,520
What are you doing here?
Do you know how worried I was?

871
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Nam-tae.

872
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,120
If your bag got tied to the pole,

873
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,480
you could've just left the bag here
and come home.

874
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,960
Hey.

875
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,440
Mi-ran.

876
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,000
You don't need to do it
if you don't want to.

877
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,600
I'll just do it by myself.

878
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,520
I need to get going.

879
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,280
(I'll do it. I'll participate
in the experiment.)

880
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,480
(-I'm going to do it by myself.
-Why won't you let me do it?)

881
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,560
(Ask your parents for permission.
If they say no, you can't do it.)

882
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,920
I'm not a kid.

883
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,640
And what kind of parent
would let their child do that?

884
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,960
I'm going to do it no matter what,
so just keep that in mind.

885
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,960
But on one condition.

886
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,720
What's that?

887
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,680
Can I get autographs
from all the Fin.K.L members?

888
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,520
My little brother's a huge fan.

889
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,000
And I heard Leslie Cheung
will be visiting Korea next month.

890
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,680
Can you let me meet him?

891
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,400
(You know what's funny?)

892
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,240
Later on, Dong-chan wouldn't let her do it

893
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,120
while Mi-ran insisted on participating.

894
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,400
-They fought again because of that.
-Really?

895
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,400
They're both really crazy.

896
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,640
They're going to wake up
after 2 hours and 30 minutes.

897
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,240
I wonder how they would feel.

898
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,920
Dong-chan would want to go to
a sauna as soon as he gets out.

899
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,000
-I want you to leave right now.
-What?

900
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,440
You can't shoot anything from now on.

901
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,680
You need to leave.

902
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,200
What are you talking about?

903
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,720
We only have 2 hours and 30 minutes left.

904
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,600
You can't shoot the thawing process.

905
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,360
Come back after two hours.
You can shoot outside.

906
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,600
Get out of here. Hurry.

907
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,560
He won't let you shoot?
Are you kidding me?

908
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,600
I guess he doesn't want to leak
the thawing process.

909
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,800
Well...

910
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,800
It'll be like leaking
confidential information.

911
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,920
Hyun-gi, do you think
something went wrong?

912
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,480
My gosh, no way. You don't need to worry.

913
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,240
That's the only part that
he won't let us shoot.

914
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,680
Director Ma will come back no matter what.

915
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,840
You know how famous restaurant owners

916
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,600
don't even share their secret recipe
with their daughters-in-law?

917
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,240
It's kind of similar to that.

918
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,640
Are you sure?

919
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,720
If this goes wrong,
we'll all lose our jobs.

920
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,040
Yes, of course. Don't worry.

921
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,280
Tell Director Ma to come see me
as soon as he wakes up.

922
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,120
Okay, I'll do that.

923
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,400
Professor Hwang, are you going somewhere?

924
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,920
There's somewhere I need to go.

925
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,080
But we need to thaw their bodies
in less than two hours.

926
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,400
I'll be back before then.

927
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,720
I want you to keep an eye on the capsules.

928
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,120

929
