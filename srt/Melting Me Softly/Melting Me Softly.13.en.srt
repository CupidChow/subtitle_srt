1
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,880
(All characters, organizations,
places, cases, and incidents...)

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,080
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,920
-It's starting.
-Okay, everyone.

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,480
("Go Go 99")

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,760
-I'm so nervous.
-We're finally watching the show.

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,560
I love the introduction.

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,760
-(I am ground, introduce yourself.)
-(I am ground, introduce yourself.)

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,200
During my childhood
I once had a beautiful dream

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,920
(Let's Go Back to 1999! "Go Go 99")

10
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,240
-What's going on?
-What's this?

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,280
-Something's wrong.
-What's the matter?

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,280
(Please save my husband.
The cryonic capsule...)

13
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,000
(What happened to her...)

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,400
(on that night of 2019?)

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,160
(What happened to her
on that night of 2019?)

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,400
-Shouldn't we stop this?
-No, let's leave it.

17
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,440
(What happened to her
on that night of 2019?)

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,360
(On that night of 1999,)

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,039
(we were waiting to be thawed
after having participated...)

20
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,960
(in the experiment for 24 hours.)

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,080
(But what in the world happened
to us that night?)

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,880
(The two incidents may seem
totally irrelevant from each other.)

23
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,000
He's...

24
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,360
(But this guy was behind both incidents.)

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,640
(He's Lee Hyeong-du,
the younger brother...)

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,160
(of Unsung Group's chairman, Lee Seok-du.)

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
What the...

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,880
My goodness.

29
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,079
(Hello?)

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,920
(You're whom?)

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,800
(You're Mr. Lee Seok-du's twin brother?)

32
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,760
(I was never told that he has
a twin brother.)

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,480
A blood transfusion?

34
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,240
(We need his guardian's approval
in order to thaw him.)

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,160
-What is all this?
-(No.)

36
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,400
(You can't enter the cryonics lab.)

37
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,600
(No, I'll...)

38
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,120
(I'll just go to where you are.)

39
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,600
(Professor Hwang left the lab
after he received that call.)

40
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,480
(Then he got into an accident.)

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,960
Is that really true?

42
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,640
(I am...)

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,520
(the real Lee Seok-du.)

44
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,040
Oh, my gosh.

45
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,920
Did you just hear that?

46
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,000
(The current chairman of Unsung Group...)

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,520
(is Lee Hyeong-du, the twin brother
of Lee Seok-du.)

48
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,640
(The person we all think is
Lee Seok-du...)

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,800
(isn't actually the real Lee Seok-du.)

50
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,360
-My gosh.
-This is unbelievable.

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,360
(Produced and directed by Ma Dong-chan)

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,640
Once a person is born,

53
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,920
we should make the world better than
the one they were born into.

54
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,720
(Episode 13: The Truth, Too Late)

55
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,360
How can you not tell me a thing...

56
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,320
after you have done something so huge?

57
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,640
What do I mean to you anyway?

58
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,680
If I told you before,
you wouldn't have let me do it.

59
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,960
You would've stopped me.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,600
Why would I? You would have all
of my support.

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,240
It's a revolutionary accident.

62
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,720
You shouldn't think such actions are cool.

63
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
Let me give you advice as a director.

64
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,360
Don't ever create such trouble.

65
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,400
It's something you should never do.

66
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,120
Unbelievable.

67
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,280
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

68
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,360
Make sure you talk to me before you do
anything from now on.

69
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,520
-Everything.
-Okay.

70
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,960
I'll tell you everything. Anything.

71
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,080
You can't just smile your way
through life.

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,640
I guess he can still sleep well
after what he has done.

73
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,000
Mr. Ma, please look this way.

74
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,840
-This way, too.
-Please look this way.

75
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,520
-Turn around.
-Please take a look at us.

76
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,200
-Look over here.
-Look this way, please.

77
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
-This way, please.
-Can you turn around?

78
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,320
Please say something.

79
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,400
Say something.

80
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm Ma Dong-sik, who almost became
a world-renowned pianist.

81
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,159
-Who's that?
-That's not him.

82
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,680
-Where's Mr. Ma Dong-chan?
-It's not him.

83
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,400
-That's not him.
-He's just an old guy.

84
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,840
Who's that?

85
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,920
I've never seen such chaos before.

86
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,560
What's your uncle doing in this situation?

87
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,960
He's pretending to be pretty.

88
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,120
Pretending to be pretty?

89
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,200
Yes, okay. Fine.

90
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,360
This is only the beginning.
It's me, Ma Dong-chan.

91
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,800
(You broke the rules on fair reporting...)

92
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,680
and controlling public opinion
on internal affairs.

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,960
You will be disciplined
as an associate member...

94
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720
of the broadcasting industry.

95
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
Any objections?

96
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,000
No, nothing.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,960
I'll take responsibility
for everything regarding the program.

98
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,280
Mr. Ma.

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,760
I'm very disappointed that you used
network TV as your personal channel.

100
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
Don't you regret this?

101
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,280
I don't.

102
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,880
I don't want to live my life...

103
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,400
hiding the truth I know...

104
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,920
because I'm afraid of my well-being
and fear.

105
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,440
I only did what I had to do.

106
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,760
You say that I used it
as a personal channel,

107
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,280
but I am proud to tell you that...

108
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,440
I used this program
for the public good above all things.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,920
We destroyed all of those tapes.

110
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,640
Where did he find those?

111
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,920
I forgot to take the tape
from the camera...

112
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,760
which the floor director Kim Jin...

113
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,640
put up on the ceiling.

114
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,680
I had no idea he kept that with him.

115
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
I guess there's no such thing
as a perfect crime.

116
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,400
If they keep digging...

117
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,880
deeper and deeper into the case
that was shown on TV,

118
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,520
what do you think they'll find?

119
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,680
They'll find us.

120
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Isn't that over already?

121
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,480
It'll only be over once we're dead.

122
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,000
You two are together again?

123
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,800
Hey.

124
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,760
I have something to discuss with you.

125
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,920
What do you mean, fabricated?

126
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,520
Mr. Lee Seok-du woke up.

127
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,120
I hid him away very well.

128
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,440
Where is he?

129
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,680
How can I trust you
and tell you everything?

130
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,560
All kinds of conspiracy theories
and rumors are...

131
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,360
getting uploaded by the minute.

132
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,360
Is that why you're trying to come up
with a plan...

133
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,880
to play along with one of those rumors?

134
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,440
That's not what I mean.

135
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,080
Both of you will be summoned...

136
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,520
once the prosecution begins
their investigation.

137
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Then just tell them the truth...

138
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,400
and avoid getting humiliated later.

139
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,520
What are you talking about?

140
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,919
Tell them the truth about what?

141
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,600
How the network completely covered up...

142
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,320
my disappearance because you thought
Professor Hwang was dead.

143
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,440
They can't start investigating unless
you tell them that.

144
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,320
Oh, don't worry about it.

145
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,120
I'm sure you won't get locked up.

146
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,800
The statutory limitation is over.
Keep up your spirit.

147
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,560
Hey, keep up your spirit.

148
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,120
Wait.

149
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,480
Why didn't we know that?

150
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,600
Ma Dong-chan.

151
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,280
An emergency board meeting
has been called.

152
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,160
(Unsung Group Temporary Board Meeting)

153
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,560
(Unsung Group Temporary Board Meeting)

154
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,640
Are the rumors true, then?

155
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,080
-The chairman's scandal?
-Tell him to come!

156
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
-Where is he?
-Tell him to be here.

157
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,480
Just call him here.

158
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,120
Hello, everyone. It's Lee Seok-du.

159
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,640
Unsung Group and I suffered huge damage
to our image...

160
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,680
because a TV network director...

161
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,600
spread false rumors.

162
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,960
Do you have clear evidence that can prove
the rumors are false?

163
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,760
How can you prove that you are truly
Lee Seok-du?

164
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,440
Then how will anyone provide
the evidence...

165
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,960
that I'm not Lee Seok-du?

166
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,160
You're right.

167
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,040
As you've seen on TV, back in 1999,

168
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,400
I stopped by at the cryonics lab...

169
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,280
to see my younger brother,

170
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,800
Lee Hyeong-du, who was in
the cryonic capsule.

171
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,200
His younger brother?

172
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Then who is this man that he claimed
he is Lee Seok-du?

173
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,920
That video has been forged.

174
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,280
It's fabricated.

175
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,240
Then where is Mr. Lee Hyeong-du
at this moment?

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,360
I'm glad you woke up
without any complications, Hyeong-du.

177
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,120
I am...

178
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,120
Lee Seok-du.

179
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,840
-What?
-He's saying it's him.

180
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,360
My brother isn't
in his normal condition yet.

181
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,520
You've been fooled.

182
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,080
I'm your real father.

183
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,680
My mom told me...

184
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,120
that my father is in a cryonic capsule...

185
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
because of side effects
from a blood transfusion.

186
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,480
When did she tell you that?

187
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
Right before when she came to Korea,

188
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,800
as soon as she found out that
some people woke up...

189
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,480
from the cryonic capsule.

190
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,920
And after a little while,
my mother passed away.

191
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,040
-That's pretty convincing.
-What's going on?

192
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,320
You killed her!

193
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,040
What your mother said is all false.

194
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,120
She was suffering from serious depression.

195
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,280
She also passed away...

196
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,280
from a heart attack due to drug overdose.

197
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,280
Do not be fooled by this man's show.

198
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,600
Is he really lying?

199
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,760
-Forget that.
-What's going on here?

200
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,320
Maybe he's telling the truth.

201
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,960
So which one is the real one?

202
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
-Exactly.
-I can't believe this.

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,560
I am the company's lawyer
who was there 21 years ago,

204
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,800
when Chairman Lee Yang-gon...

205
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,440
passed his position over to his son,
Lee Seok-du.

206
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,560
At that time, the chairman...

207
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,320
left an important a word with Seok-du...

208
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,480
to let him become
a trustworthy businessman.

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,960
It was absolutely unforgettable.

210
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,640
Can you tell me what that was?

211
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,040
He asked me...

212
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,760
to keep Unsung Pharmaceutical
without selling it overseas...

213
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,600
even if it suffers from loss.

214
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,640
He told me to make sure...

215
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,680
I keep Unsung Pharmaceutical with us.

216
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,600
Chairman Lee.

217
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,920
-What?
-Then he's the real one?

218
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,640
-Is he the real chairman?
-Then who is he?

219
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,480
-Who's that guy?
-What's with him?

220
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,000
That means he's the real one.

221
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,080
Lee Hyeong-du.
You're under emergency arrest...

222
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,400
for attempting the murder of Park Hyo-woo
and Jung Hyun-sung.

223
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,520
-What?
-My goodness.

224
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,640
-I can't believe this.
-My gosh.

225
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,280
How can this be?

226
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,080
-Unbelievable.

00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,320
Professor Hwang.

237
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,360
Are you all right?

238
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,600
What about Mr. Ma and Ms. Ko?

239
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,920
What happened to the side effects
from protein mutation?

240
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,680
I found a solution.

241
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,400
I knew you'd find it.

242
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,920
Professor Hwang, I think you should get
some rest first.

243
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,600
I need to hurry and finish making
the reagent...

244
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,200
to make their body temperatures normal.

245
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,960
For Lee Seok-du who came back alive,

246
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,400
and...

247
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,840
for the couple too.

248
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,880
You spoke to Lee Hyeong-du
on the phone 18 times,

249
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
and you met him over 3 times.

250
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,360
Out of the files...

251
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,840
from your phone which was handed in
as evidence,

252
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,840
there was a recorded file
from Lee Hyeong-du.

253
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,920
What is this?

254
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,080
(Put Ko Mi-ran back into
the cryonic capsule.)

255
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,600
(That's our deal.)

256
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Why did you say this?

257
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,960
If you don't answer,
it'll give you a disadvantage.

258
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,920
What you're saying is it was Lee Hyeong-du
20 years ago...

259
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,480
who called out Professor Hwang...

260
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,800
and caused a problem.

261
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,160
Yes, that's right.

262
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,440
You mean it was Lee Hyeong-du...

263
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,080
who also recently abducted
Professor Hwang, right?

264
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,760
Yes. I'll hand in the related evidence.

265
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,800
Also, I'll also forward you
other reference materials...

266
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,680
I couldn't fit into the 55-minute runtime.

267

268

I'm running out of time.

269
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,560
Please help me.

270
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
(Why must I...)

271
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,760
(get shook up over a single word
from you?)

272
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,400
(When you asked me for help,)

273
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,800
(I shattered to pieces,
and I lost ground.)

274
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,880
(Why am I like this?)

275
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,720
(Ma Dong-chan.)

276
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,600
(I want to free myself from you.)

277
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,960
Why did you do that?

278
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,560
I couldn't stand it.

279
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,880
I was constantly going in
and out of prison,

280
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,920
while you were recognized by Father
when you met him later.

281
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,040
That's why I thought...

282
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,560
I should become Lee Seok-du.

283
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,240
I decided to steal
Lee Seok-du's life whole.

284
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
Hyeong-du.

285
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,400
That night 21 years ago,

286
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
I thought I got rid of you.

287
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
Honey!

288
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,200
(The only people who could
give you blood...)

289
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,040
(were me and Jung-woo
since you're a rare type.)

290
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,960
(Jung-woo was too young then,)

291
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,720
(so it'd be too dangerous for him
to give you blood.)

292
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,920
(I thought you'd die...)

293
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,720
(as long as I didn't show up.)

294
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,680
(I never imagined Mother and your wife...)

295
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,160
(would put you inside a cryonic capsule
as you were dying.)

296
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,320
It was still fine...

297
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,920
because I was already Lee Seok-du.

298
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,520
But,

299
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,960
when Ma Dong-chan woke up,

300
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,600
everything got messy.

301
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,160
You people...

302
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,040
should have stayed frozen forever.

303
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,520
Dong-chan just arrived at the station.

304
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,560
Really?

305
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,240
-You're cool.
-You're cool.

306
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,240
-Hello.
-Hi.

307
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,320
Today's lunch is Chinese food.
I'll take your orders.

308
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,400
-I'll have japchae on rice.
-I'll have jjamppong.

309
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,600
Can we order sharing dishes?

310
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,800
-I'll have fried rice.
-I'll have a jjajangmyeon.

311
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,240
One jjajangmyeon.

312
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,160
(Should I eat jjamppong or jjajangmyeon?)

313
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,120
(Jjajangmyeon.)

314
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,520
Mr. Ma, I sent you the file.

315
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Okay.

316
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,080
(Should I print that file or look at it
on my monitor?)

317
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,400
(I'm going to go to the washroom.)

318
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,040
(Should I go to the 2nd floor
or the 3rd floor?)

319
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,720
Are you rebelling?

320
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,440
This isn't the kind of discussion
I was referring to.

321
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,800
Why aren't you talking?

322
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,960
Should I be honest or should I be nice?

323
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,640
Don't ask me. Don't discuss with me.
Figure it out on your own.

324
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,320
You told me not to ask you, so...

325
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,400
What was that?

326
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,640
-Be honest.
-I'm telling you the truth.

327
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,720
Sure.

328
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,880
What? What?

329
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,640
We're dating. So what?

330
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,840
-Are you in love?
-Gosh.

331
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,920
I shouldn't have told everyone I know...

332
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,160
that I'm close with Lee Seok-du.

333
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,640
He wasn't Lee Seok-du,
he was Lee Hyeong-du.

334
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,600
You were rooked.

335
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,960
How can something more dramatic
than a drama happen to me?

336
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm now free from all this,

337
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,080
but you must be worried.

338
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,960
What is this? Are you two together again?

339
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,880
You should just get married
if you want to be this close.

340
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,440
What... What brings you here?

341
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,000
We should wrap things up.
I made a broadcasting accident.

342
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,000
Should I get fired or should I hand
in my resignation?

343
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,720
I'm not sure. What should we do?

344
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,080
By the way, when do you plan
on getting fired?

345
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,720
-Why should I get fired?
-You partnered with...

346
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,000
the fake Lee Seok-du
and did all kinds of things.

347
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,600
I didn't! He and I parted ways.

348
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,280
Please. Just leave on your own.

349
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
I don't want to.

350
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,960
Anyway, here's my resignation letter.

351
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,680
(Resignation Letter)

352
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,200
Hey, why are you suddenly resigning?

353
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,320
Hey! Let's go out to eat.

354
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
I don't want to.

355
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,640
(Ma Dong-chan)

356
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,000
Hey, Dong-chan. Dong-chan!

357
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,600
You can't just... Hey!

358
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,480
You handed in a resignation letter...

359
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,640
without even telling me?

360
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,880
Yes.

361
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,080
You told me I didn't have to discuss
everything with you.

362
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,280
Why are you always so extreme?

363
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,680
Hey, don't get angry.

364
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,120
Your body temperature will rise.

365
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,000
Do you have a plan?

366
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,320
Yes, my niece told me I should start
a Youtube channel.

367
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,040
You never listen to anyone.

368
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,320
But you listen to your niece?

369
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,720
Yes, I always listen to her.
She's very smart.

370
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,520
So I've been thinking.

371
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,040
How about we both quit...

372
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,680
and start a Youtube channel together?

373
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,400
These days, TV isn't the mainstream media.

374
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,760
So let's both quit...

375
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,160
and start our own channel.

376
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,600
How long are you going
to work as an intern?

377
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,120
I'm not sure.

378
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,440
-Well...
-Yes?

379
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,320
Maybe it's because I'm old-fashioned,

380
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,960
but I still think...

381
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,880
TV shows are the most influential.

382
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,440
Plus, I already asked for
a chance on social media.

383
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,680
And more importantly,
at least one of us...

384
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,160
should have a stable income.

385
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,840
You're going to stay
at a broadcasting station...

386
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,720
where Ma Dong-chan no longer exists?

387
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,280
But work is work.

388
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,200
So you just expect me to quit
and leave you...

389
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,760
to work with that young intern?

390
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,200
No way! I can't do that!

391
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,280
Come on. You should quit as well.

392
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,440
You can't get what you want just
by whining like this.

393
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,200
You can quit by yourself.

394
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,040
You're so cold-hearted.

395
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,440
I guess you're cold
because you're a cryonic.

396
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,040
I don't need a job there.
I'm just going to stay here.

397
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,800
What used to bother me here is no longer
a problem.

398
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,120
And the broadcasting station keeps
asking me to stay.

399
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,680
What? You didn't have a vacant spot
for me anyway?

400
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,600
I don't intend to work there either!

401
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
The actual first episode of "Go Go 99"...

402
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,600
will air this weekend, so keep
that in mind.

403
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,440
And one more thing.

404
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,320
Director Ma,
the legendary variety show director...

405
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,240
whom we can't live without will be
leaving us now.

406
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,640
It hurts me so much.

407
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,800
But we should still let him go.

408
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,400
Sir.

409
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,280
Did he get fired or decide to quit
on his own?

410
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
He obviously got fired because
of what he did.

411
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,080
If any of you run into him,

412
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,760
-show him your condolences.
-What are you talking about?

413
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,080
I'm not dead.

414
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
Plus, I'm the one who decided to quit.

415
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,640
No one has the right to fire me.

416
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,280
I'm Ma Dong-chan.

417
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,280
Everyone.

418
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,120
I'll be leaving as of today.

419
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,320
I'm 52 years old,

420
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,080
and I know I may be too old
to start something new.

421
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,840
But I'm still going to give it a try.

422
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,080
I should do something no one else has
ever done before...

423
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,440
in order to change this world.

424
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,840
Hey, what are you doing?

425
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,080
I wanted to help you pack since
it's your last day here.

426
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,760
I'll pack everything so
that you won't have to return.

427
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,440
That punk.

428

429
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,840
I'm having trouble with this.

430
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,440
Oh, this? I've done this before,
and it's not that hard.

431
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,080
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

432
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,480
Have you tried doing this?

433
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,600
Yes, I have.

434
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,120
Hey, stop asking her questions...

435
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,800
and just read the book.
It's all written in the book.

436
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,360
You'll learn a lot from it.

437
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,960

My dream as a child

Was to ride a yellow balloon

And fly high up in the sky

455

the remaining footage of 58 minutes?

459

I won't let this slide.

What kind of content are you going
to make?

481
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,120
Beauty? Eating shows? Games? ASMR?

482
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,640
How about a beauty channel?
Are you okay with wearing makeup?

483
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,080
Makeup?

484
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,520
Why would I put makeup on my face?

485
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,360
I lived longer than you,
so let me give you some advice.

486
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,560
Listen to me carefully!

487
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,080
You're free to do everything you want
to do in life.

488
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,880
But you should also know
that life is very precious.

489
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,720
You should think of living a long
and stable life.

490
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,520
Even if you have to go through a lot,

491
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,960
it's still better to live than to die.

492
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,280
So please...

493
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,400
don't risk your life on anything.

494
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,800
She's right. I also want
to live a long life.

495
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,800
I want to live as long as possible.

496
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,200
I want my life to be very long and stable.

497
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,040
A living crab...

498
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,760
is better than a dead Napoleon.

499
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,720
It's never bad to listen to someone
who's more experienced in life.

500
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,400
As we all expected,
"Go Go 99" did great on TV.

501
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,960
I think it's going to get added
to the official schedule.

502
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,400
-Nice!
-Great!

503
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,840
-You did great.
-Good job.

504
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,760
It's been a while. Good work.

505
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,520
What is it?

506
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,400
What are you doing here?
I thought you quit.

507
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,880
I just came.

508
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,360
By the way, where's Mi-ran
and the other intern?

509
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,440
Mi-ran went to cast the guests
for our show.

510
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,880
-And the intern?
-I'm not sure.

511
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,320
I think he went with Mi-ran.

512
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,840
Why? Why would he go with her?

513
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,360
Mi-ran, aren't you hungry?

514
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,880
Are you hungry?

515
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,160
A little?

516
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,120
I can't let you stay hungry.
Let's go eat something.

517
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,840
What do you want to eat?

518
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,880
Mi-ran, you're not my mom.

519
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,640
I know you're my mom's friend,
but don't treat me like a kid.

520
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,120
I'm just your school friend.

521
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,240
I know we're school friends,
but I'm also your mom's friend.

522
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,960
And this is a very special situation
we're in.

523
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,440
I'm the same age as your mother.

524
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,320
Do you know
how sensitive people are about age?

525
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,480
Keep the passion you had
when you started the experiment.

526
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,360
That's why I like you.

527
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,200
Where are you going?
I thought you were hungry.

528
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,720
Forget it. I don't want to eat
with my mom's friend.

529
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,040
Let's go.
I'll buy you something delicious.

530
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,920
-Why isn't she picking up?
-Really?

531
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,400
I thought you quit.

532
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,440
Darn it. Why didn't you pick up?

533
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,520
You called? I didn't hear the phone ring.

534
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,920
What were you so focused on...

535
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,320
that you couldn't even hear
your phone ring?

536
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,920
And what's your problem, Intern?

537
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,880
Don't you have any work to do?
Do you have no ambition?

538
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,440
This is a very crucial time for you.

539
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
You only get to live your 20s once.

540
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,320
Then what about your 50s?
Do you get to live it twice?

541
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,880
What? What did you say?

542
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,760
I work extremely hard.

543
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,160
My gosh, do you find it easy
to talk to me...

544
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,840
now that I no longer work here?

545
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,400
Is that why you're being so rude?

546
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,080
What's wrong with you?

547
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,920
Stop taking out
your jobless frustration on him.

548
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,680
What? "Jobless frustration"?

549
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,200
Why are you laughing?

550
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,840
What's so funny about my being jobless?

551
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,760
Plus, I'm in my 30s.

552
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,880
-That's enough.
-Do you know...

553
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,760
-Do you know how healthy I am?
-What's wrong with you?

554
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,240
-You're so embarrassing.
-Why am I embarrassing?

555
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
Stop it.

556
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,360
My gosh, seriously.

557
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,320
I'll bring my bag, so wait here for a bit.

558
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,840
And stop being so grumpy.

559
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,960
Why were you having fun with that guy?

560
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,560
I wasn't having fun with him.

561
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,880
Stop talking like an old man.

562
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,920
You sound like an oldie sometimes.

563
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,720
Oldie? Hey, "oldie" sounds
even more ancient.

564
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,800
Don't pretend like you're young
by hanging out with a kid, old woman.

565
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,080
Old woman? Then are you an old man?

566
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,400
Yes, I'm an old man.
You're an old woman.

567
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,880
Why are you throwing a fit?

568
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,720
I don't think we can process
Dong-chan's resignation.

569
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,320
Why not? He wants to leave!

570
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,880
The board told me to just suspend him...

571
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,520
because we can never lose him.

572
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,160
Even so, how can we do that?

573
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,960
Just process it already.

574
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,280
-Wait, are they dating?
-We both are old.

575
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,800
They're together pretty often.

576
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,680
Yes, they're dating.

577
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,200
Yes, darling. Why did you call me now?

578
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,720
I've been waiting.

579
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
Darling?

580
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,720
Eat up and fix my brother soon.

581
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,880
Of course.

582
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,280
My brother is unemployed now.

583
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,240
Goodness.

584
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,160
He can't get another job at the age of 50.

585
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,560
And he can't work for others
because he has a bad temper.

586
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,080
Hello, welcome. How many...

587
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,280
Are you here to eat?

588
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,840
-Yes.
-Yes.

589
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,440
Grab a seat wherever you'd like.

590
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,720
Hey.

591
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,400
Come here.

592
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,320
Don't just focus on eating,
make me one too.

593
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,840
Are you the only person
who gets to eat here?

594
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,120
It's good.

595
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,400
I love how you are so blunt
about everything.

596
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,280
Do you want to come to my house
and have instant noodles tonight?

597
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,719
This is an all-you-can-eat place,
so you can eat as much as you want.

598
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,880
Why would we eat instant noodles?

599
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,880
-You idiot.
-I'd love to.

600
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,480
I really don't like that guy.

601
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,920
His looks, hair, and outfit. Everything.

602
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,560
He's much better than Chu Bang-nam.
What are you saying?

603
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,000
I told you to stop bringing Bang-nam up.

604
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,160
I don't care what you say.
He was my true love.

605
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,560
Dong-ju, the customers are leaving.

606
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,280
You should stay by the counter.

607
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,400
Hey, you go.

608
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,600
Stop it.

609
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,120
I'm a guy who was on TV.

610
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,200
I've been wondering for a while.

611
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,360
Why do you call Dong-ju by her name?

612
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,400
Shouldn't you be more respectful
and call her Ms. Ma?

613
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,720
You only address your husband's
younger sister by their names.

614
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,160
Yes, you're right.

615
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,280
But she doesn't want me to do that.

616
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Why not?

617
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,560
She feels as if she's a part of a gang
if I do that to her.

618
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,880
It's too hot.

619
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,480
Let me blow on it.

620
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,240
It's so good.

621
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,640
Here. You're eating so well.

622
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,840
That's so gross.

623
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,880
Why did you spit it out?

624
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,640
Goodness.

625
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,920
What is this?
Is Mom at the morning prayer again?

626
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,800
Of course, how can she sleep in peace...

627
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,760
when her eldest son is sitting around
at home...

628
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,240
unemployed at the age of 52?

629
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,560
Now that Dong-ju sobered up
and became a decent human being,

630
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,440
-you're causing her trouble again.
-Hey, you...

631
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,160
That's what she said.

632
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Hey, Dong-chan.
We have to do construction work...

633
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,680
because our plumbing is down.

634
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,200
It'll take about a week.
What are you going to do?

635
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,640
What do you mean?

636
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,880
Where are you going to go for a week?

637
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,280
We're going to Hye-jin's house.

638
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,840
I'll be at Ok-jeong's house.
She's a friend of mine.

639
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,560
Mom will go to Aunt's place.

640
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,440
So she's asking where you're going to go.

641
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,040
What? I have nowhere else to go.

642
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,520
Are you all bullying me right now?

643
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,320
It's not like that.
Do you want to come with us?

644
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,440
No.

645
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,440
Then you can come with me
to Ok-jeong's place.

646
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,960
No, that's worse.

647
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,560
Where am I going to go?

648
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,600
Don't you have any friends?
Go crash at your friend's place.

649
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,960
He hasn't been in touch for 20 years.

650
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,920
He wouldn't have a friend
who would let him crash for a week.

651
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,440
He's like a pair of underpants
with a broken rubber band.

652
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,920
You're right.

653
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,480
And he's currently unemployed.

654
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,920
He'll look worse
if he goes somewhere to crash.

655
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Hello?

656
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Yes.

657
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,360
Who is this again?

658
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,360
-Hello.
-Take a seat.

659
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,200
Sure.

660
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,360
Wait, how much are you offering me?

661
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,840
That's not all.

662
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,040
You'll also receive incentives
on the sales and ad revenue.

663
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,560
Your position will be a director
on the board.

664
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,680
This is the contract.
Please do read through.

665
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,560
Wow, this is... What is...

666
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,720
Goodness.

667
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
Well, I...

668
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,520
I'm sorry,

669
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,160
but I'll live my life doing
whatever I want.

670
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,720
If I get held down
with a huge contract like this,

671
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,520
I'll be tied down by this...

672
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,160
and become a puppet of that money.

673
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,160
I'm not very good at doing something
as I'm told.

674
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,280
I just wish to express my gratitude
for your offer.

675
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,000
We're offering you full control
and freedom.

676
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,960
Please do reconsider.

677
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,240
Do give us a call if you change your mind.

678
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,120
Sure, I will.

679
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,880
You can't resign.

680
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,360
There's no proof...

681
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,280
that you were directly a part of
the Lee Hyeong-du case.

682
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,000
You were cleared of your suspicion.

683
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,000
Why do you want to quit?

684
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,080
I've done everything I could.

685
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,400
One of us will have
to take responsibility.

686
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,160
No.

687
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,680
Ha-young, if it ends well,
it means everything is well.

688
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,000
Let's cover it up just like
how we did before.

689
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
No.

690
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,080
I wish to be different from 20 years ago.

691
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,280
I always created...

692
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,120
irreversible situations...

693
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,320
because of the wrong choices that I made.

694
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,560
This may be another one of
those wrong choices.

695
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,040
Is it too tough for you to work
with Dong-chan?

696
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,480
Dong-chan resigned.

697
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,440
(Family Court)

698
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,560
Have a good life like a decent human.

699
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,000
I'll do my best.

700
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,400
I won't take away your job as a professor.

701
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,200
That's my alimony to you.

702
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,880
You're the one who's at fault,
but I'm giving you alimony.

703
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,480
But you can't use my father
as your connection anymore.

704
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,320
You have to do your best
to keep your position now.

705
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,280
Thank you.

706
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,960
I'm divorcing you because
of the attitude...

707
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,240
you've shown as Ji-hoon's dad.

708
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,680
I figured that you aren't the worst.

709
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,920
Why do you always think I'm like that?

710
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,200
-I'm not a bad guy.
-That's not the case.

711
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Goodbye.

712
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
Young-sun.

713
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,320
You're really pretty in that hat.

714
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,200
You look like a lady
of the UK's royal family.

715
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
Crazy idiot.

716
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,840
Ms. Oh, you're here.
Your friend is waiting for you.

717
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,280
It wasn't me.

718
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,400
Of course, it was you.

719
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,080
My boyfriend did some digging
behind your back already.

720
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,960
You have a boyfriend?

721
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,640
-Yes.
-When?

722
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,440
I don't know. We can talk
about that later.

723
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,200
Anyway, why did you do that?

724
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,800
It wasn't me! Why would I do that?

725
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,120
Also, why did your boyfriend do
a background check on me?

726
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,720
He didn't do a check on you.

727
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,800
He was searching for the one
who uploaded that posting about Mi-ran,

728
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,280
and the IP was this cafe.

729
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,200
-It wasn't me.
-Gosh.

730
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
Hey, we've been friends for 25 years.

731
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,200
How can you find me suspicious...

732
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,080
because of what your new boyfriend said?

733
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,720
-Well...
-I'm really disappointed.

734
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm already in a bad mood.

735
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,920
I just got a divorce before coming here.

736
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,240
What?

737
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,160
It's the weekend tomorrow.

738
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,960
Aren't weekdays and weekends the same
for someone jobless?

739
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,400
Hey, even jobless people have life cycles.

740
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,920
We have different patterns
for weekdays and weekends.

741
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,800
We don't get stressed on weekends,

742
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,520
so we even sleep in.

743
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,280
You have no idea.

744
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,520
I heard at the Variety Department...

745
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,400
that all the stations are going crazy
to recruit you.

746
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,040
That's nothing new. It's the story
of my life.

747
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,800
By the way, I need to find a place
to stay for a week...

748
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,920
because our house is going
under construction.

749
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,720
Should I just move out while I'm at it?

750
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,440
You were apart from your family
for 20 years.

751
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,720
You shouldn't do that.

752
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,880
But, our rooftop house is vacant
at the moment.

753
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,080
Just a week?

754
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,920
-The rooftop house?
-There's a construction?

755
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,200
It's empty?

756
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,040
Yes. I'll take it.

757
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,360
I heard you'll be staying for a week.

758
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,400
Make yourself at home.

759
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
Yes. Make yourself at home.

760
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,160
Thank you.

761
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,320
You can treat me comfortably,

762
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,240
Mother and Father.

763
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,880
Mr. Ma, you should go up
and see. It's clean.

764
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,000
Okay, thank you.

765
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,680
I'll be going up then.

766
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,120
-Yes.
-Go ahead.

767
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,600
Thank you.

768
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,760
If he wasn't such a troublemaker,
he'd be perfect.

769
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,800
I agree. He's handsome...

770
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,400
and he looks like a good person.

771
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,400
But he always makes such huge troubles.

772
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,680
But don't you think he looks...

773
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,240
like a playboy?

774
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,360
Professor Hwang.

775
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,880
You're going to get busy now.

776
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,040
Many things will happen to you.

777
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm sure since Lee Seok-du is awake.

778
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,600
Things will change.

779
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,280
You'll get busy too.

780
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,080
You promised me 20 years ago saying...

781
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,000
you'd help me succeed
with the cryonics experiment...

782
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,840
with only Korean funds and technology.

783
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,600
Yes, I did.

784
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,520
I think it'll be realized soon.

785
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,440
We just need to bring back
your normal body temperature.

786
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,000
As long as we get that resolved,
then this experiment is a success.

787
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,840
You did it.

788
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,280
It's only the beginning.

789
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,920
By the way,

790
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,560
when can we start living
like ordinary people?

791
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,120
Soon.

792
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,800
(What are you doing?)

793
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,400
(I'm about to go to bed.)

794
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,600
(How can you be sleepy when I'm upstairs?)

795
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,000
(How can you be sleepy when I'm upstairs?)

796
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,080
(Giggling)

797
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,840
(Don't just giggle.)

798
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,120
(Don't just giggle.)

799
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,480
(Should I go up?)

800
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,280
(Should I go up?)

801
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,200
It's a little hot up here.
Will you be okay?

802
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,400
I missed you.

803
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,320
Me too.

804
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,600
Hey. Hey, what were you thinking?

805
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,840
You had naughty thoughts,
didn't you?

806
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,120
What do you mean?
Yours started ringing faster.

807
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,640
What were you thinking?

808
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,760
Hey, we should...

809
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,040
go outside.

810
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,360
This place isn't a good idea.

811
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,360
Go where?

812
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,760
Anyway, we shouldn't stay here.

813
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,800
Let's go out.

814
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,640
It's so hot.

815
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,640
I wish our temperatures
would return fast...

816
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,720
so we could do everything other people do.

817
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,560
Me too.

818
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,760
I wish it could feel cold in here.

819
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,520
Me too.

820
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,520
I want to drink a hot americano
within five minutes.

821
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,920
Me too.

822
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,760
I want to love you like crazy.

823
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,640
Me too.

824
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,760
Instead of just agreeing with me,

825
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,160
say what you want too.

826
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,280
Earmuffs. Fur hats. Leggings.

827
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,520
I want to wear long boots.

828
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,720
Me too.

829
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,000
Gosh, it's cold.

830
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,120
-I'm dizzy.
-Gosh, this place is crazy.

831
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,720
Hey, look at that.

832
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,840
I can't stay here. Let's go.

833
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,600
Yes, let's go.

834
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,160
It's an ice room, so it's cold.

835
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,960
How can they stay there?

836
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,920
Hey, a drama is starting.

837
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,760
Let's watch it.

838
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,600
(The talk of buying out
the electronics company...)

839
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,240
-Gosh.
-It finished.

840
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,880
Hey, do you want to go to
the ice room again?

841
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,720
-It's hot, so why don't we go?
-Okay.

842
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,240
Should we have another drink?

843
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,280
Were they in here all this time?

844
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,200
-That's crazy.
-They're amazing.

845
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,360
(Serious Crimes Team 2)

846
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,360
Let's see.

(Murder Suspect Wanted)

848
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,600
(I just finished getting ready.)

849
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,520
(I just finished getting ready.)

850
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,720
(I'm heading out too.)

851
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,720
(See you outside in three minutes.)

852
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,760
(See you outside in three minutes.)

853
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,240
Hello.

854
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,240
I'll be back.

855
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,040
Where are you going?

856
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,440
You should have breakfast.

857
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,400
I normally don't eat breakfast.

858
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,680
Just sit down.

859
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,800
Let's eat together.

860
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,440
-Yes. Here.
-Sit down.

861
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,480
Gosh. Thank you for the food.

862
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,880
This is the spoon the professor used
to use.

863
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,680
I see. "Professor"?

864
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,440
There was a professor
who lived in the rooftop house.

865
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,080
I miss him.

866
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,640
Do you mean Professor Hwang?

867
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,160
I wonder if he's doing well.

868
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,800
Then that rooftop house...

869
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,840
is a place where all the men related
to you stay.

870
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,840
What's with you this time?

871
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,920
He moved in without my permission.

872
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,240
Gosh.

873
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,520
Are you upset?

874
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,720
What's there to be upset about?
It's just funny.

875
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,680
That professor is really something.

876
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,680
How could he move in?

877
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,000
Also, same with that young intern.

878
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,880
I heard his mom is your friend.

879
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,040
Yes, she is.

880
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,840
Her husband is Hwang Byung-sim.

881
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,000
I see.

882
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,320
I said, his dad is Hwang Byung-sim.

883
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,400
I heard you.

884
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,840
What? What?

885
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,520
That young intern's dad is
Hwang Byung-sim?

886
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,000
Gosh, what's with that family?

887
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,320
Gosh. How...

888
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,880
They say this ice room is really romantic.

889
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,200
Let's go here next time.

890
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,600
Thank you for the ride. See you later.

891
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,760
Why did you get off?

892
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,320
I can do whatever I want.

893
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,720
-Yes. Work hard.
-Okay.

894
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,840
-Hello.
-Hello.

895
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,360
You should work hard.

896
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,440
You should always work hard.

897
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,960
What are you doing here again?

898
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,000
-I came because I wanted to.
-Why did you even bother...

899
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,120
to quit in the first place?

900
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,240
You come here more often than you used to.

901
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,800
None of that is your concern.

902
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,120
Dong-chan, do you know that Ha-young quit?

903
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,560
(Unsung Group)

904
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,880
After the world found out that
Lee Hyeong-du was a fake,

905
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,120
Unsung Group's stock price
keeps plummeting.

906
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,600
I'm doomed.

907
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,800
I bought a ton of their stocks
because I was told it'll rise.

908
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,720
By the way, are you sure Dong-chan quit?

909
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,320
I think he comes to work every day.

910
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,200
Someone uploaded a petition saying
we should hire him back,

911
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,160
and tons of people have signed it already.

912
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,240
He's like a ticking bomb.

913
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,840
I think we'll just have to end it
with a suspension...

914
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,280
and eventually bring him back.

915
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,800
You still haven't filed
his resignation letter?

916
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,840
The board is very persistent
about keeping Dong-chan here.

917
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,920
We can't let him leave.

918
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,680
How long are you going to work
as their puppet?

919
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,320
You really need to have some backbone.

920
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,560
-What did you say?
-File the resignation letter.

921
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,760
He wants to leave, so give him
what he wants.

922
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,360
Sir, will you please just make him leave?

923
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,600
Why do you want him gone so badly?

924
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,000
Do you have any idea...

925
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,360
how much he tainted my reputation
after he came back?

926
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,480
I hate coming to work because of him.

927
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,960
All the directors subtly look down on me.

928
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,360
Then you should quit instead.

929
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,280
How could you say that to me?
We spent years working together.

930
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,560
If Dong-chan and I are drowning,
whom are you going to save first?

931
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,320
I'm not capable of saving anyone.

932
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,560
I'm the one who's about
to drown right now.

933
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,160
But still, give me an answer.
Whom will you save first?

934
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,960
Dong-chan! I'll save Dong-chan first!

935
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,600
My gosh.

936
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,040
It's been so long.

937
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,000
(Create an account for a new channel.)

938
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,000
Why don't you do this at home?

939
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,560
You told them you're going to quit.
Why are you doing this here?

940
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,880
Because I want to do it here.

941
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,240
Are you really going to do this?

942
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,760
What are you planning to do this time?

943
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,560
I have a plan.

944
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,320
By the way,

945
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,720
there's something I haven't told you.

946
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,600
But it torments me to keep it from you.

947
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,840
Remember Ha-young, the girl you dated?

948
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,080
She came to see me 20 years ago
after you disappeared.

949
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,000
What did she say to you?

950
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,840
She asked me to go to
the police station with her...

951
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,680
so that they'll do an investigation.

952
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,680
She told me that no one's willing
to help her out.

953
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,680
But...

954
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,680
I was too scared.

955
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,520
So I refused.

956
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,040
I'm sorry.

957
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,560
Hey.

958
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,720
Can we meet?

959
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,360
-That won't get you anywhere.
-Exactly.

960
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,680
Dong-chan.

961
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,160
-Hello.
-Dong-chan.

962
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,160
Hello.

963
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,080
What's with him?

964
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,160
What is he doing?

965
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,520
I don't get it.

966
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,280
This feels so wrong.

967
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,680
Who would think that he quit working here?

968
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,720
He's kind of like...

969
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,680
those ghosts you hear
about in a girls' high school.

970
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,200
He's there but he isn't.

971
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,720
And he's always roaming around the place.

972
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,200
What are you talking about?

973
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,960
-We saw Dong-chan at the rooftop.
-The rooftop?

974
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,120
Why don't you...

975
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,840
ever tell me everything?

976
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,520
You know what? You were always like that.

977
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,120
Why didn't you tell me the truth...

978
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,080
when I was busy doubting you?

979
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,720
If you had told me that you tried
to confess everything to the cops...

980
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,160
I waited...

981
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,880
for you to tell me.

982
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,760
My mom was sick.

983
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,880
And I needed money, so I had no choice.

984
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,080
I wanted an explanation.

985
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,440
I had done so many bad things.

986
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,520
And I hated myself for not having
continued to search for you.

987
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,360
I...

988
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,600
I thought you had abandoned me.

989
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,600
Do you know what tormented me the most...

990
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,040
after I woke up in 20 years?

991
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,960
I wasn't bothered by how different
the world had become...

992
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,120
and that the broadcasting station didn't
bother to look for me.

993
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,440
It was that you didn't look for me.

994
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,960
Do you know how heartbroken I was?

995
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,120
Do you know how much that hurt me?

996
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,920
I should've endured it.

997
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,400
But I couldn't.

998
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,840
And in the end, I didn't look for you.

999
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,720
I gave you up...

1000
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,640
for my own success.

1001
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,240
Don't...

1002
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,240
ever forgive me.

1003
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,560
(Melting Me Softly)

1004
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,120
(I know he's my destiny.)

1005
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,320
(But I'm not sure if I'm his destiny.)

1006
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,720
I keep getting bothered by you.

1007
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,360
Are you that insecure?

1008
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,000
(Do you still like him?)

1009
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,520
Is there something wrong?

1010
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,640
(I wonder what's up with her.)

1011
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,200
(A guy named Terry Kim hasn't
gotten arrested yet.)

1012
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,680
-(He ran away.)
-(I want you to do a cover on him.)

1013
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,840
I'm sure you'll find something.

1014
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,280
(I want you to give me the shot first.)

1015
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,720
Mi-ran!

1016
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,080
(Even if I ever end up
inside the capsule again,)

1017
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,600
(I don't want you to follow me inside.)
