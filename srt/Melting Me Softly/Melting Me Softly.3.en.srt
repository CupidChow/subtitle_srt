You didn't even look for my son.

112
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,080
You had a great life, didn't you?

113
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,720
Look at how plumpy you are.

114
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,400
Mom, please. One second.

115
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,640
Mom, can you go somewhere else?

116
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,480
I have to talk to them.

117
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,919

and go somewhere else?

-Let's go, Mom.

120
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,520
-You!
-Mom, calm down.

121
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,560
-Why are you so strong?
-You jerks.

122
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,760
Let's go.

123
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,200
First off,
let me just speak casually with you.

124
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,680
Are you really Hyun-gi?

125
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,440
Of course, you saw this.

126
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,320
Fine.

127
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,880
Okay.

128
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,280
Find Ko Mi-ran's address for me.

129
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,240
How would I find it?

130
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,160
That happened 20 years ago.

131
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,880
Do you know how much I tried to find you?

132
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,320
But I couldn't even find any clues.

133
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,280
We tried our best too.

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,600
I mean, Professor Hwang Gab-su
suddenly died.

135
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,760
Wait. Professor Hwang died?

136
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,680
He did. He's not the only one who died.

137
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,240
Michael Jackson died,

138
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,040
and so did Kim Jong-il of North Korea.

139
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,560
Whitney Houston died too.

140
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Who else died? It's...

141
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,880
Mr. Mo Soo-young of Production Team Three

142
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,160
also died of lung cancer.

143
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,120
And my mother-in-law passed away too.

144
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,200
Anyway, that's the current situation.

145
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,000
Of course, during that time,
I had two sons,

146
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
and our chief became the president.

147
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,280
He got caught for having an affair
and had to get divorced

148
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,200
just 20 days before the abolishment
of adultery as a criminal offense.

149
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,160
Can you charge this phone?

150
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,760
What is this?

151
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,080
Do you think
this phone will work, Dong-chan?

152
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,520
Really? Then give me your phone.

153
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,080
Come on, give it to me.

154
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,880
Where is the keypad on your phone?

155
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,520
What do you do...

156
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,560
Hey, what's with this phone?

157
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,560
How do I...

158
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,800
Tell me the number.

159
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,320
It's 0173491563.

160
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,960
You're still the same.

161
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,440
You're still good at memorizing numbers.

162
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,080
But I guess you memorized
Ko Mi-ran's number.

163
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,440
He remembers something from 21 years ago.

164
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,160
That's amazing.

165
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,520
It's not 21 years ago for him.
It was yesterday.

166
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,440
Right.

167
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,800
(The phone you have reached
is turned off.)

168
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,960
(-Leave your message...)
-The number isn't...

169
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,200
Dong-chan.

170
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,680
-Goodness.
-Should we go home?

171
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Dong-chan, let's go home.

172
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,400
Hey, wait. Mr. Baek.

173
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,840
I mean, can you call Detective Baek?

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,520
I divorced him, Dong-chan.

175
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,120
But we do stay in touch.

176
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,600
We haven't settled on the division
of assets and the alimony.

177
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,520
He's been paying me monthly.

178
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
You got divorced?

179
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,840
Yes, twice.

180
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,320
It has been 20 years.
How can I live with just 1 man?

181
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,160
Why is everyone divorced?

182
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,480
It's me.

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,680
It's me! Can't you hear me?

184
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,200
Get your ears cleaned.

185
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
One second.

186
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,120
Dong-chan, you can ask him
whatever you want.

187
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,840
Ko Mi-ran's current address.

188
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,840
Well, her resident registration number

189
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,280
begins with 760214, but...

190
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,240
Why is it so hot in here?

191
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,880
Can you get me some cold water?

192
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,880
Okay?

193
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,920
Wait, where have they gone?

194
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,360
Yes, hello?

195
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,760
Yes, right.

196
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,600
I was about to drop him off at home.

197
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,160
Yes. Right. Yes.

198
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,680
Dong-ju asked me to bring you home.

199
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,360
(Haengdang-ro)

200
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,280
I have the key here.

201
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,480
Here is the key.

202
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,680
Wait, I thought our home was...

203
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,600
-Let's go inside.
-Come in.

204
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,480
What are you doing? Let's go in.

205
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,000
What?

206
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,080
Come in.

207
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,720
What happened?

208
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,160
Did you win the lottery?

209
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,480
Of course.

210
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,800
It's as if we won
the first place of the lottery.

211
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,440
It's all thanks to

212
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,600
the bank book that you gave me.

213
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,920
The bank book?

214
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,920
Yes, the money you got for the experiment.

215
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,560
Your dad and I started a business

216
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,920
with the money that you left for us.

217
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,600
And we made some money.

218
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
That was the price of your life,

219
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,640
so I guess the deities gave us a favor.

220
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,120
They let us become so wealthy.

221
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,960
Excuse me, Mr. Jo.

222
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,520
Yes?

223
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,160
Can you do me a favor?

224
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,920
Of course, something like that
wouldn't happen,

225
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,520
but if anything happens to me,

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,120
can you

227
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,440
give this to my family?

228
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,480
(Ko Nam-tae)

229
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,080
"Ko Nam-tae"?

230
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,560
(6.5 million won)

231
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,400
(Ko Nam-tae)

232
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,680
(The passcode is Nam-tae's birthday.)

233
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,200
Mi-ran, your room is over there.

234
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,080
Go on.

235
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,560
Thank you.

236
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,760
Mom. Dad.

237
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,640
And Nam-tae.

238
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,320
Thank you for having a good life.

239
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,280
Don't thank us.

240
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,160
We're thankful to you.

241
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,560
Now you've come home alive.

242
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,520
(Korean Style Restaurant Jinsagalbi)

243
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,520
What is this?

244
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,960
What are you doing? Come inside.

245
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,520
What on earth happened?

246
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,160
These two

247
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,240
wasted so much of our fortune away.

248
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,720
-Let's go in.
-Come on.

249
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,320
Let's go in. Come on.

250
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,840
That man stepped on it!

251
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

252
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't call him "that man".
He's my big brother.

253
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,280
What? How can he be older than you
when he looks so young?

254
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,640
Just call him your uncle.

255
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,599
Hello.

256
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,440
Dong-chan. This is my wife,
and this is my daughter.

257
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,880
Take your toy and go to your room.

258
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,599
I'm sorry, Dong-chan.

259
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,600
No, no. It's okay.

260
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,440
Here, wear these for now.

261
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,400
Do you have anything else, sir?

262
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,600
I mean, do you have anything else?

263
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,480
All of your stuff are in the storage,

264
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,840
so we have to go get them tomorrow.

265
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,440
You should use Dong-ju's room
for the next little while.

266
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,480
What about me?

267
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,240
You can sleep with me

268
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,880
or sleep in Seo-yoon's room.

269
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,760
Your brother doesn't have
a place to sleep.

270
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,200
Fine.

271
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,680
Dong-chan, sleep well.

272
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Yes, ma'am.

273
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,840
Okay.

274
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,680
(Looking for a missing person)

275
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,000
Where's Dad?

276
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,800
Where is he?

277
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,520
Dad?

278
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,800
Gosh.

279
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,360
I was planning to report you missing
if you didn't come home today.

280
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,080
-You were alive after all.
-I attended a seminar.

281
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,800
Stop lying, punk.

282
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,760
I went on a trip since living is so tough.

283
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,560
What's so tough? Are you in agony?

284
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,120
Are you doing research?
Are you supporting a family?

285
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,120
If I'm ever born again,
I want to live like you.

286
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,040
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

287
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,640
Hey. By the way...

288
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,760
-Don't talk to me.
-Mi-ran...

289
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,120
Is Mi-ran a girl whom
you're interested in lately?

290
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,680
I'm talking about Ko Mi-ran
who went to the US 20 years ago.

291
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,880
My first love, Ko Mi-ran.

292
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,440
"Ko Mi-ran"?

293
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,640
Your friend from college entrance
preparation school?

294
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,960
Yes, that Ko Mi-ran.

295
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,880
She hasn't contacted you
since then, right?

296
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,880
No.

297
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,960
Why are you asking?

298
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,600
No reason.

299
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,200
I wonder if she made a family
and is living well over there.

300
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,560
You're so random.

301
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,840
Do you have nothing better to do

302
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,520
but to reminisce about your first love?

303
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,360
There's only so much my father can do

304
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,920
to prevent you from getting fired.

305
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,960
You should write dissertations
and go to seminars.

306
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,440
Show some effort, will you?
Stop living like a parasite.

307
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,880
What's the point of changing your name

308
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,880
when you're still a fool?

309
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,840
Did you call me a fool?

310
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,040
That's ridiculous.
You should talk more elegantly.

311
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,120
Why should I listen to you?

312
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,760
Why should I? Why should I?

313
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,760
Where did my life go wrong?

314
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,560
Both of us were ruined
because of Ko Mi-ran.

315
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,080
If you didn't make that mistake
after getting pathetically drunk

316
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,800
over Mi-ran...

317
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,280
Why do I bother?

318
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,320
I miss

319
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,680
Mi-ran.

320
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,720
Darn her.

321
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,720
Hey.

322
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,680
The moment the world finds out
that our station

323
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,320
kept quiet about Dong-chan going missing,

324
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,960
both of us will be fired.

325
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,160
We'll really be done for.
You know that, don't you?

326
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,520
Of course I do. What should we do now?

327
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,800
We have to pretend we don't know
anything until the end.

328
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,040
We covered up the mouths of every staff

329
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,720
who were involved in the experiment.

330
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,200
And the professor who worked
on the experiment is gone.

331
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,960
All we have to do is keep Dong-chan quiet.

332
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,800
Do you think it'll be easy
to keep him quiet?

333
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,760
That's what I'm worried about too.
He's crazy.

334
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,920
He's insane.

335
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,640
By the way, where did Ko Mi-ran go?

336
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,840
Whatever happened to her?

337
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,800
What's giving me the real headache is her.

338
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,320
She's worse than Dong-chan.
She's really crazy.

339
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,520
I mean it.

340
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,760
Don't tell me she's alive.

341
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,920
What are we going to do?
I knew this year was unlucky for me,

342
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,280
but this is driving me crazy.

343
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,360
I really don't feel like living.

344
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,400
Who on earth woke them up?

345
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,240
Where were they all this time anyway?

346
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,880
How is it possible

347
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,360
for him to look exactly the same?

348
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,000
What could've happened?

349
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,840
I'm speechless.

350
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,120
Is he really your older brother?

351
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,040
With all seriousness,
he looks like your son.

352
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,160
He strangely feels like someone else.

353
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,560
How is he different?

354
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,960
Compared to Dong-chan,

355
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,880
the back of his head looks different.

356
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,240
He has wider nostrils too.

357
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,720
His eyes look super cold, just like ice.

358
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,080
Doesn't he look extremely rude?

359
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,040
He was never nice.

360
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,160
Didn't he used to have a mole
under his left eye?

361
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,840
I couldn't see one earlier.

362
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,320
Why are you all talking nonsense?

363
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,000
If he isn't Dong-chan, then who is he?

364
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,800
When they investigated his phone,
they found a strange text.

365
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,600
It said, he would make sure
to succeed with the experiment.

366
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,560
He talked about "the experiment"
in several places.

367
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,720
Right.

368
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,200
I'm certain that Dong-chan
was involved in an experiment.

369
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,240
So? What kind of experiment
are you saying he did?

370
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,920
What are you thinking?

371
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,160
Clones.

372
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,760
She's right.

373
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,440
Anyway,

374
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,200
before Dong-chan talks to us first,

375
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,080
don't ask him anything.

376
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Okay.

377
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,680
I'm sorry, Dad.

378
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,320
I couldn't send you on a cruise
like I promised.

379
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,280
I wasn't there
for your last moments either.

380
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
Dad...

381
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,440
Dad?

382
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,120
Dong-chan, what are you doing out here?

383
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,560
Aren't you going to bed?

384
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,640
Gosh. You surprised me.

385
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,880
I just...

386
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,480
What are you looking at?

387
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,000
Dad?

388
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,160
Dong-chan. Goodnight.

389
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,360
(When are you coming back, Mi-ran?)

390
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,400
Mi-ran.

391
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,640
(Mom cooked Mi-ran's favorite food.
She said Mi-ran's always with us.)

392
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,320
(Honey, when are you coming back?)

393
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,160
(Why aren't you coming?
I'm waiting for you.)

394
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,720
(Honey, I'm waiting for you to come back.)

395
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,160
(Dong-chan.)

396
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,000
(I miss you.)

397
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,000
Do you feel okay?

398
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,480
We'll take you to the hospital

399
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
once you're done eating.

400
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,320
No, it's okay.

401
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,640
I feel so much better
now that I got some sleep.

402
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,200
Must you go back to school?

403
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,880
Why don't you get some more rest?

404
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,640
I rested for 20 years.

405
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,600
I should get back to my daily life.

406
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,960
We always had hope that you'd come back.

407
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,800
So we filed for a leave of absence
every single year.

408
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,680
We've also kept your number alive.

409
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,440
But I came back a little late.

410
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,840
-Didn't I?
-Don't say that.

411
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,480
You didn't come back late.

412
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,680
My gosh, even if I end up

413
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,400
dying tomorrow, I'd die a peaceful death.

414
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,920
Why would you say something like that?

415
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,760
The new semester just started.

416
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,440
And there's not much time
for me to achieve

417
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,000
everything I should've done
during the past 20 years.

418
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,880
I should live a diligent life.

419
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,760
I need to graduate and get a job.

420
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,920
Yes, you're right.

421
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,640
You can do everything you want.

422
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,400
But before that,

423
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,440
there's something I need to take care of.

424
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,840
Director Ma.

425
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,440
-I'm so glad you're...
-What in the world

426
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,720
happened here?

427
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,720
Professor Hwang got into an accident

428
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,040
two hours before the experiment
was supposed to end.

429
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,800
Then how were we able
to wake up in 20 years?

430
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,080
Was Professor Hwang

431
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,120
the person who woke us up?

432
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,520
Dissociative amnesia.

433
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,600
He woke up from a coma in 20 years.

434
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,680
And with his subconscious tenacity,
he woke you guys up

435
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,160
and lost consciousness again.

436
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,000
(You could say his body reacted
faster than his brain.)

437
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,600
(His subconsciousness that's been
dormant for 20 years)

438
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,320
(is what caused him to wake you up.)

439
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,640
(You could say it's similar)

440
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,760
(to a sleep disorder.)

441
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,960
They why does everyone think he's dead?

442
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,720
His car exploded.

443
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,600
(Someone tried to kill him.)

444
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,280
(If he found out that Professor Hwang
managed to stay alive,)

445
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,080
(he would've tried to kill him again.)

446
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,600
So we made it seem

447
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,240
like he was dead.

448
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,920
Professor Hwang and I went
to the same medical school.

449
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,320
(I don't know why,
but he was always nervous.)

450
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,920
(Right before the accident,
he called and desperately asked me)

451
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,440
(to handle everything
if anything bad happened to him.)

452
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,600
Did you find the culprit?

453
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,800
I guess we can't ask the cops

454
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,240
to investigate since the statute
of limitations has already expired.

455
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,800
I'm sure it has something to do
with the cryonics experiment.

456
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,480
We'll only be able to find out
once Professor Hwang wakes up.

457
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,360
I couldn't tell this to anyone

458
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,840
for the past 20 years

459
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,720
because I couldn't trust anyone.

460
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,200
Did you meet Ko Mi-ran?

461
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,640
No, not yet.

462
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,560
Mi-ran's mother knew

463
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,880
that she was taking part
in the cryonics experiment.

464
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,120
I'm sorry.

465
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,240
I couldn't tell your parents

466
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,160
that you were participating
in the cryonics experiment.

467
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,000
I was worried that the experiment
might get exposed

468
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,760
and put Professor Hwang in grave danger.

469
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,800
I'm really sorry.

470
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,920
Hey.

471
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,360
Dong-chan, did you sleep well?

472
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,480
Ha-young.

473
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,360
I want to meet Ha-young.

474
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,800
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

475
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,920
-Good work, everyone.
-Thank you.

476
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,080
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

477
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,520
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

478
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,760
Thanks.

479
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,400
Hello?

480
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,480
Aren't you Na Ha-young, the news anchor?

481
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,320
Can I get an autograph?

482
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,320
Thank you.

483
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,920
Dong-chan.

484
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,760
Have you been well?

485
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,760
It's been 20 years already.

486
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,280
Yes, I know.

487
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,600
I'm really late, aren't I?

488
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,280
I should've listened to you
and gave up on the experiment

489
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,320
had I known that this was going to happen.

490
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,920
It's all in the past.

491
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,880
I already forgot about it all.

492
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,159
I'm sorry.

493
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,840
I couldn't keep my promise.

494
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,560
What did I tell you?

495
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,800
I told you not to do the experiment.

496
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,239
Why did you do that? Why?

497
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,440
You told me that you won't regret it.

498
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,520
But look what happened!

499
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,120
I'm sorry.

500
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,680
But I am

501
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,440
thankful that you are

502
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
still alive.

503
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,560
I have to go back to work.

504
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,520
I'll call you later.

505
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,440
Is there no way of resolving
hypothermia of the two people

506
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,160
who woke up?

507
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,320
Nothing for now.

508
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,320
During the first experiment,
the dolphin died

509
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,320
because we couldn't resolve
the problem of hypothermia.

510
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,280
Professor Hwang researched for years
to resolve this problem.

511
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,840
And in the end, he created
a medicine that returns

512
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,760
the body temperature to normal.

513
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,800
Professor Hwang is the only one
who could bring back

514
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,680
the two frozen people to life.

515
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,680
That means
if Professor Hwang doesn't wake up,

516
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,560
the two of them will remain in danger.

517
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,360
(Promissory note)

518
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
Is she

519
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,120
Ko Mi-ran?

520
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,360
Oh, no.

521
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,040
That's Ma Dong-chan. It's definitely him.

522
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
Mi-ran.

523
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,960
I looked everywhere for you.
Are you all...

524
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,120
What are you...

525
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,600
Give me back my 20 years.

526
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,000
Give me back my life that you took away!

527
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,880
-What's going on?
-Who is that?

528
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,360
Let's talk somewhere else.

529
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,000
Cut! Okay.

530
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,040
We're rehearsing.

531
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,600
Go on, everyone. Get moving.

532
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,240
Cameras, come on out.

533
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,520
Isn't she that woman

534
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,440
who took part in that experiment
with Dong-chan?

535
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,520
What?

536
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Yes.

537
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,360
Explain yourself. How can this happen?

538
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,840
Twenty years?

539
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,640
Wait, did you say it's only
for a day when it was 20 years?

540
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,360
What are you talking about?

541
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,760
I woke up with you.

542
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,120
I can't believe this.

543
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,680
I'm sorry, Mi-ran.

544
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,480
I'm also frustrated that this is

545
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,160
the only thing I can say to you.

546
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,920
But... But I'm a victim too.

547
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,040
That's your problem!

548
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,800
How will you pay me back
for the 20 years I lost?

549
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,680
My parents and my brother also
waited for me with frustration.

550
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,240
How will you compensate them
for that pain?

551
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,480
I know how you feel.

552
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,360
I feel the same way.

553
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,280
This is driving me crazy too!

554
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,960
Well, you know,

555
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,840
this is what happened.

556
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,720
Professor Hwang got into an accident

557
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,080
a few hours before
we were supposed to wake up.

558
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,640
We ended up sitting in there for 20 years

559
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,760
when it was supposed to be a day.

560
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,760
How am I going to live now?

561
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,160
How can I jump over 20 years
and live my life?

562
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,120
I hope this is a dream.

563
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,440
But this isn't a dream. It's reality.

564
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,600
I didn't get to see my brother grow up.

565
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,520
I couldn't get married or get a job.

566
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:29,720
I just slept in the capsule for 20 years.

567
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,120
That's my problem too. I suddenly woke up,

568
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,680
and I'm now 52 years old.

569
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,920
I mean, do you think I'm in my right mind?

570
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,360
We're in the same situation.

571
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,280
But wait.

572
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,680
We're alive.

573
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,480
The experiment was a success,
and we came back alive.

574
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,800
Think about it. Isn't this amazing?

575
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,600
We made history.

576
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,680
Isn't it amazing how we're the first
to survive the cryonics experiment?

577
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,040
Mi-ran, let us remember that glory

578
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,600
while living the remaining life.

579
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,760
Let us overcome this hardship together.

580
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,320
No!

581
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,440
No?

582
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,880
Anyway, Mr. Ma.

583
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,520
-Yes?
-Why do you speak casually to me?

584
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,360
What?

585
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,440
(Director Ma Dong-chan of TBO is)

586
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,320
(still missing after 50 days
without any traces.)

587
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,680
(There is no evidence or trace left
regarding the incident,)

588
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,680
(which makes
the investigation much harder.)

589
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,680
(-The missing...)
-President Kim!

590
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,240
Wait.

591
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,800
(The best TV show
chosen by the viewers...)

592
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,240
What is it? What's going on?

593
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,920
This is bad. There's another one.

594
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,440
What do you mean, there's another one?

595
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,640
I mean that there is
another one who was frozen.

596
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,560
Is this buy 1 get 1 free?
Why do they keep showing up?

597
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,400
-This is driving me insane.
-It's Ko Mi-ran.

598
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,080
-The woman who joined...
-She showed up?

599
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,440
Yes, the frozen female showed up.

600
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,440
But she has been thawed.

601
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,360
This is driving me crazy.

602
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,480
What are we going to do?

603
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,840
What do you think?

604
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,400
Should we hold hands
and run away together?

605
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,800
Why should we hold hands?

606
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,720
I'll come up with a follow-up
measure and call you again.

607
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,560
-Don't you dare run away.
-How can I run away?

608
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,200
Ms. Ko. I'm sure my passport has expired.

609
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,240
How can you joke around at this point?

610
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,640
I'm not joking.

611
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,120
I'm telling you
that I don't intend on running away.

612
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,520
What a jerk.

613
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,120
What? Wait

614
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,080
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

615
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,480
I'm glad.

616
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,040
I mean, I'm glad that the woman
from the experiment is okay.

617
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,480
Yes.

618
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,880
Ha-young.

619
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,920
Do you want

620
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,120
to meet up tomorrow?

621
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,040
Let's meet at the restaurant
we last saw each other.

622
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,360
That restaurant

623
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,680
closed down a long time ago.

624
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,880
Has it been 15 years?

625
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,640
I see.

626
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,560
The newsroom staff are having
a team dinner tomorrow,

627
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,160
so it won't work.

628
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,960
I see. Okay.

629
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,680
What's wrong with me?

630
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,760
I came to register
as I want to return to school.

631
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,280
You can do it at home on your computer.

632
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,280
What's your major and student number?

633
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,400
My major is Chinese Literature,
and I enrolled in 1996.

634
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,840
My name is Ko Mi-ran.

635
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,280
"Chinese Literature". "1996"

636
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,000
I'm sorry? "1996"?

637
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,120
By the way, did your name
used to be Hwang Byung-sim?

638
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,440
You received mail from
your high school alumni association.

639
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,200
It's under the name Hwang Byung-sim.

640
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,880
-Hello.
-Hello.

641
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,200
-Hello.
-Hey, there.

642
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,680
-Hello.
-Hi.

643
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,040
Hello.

644
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,160
Ko Mi-ran?

645
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,240
Excuse me.

646
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,800
(Women's Restroom)

647
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,600
I'm sorry.

648
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,240
(Mi-ran, why can't I reach you?)

649
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,160
(Did you really go to the US?)

650
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,800
(The number you have dialed
is not in service.)

651
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,040
(Mi-ran, I'm sorry.)

652
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,160
(I'm to blame.)

653
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,160
(Please forgive me.)

654
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,360
(I heard you moved to the US.)

655
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,880
(Did you leave because of me?)

656
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,120
(It's bad to ghost people.)

657
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,600
(You need to fix that.)

658
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,680
That idiot.

659
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,200
-What?
-Say that again.

660
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,400
What's wrong with you?

661
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,640
What can you do in your state?

662
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,040
What's wrong with the state I'm in?

663
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,680
I'm healthier than you.

664
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,320
You're not all there.

665
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,200
You were frozen then thawed,

666
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,160
so you're not very fresh.

667
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,360
I'm fresher than you.

668
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,760
Wait, Dong-chan.

669
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,120
I'm looking into a job for you.

670
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,280
Why don't you work in Programming Team

671
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,280
for a few months and take it easy
before you return?

672
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,000
I'll just get back to work right away.

673
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,920
Do you think this job is a joke?

674
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,920
If anyone takes broadcasting
more seriously than I do,

675
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,280
then I dare them to step up.

676
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,760
Do you take it more seriously
than I do? What about you?

677
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,400
I almost died while working.

678
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,880
Of course I don't think it's a joke.

679
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,920
Dong-chan, you should take a break.

680
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,120
I took a break for 20 years.
Do you want me to rest more?

681
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,800
I need to finish the program
I never got to finish

682
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,520
20 years ago with my own hands.

683
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,000
Since I started it,
I should see it to the end.

684
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,160
It's been 20 years.

685
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,480
"Infinite Experiment Paradise"

686
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,120
ended 20 years ago.

687
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,880
What do you mean?

688
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,200
I never said it could end,
so who ended it?

689
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,200
Hong-suk, be honest with me.

690
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,800
Are you scared?

691
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,120
Gosh, scared of what?

692
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,040
If people find out that a director

693
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,720
who disappeared 20 years ago
has come back,

694
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,720
they'll realize
that the station covered it up.

695
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,440
-When that happens...
-Stop, stop!

696
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,320
No one covered up anything.

697
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,080
If you won't take me in,
I'll go to a different station.

698
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,800
I'm Ma Dong-chan.

699
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,760
They'll fight over me.

700
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,360
-Dong-chan!
-Dong-chan!

701
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,800
Where are you going?

702
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,120
-Yes, where are you going? No.
-No.

703
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,680
(Please Help him.)

704
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,240
(Father... Father!)

705
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,080
Hurry up and get out.

706
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,360
Just do your business.
I'm your dad, it's okay.

707
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,200
Dad, there are boundaries you must keep

708
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,080
even with your family members.

709
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,280
Get out now.

710
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,080
I said, hurry up!

711
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,480
Gosh. I was in here first.

712
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,440
Hello, Dad.

713
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,480
Dong-chan, it's me.

714
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,880
Yes. Right.

715
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,000
I'm glad I ran into you.

716
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,360
Can you dye my hair?

717
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,520
I have so many grey hairs.

718
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,440
Okay.

719
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,080
Honey, hurry up and eat.

720
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,680
Dong-chan, come and eat.

721
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,240
Dong-chan, let's eat.

722
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,720
Come along.

723
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,800
My gosh.

724
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,800
Grandma, let's move to a place
with two bathrooms.

725
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,200
This place is too cramped for me.

726
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,080
Plus, Uncle Dong-chan is back.

727
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,360
Okay, let's do that.

728
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,200
I'm going to live diligently from now on.

729
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,240
I'm going to work really hard

730
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,080
now that my son has come back alive.

731
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,840
After what happened to you,

732
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,200
Mom totally gave up on everything.

733
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,800
I only lived because I had to.

734
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,160
I didn't live because I wanted to.

735
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,480
-Eat up.
-I'm sorry, Mom.

736
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,040
Why are you sorry?

737
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,560
Eat up.

738
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,520
Uncle Dong-chan, where were you
all this time?

739
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,400
My dad keeps saying
you're his older brother,

740
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,960
but you're young enough to be his son.

741
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,840
-Well...
-By any chance,

742
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,120
did you become a vampire?

743
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,600
There's this show on Youtube
called "Vampire Love".

744
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,160
And the male lead doesn't age
because he's under a spell.

745
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,520
Is that what happened to you?

746
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,200
What? "Youtube"?

747
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,520
Yes, you should quit work
and start a Youtube channel.

748
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,800
Elementary school kids
don't watch TV these days.

749
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,760
Dong-chan, she doesn't
take after her dad at all.

750
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,600
So she's very straightforward.

751
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,280
You seem a little flustered.

752
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,640
She's crazy about dramas.

753
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,840
We were always so busy,
so we let her watch TV a lot.

754
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,760
And she learned about life through dramas.

755
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,400
So she's a little overloaded.

756
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,120
Uncle, you should broadcast
our restaurant on TV.

757
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,960
Then we'll get a lot of customers.

758
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,000
There's this show where they help
unsuccessful restaurants.

759
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,120
I thought you didn't watch TV.
How do you know that?

760
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,080
Even if I don't watch TV,
I still need to know the trend.

761
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,400
I already know TV shows have
written scripts beforehand.

762
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,520
Just eat your food.

763
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,440
Did Dong-ju spend the night out again?

764
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,760
Dong-ju spent the night out?

765
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,040
She rarely comes home.

766
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,680
That darn brat sleeps outside?

767
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,600
You should shave her head
and stop her from going outside.

768
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,800
-Dong-chan.
-My gosh, you startled me.

769
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,800
Dong-chan, welcome.

770
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,920
I missed you.

771
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,880
I missed you, my brother.

772
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,240
You reek of alcohol.

773
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:34,200
Do you have any idea
how much I missed you?

774
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,960
Okay, I get it. Will you please let go?

775
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,360
Because of what happened you,

776
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,480
I can't live a single day without alcohol.

777
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,040
Will you stop drinking, you brat?

778
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,520
I got a call from the rehab clinic
for alcoholism.

779
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,280
They told me you missed
three days of treatment.

780
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,440
I went there and got my treatment!

781
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,320
Then we had some drinks afterward.

782
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,800
My goodness, you crazy brat.

783
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,360
I don't think it was a good idea
to send her there, Mom.

784
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,000
What's the point of going there
when she drinks after her treatment?

785
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,040
My goodness.

786
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,320
Dad.

787
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,560
I'm sorry.

788
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,680
Okay, ready?

789
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,960
-1, 2, 3.
-1, 2, 3.

790
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,720
-Let's take another one.
-Sit down.

791
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,520
-1, 2, 3.
-1, 2, 3.

792
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,160
-1, 2, 3.
-You look pretty.

793
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,240
Really? Let me take a look.

794
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,920
("Miss You Much", Leslie)

795
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,680
Excuse me.

796
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,200
Do you have Leslie Cheung's latest album?

797
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,480
How many albums has he released?

798
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,760
That album was released
to commemorate his death.

799
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,480
-What?
-Leslie Cheung's dead.

800
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,280
He died 16 years ago.

801
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,640
Leslie Cheung

802
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,560
is dead?

803
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,720
("Miss You Much")

804
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,560
Leslie Cheung!

805
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,840
Leslie Cheung!

806
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,600
(Ma Dong-chan)

807
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,960
Finally.

808
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,400
Okay, okay.

809
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,880
Now that I take a proper look,
you've aged so much.

810
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,360
Did you live recklessly?

811
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,000
I forgot to take my botox,
so my skin looks a little saggy.

812
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,600
Plus, I'm the chief,
and I'm pretty old now.

813
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,640
Yes, I know. So what?

814
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,560
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

815
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,640
Hey, guys. Keep up the good work.

816
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,520
Always focus on sincerity
rather than the ratings.

817
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,440
A director isn't a salesman.
You know that, right?

818
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,000
-Yes, sir!
-Good.

819
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,280
What a joke.

820
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,240
You'd better teach them
how to get good ratings.

821
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,320
Okay.

822
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,880
And is this the army or something?
Why are you being so strict?

823
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,200
(The main anchor for the
nine o'clock news will get replaced.)

824
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,680
(Let's just cover this up.)

825
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,680
We can't do that. We should check
if he's dead or alive.

826
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,360
What if something went wrong and he died?

827
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,120
He's probably dead already!

828
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,240
(I didn't have a choice.
There was nothing I could do.)

829
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,600
Dong-chan.

830
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,240
(Let's kiss each other
until we break our front teeth.)

831
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,480
I'm free on Friday.

832
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,480
Would you like

833
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,320
to meet?

834
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,040
(Melting Me Softly)

835
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,040
(You're a new face.
Have you worked in this field?)

836
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,320
(What do you think you're doing?)

837
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,720
Let's have celebrities go to an island

838
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,840
and make them cook
three meals a day there.

839
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,280
(I'm afraid your creativity
got frozen that day)

840
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,160
along with your brain.

841
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,320
Are you serious?

842
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,720
(-This is Ko Mi-ran.
-Ko Mi-ran wishes to meet us.)

843
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,240
(I ask for compensation.)

844
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,440
Be quiet!

845
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,600
(Aren't you cold, Dong-chan?)

846
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,800
(You haven't aged at all.
You look exactly the same.)

847
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,040
I was frozen in the freezer, okay?

848
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,400
Director Ma, can you get me a job?

849
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,720
A job?
