(Episode 14:
The People Who Want to Get Frozen)

7
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,560
This is good.

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,120
-It's doing well.
-Yes.

9
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,759
I'm glad.

10
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,240
Are you sure Director Ma really quit?

11
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
I don't think he did.

12
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,360
I love how unpredictable
and passionate he is.

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,039
Not everyone can be like him.

14
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,400
It all comes from confidence.

15
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,720
He was offered a lot of money,

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,760
and so many channels
are dying to recruit him.

17
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,440
-I'm so jealous.
-Me too.

(Cold-hearted Punk)

19

Hey, it's me.

20
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,560
How about we grab a drink together?

21
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,040
(Ko Mi-ran)

(The person you've called is

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,520
Mi-ran, you can drink juice.

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Here.

25
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,560
Let's all clink glasses.

26
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,440
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

27
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,120
She's dating someone.

28
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,360
-Who?
-It's someone you know.

29
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,240
-Who?
-Son Hyun-gi, the chief.

30
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,560
And she got a divorce.

31
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,880
I told you that I was going to.

32
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,000
By the way, how are you
and that director doing?

33
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,120
Gosh, the fortuneteller said you'd meet

34
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,480
your soulmate in 20 years.

35
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,720
Come to think of it,

36
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,200
she was really talented.

37
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,320
Yes.

38
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,480
I know that he is my soulmate.

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,640
But do you think I am his?

40
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,760
What?

41
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,280
Is something wrong?

42
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,720
What should I do?

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,400
You have more experience than me,
so you must be wiser.

44
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,800
Having more experience doesn't
always mean you're wiser.

45
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,480
Why do you think
there are so many old people

46
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
who cause trouble?

47
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,480
We just have

48
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,600
several solutions
based on our experiences.

49
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,600
What's wrong? Tell us.

50
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,560
I saw him

51
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,400
with his ex-girlfriend.

52
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Oh, my.

53
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,160
Do you think
he still has feelings for her?

54
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,360
Why do you think so?

55
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,200
Isn't that possible?

56
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,480
They didn't break up
because they wanted to.

57
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,159
They say men never forget
their first loves.

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,560
Here's my advice.

59
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,400
If what you're saying is true,

60
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,880
then cut him off.

61
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,640
You must meet a man who truly loves you.

62
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,320
Hey, is that girl pretty?

63
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,800
-How old is she?
-I don't know.

64
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,200
She's probably in her 40s.

65
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,280
Then she's not a girl.

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,200
She's pretty, awesome,

67
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,280
and successful.

68
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,720
I'm no match.

69
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,440
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

70
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,200
No matter how pretty
or awesome she may be,

71
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,640
you're younger than her.

72
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,400
What if he's just acting this way to me

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,400
because he feels responsible?

74
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
If you want him that badly,

75
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,160
beat her to a pulp.

76
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,720
Hey, what did the woman do so wrong?

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
She should beat the man instead.

78
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,200
Then beat both of them to a pulp.
Love is like war.

79
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,159
You need to go through a lot
to obtain your love.

80
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,240
Sophistication and elegance?
Throw them out the window.

81
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,720
You better listen to me.

82
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,720
Darn it.

83
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,760
Mr. Cryonics, what are you doing?

84
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,960
Is your sister home?

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,320
Mi-ran? Not yet. Why?

86
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,280
I can't reach her.
This has never happened before.

87
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,480
Should I call her?

88
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,560
Mi-ran.

89
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,560
Where are you?

90
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,560
Okay. Come home soon.

91
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,120
She picked up.

92
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,520
(The person you've called is
not available at the moment.)

93
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,960
What? What's her deal?

94
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,400
Is she filtering my calls?

95
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,880
But why?

96
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,360
My gosh.

97
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,520
Why are you so startled?

98
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,080
What is it?

99
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,600
Is something wrong?

100
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,120
No, it's nothing.

101
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,880
Why didn't you answer my calls?

102
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,720
Because I didn't want to.

103
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,840
Why not?

104
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,320
I know we'll fight if I tell you about it.

105
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,240
And I also know that I'll lose.

106
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,400
And when I do, I'll feel upset.

107
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,800
I'll get hurt, so I won't talk about it.

108
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,320
No, tell me.

109
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,720
I must hear it.

110
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,760
I'll try not to hurt you.

111
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,400
No, you can't do that.

112
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,000
Why not?

113
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,080
We shouldn't fight.

114
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,720
Since I'm the weaker one,

115
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,240
I'll get hurt no matter what.

116
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Wait. Why are you the weaker one?

117
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,800
That's because

118
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,480
my feelings for you are bigger.

119
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,799
Is something wrong?

120
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,039
I need to think about this.
We'll talk again tomorrow.

121
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,039
Right now, I'm too emotional.

122
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,039
I don't want to make a mistake.

123
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,720
Wait.

124
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,120
How could he not grab onto me?

125
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,680
What should I do?

126
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,600
What's gotten into her?

127
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,680
Why is she upset?

128
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,680
We'll be able to get you a house soon.

129
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,800
Come on, you shouldn't spend
the foundation's money on me.

130
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,680
Besides, I really enjoy living
in this house with Nam Tae.

131
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,800
He's grown on me.

132
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,240
But still, you need your own place
sooner or later.

133
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,400
We can talk about that again
once I figure out

134
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,800
how to raise your body temperature.

136
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,560
I'll take

137
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,040
that shot first.

138
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,920
Mi-ran wanted to get it first.

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,320
Gosh.

140
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,680
She's too fearless for her own good.

141
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,280
Come to think of it,
she went into the capsule

142
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,920
so fearlessly.

143
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
Goodness.

144
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,240
Look who's talking.

145
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,600
That's why you two go well together.

146
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,480
Professor Hwang.

147
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
Please let me get the shot first.

148
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,120
Okay, I will.

151
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,440
How awesome

152
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,160
and beautiful.

153
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,560
Make sure

154
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,560
you protect him.

155
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,160
Anyone would want him.

(Announcer Na Ha-young,

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,360
We started crowdfunding

158
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,160
regarding the cryonics experiment.

159
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,120
They've already raised
over 3 million in 1 day.

160
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,520
Wasn't Unsung Group going to fund it?

161
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,080
Chairman Lee Seok-du has returned as well.

162
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,440
He didn't want

163
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,040
such a large-sized company
to fund the project.

164

Is it Dong-chan

165

who started the project?

166
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Yes.

167

will enter a phase.

170
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,920
Then Dong-chan and Mi-ran

171
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,360
will be able to live
ordinary lives, right?

172
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,600
If the clinical test
is successful, then yes.

173
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,400
Can we cover it?

174
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,720
I did ask, but they said no.

175
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,840
I knew it.

176
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,920
This is most important,
so put it in the headlines.

177
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,840
And put this at the end.

178
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,080
Good.

179
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,360
Why haven't you gotten married yet?

180
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,560
Do you know how rude that question is?

181
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,520
If it was, I apologize.

182
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,080
Are you asking me

183
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,960
if it was because of Dong-chan?

184
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,000
Had you asked me straightforwardly,

185
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,960
it would've been easier for me to answer.

186
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,360
Do you still

187
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,760
have feelings for him?

188
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,840
-Ms. Ko!
-You're really cool.

189
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,400
You're still beautiful too.

190
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,160
Most of all,

191
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,280
you're someone Dong-chan once loved.

192
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,240
You

193
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,400
bother me.

194
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,680
Are you that unsure of yourself?

195
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,600
(Building Entrance, Parking)

196
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,720
Are you that unsure of yourself?

197
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,440
I'm not unsure of myself.

198
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,240
What are you unsure of?

199
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,280
Nothing.

200
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,440
Come out. We should talk.

201
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,280
See? I told you he didn't quit.

202
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,160
You're right. What's the matter, then?

203
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,440
We need to take action right away.

204
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,280
Now tell me what's going on.

205
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,440
I saw you on the rooftop
with Ms. Na yesterday.

206
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,560
I see. So that's what this was about.

207
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,040
Is that why you didn't
take my calls yesterday?

208
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,440
What's going on between you two?

209
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,520
What happened yesterday?

210
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,800
I don't want to talk about it.

211
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,280
Also, I should respect her privacy.

212
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,240
I just...

213
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,800
We just resolved
a long-standing misunderstanding.

214
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,000
What misunderstanding?

215
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,200
Do you even like me?

216
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,800
Now that I think about it,
I don't think you do.

217
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,040
I told you my ex-boyfriend
stayed in the rooftop room,

218
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,600
but you weren't jealous at all.

219
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,120
I don't think you fell for me.

220
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,240
I acted like I wasn't jealous

221
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,360
because I didn't want
to make a fuss about it.

222
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,200
I was still furious inside.

223
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,800
Do you know how hard it was

224
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,640
for me to act like I was cool?

225
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,200
I don't want to act small in front of you.

226
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,560
I smiled and let it go

227
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,920
so I could look like a cool guy.

228
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,240
But, it was a complete mess
inside my head.

229
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,320
You don't think I fell for you?

230
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,280
Fine. To be honest,
it wasn't love at first sight.

231
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,080
I can't say things I don't feel,
so I want you to understand.

232
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,520
Keep going.

233
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,080
Why do you like me
if you didn't fall for me?

234
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Exactly.

235
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,440
I don't know either.

236
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't know what part of you I like,

237
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,880
but I just love you to death.

238
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,640
I'm an old guy,

239
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,119
so I can't go on because this
will make me squirm. Let's stop.

240
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,319
Are you abusing your power on me?

241
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,480
You keep on saying
you're inferior to me, but...

242
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,360
No matter how much you like me,
you can't compare to me.

243
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,000
I'll still like you more.

244
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,480
Don't be silly.

245
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,360
How would you know
if you like me more or not?

246
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,720
It's not like we can weigh
our feelings for each other.

I searched my last name,
and there's a pork restaurant,

a dim sum restaurant, a sushi place,

a chicken restaurant, and a cart bar.

257
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,720
Why did you save the number to a cart bar?

258
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,120

-Why don't you just laugh?

271

Right. I'm the inferior,
so I shouldn't say anything.

I'm hungry. I haven't eaten anything
since last night.

Didn't I tell you not to skip meals
a thousand times?

You never listen.

Why did you hand in a resignation letter?

276
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,240
Because I should be responsible
for what I did.

You have to listen to me
because I'm your superior.

330
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,920
Every woman in their 20s knows who he is.

331
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,640
But what does that have
anything to do with me?

332
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,280
He apparently wants to meet you.

333
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,560
Why?

334
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,840
How would I know?

335
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,320
You should get going.
He's waiting in the meeting room.

336
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,840
Right now?

337
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,240
Hello, I'm Jang Woo Sin.

338
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,360
I'm Ko Mi-ran.

339
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,320
Yes, I know.

340
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,160
May I ask

341
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,080
why you wanted to meet me?

342
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,320
I met Professor Jo Gi Bum.

343
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,400
You met Professor Jo?

344
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,120
Why?

345
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,520
Because

346
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,240
I want to be a cryonic.

347
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,840
There's this woman I really love.

348
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,240
But it's not easy to marry the woman
you love in a family like mine.

349
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,040
So I've been dating her in secret.

350
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,960
But she's

351
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,000
really sick right now.

352
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,280
She got diagnosed
with an incurable illness.

353
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,640
And I can't let her
get frozen all by herself.

354
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,480
That's why you want to
get frozen with her?

355
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,760
Yes.

356
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,240
Here's why I wanted to meet you.

357
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,680
I don't get cold that easily,
so I'm okay with it.

358
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,280
But she's a woman. I want to know
if it'll be okay for her

359
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,720
to be in there for a long time

360
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,840
and if it hurts by any chance.

361
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
I just wanted to ask you
those kinds of stuff.

362
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,520
I wanted to check with my own eyes.

363
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,280
It doesn't hurt at all.

364
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,200
And it's not cold.

365
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,640
All you need to do
is dream of a better future.

366
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,920
Really?

367
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,400
Yes, of course.

368
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,040
I'm relieved to hear that.

369
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,760
Thank you.

370
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,440
But

371
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,680
why do you want to get frozen with her?

372
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,280
Why can't you just wait for her?

373
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,520
I want to be with her
in the same place and time.

374
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,560
And that's the only way I could think of.

375
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,640
I'm a very simple guy.

376
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,400
I'll be off, then.

377
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,800
-Hello.
-Keep up the good work.

378
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,440
He came to work again.

379
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,640
So what? What do you want me to do?

380
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,720
Do you know what the board wants?

381
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,800
They want to promote Dong-chan
to the Variety Department's chief.

382
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,800
What? Then what about me?

383
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,040
You'll just have to
give him your position.

384
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,880
Those people are unbelievable.

385
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,400
Our broadcasting station needs
to do something big.

386
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,840
We're facing a huge crisis.

387
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,160
Even so, that's way too much.

388
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,200
They can't let a 32-year-old
become a chief.

389
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,240
Then why do you always
get intimidated by that 32-year-old?

390
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,080
That's why I
desperately want him to leave.

391
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,920
Why do you still come here
after you decided to quit?

392
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,240
You still want to work here, don't you?

393
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,960
Do you go to the bathroom

394
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,840
because you want to work there?

395
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Then why do you keep
coming to the broadcasting station?

396
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,320
You already quit.

397
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,560
It's force of habit. I just come here.

398
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,960
Anyway, that means

399
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,040
you don't want to work here, right?

400
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,640
The work I should've completed
20 years ago still remains undone.

401
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,120
I'll leave once I'm done with that.

402
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,800
My gosh, I'm glad you decided to do that.

403
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,560
What kind of nonsense is that?

404
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,400
That makes no sense at all.

405
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,680
Instead, I'm only going to work on
the stuff I'm interested in.

406
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,040
You better not interfere.

407
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,880
Yes, of course.
You're free to do whatever you want.

408
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,680
Go ahead.

409
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,280
-My gosh.
-Mom, why are you angry?

410
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,560
Remember when Professor Hwang told us

411
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,520
that Dong-chan's seeing someone?

412
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
I always wanted to know who he was seeing.

413
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,280
And after waiting for so long,
I finally asked him.

414
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,320
And you won't believe
who it turned out to be.

415
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,720
Stop hesitating and just tell us.

416
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,600
The cryonic.

417
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,640
-What?
-I'm talking about that girl

418
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
who also participated in the experiment.

419
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,120
That's the girl he's dating.

420
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,840
My gosh, no wonder
they seemed so friendly.

421
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,760
They looked really close
at the filming site as well.

422
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,520
But her body temperature is so low.

423
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,080
Is she even capable of having kids?

424
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,000
Dong-chan's the eldest son of our family.

425
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,920
He's also a cryonic.

426
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,960
So it might be possible.

427
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,360
My gosh, be quiet.

428
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,880
I won't ever approve of her.

429
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,040
Of all the people he could date,
why does it have to be a cryonic?

430
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,560
You all know
how dearly I think of Dong-chan!

431
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,440
But he's a cryonic too.

432
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,800
I heard you'll be taking the semester off.

433
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,040
Yes, I'm going to
apply for military service.

434
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,160
I see.

435
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,280
That's a good idea.

436
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,120
Do you have a girlfriend?

437
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,920
There's someone I like.

438
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,080
But she's dating someone else.

439
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,600
Are you talking about Mi-ran?
Your mom's friend?

440
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Yes.

441
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,160
You know you can't date her, right?

442
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,600
Just find yourself another girl.

443
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,360
I'll make my own decisions.

444
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,840
I'm planning to work on a new project,

445
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
and I want you as my staff.

446
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,680
But I'm already working with Mi-ran
on "Go Go 99".

447
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,040
No, I'll take care of that for you.

448
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,160
-So I want you on my team.
-Do I have no choice?

449
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,760
-No, you don't.
-Why does it have to be me?

450
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,120
Because I really like you.

451
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,520
Hey, Dong-sik.

452
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,280
Dong-chan, we have an emergency
family meeting today.

453
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,240
I didn't know we had family meetings.

454
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,760
We just came up with it today.

455
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,440
Oh, I see. Did you fix the bathroom?

456
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,720
No, not yet.

457
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,840
We closed the restaurant early today.

458
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,440
What's the urgent matter?

459
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,920
You should come home
with the girl you're seeing.

460
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,120
What?

461
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,760
Don't be nervous.

462
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,440
My mom probably just wants
to tell us to be careful

463
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,720
before we get the shot to retrieve
our normal body temperature.

464
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,880
You can relax.

465
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,600
Okay.

466
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,960
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Kim.

467
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,080
Dong-chan's staying at your place, right?

468
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,520
I already told them about it.

469
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,880
Yes, the rooftop room in my house
happened to be empty.

470
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,360
Oh, I see. What a relief.

471
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,240
I thought you guys were
sleeping in the same room.

472
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,840
Will you cut the nonsense?

473
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,240
Why are you taking it out on me?

474
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,160
Don't mind them.

475
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,800
By the way,

476
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
why did you want to see us, Mom?

477
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,800
I heard you two are dating.

478
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,960
Yes.

479
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,040
You're not thinking of
getting married, are you?

480
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,560
My gosh, Mom. You can't just ask us that

481
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,040
-all of a sudden...
-No, we're not.

482
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,320
I'm only 24.

483
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,280
I don't plan on getting married yet.

484
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,920
That's a relief.

485
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,120
I just want to let you know
that you two can never get married.

486
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,280
No way.

487
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,720
I don't plan on getting married.

488
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,800
But can you tell me

489
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,280
why we're not allowed to get married?

490
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,760
Listen to me.

491
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,520
-You're not good enough for my son.
-Mom.

492
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,360
I'm pretty likable.

493
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,160
You sound awfully confident.

494
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,680
I work really hard,

495
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,640
I'm not a picky-eater,
and I have a great personality.

496
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,120
I also have a lot of money.

497
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,760
The broadcasting station
owes me 70 million dollars.

498
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,160
What do you mean? That's not true.

499
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,080
If you think about it, your son
is getting paid with my money.

500
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,000
What do you mean?

501
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,960
You know how peculiar he is.

502
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,080
No one can tolerate him.

503
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,360
I'm peculiar?

504
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,120
You're so brazen.

505
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,000
Also, in dramas,

506
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,760
they usually hand over an envelope.

507
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,280
Hey.

508
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,320
She's no joke. You're hilarious.

509
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,920
I'm not asking for one, though.

510
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,680
How are you not intimidated by the elderly

511
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and dare to joke around?

512
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,280
I feel like I should joke around
and soothe your anger.

513
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,720
When I get paid next week,
I'll bring something tasty.

514
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,720
What do you like?

515
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,640
Why are you here?

516
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,080
Don't say such a hurtful thing.

517
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,880
How dare you come in here?

518
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,480
Should I report you for trespassing?

519
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,120
Please do so that I can sleep in jail.

520
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,000
Is something wrong?

521
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,320
I think there's a ghost in my studio.

522
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,000
Quit blabbering and get out.

523
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,400
At 12am, I hear a woman taking a shower.

524
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,040
But when I check, there's no one.

525
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,440
Isn't that creepy?

526
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,199
Why do you think it's a woman?

527
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,280
You're right. Why do I think so?

528
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,280
That's because it's not a ghost.

529
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,880
You're just desperate for a woman.

530
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,480
-Young-sun, I'm scared.
-What do you want me to do?

531
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,679
Can I stay here for the night?

532
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,159
Get out, or I'll beat you.

533
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,040
You should leave and go through
the legal procedures before coming.

534
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,719
This isn't going to help you.

535
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,880
You're so cold-hearted.

536
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,560
You got that from that punk
who's only 52 on paper, right?

537
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,679
Did my family offend you?

538
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
I'm sorry.

539
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,400
I wasn't offended.

540
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,400
I would've done the same
had I been your mother.

541
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,600
-Why?
-Because I'd have

542
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,680
the most wonderful son in the world.

543
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,480
No woman would satisfy her.

544
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,880
(Do you want to come up?)

545
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,600
(Do you want to come up?)

546
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,760
(You wait there.)

547
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,720
Hey.

548
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
Hey.

549
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,360
My mom's down there.

550
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,200
Guess whom I met today.

551
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
What?

552
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,080
Was it your favorite idol?

553
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,920
A man whose girlfriend was suffering
from an incurable disease

554
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,600
visited me.

555
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,160
He said

556
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,040
he was going to get into
a capsule just like her.

557
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,360
Really?

558
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,680
He wanted to ask me
for the female's point of view.

559
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,120
He asked if it was scary
or if it caused pain.

560
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,160
He was curious.

561
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,320
If I ever

562
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,040
enter the capsule again,

563
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,560
don't join me.

564
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,480
Why would you say that?

565
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,200
Why would you go back in there?

566
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,880
Why would you say such a horrible thing?

567
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,680
If something like that happens to me,

568
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,240
protect me from outside the capsule.

569
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,000
-Okay?
-Don't worry about that.

570
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,120
Why would I enter another capsule?

571
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,720
Over my dead body.

572
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,920
That doesn't sound pleasing to me.

573
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,400
So you'll be
Dong-chan's assistant director?

574
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,320
Yes.

575
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,600
Do you know that I began my career here

576
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,480
as his assistant director?

577
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,680
I heard about that.

578
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,280
I pity you.

579
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,280
If there's anything I must keep
in mind as his assistant director,

580
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,000
please tell me, sir.

581
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,040
Let me tell you about Dong-chan.

582
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,040
You look so old from up-close.

583
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,560
-How could you...
-(Don't compliment him.)

584
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,960
(He'll get mad for stating the obvious.)

585
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,160
-That's not it.
-Then what?

586
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,320
(Don't criticize him.)

587
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,520
You wanted me to be comfortable.

588
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,000
Yes, be comfortable. I didn't scold you.

589
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,880
-(He'll get extremely upset.)
-That's so disgusting!

590
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,480
(Don't bite your nails.)

591
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,520
(He will say that it's disgusting.)

592
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,440
During fall and winter,
don't wear angora wool.

593
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,920
He'll yell about the fur.

594
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,360
During the summer,
don't wear sleeveless shirts.

595
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,320
He'll yell about the hair.

596
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,040
That's a list of people from YouTube

597
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,880
who will have their pre-interviews.

598
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,400
What kind of interview is it?

599
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,120
It's about those who want to get frozen.

600
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,360
(Interview of the participants for
"Those Who Want to Get Frozen")

601
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,400
Hello.

602
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,080
We'll begin.

603
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,440
My plastic surgery...

604
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,480
(Kim Ah-reum, 26 years old)

605
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,640
fell through.

606
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,560
I'm about to go insane.
It's eating me up inside.

607
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,120
When I wake up 10 years later,

608
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,640
wouldn't I be able to receive

609
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,520
better reconstructive surgery
and become prettier?

610
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,240
You You want to become prettier?

611
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,520
Next. Okay, thank you.

612
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,040
I don't want to live anymore.

613
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,440
I'm not suited for this world.

614
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,200
I'd rather go into the capsule than die.

615
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,760
-Next. Next one.
-Next.

616
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,160
I don't want to take the SAT.

617
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,600
I'm serious. I hate it so much.

618
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,120
In 20 years,

619
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,920
-they probably wouldn't have it
-Get out.

620
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,120
Hey, get out!

621
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,480
My business is failing.

622
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,200
I don't see the future.

623
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,360
I can't live like this anymore.

624
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,960
I want to escape.

625
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,720
My building, house, bankbook, and bond

626
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,320
will cost about
30 million dollars in total.

627
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,800
It's such a waste to hand them over

628
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,520
to my sons or their wives.

629
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,400
But I don't want to die either.

630
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,120
Just freeze me, will you?

631
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,480
-I want reconstructive surgery.
-I want to die.

632
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,040
-I don't want to take the SAT.
-I can't live like this anymore.

633
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,480
It's such a waste.

634
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,560
-Is this it?
-Yes.

635
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,360
Hello.

636
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,360
Are you Nam Ki-seok's parents?

637
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,480
-Are you Director Ma Dong-chan?
-Yes.

638
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,800
-Hello.
-Hello.

639
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,440
My son is suffering from
rare childhood cancer.

640
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,160
The current medications are of no use.

641
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,000
The government is no longer
supporting us either.

642
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,000
We're aware that several anticancer drugs

643
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,960
are being produced every year.

644
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,040
But our son is running out of time.

645
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,760
If he's given more time,

646
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,040
he'll be able to receive
the right anticancer drug.

647
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
Right.

648
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,920
I completely understand.

649
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,200
I would like to help you as much as I can.

650
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,760
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

651
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,920
But you see...

652
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,240
Producing the right anticancer drug

653
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,320
may take 20, 30, or 50 years.

654
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,480
It's not certain.

655
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,320
Then you'll just lose your chance

656
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,240
of making new memories with him.

657
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,720
And when he wakes up,
he'll be heartbroken to know that.

658
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,480
Will you be all right?

659
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,480
We know that.

660
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,400
Something might happen to us

661
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,680
while our son is in there.

662
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,400
Then he'll be left alone.

663
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,040
But we can't just watch him die.

664
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,480
I wish I could give my son
the rest of my life.

665
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,160
There's so much
he hasn't been able to see yet.

666
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,920
I can't let him die like this.

667
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,040
It's so heartbreaking.

668
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,520
I don't know what would be right.
It's tough.

669
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,480
If I was the son, I wouldn't go in.

670
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,640
If I was a parent, I'd make him go in.

671
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,920
That's how I feel.

672
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,560
I'm sure Professor Hwang started
this research for the same reasons.

673
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,600
You saw the interview earlier
so you must know,

674
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,800
but many people think
the cryonics experiment is easy.

675
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,600
We need to teach people
the concept and the goal

676
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,400
of this project again.

677
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,600
I'll help as much as I can.

678
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,400
You're so cool.

679
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,160
What?
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

680
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,520
I'm just honored to be able

681
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,320
to work on such a project with you.
I suddenly felt that way.

682
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,040
Suddenly? Gosh.

683
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,600
You're really something.

684
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,800
You know how to separate
your personal feelings from work.

685
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,840
Let's go. You can go home.

686
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,200
Okay.

687
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,320
(Inferior)

688
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,120
Hello?

689
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,680
Are you done?

690
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,440
Wait just a little bit.
I'm on my way to get you.

691
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,400
Okay.

692
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,200
Ko Mi-ran!

693
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,760
What?

694
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,600
I'll be right there.

695
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,040
I asked management

696
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,600
to check the CCTV footage
in the parking lot, so please wait.

697
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,840
Okay.

698
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,320
Yes?

699
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,360
Do you mean that motorcycle
wasn't registered?

700
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,880
I understand. Thank you, Detective Seo.

701
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,560
In my opinion,

702
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,320
it wasn't a mistake.
He drove into you intentionally.

703
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,080
You know Professor Hwang's abductor
is wanted, right?

704
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,880
You never know, so be careful from now on.

705
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,200
Thank you.

706
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,400
I'm

707
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,640
not someone you should thank.

708
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,920
Don't thank me.

709
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,360
I better ask Young-tak for bodyguards.

710
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,440
If it wasn't for Ms. Na,
I'd be in trouble.

711
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,640
I was so surprised.
My body still feels hot.

712
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,320
Let's go have something cold.

713
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,520
Where did he go?

714
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,680
What is this?

715
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,640
I'm too anxious.

716
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,400
Make sure you carry this with you.

717
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,640
Could I test it out right now?

718
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,920
I'm not kidding.

719
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,600
If anyone hangs around you,

720
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,880
then give them a taste of this right away.

721
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,960
Don't do that. What are you doing?

722
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,960
You're the one
who hangs around me the most.

723
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,160
Don't joke around.

724
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,000
You better take this
with you all the time.

725
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,600
Hello?

726
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,640
Hey, our washroom was fixed.
Come back home.

727
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,280
I see. It's still not working?

728
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,520
Yes. I knew it.

729
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,720
What are you saying?
I told you it's fixed.

730
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,840
They told us a week,

731
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,080
but it's going to take another week?

732
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,560
Hello? Can't you hear me?

733
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,640
They told us a week,

734
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,280
(but they fixed it in three days.)

735
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,440
Hey, we might as well move.

736
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,240
Yes. Okay, I better go.

737
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,920
Hello?

738
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,480
What was that? Is he crazy?

739
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,200
What was that?

740
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,840
Why does it take so long
to fix a washroom?

741
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,960
They're not done yet.
It's going to take another week.

742
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,720
It takes a really long time.

743
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,160
We need water to come out well.

744
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,520
That's why it takes long.

745
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,880
He hung up on me after talking nonsense.

746
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,720
We shouldn't leave him in that house.

747
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,320
He should come back right away.

748
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,720
A man and a woman
shouldn't be so close together.

749
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,400
It's not like they can do anything
just because they're close.

750
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,840
They can't get their temperatures up.

751
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,880
That's why they shouldn't be
staying so close together.

752
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,360
What if they die unnatural deaths?

753
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,640
No way.

754
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,880
Uncle Dong-chan got a gold button
as soon as he started YouTube.

755
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,960
He's going to bring in so much money.

756
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,840
But I heard he decided to go back to work.

757
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,880
-Who told you that?
-I'm close with the chief.

758
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,720
He told me he's going to quit
since Dong-chan is coming back.

759
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,480
He's so thoughtless.

760
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,760
Why would he say that to you?

761
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,040
(Complete)

762
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,960
Mr. Ma.

763
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,160
It's complete.

764
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,920
The two of you

765
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,320
will be able to live normally soon.

766
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,040
You went through so much.

767
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,800
Thank you for all the work,
Professor Hwang.

768
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,360
Thank you.

769
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,880
(Thank you.)

770
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,200
(Thank you.)

771
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,520
(Bureau Chief Na Ha-young)

772
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,920
Hello?

773
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,840
It's me. Can we meet right now?

774
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,120
I'll come near your place.

775
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,480
Please give me your address.

776
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,760
(Everyone's going crazy while
fighting about your girlfriend.)

777
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,280
(You're not here,
but they're fighting each other.)

778
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,480
It must've been so boring
when I wasn't here.

779
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,000
Hey, Seo-yoon.

780
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,200
I'm getting my shot tomorrow
to bring my body temperature back.

781
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,680
Really? That's crazy.

782
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,360
I better tell Grandma.

783
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,600
(No, don't tell her yet.)

784
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,680
Let's keep it a secret
between us for a while.

785
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,600
Okay. I'll tell you a secret too.

786
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,800
I made a boyfriend.

787
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,080
Really? What does he do?

788
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,320
What do you think?
He's in elementary school.

789
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,240
Did you expect him to be
a prosecutor or a judge?

790
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,840
No, I guess you're right.

791
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,080
Then does he at least want to be
a prosecutor or a judge?

792
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,320
(What kind of kid dreams of becoming
a prosecutor or a judge?)

793
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,360
(They either want to become
a YouTuber or an idol star.)

794
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,760
I see.

795
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,040
(Anyway, you should come home
after you get the shot tomorrow.)

796
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,120
Stop staying at someone else's house.

797
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,600
Okay, fine. You should go to bed.

798
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,840
-(Goodnight, Uncle.)
-Bye.

799
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,800
Why did you want to meet me?

800
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,160
I don't know how much you know.

801
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,160
But I once made a deal
with Lee Hyeong-du regarding you.

802
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,280
And because of that,

803
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,120
I even got investigated by
the prosecution.

804
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,120
What do you mean you made a deal
regarding me?

805
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,600
It literally means I tried
to make a deal with Lee Hyeong-du

806
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,640
regarding you.

807
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,920
What kind of deal?

808
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,200
I asked him

809
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,040
to put you back in the cryonic capsule.

810
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,040
Why would you do something like that?

811
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,120
How could you?

812
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,800
I was still in love
and obsessed with Dong-chan.

813
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,320
And I was jealous of the girl

814
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,440
he was in love with.

815
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,240
You probably wouldn't understand.

816
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,280
I had hit rock bottom.

817
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,920
Did you think

818
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,920
you'd be able to
get him back if I disappeared?

819
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I just wanted

820
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,440
to put him through pain.

821
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,880
He would've had to grow old without you.

822
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,080
And when the woman he loves
shows up still looking young

823
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,600
and neglects him, that'd cause him pain.

824
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,480
I wanted him to feel that pain as well.

825
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,080
Does he

826
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,720
also know about this?

827
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,600
No, not yet.

828
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,800
But he'll

829
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,120
find out soon.

830
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,400
I don't

831
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,080
want him to know.

832
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,080
Let's just keep it between ourselves.

833
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,240
(What are you doing? Are you sleeping?)

834
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,240
(No, I'm outside.)

835
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,800
(Hurry up and come home.
What are you doing outside?)

836
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,160
(I told you not to wander around
because it's dangerous.)

837
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,720
(Where are you right now?)

838
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,240
(Don't worry. I'm in front of the house.)

839
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,960
(I'll be home soon.)

840
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,120
(It's over now.)

841
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,600
(It's all done.)

842
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,760
I fell asleep while waiting for you.

843
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,280
What took you so long?

844
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,080
Where were you?

845
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,120
I met a friend.

846
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,720
That pretty friend of yours?

847
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,240
Just a second.

848
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,560
Here.

849
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,480
What's this?
Is it a tear gas gun this time?

850
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,600
We won't

851
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,800
have to wear this anymore.

852
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,760
Let's hang in there, okay?

853
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,760
It's pretty.

854
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,840
Now that you're wearing that watch,
why don't you reconsider?

855
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,880
Reconsider what?

856
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,240
Do you really

857
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,560
have no plans to get married?

858
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,200
Do you want to marry me?

859
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,640
Then

860
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,000
I want you to wait until I turn 30.

861
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,480
Okay, fine. I guess I have no choice.

862
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,080
It's pretty.

863
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,360
We'll begin the injection.

864
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,720
After a week,

865
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,760
your body temperature
will finally come back to normal.

866
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,320
I heard Dong-chan is
meeting Professor Hwang today.

867
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,720
Is he trying to get the shot first?

868
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,400
Who's that? I thought
I wasn't getting any backup.

869
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,120
Wait here for a second.

870
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,760
Okay.

871
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,600
This is just a transitional phenomenon.

872
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,280
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

873
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,800
Hey, what's up?

874
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,600
A police car?

875
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,600
Are you telling me
he drives around in a police car?

876
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,640
(Police)

877
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,920
(We'd like to thank Park Jin Young
for his special appearance.)
