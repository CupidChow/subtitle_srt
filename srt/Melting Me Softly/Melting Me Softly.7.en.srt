my temperature too.

00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,840
-Hey, sweetheart.
-Hello.

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,280
-Hi.
-Hi, frozen prince.

12
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:11,400
Hello, frozen prince.

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,840
-Sweetheart.
-Hey.

14
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,560
My gosh, they startled me.

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,200
My body temperature is rising.

16
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,840
I should get going.

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,759
(There are a lot of things that
I want to do for you.)

18
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,920
Please give me a chance.

19
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,400
I never loved anyone sincerely.

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,120
You told me that
you'd run away from the truth

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,800
since it's the best way to protect me.

22
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,960
But we should

23
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,560
face it head-on.

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,240
Let's face all our struggles
and get our anger out together.

25
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,720
Can we?

26
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,440
You can leave me after that.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,640
We can't just end it like this.

28
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,240
Do you think

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,560
we can overcome the 20 years that flew by?

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,720
I resent you for what you did.

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,560
I'm sure the time we spent apart
left you in pain.

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,280
You've matured during
the past 20 years too.

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,120
But I lost my chance to do that.

34
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,880
I'm just a selfish guy who's immature.

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,640
I only care about myself.

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,600
And right now,

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,920
I resent you.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,079
Director Ma.

39
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,720
She's my girlfriend.

41
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,040
The bureau chief was
Director Ma's girlfriend.

42
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
Did she wait for him all along?

43
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,960
Did she love him that much?

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,240
At least he had a girlfriend from before.

45
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,640
What about me?

46
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
He's supposed to find a way
to thaw Mi-ran.

47
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,880
All he does is go through
our freezer every night!

48
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,440
What is this mess?

49
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
Maybe he's feeling pressured.

50
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
What?

51
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,640
To thaw everything that's frozen.

52
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,000
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,640
Can you tie my hair in a bun?

54
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,320
Hey, Byung-sim fell asleep at my place.

55
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,040
Get over here and take him home.

56
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,600
Just leave him there.

57
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,360
Ji-hun.

58
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,200
I'm considering a divorce.

59
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,800
Are you okay with that?

60
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,680
Mom.

61
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,960
Can you live without Dad?

62
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,480
Ever since I was younger, I wondered

63
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,480
why you never got divorced when
you fight all the time.

64
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,680
As I grew older, I realized

65
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,440
that it's because you can't let him go.

66
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,360
It's better to stay happy than
to stay in an unhappy marriage.

67
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,120
If that's the reason,
I'll respect your decision.

68
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,640
It's your life anyway.

Did you have breakfast, sir?

No, I only eat one meal a day.

Hey.

the editing room yesterday?

I realized that I gave you
the wrong proposal.

91
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,080
I wanted to give you
the updated version before I left.

92
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,520
Then why did you just leave?

93
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,000
-It seemed like bad timing.
-What do you mean?

94
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,960
I mean, you guys seemed a little...

95
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
It wasn't anything urgent anyways.

96
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,440
I was going to give it to you later.

97
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,120
If it wasn't that urgent,

98
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,040
why bother coming to the editing room?

99
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,840
Why are you trying to start a fight?

100
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,000
Am I starting a fight?

101
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,159
This is just how I ask questions.

102
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,400
Let me make myself clear.

103
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,880
If you have to talk to me
or feel feverish,

104
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,640
report to me regardless
of whatever situation I may be in.

105
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,480
Even if I'm with a woman at a hotel,

106
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,040
don't bother being considerate.

107
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,840
You'd better call or come right away.

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,480
I'm not that rude, you know.

109
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,720
Being rude is better
than fainting from a fever.

110
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,200
Do you understand?

111
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,720
-Yes.
-Good.

112
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
What's his issue?

113
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,640
Does he have a hormonal problem?

114
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,440
Is that your ideal type?

115
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,680
No, I don't like Korean women.

116
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,680
Why is everyone so weird?

117
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,480
Does that mean he likes Korean men?

118
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
What nonsense.

119
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,559
Nam-tae spends a lot of time
with Professor Hwang these days.

120
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,320
It's helping him become more social.

121
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,799
I'm glad we chose to do this.

122
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,760
We should make good use
of the attic now that Mi-ran's back.

123
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,640
Let's upload a post about
our attic's availability.

124
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,520
I'll upload your cellphone number.

125
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,720
I need to go to the office today.

126
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,400
Make sure you pick up if anyone calls.

127
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,840
Okay.

128
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
Hello?

129
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,360
Okay, I'll be right there.

130
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,240
-The cops are here.
-Okay.

131
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Professor Hwang.

132
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,360
Hello?

133
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,600
You haven't left yet, right?

134
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,720
-Not yet.
-Then could you bring

135
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,400
the documents that
I just texted you about?

136
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,600
We have to publish them.

137
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,120
Okay.

138
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,480
I'm getting some
herbal medicine for Mi-ran.

139
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,760
Why are you stopping me?

140
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,080
You can't do that.

141
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,400
A cryogenic human needs to maintain
a body temperature of 31.5℃.

142
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,720
Herbal medicine can raise
her body temperature.

143
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,720
Do you remember it now?

144
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,640
Body temperature, 31.6℃.

145
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,040
Heart rate, 107, 108, 110?

146
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,320
Why is your heart rate
increasing suddenly?

147
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,600
Look at this.

148
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
And your body temperature is at 31.7℃.

149
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,480
Because you surprised me.

150
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,800
Getting nervous?

151
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,400
-What?
-Listen up.

152
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,720
Our body temperature goes up
when our heart rate goes up suddenly.

153
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,160
We have to stop
our heart rate from going up.

154
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,720
What makes it go up?

155
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,960
First, don't run.

156
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,680
Second, don't get worked up.

157
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,480
And don't watch any porn.

158
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,400
Tell yourself that.

159
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,320
If you think you'll get worked up,

160
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,880
make sure you take a cold shower first.

161
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,880
My heart rate is going up
because I'm getting angry.

162
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,680
Yes, Young-sun?

163
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,720
Okay.

164
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,120
I know that place.

165
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,680
See you later.

166
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,920
Your friend?

167
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
Yes.

168
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,160
That gorgeous friend?

169
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,840
Yes.

170
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,320
Do you have your fever-reducer shot
at all times?

171
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
What?

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No.

173
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,960
I told you to bring it around.

174
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,080
Okay, fine

175
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,240
Oh, right.

176
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,400
Your project proposal wasn't so bad.

177
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,240
Really?

178
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,600
I'd be a perfect director
for a variety show.

179
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,920
Slow down. I only liked one of them.

180
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,480
Everything else was garbage.

181
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,360
We'll begin our planning meeting
after lunch.

182
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,000
Keep your rendezvous
with your gorgeous friend short.

183
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,640
Yes, sir.

184
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,840
He has such a sharp tongue.

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,760
How can he call them garbage?

186
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,720
He's always like that. A huge jerk.

187
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,000
Spread the word, will you?

188
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,320
My gosh, he startled me.

189
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,160
I hope I didn't bother you
during your busy day.

190
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,640
No, it's fine.

191
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,680
We needed this talk anyways.

192
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,360
Let's get something to drink.
What do you want?

193
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,360
Anything full of ice.

194
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,560
Okay.

195
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,880
-I'm sorry.
-Hey...

196
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,640
Sorry for what?

197
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,120
For beating

198
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,160
-your husband up.
-He deserved it.

199
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What happened to you two?

200
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,520
How did you two end up getting married?

201
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,200
I got pregnant.

202
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,160
It's old-fashioned and tacky,
but that's the reason.

203
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,280
On the day of my graduation,

204
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,920
Byung-sim took a leave.

205
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,520
We got wasted and...

206
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,320
I'm surprised. It's so unlike you.

207
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,960
I can't believe you made such a mistake.

208
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,520
It wasn't a mistake.

209
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,120
I...

210
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,240
I liked Byung-sim.

211
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,800
I liked him

212
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,720
before you started dating him.

213
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,240
Ever since we attended
the test prep center together.

214
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,920
Did I surprise you?

215
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,440
What did you like about him?

216
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,560
Why did you date him then?

217
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,160
He was good looking, quirky,

218
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,840
and you feel like
you should look after him.

219
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,680
That's what he was like.

220
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,120
He was.

221
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,160
He's a guy you'd date out of curiosity

222
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,640
before realizing what you want from a man.

223
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,360
He's quite an oddball.

224
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,000
You're right.

225
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
It'd be impossible for a sane woman

226
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,280
to love a man like him

227
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,920
for such a long time.

228
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
You still love Byung-sim,

229
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,080
don't you?

230
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,320
He doesn't love me though.

231
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,000
We never adored each other.

232
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,360
So how can I abandon him?

233
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,840
I can only end when there's a start.

234
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,600
(To all the people who are in love,)

235
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,960
(I'd like to ask when the start
of your love was.)

236
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,000
(But there isn't an exact start
to your love.)

237
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,600
(It comes at you so randomly)

238
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
(that you don't even realize
you're in love.)

239
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,640
(Then it tortures you.)

240
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,360
But I think

241
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,680
it's time that I ended this.

242
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,400
It's because of me.

243
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,880
It's not like that.

244
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,480
I knew you'd think that way.

245
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,320
That's why I wanted to see you first.

246
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,320
You said you still like him.

247
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,120
Can you end this?

248
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,200
I needed a reason to end this.

249
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,360
I hated myself for acting like this.

250
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,280
Can you live on with affections for a guy

251
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,720
who doesn't love you back?

252
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,640
Thankfully,

253
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,160
I still have my pride.

254
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,720
(And the end of love)

255
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,840
(is unclear too.)

256
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,760
(It's not over even if it's over.)

257
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,920
(It's not over even when it's over.
That's why we call love a fate.)

258
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,800
Hello?

259
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,480
(Maju Police Station)

260
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,240
What happened?

261
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,839
Your car exploded?

262
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,079
I got lucky.

263
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,040
If I was ten seconds late...

264
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,520
I got away because
I kept my engine running.

265
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,320
The one trying to kill Professor Hwang

266
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,920
isn't Nikolai.

267
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,800
There's no reason for him

268
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,400
to kill you too.

269
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,880
If you were the target,

270
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,760
there's no reason to make it
look like a car accident again.

271
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,920
It seems like

272
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,640
this person is trying to put
the blame on Nikolai.

273
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
Lee Seok-du can't come back alive.

274
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,760
Everything will be over then.

275
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,400
I'll never make another mistake.

276
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,400
The money I gave you costed your life.

277
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,080
Promise me that
you'd be taking away your own life

278
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,200
if anything goes wrong.

279
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,640
I understand.

280
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,400
(Professor Jo's car blew up.)

281
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,720
(I'll tell you the details when I'm back.)

282
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,120
(Professor Jo is fine.)

283
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,520
How could this happen?

284
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
Hello?

285
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,480
Hello. This is Hanguk University
Professors' Association calling.

286
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,440
Are you Mi-ran from
Chinese Literature, enrolled in 1996?

287
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,480
-Yes.
-You assaulted

288
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,200
Professor Hwang Byung-sim
on campus in broad daylight.

289
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,200
We need you to come in

290
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,960
so we can figure out what happened.

291
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,840
We finished this conversation
at the police station.

292
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,080
You might be done with the police,

293
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,960
but the Professors' Association

294
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,200
can't overlook this as an incident.

295
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,600
We ask for your cooperation.

296
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,000
-I'm busy.
-We're busy too.

297
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,560
A student assaulted a professor.

298
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,120
This is a serious infringement.

299
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,200
We cannot go over it irresolutely.

300
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,560
I was tailed because
they think Professor Hwang is alive.

301
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,080
They're tracking down the witness
of murder from 1984

302
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,160
and trying to get rid of him in 2019?

303
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,520
Let's say that's true.

304
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,360
Why are they trying to kill Jo Gi-bum?

305
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,960
There are no links.

306
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,880
Yes, that's it.

307
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,200
Hello, Professor Jo.

308
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,800
About the four capsules in the lab

309
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,600
and the cryogenics in the capsules.

310
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Do you happened to

311
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,240
have the documents on them?

312
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,400
No. Professor Hwang
has all the information.

313
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,480
Did our source from

314
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,120
the National Police Agency say anything?

315
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,560
Director Ma contacted a private detective

316
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,560
to hire a personal bodyguard.

317
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,800
Who are they protecting?

318
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,600
It's a top-secret project,

319
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,880
Only a man named Baek Young-tak
at Mapo Police Station knows.

320
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,720
He happens to be
Director Ma's ex-brother-in-law.

321
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,200
Here's some tangerine tea.

322
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,760
Chief Son, you should wait outside.

323
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,000
This reminds me

324
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,920
of when I used to work under you.

325
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,840
I'm feeling sentimental.

326
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,720
It's no time for that.

327
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,840
Ma Dong-chan gave us a new card to play.

328
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,920
A president who's been thinking

329
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,680
about developing science and technology
of this country since 20 years ago.

330

to become the president.

I came here to give you this.

The shadow
of Suyangsan Mountain is 30km long.

337
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,080
I'll become Suyangsan Mountain.

338
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,040
Follow my lead.

for the assault.)

What is it this time?

345
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,280
I should take a picture with him.

346
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,560
He's the starting point
of my political career.

347
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,440
He'll play as my stepping stone.

348
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,960
It looks like you're gaining
a lot from Dong-chan.

349
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,480
-What?
-You were just a chief

350
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,680
of Variety Department, not the News Bureau

351
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,520
and yet you became a president
all thanks to Dong-chan.

352
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,080
Covering up Dong-chan's case
gave you that position.

353

Why are you bringing that up now?

354
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,640
You're talking back at me these days.

-Are you copying Dong-chan?
-What?

356
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,840
Dong-chan, I'm glad you're here.

Let's take a picture with me.

I realized that I don't have
any pictures with you.

I've to tell you something.

360

Dong-chan, smile big.

-This is important.

-Okay.
-There was a car accident.

Hurry up and take it.

You should smile, Dong-chan.

on the 19th at around 2pm?

Now we'll ask Professor Hwang Dong-hyuk.

As the victim of the disturbance
that happened on the 19th at 2pm,

376
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,160
do you admit that
the assault was justifiable?

377
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,520
Yes.

378
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,480
I deserved it. I more than deserved it.

Ever since 1995

385
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,400
when we attended
the same test prep center,

386

we promised a future together.

387
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,440
But our fate split us apart

388
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,360
and I ended up starting
an unwanted marriage.

389
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,840
This is passionate love.

390

"what does a woman want?",

394

to what my first love wants.

397
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,480
Just like Freud!

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,680
What?

402
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,480
You better not hurt Young-sun.

You have no idea, do you?

404
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,400
She never gets hurt by me.

405
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,200
I'm the one who gets hurt.

406

As you already know,
I may look muscular and manly

407

and clothes that you asked for.

Okay. Good work.

Hey.

Did my ex-wife get mad at you
or throw things at you?

415
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,960
She never hands it over so easily.

416
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,160
She told me to pack it myself.

417
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,360
Ex-wife? Did you get a divorce already?

418
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,080
I will soon.

419
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,080
If you're not legally divorced,
you shouldn't call her that.

420
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,160
I want to get used to calling her that.

421
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,320
Once I get divorced,
I'll be pessimistic about my situation.

422
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,560
Calling her my ex-wife
would be difficult then.

423
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,760
This is human psychology.

424
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,320
It's sort of a way to manage my mentality.

425
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,000
You didn't pack my blue striped underwear.

Darn. That's my favorite underwear.

He has no reason to kill Professor Jo.

There's another suspect.
I'm looking into it right now.

But before that,

get our broadcast station's cooperation.

I haven't finished reading it

because of my busy schedule.

I didn't know Young-jun had a girlfriend.

Not yet. They're just in the grey area.

-Grey area?
-Yes.

477
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,040
It's not official yet.
They just have a thing.

He met her at a school club.

Are people in the grey area

before they start dating?

482
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,640
Don't you know what that means?

483
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,680
No, I've never heard of it before.

484
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,240
Are you from outer space or something?

485

How do you not know this?

00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,960
Well, the thing is...

No wonder.

00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,400
Anyway, what does it mean?

492
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,240
It's when you like someone,

493
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,680
but you're not sure
if that person likes you back.

494
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,600
It's when they're acting vague,

495
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,160
but something is still going on.

496
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,600
You know what I mean, right?

497
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,800
Yes, I get it. When you're unsure of it?

498
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,080
Yes, that's right.

499
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,520
That's called the grey area.

500
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,400
Oh, I see.

501
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,080
You've been in
a relationship before, right?

502
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,920
Were you ever in the grey area?

503
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,760
Yes, I guess.

504
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,360
But the guy I dated

505
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,280
was a real jerk.

506
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,000
He got married to my friend

507
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,840
and they also have a kid.

508
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,120
Let's just call him a psycho.

509
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Hello?

510
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,600
Are you still at school?

511
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,240
I was just about to leave.

512
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,920
The planning meeting is
on hold for two hours.

513
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,400
I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

514
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,920
I'll be off now.

515
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,040
I'll read your assignment
as well as Young-jun's by tonight.

516
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,480
-Okay, Mi-ran.
-Enjoy your lunch.

517
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,880
Aren't you going to eat?

518
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,920
No, I need to get going.

519
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,760
I'll find out about the internship
by the end of the month.

520
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,880
I hope I get to work with you
at the broadcast station.

521
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,360
Me too. I'll be off now.

522
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,280
I told you not to run.

523
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,720
You told me to be quick.

524
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,440
You should schedule your time wisely

525
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,000
so that you don't have to run.

526
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,400
Your temperature will rise.

527
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,400
You're obsessed with my temperature.

528
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,760
I'll be fine.

529
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,400
Be quiet and don't run.

530
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,760
-Did you eat?
-No, not yet.

531
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,520
Why haven't you eaten yet?

532
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,160
Well...

533
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,400
It's okay. I don't need to eat.

534
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,960
Who says it's okay?

535
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,640
-Starving will raise your temperature.
-Why would it rise?

536
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,280
You get angry when you're hungry.

537
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,680
Let's go. I'll keep you company.

538
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,000
Did they forgive you for the assault?

539
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,280
I don't want to talk about it.

540
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,120
By the way, what happened

541
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,040
with Professor Jo's car explosion?

542
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,480
Let's talk about that later.

543
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,840
We can't talk about it here.

544
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
Okay.

545
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,560
You were about to chew on your hair.

546
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,360
Director Ma.

547
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
Yes?

548
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,120
Were you ever in the grey area?

549
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,480
What's that?

550
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,040
Don't you know what that is?

551
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,280
What is it?

552
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,320
I have no idea what you're talking about.

553
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,199
Gosh, you're so old.

554
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,719
You should catch up with the trend.

555
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,040
You're clueless about a lot of things.

556
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,960
What about you? Have you been there?

557
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,040
Tell me. Let's go there together.

558
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,920
You're supposed to be in it
with the person you like

559
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,239
before you start dating.

560
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,159
Sit down.

561
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
(Turn back the time)

562
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,199
I came up with this idea based on
Mi-ran's project proposal.

563
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,440
We're going to go back in time.

564
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,920
As you can see,

565
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,240
Ellen Langer,
a psychology professor at Harvard,

566
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,040
ran a study that made
old people feel young again.

567
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,040
But how is that even possible?

568
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,600
Will you please listen?

569
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,640
She gathered seniors in their 70s

570
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,800
and recreated the world from 20 years ago.

571
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,640
She exposed them to the songs, news,

572
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,320
and movies from the old days.

573
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,840
They were told to reenact
their past lives.

574
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,840
Eventually, their physicality returned

575
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,880
to how it used to be 20 years ago.

576
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,200
Mi-ran suggested that
we gather 27-year-olds

577
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,640
and carry out a similar study.

578
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,360
But it's so unnatural to watch
grown-ups act like infants.

579
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,040
So we're going to gather adults

580
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,880
of older age and take them back.

581
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,840
People in their 40s go back to their 20s.

582
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,520
They'll get to relive their 20s.

583
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,240
The idea is pretty great.

584
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
But wouldn't the show be too tacky

585
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
considering that it's set to 20 years ago?

586
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,880
That's the essence of this project.

587
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,120
Our job is to make people

588
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,680
feel intrigued about the past.

589
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,800
Retro can become the new trend.

590
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,680
People in their 40s
who are exhausted with life

591
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,080
can go back to their 20s

592
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
and overcome the biological aging process.

593
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,160
Every generation
will be able to relate to our show.

594
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,480
We'll deliver a message

595
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,840
saying that we decide
the age of our minds.

596
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,120
Not only will it be a fun variety show,

597
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,920
but it'll have a sincere message too.

598
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,240
We'll have both of them.

599
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,800
How is "Reply 1999" for the title?

600
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,560
That's the hit drama from a cable channel.

601
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,800
The "Reply" series.

602
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,080
Yes, I know.

603
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,040
How about

604
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,320
"Go Go 99"?

605
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
It implies "Let's go back to 1999."

606
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,680
It has a nice rhyme.

607
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,360
That sounds incredible.

608
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,640
Let's go with that.

609
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,880
Great job. I love that title, Mi-ran.

610
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,880
We're not only focusing on the 40s.

611
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,400
We're also going to have college students.

612
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,280
It'll be nice to have celebrities
take part too.

613
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,920
Yes, that's a good idea.

614
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,000
I already looked into few sites.

615
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,760
Mi-ran, I want you to come with me

616
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,000
to check the sites.

617
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,000
Okay.

618
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,320
I want to go with him as well.

619
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,760
Director Park, look into advertisements.

620
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,320
But I'm working on a new program

621
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,840
that's going to air
in the second half of this year.

622
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,800
I read your project proposal and

623
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,640
I guarantee that it'll be a fail.

624
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,240
You can't buy self-realization
with the company's money.

625
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,800
Think of something else
and help me while you're at it.

626
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,200
Who knows?
A cable channel might reach out to you.

627
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,640
You're not maintaining
that lousy work ethic of yours, right?

628
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,240
Chief Son, draw up the budget.

629
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,920
It's a pilot, so it'll be easy.

630
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,960
Me?

631
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,320
Why?

632
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
But I'm a chief.

633
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,120
When your life is boring and futile

634
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,880
because you have no achievements,

635
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,480
have some enthusiasm about work.

636
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,520
Of course, I'm too young to know anything.

637
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,840
But it's just my opinion.

638
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,640
He's holding a grudge
over what I said when I got drunk.

639
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,440
Let's work hard to make this a success.

640
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,600
TBO variety shows are going to change

641
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,320
now that I'm back.

642
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,560
(Pictures of the car explosion)

643
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,600
The car of Professor Jo, who participated

644
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,440
in the cryonics project, has exploded.

645
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,520
No, I'll mention the details
of the accident

646
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,520
so state them accurately in the article.

647
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,360
Mr. Park, visit the site.

648
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,120
The police cleaned up the site.

649
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,760
You still have to go.
The criminal has to feel pressured.

650
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Yes.

651
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,240
Dong-chan.

652
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,040
Am I still in love with you?

653
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
Or

654
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,480
have I fallen in

655
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,280
another love?

656
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,720
Call the police!

657
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,280
-You jerk!
-What's with you?

658
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,480
-I'll get you.
-Dong-ju.

659
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,480
The officer is here.

660
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,040
What's wrong? Calm down, will you?

661
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,040
This man pays the alimony
every single month.

662
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,440
You said you'll pay
when you sell the building.

663
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,280
Why aren't you paying me, you fraud!

664
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,120
It got auctioned off.

665
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,000
How much is the alimony?

666
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,080
He agreed on 20,000 dollars in court

667
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,520
and didn't share any properties in return.

668
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,880
Why aren't you paying back the money
you took from my family? Why?

669
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,720
I have to start our business.
You have to stop.

670
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,080
Why are you holding a bottle in your hand?

671
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,320
Hello, Uncle One.

672
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,520
Hello, Uncle Two.

673
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,240
Is your father at the academy?

674
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,840
No, he wasn't there.

675
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,640
His academy is about to go under.

676
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,440
Why is he away all the time?

677
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,120
My brother is back

678
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,600
so I can't sit around here any longer.

679
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,400
Give me my money.

680
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,920
Whatever. I don't have any.

681
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,840
-Okay. I'll kill you!
-Goodness, stop.

682
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,040
Stop! You didn't do anything great either.

683
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,960
How did you live with a woman like her?

684
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,160
-What?
-Stop!

685
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,560
(A passionate love that boiled at 100℃)

686
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,440
(can always drop down to minus 10℃.)

687
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,400
(And you must pay the price
when your love ends.)

688
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,280
(It either hurts, makes you sad,)

689
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,840
(or costs a lot of money.)

690
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,440
I hope my brother gets to live peacefully

691
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,040
in this world full of anger.

692
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,600
I hope my daughter

693
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,520
grows up to become a beautiful person.

694
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,760
I hope my sister

695
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,920
overcomes alcoholism.

696
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,840
And my mom,

697
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,520
my dad, and my wife.

698
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,800
The piano academy that I'm trying to sell.

699
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,560
I trust that you will remember
everything I've just said.

700
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
Goodbye.

701
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,680
♫ The Lord abides with me ♫

702
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,000
Let us pray together.

703
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,640
-Lord! -Lord!

704
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,360
-Lord! -Lord!

705
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,560
-Lord! -Lord!

706
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,400
-Lord! -Lord!

707
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,440
Please have mercy and love for Kyung-ja,

708
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,280
who lives in vanity and extravagance.

709
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
Please.

710
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,160
And this poor girl's husband

711
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,560
has been out of his mind for ten years.

712
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,280
Please have mercy and
let him come to his senses.

713
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,240
(A couple's love is coming to an end.)

714
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,920
(But they each cool down to
different temperatures.)

715
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,200
(One of them is still burning hot.)

716
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,360
(The other one is as cold as ice.)

717
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
(That is)

718
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,200
(the problem with love.)

719
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,640
(Only Church)

720
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,880
What's wrong?

721
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,680
(Send over my suits and
striped underwear in every color)

722
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,600
(to the studio that I'm staying at.)

723
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,920
(I'll send you the address.)

724
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,040
(Pay the delivery fee upfront.
I have no cash.)

725
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,680
Darn it.

726
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,240
Let's go.

727
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,560
We're going to look at
two places on the list.

728
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,760
Gyeonggi Province
or the outskirts of Seoul.

729
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,920
Okay.

730
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,440
All right. We'll have team dinner tonight.

731
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,280
-All right!
-Yes!

732
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,520
Hey.

733
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
Come here.

734
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
Come.

735
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,000
Make sure you don't drink tonight.

736
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,520
If you make another mistake,
I'll get you for last time too.

737
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,640
Your drunk habits are
the same since 20 years ago.

738
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,640
You get completely wasted.

739
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,920
You can't go home first.

740
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,800
-Seriously.
-You sound so confident.

741
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,840
-No, I'm serious.
-Okay, I'll take it slow.

742
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,520
-You can't leave.
-Okay.

743
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,160
-You need to eat too.
-Fine.

744
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,120
-We're getting barbecue.
-Have some food.

745
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,680
-Hello.
-Hello.

746
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,880
(Korean Style Restaurant Jinsagalbi)

747
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,640
-All right! -Let's go!

748
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,680
You're good.

749
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,440
-Give it to everyone. -You're good.

750
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
Hey.

751
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,480
Right.

752
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,800
You need to drink to
become a variety show director.

753
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,200
Hey, intern. Have a drink.

754
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,200
She can't drink.

755
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,000
What?

756
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,760
She has a fatty liver syndrome
at such a young age.

757
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,640
Isn't that sad?

758
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,320
And you have palsy too. Yes, palsy.

759
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,760
Are you ill?

760
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,800
-Already?
-I know right.

761
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Goodness.

762
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,440
-All right! -Cheers!

763
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,200
Let's have some more.

764
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,960
-Drink up. -I shouldn't drink so much.

765
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,000
-What if you get drunk again? -Stop it.

766
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,800
I want some more too.

767
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,320
-Order another one. -That was good.

768
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,560
-Excuse me. -Your face is red.

769
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,160
Who should I ask?

770
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,960
-That lady. -Cold noodles and water.

771
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,840
-Cheers.
-Okay, cheers.

772
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,440
-Pour me another one. -Okay, fine.

773
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,200
-Again? -Yes, right here.

774
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,280
Eat up.

775
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,600
It's so good.

776
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,720
Eat up.

777
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,520
It's all-you-can-eat,
so eat as much as you want.

778
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,280
-Who did this to my beer? -Oh, okay.

779
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,400
Goodness.

780
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,960
Cheers.

781
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,160
Ma Dong-chan is back.

782
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,760
Come on, let's go!

783
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,960
All right, let's go party!

784
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,120
Free!

785
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,520
♫ Though that person sees me ♫

786
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,520
♫ I don’t know that person ♫

787
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,920
♫ Though my fluttering heart ♫

788
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,760
♫ May ache ♫

789
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,200
♫ I don’t know you anymore ♫

790
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,440
♫ When I just pass by the face ♫

791
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,840
♫ I wanted to see so much ♫

792
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,800
♫ In your ♫

793
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,880
♫ Dejected figure ♫

794
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,320
10 minutes until the news. Get ready.

795
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,240
♫ I have no regrets now ♫

796
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,360
♫ Though you know me ♫

797
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,680
♫ I do not remember you anymore ♫

798
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,040
♫ Even if I choke up ♫

799
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,560
♫ And tears flow ♫

800
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:27,120
♫ When love passes ♫

801
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,600
That's why you should be extra careful.

802
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,040
Who do you think is the culprit?

803
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,440
Someone who wants Professor Hwang dead.

804
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,560
This time, it was someone

805
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,080
who wanted Professor Jo dead.

806
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,680
They're the same person.

807
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,800
Who on earth could it be?

808
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,240
I don't know.

809
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,360
Of course.

810
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,920
Don't bother thinking about it.

811
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,920
I was just about to think of something.

812
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,280
Don't. Forget it.

813
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,960
-If you think too much...
-My temperature will go up?

814
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,560
You know it.

815
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,640
Make sure you pack
your fever-reducer shot tomorrow.

816
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,320
-All right.
-Good.

817
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,320
Gosh. My goodness.

818
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,800
He scared me.

819
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,680
That's my little brother.

820
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,760
I see. Your brother?

821
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,840
Hello.

822
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,520
Nam-tae, say hello.

823
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,640
He works at the broadcast station...

824
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,000
It's the cryogenic man. Cryogenic man.

825
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,640
You're so smart, Nam-tae.

826
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,680
Yes, that's him.

827
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,360
You saw him on the news, right?

828
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,440
He works at the station with me.

829
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,640
Say hello.

830
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,600
Hello, Mr. Crygenic Man.

831
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,120
Yes. Hello.

832
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,240
I'll get going.

833
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,520
Okay.

834
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,600
-Bye.
-Bye.

835
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,440
Let's go, Nam-tae.

836
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,000
Do you think

837
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,560
it can be fixed?

838
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,760
She was willing to participate

839
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,960
in the experiment
because of her sick brother.

840
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,320
In the grey area.

841
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,320
(In the grey area)

842
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,320
Why are you still up and eating snacks?

843
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,880
I got a 7 out of 10 on
my spelling test today.

844
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,080
Good job. Aim for a 10 out of 10 now.

845
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,160
It's okay.
Spelling tests aren't important.

846
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,880
Then what's important to you?

847
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,040
I'll just be happier than
the kid who gets a 10 out of 10.

848
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,040
How's work? Is it manageable?

849
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,040
Yes. It's not bad.

850
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,720
Anything keeping you up at night?

851
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,880
Not yet.

852
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,720
Is there anything I can help you with?

853
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,200
Can you explain

854
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,880
what "in the grey area" means?

855
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,520
Sure thing.

856
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,800
What is it?

857
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,640
Did you know that Snow White

858
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,600
was in the grey area
with the seven dwarfs?

859
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,920
What? This is a problem.

860
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,360
Why would Snow White have a thing
with the dwarfs?

861
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,280
She was probably in
the grey area with the prince.

862
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,640
No, she was in the grey area
with the dwarfs.

863
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,360
Is it good?

864
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,160
-Seo-yoon.
-Can I have the rest?

865
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,320
Go to bed now.

866
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,800
Brush your teeth first.

867
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,960
You need to stop eating those.

868
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,320
I can't.

869
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,560
Did you hurt your leg?

870
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,760
Dong-chan.

871
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,800
I have bad joints.

872
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,400
They're creaky these days.

873
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,400
Since when? You need to get it fixed.

874
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,520
Did you see a doctor?

875
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,920
Is it calcium deficiency or arthritis?

876
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,040
I went to a temple to pray today

877
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,840
and my knees just gave out.

878
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,320
It's not a big deal.

879
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,800
I bet it's just menopause.

880
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,760
My little brother.

881
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,360
When did you get so old?

882
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,040
There, there.

883
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,240
Dong-chan.

884
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,560
Dong-chan.

885
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,280
You favor him too much.
You should look after me too.

886
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,040
I'm sick too.

887
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,800
Come here. Where does it hurt?

888
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,960
My heart aches.

889
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,800
The world is so mean to me.

890
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,560
Come here, my little ones.

891
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,200
It's okay.

892
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,840
(Love doesn't just exist
between men and women.)

893
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,320
-(There's familial love.) -Don't cry.

894
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,560
(For an egg to hatch,)

895
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,920
(the temperature needs to be 36℃.)

896
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,800
(This warmth alone allows love.)

897
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,080
(That's what love is within a family.)

898
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,640
Are we at the right place?

899
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,200
Yes.

900
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,720
Follow me.

901
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,800
Hey.

902
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,480
She's so careless.

903
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,800
She didn't even take her bag.

904
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,440
Hey, Mi-ran.

905
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,000
I think it's this way.

906
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,800
There's a good spot 800m ahead.

907
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,440
Okay, let's check it out.

908
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,520
This is a good spot too.
You should make a note of it.

909
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,960
Okay.

910
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,680
Should we go over there too?

911
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,920
There might be some good camping spots.

912
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,240
Okay, let's go.

913
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,080
It looks like

914
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,440
people don't travel this way.

915
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,680
There is no path.

916
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,240
Doesn't that make it better?

917
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,800
We could cut the grass, then set a tent.

918
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,280
Let's go in further.

919
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,960
Hey, stop.

920
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,120
Don't you ever get scared?

921
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,360
Hey, wait for me.

922
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,520
Let's leave. It's too hot.

923
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,800
It is, isn't it?

924
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,360
Let's leave.

925
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,360
I don't think this is the way.

926
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,320
Mi-ran, wait right beside this tree.

927
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,040
I'll come back after I find the way out.

928
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,720
Here.

929
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,400
Did you bring the fever-reducer shot?

930
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,000
Of course.

931
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,200
Director Ma, can't I just come with you?

932
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,960
I'm fine.

933
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,040
Okay. Let's go together.

934
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,800
Hey, Mi-ran. Are you okay?

935
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,080
Hang in there. Can you do it?

936
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,160
-Yes.
-Okay.

937
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,400
Let's go.

938
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,040
This isn't working. Let's take the shot.

939
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,440
I forgot to bring it.

940
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,960
Mi-ran.

941
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,600
Mi-ran.

942
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,600
Mi-ran, wake up. Mi-ran.

943
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,040
Mi-ran.

944
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,360
No...

945
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,920
Director Ma.

946
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,680
Director Ma.

947
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,760
Director Ma, wake up.

948
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,440
My gosh.

949
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,840
Director Ma! Director Ma!

950
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,440
Director Ma! Gosh, what do I do?

951
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,760
Director Ma!

952
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,680
Wake up, Director Ma!

953
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,760
Director Ma, are you okay?

954
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,320
Director Ma!

955
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,040
(The temperature limit
of my love is 31.5°C.)

956
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,800
(It's not allowed to rise
higher than that.)

957
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,920
(I wonder if I'll ever be able to
kiss anyone before I die.)

958
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,600
(I should at least kiss someone
before I die.)

959
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,640
(I should make the best of my life.)

960
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,640
(Melting Me Softly)

961
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,200
Dong Chan and that woman
went by themselves?

962
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,240
Sorry.
You're so small-minded, Director Ma.

963
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,480
I'll wait for my punishment. Try me.

964
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,080
Was that her first kiss? Gosh, no way.

965
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,000
Don't ever boast about it to anyone.

966
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,840
Why? Did he like it?

967
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,080
You are out of your mind.

968
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,280
Why do you want her on your team
when you guys fight all the time?

969
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,960
He looks so similar.
His height and physique.

970
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,320
He asked me if he could meet you.

971
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,040
What if it wasn't me in that situation?

972
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,960
would you still have kissed that person?
