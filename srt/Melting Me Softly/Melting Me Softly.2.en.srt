Let me know if you find
anything peculiar, okay?

(Police)

Over there.

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,520
Dong-chan. Where's Dong-chan?

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,920
You were with him until the end.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,800
I don't know, ma'am. I really don't know.

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,720
-Ma'am, please calm down.
-My son!

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,360
Find my son!

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,560
-Mom!
-Mom!

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,720
-Mom, wake up!
-Mom!

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,160
-Mom, wake up!
-My gosh!

-Honey!
-Mom!

00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,360
(Are you kidding me?)

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,120
You'd better keep it together.

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,960
If people find out about
the cryonics experiment,

25
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,560
we won't just get fired.

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,120
We'll get ostracized.
And it won't be pretty.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,560
We'll practically get buried alive.

28
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,240
My gosh!

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,240
-Hyun-gi!
-Yes?

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,120
Are these all the footage?

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,400
Yes.

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,640
I want you to do as I say.

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,400
I'll handle everything else.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What do you plan to do?

35
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,720
You didn't meet Dong-chan that day.

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,960
You were editing at the office.

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,720
-But sir!
-Hey!

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,480
I clearly saw you
editing videos all night.

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,600
But...

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,280
Dong-chan planned and proceeded
with this project all by himself.

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,800
That's how this happened.

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,560
But that makes no sense!

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,800
This is a broadcasting station!

44
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,520
We make things up for a living.

45
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,400
But sir, we already submitted
a budget proposal

46
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,160
regarding how much
the subjects will get paid...

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,200
Listen to me!
Dong-chan did that on his own.

48
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,120
Do you understand?

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,400
Who else in the broadcasting station

50
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,760
knows about this project other than you?

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,040
Me, the floor director Jin, and...

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Ha-young.

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,160
I can tell Jin to keep his mouth shut.

54
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,520
But the problem is Ha-young.

55
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,600
Ha-young. Ha-young.

56
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,120
Hey.

57
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,280
Isn't her mother hospitalized right now?

58
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,079
(Emergency Medical Center)

59
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,320
What happened?

60
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,560
Where's Dong-chan?

61
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,800
Everything regarding
the project disappeared.

62
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,200
Professor Hwang died.

63
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,280
On top of that,
his assistant also went missing.

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,240
Let me go check. Where's the laboratory?

65
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,760
-There's no point in going.
-I'll find him.

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,000
We need to bury this case.
Otherwise, we'll get in trouble.

67
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,800
I got orders from the CEO.

68
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
This isn't just about us.

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
And there's nothing we can do.

70
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,800
The main anchor for the nine o'clock news

71
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,320
will get replaced.

73
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,160
Hello, you're watching
the nine o'clock news,

74

and I'm Na Ha-young.

75
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,840
Here's our first news.

76
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,120
President Kim Dae Jung made a speech
for the citizens of our country

77
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,000
100 days prior to welcoming
the new millennium.

78
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,760
Let's hear about it from Reporter Kim.

79
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,680
This is nonsense. How did she
become the main anchor?

80
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,720
It's what the CEO wants.

81
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,920
Her boyfriend went missing,

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,560
but she looks totally fine.

83
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,120
She's so cold-hearted.

84
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,920
What?

85
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
What?

86
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,880

to constantly challenge ourselves.)

Let's move onto the next news.

92
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,840
Director Ma Dong-chan

93
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,680
has been missing for 50 days.

94
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,320
There are no clues or traces
regarding the incident,

95
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,920
so the police are having
a hard time investigating.

("TBO's Director Ma Dong-chan,
Disappeared for 50 Days")

Through "Infinite Experiment Paradise",

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,520
he was awarded the Best Program Award.

99
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,680
He was also awarded
the Variety Show Producer Award.

100

101
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,760
(a new renaissance to variety shows)

102
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,720
(and has changed many paradigms
in the industry.)

103
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,680
(During an awards ceremony overseas,
he proudly received)

104
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,000
(-the Grand Award.)
-It's Mi-ran.

105

at the sudden disappearance)

(Many people who are waiting
for him are in despair.)

111
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,960
Hey, give me your money.

112
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,360
-Do you want to get beaten up?
-I don't have any money.

113
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,280
You scumbag. Give me your money.

114
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,080
It's ticklish!

115

It's ticklish!

116
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,840
Hey, did you just smile?

117
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,560
-Is this funny?
-Stop!

118
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,600
Mi-ran.

119
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,840
Mi-ran.

120
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,800
So you're the ones who have been
bullying my brother.

121
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,600
So what? What will you do about it?

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,880
You punk, do you want to die?

123
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,440
It hurts! Let me go!

124
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,120
It hurts!

125
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,480
I work for "Infinite Experiment Paradise"

126
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,680
as one of the experiment girls.

127
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,840
I'm just coming home from work.

128
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,159
Do you know what this is?

129
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,000
If you spray this substance
on your hair, it will melt it.

130
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,800
I forgot to return this, you see.

131
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,280
What do you say?
Shall I spray it on your hair?

132
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,120
Mi-ran. Mi-ran.

133
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,320
Are you injured anywhere else?

134
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,680
Are you not hurt?

135
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,800
No. I'm fine.

136
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,200
By the way,
when did you grow up this much?

137
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,760
Soon, you'll become bigger than me.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,120
If you don't want me to,
then I'll stop growing.

139
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,960
I don't need to grow up anymore.

140
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,560
Don't be ridiculous. You must
hurry and grow up a lot.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,800
Mi-ran, does that spray
really melt your hair?

142
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,800
No, it doesn't.

143
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,640
Guys like them need to be frightened.

144
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,960
They had no idea that you fooled them.

145
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,680
You fooled them, right?

146
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,920
-Nam-tae.
-Yes?

147
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,360
Don't forget that
I'll always be by your side.

148
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,400
Okay. Hey, have this.

149
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,720
No, thanks.

150
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Since you love bread,

151
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,360
you should become a baker.

152
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,600
I love bread. Bread!

153
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,840
Will you bake bread for me?

154
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,720
-Yes.
-Promise?

155
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,920
I promise.

156
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,320
(Mi-ran.)

157
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,160
Mi-ran.

158
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,200
Mi-ran.

159
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,280
Mi-ran.

160
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,280
Mi-ran.

161
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,640
Nam-tae.

162
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,159
If someone bullies you again

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,880
or if anything happens,

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,560
blow this whistle, okay?

165
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,080
Then I'll come running.

166
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,960

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,560
(Live Today)

168
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,880
Ms. Na.

169
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,360
It's nice to meet you.

170
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,960
I'm Ma Dong-chan from the Variety Team.

171
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,320
Hello. My name is Na Ha-young.

172
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,240
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
I just came back from doing
fieldwork, so I'm a bit dirty.

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
We're shooting a farming special.

175
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,760
I see.

176
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,920
Thank you for being
our show's commentator.

177
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,200
("'What would you bring
to a desolated island?'")

178
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,320
("When you're asked such a question,")

179
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,200
("you can't help but feel happy
while pondering.")

180
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,520
("Or is it just me?")

181
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,760
("So at 'Infinite Experiment Paradise',")

182
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,080
("we came prepared")

183
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,600
("and decided to...")

184
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,800
Ms. Na.

185
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,280
Don't read it as if you're reading
the news.

186
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,840
For this part,
could you lively raise your tone?

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,720
Make the viewers think

188
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,960
that you're also curious about the result.

189
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,320
"Is that so?"

190
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,640
Like...

191
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,200
Excuse me. Ms. Na?

192
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Yes?

193
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,520
Did you hear what I just said?

194
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,840
-Oh, yes.
-Okay.

195
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,440
For this part,

196
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,600
try to provoke their curiosity even more.

197
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,000
Try saying it like this.

198
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Excuse me. I'm here.

199
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,600
What are you doing this evening?

200
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,200
(Hey, there's nothing here.)

201
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,960
(The last call he had
was with Professor Hwang.)

202
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,160
(So I came to the laboratory,
but it's empty.)

203
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,360
Are there no records of Prof. Hwang
being admitted to the hospital?

204
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,760
Dong-chan, where are you?

205
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,880
(Happy 59th birthday to Ma Pil-gu!)

206
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,760
♫ Birds are flying in ♫

207
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,760
♫ All kinds of birds are flying in ♫

208
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,840
♫ Mandarin ducks flying in pairs ♫

209
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,800
♫ Seagulls setting boats afloat ♫

210
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,320
She's not good enough
to be in an opera company.

211
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,080
She obviously got in through other means.

212
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,720
Lower your voice.

213
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,480
She used to be Dong-sik's schoolmate.

214
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,480
Dong-chan, you should go on a blind date.

215
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,000
You know Congressman Jung Hyun-sung,
don't you?

216
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,280
It's his second daughter.

217
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,160
She got her doctor's degree
from the States recently.

218
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,960
Do you want a doctor
as your daughter-in-law?

219
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,280
Genes are important.

220
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,440
It's usually the mother's brain
the kids take after.

221
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,760
You're smart because you take after me.

222
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,880
He takes after me, not you.

223
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,080
The only thing he takes after you
is his good looks.

224
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,120
He's smart because of me.

225
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,400
What are you saying?

226
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,640
Dong-chan is handsome and smart
because he takes after me.

227
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,680
That's not true.
He got good looks from you,

228
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,360
but he's smart thanks to me.

229
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,520
I told you, you're wrong.

230
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,000
Dong-chan got all of my good genes.

231
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,680
You know, I married you
just for your looks.

232
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,800
You might look perfect,
but you're not the smartest.

233
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,120
He's smart because of me.

234
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,640
I'm the smarter one.

235
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,240
I memorized "Thousand Character Classic"
when I turned 20.

236
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,680
That's not something to boast about!

237
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,120
Also, what does that book
have anything to do with your brain?

238
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,520
What characters come after sky and ground?

239
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,720
How on earth am I supposed
to remember that?

240
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,839
It's black and then yellow. Gosh.

241
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,920
You're far from being smart.
You have the brain of a bird.

242
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,920
Why are you two fighting
on such a nice day?

243
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,520
How can you call me a bird brain?

244
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Honey, you're acting vulgar.

245
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,160
It's better than calling you
a chicken brain.

246
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,800
Gosh. What do you mean, bird brain?

247
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,560
♫ If you go over to that mountain ♫

248
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,520
Why is it "Song of the Bird" of all songs?

249
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Here.

250
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,440
♫ Birds are flying in ♫

251
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,080
Anyway, you should marry a smart woman.

252
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,520
She's an announcer. She must be smart.

253
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,120
No, not her. She's not his level.

254
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,080
She grew up deprived.
I don't feel comfortable about her.

255
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,520
She must be stricken
with a victim mentality.

256
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,200
Her poverty shouldn't impact
how you define her.

257
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,160
This is no time to talk about marriage

258
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,720
because her mother is sick, but...

259
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,200
But what?

260
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,080
If I ever get married, it'll be with her.

261
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,240
What?

262
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,200
You should freeze to death.

263
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,760
Mom, you're too harsh.

264
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,320
What do you mean
he should freeze to death?

265
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,520
-You're acting vulgar.
-Gosh.

266
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,720
No one freezes to death these days.

267
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,480
We have our heaters on high.

268
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,720
(Happy 59th birthday to Ma Pil-gu!)

269
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,560
(Happy 59th birthday to Ma Pil-gu!)

270
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,440
He's too talented to stay in Korea.

271
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,480
Once his solo show ends,
I plan on sending him to New York.

272
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,720
So, what do you like so much
about that announcer lady?

273
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,200
She's pure and honest.

274
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Anyway, you're turning 33 next year.
You'll become an old bachelor.

275
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,160
You'll miss your prime age to get married.

276
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,680
Let's just keep her aside
while you go on the blind date.

277
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,160
Should we go on a cruise to Alaska
for Mother's birthday?

278
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,600
Alaska? That would be nice.

279
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,920
Before that, you should get married.

280
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,440
There's a project I'm working on.
It's really important.

281
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,000
When it's over, we should
talk seriously about my marriage.

282
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,960
Bravo. Bravo.

283
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,240
Bravo.

284
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,240
Bravo.

285
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,680
-Dong-sik!
-What's wrong?

286
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,120
Who does he take after?

287
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,720
He's nothing like me.

288
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,880
I got too engrossed in the music
that I got low blood pressure.

289
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,360
I'm okay. I'm okay. Okay, okay.

290
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,360
-Grab him, grab him.
-Gosh!

291
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,920
My goodness.

292
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Thank you. Okay. It's okay.

293
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,040
It's a boat!

294
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,800
Boat, boat, boat.

295
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,760
Do you want to go on a boat too?

296
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Yes.

297
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,320
When I earn a lot of money,
we can go on that boat. Okay?

298
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,600
Okay.

299
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,680
-Mi-ran, look. Over there.
-Yes?

300
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,480
-Look.
-Mom. Mom, hurry!

301
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,080
-It's a fish, it's a fish.
-I can't do this.

302
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,400
-It's a fish.
-Here.

303
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,120
Gosh. We definitely caught something.

304
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,560
See? I told you Nam-tae could do it.

305
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,640
By the looks of it, it's heavy as a whale.

306
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,120
A whale? I'm so excited.

307
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,320
I caught a whale!

308
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,280
I caught it!

309
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,720
It's a whale. You caught a whale, Nam-tae.

310
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,200
By the way, Mi-ran. That's not a whale.

311
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,200
-Ta-da.
-Yes!

312
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,920
-It's for you, Nam-tae.
-Let's eat.

313
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,760
-Blow on it before you eat.
-Okay.

314
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,160
-Is it good?
-Yes.

315
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,800
Gosh.

316
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,760
It's good, it's good.

317
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Om mani padme hum.

318
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,920
Om mani padme hum.

319
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,080
Om mani padme hum.

320
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,640
(At 4532 hours, 18 minutes,
and 23 seconds, Ko Mi-ran is alive.)

321
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,880
(At 4532 hours, 18 minutes,
and 23 seconds...)

322
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
Gosh, Mi-ran.

323
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
(Ko Mi-ran is alive.)

324
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,840
My daughter...

325
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,280
Gosh, Mi-ran.

326
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,560
(She's sleeping inside a cryonic capsule.)

327
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,480
(Please do not tell anyone about this.)

328
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,240
(Please do not tell anyone about this.)

329
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,000
(It could put Mi-ran in danger.)

330
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,080
(If you want her to wake up again...)

331
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,080
She's alive. She was alive.

332
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,880
She's alive.

333
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,640
(Congratulations to 2000's graduates
of Hanguk University)

334
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,240
-Gosh.
-Let's go.

335
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,160
-Okay, here I go.
-Hey, she's taking our picture.

336
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
1, 2, 3.

337
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,720
-We're done!
-We're done!

338
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,600
How did the pictures turn out?

339
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,960
1, 2, 3.

340
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,400
By the way, do you remember
what your sister said?

341
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,080
She told me I'll get really lucky
in 20 years.

342
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,240
I wonder what I'll be doing
20 years later.

343
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,480
What do you think you'll be doing?

344
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,200
I'll probably be a wife
who receives a lot of love.

345
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,720
I'll probably be dancing as a member
of the Bolshoi Ballet.

346
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,080
I'll be in "Swan Lake"

347
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,960
and touring all over the world.

348
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,200
Hey, who does ballet
when they're 44 years old?

349
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,520
And do you even know
where the Bolshoi Ballet is?

350
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,760
Hey! Don't look down on me!

351
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,600
It's in Russia!

352
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,480
You're so smart now.

353
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,960
I'll give you guys free tickets

354
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,800
to my performance in Russia.

355
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,840
You'd better keep that promise.

356
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,800
Don't you dare ignore us
once you go to Russia.

357
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,240
What about you, Mi-ran?
What do you picture yourself doing?

358
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,480
I'm not sure.

359
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,040
I'll probably be a landlord.

360
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,600
I'll own a five-story building.

361
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,400
Your dream is to become a landlord?

362
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,680
I'm disappointed.

363
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,680
Your dream is so materialistic.

364
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,440
You shouldn't be like me.

365
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,160
I'll open a bakery
on the first floor for my brother.

366
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,120
My parents will live on the second floor.

367
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,440
I'll live on the third floor.

368
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,720
My brother will live on the fourth floor.

369
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,480
And as for the fifth floor,

370
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,440
I'll rent it out to someone
who's really kind.

371
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,320
(Mi-ran was so naive and pure.)

372
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,640
(Yes, I know.)

373
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,800
Why would she want to waste
a five-story building?

374
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,080
She should've thought of using it
to earn money.

375
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,600
Byung-sim, are you out on your leave?

376
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,160
Haven't you heard anything
about Mi-ran yet?

377
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,760
It's my fault

378
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,880
that Mi-ran disappeared.

379
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,200
It's because I gave her

380
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,800
a beautiful memory that's hard to forget.

381
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,000
That ended up hurting her,

382
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,920
and that's why she left Korea.

383
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,480
I'm such a jerk.

384
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,240
What a joke.

385
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,680
Isn't it weird?

386
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,280
It's weird that Mi-ran left

387
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,280
without even saying anything.

388
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,760
But it's also weird
that she isn't even contacting us.

389
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,280
I know, right? It's more than just weird.

390
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,200
I think she fell in love
with the director of the show

391
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,560
she always worked part-time for.

392
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,640
I feel like the two of them
fell in love and ran away.

393
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,000
Did you see the news?
That director went missing too.

394
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,080
My gosh, you're right.

395
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,800
That totally makes sense.

396
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Didn't it seem like Mi-ran's mother
was hiding something from us?

397
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,960
I saw her eyes shake

398
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,280
when she told us that Mi-ran left
to study abroad.

399
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,600
My gosh, do you think she got pregnant?

400
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,880
Do you think that's why?

401
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,440
People do crazy stuff when they're angry.

402
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,000
After she got backstabbed by him,

403
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,800
she seemed to get over him really quickly.

404
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,560
So that really worried me.

405
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,720
My first love in Korea hurt me so much,

406
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,480
so I'm going to leave.

407
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,040
Let's never come back to Korea.

408
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,480
Okay.

409
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,560
Let's go to Arizona.

410
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,600
We'll ride camels, grow cactuses,

411
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,480
and eat buffalos.

412
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,720
I'm a vegetarian.

413
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,760
Then let's eat grilled cactus.

414
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,040
You really are a strange man.

415
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,880
I guess I'll just have
to like that about you.

416
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,960
Freud once said,

417
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,440
"The human soul and body
can be separated."

418
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,400
My body will be with you,
but my ex-boyfriend

419
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,000
still holds my heart.

420
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,560
Don't try to make me yours.

421
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,480
That will never happen.

422
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,480
Okay, fine. Then I'll just have your body.

423
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,480
No, that's not it.

424
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,080
I'll just be happy
with half of your heart.

425
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,520
But you're free to take everything
that's mine.

426
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,200
No, it's okay. I don't like it
when a guy is too easy.

427
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
But...

428
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,600
But wait...

429
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,280
What are you thinking about?

Here's our first news.

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,040
We did an exclusive interview
regarding a woman who gave birth

482
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,840
using the eggs she froze 16 years ago.

483

This woman attempted an IVF procedure

using the eggs she froze in 2003
at the age of 27

And today, she gave birth to a son.

Both the mother and child
are very healthy,

of having been frozen

491
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,640
People thought cryonics
was just a hypothesis

492
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,600
made by academics, but it seems as though

493
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,440
it might come true in real life.

can no longer be considered
as something for the distant future.

As long as human beings exist,

there is no limit to what
scientific technology can do.

502

00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,680
We came here after getting
a call from the hospital.

652
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,440
We're here for Ma Dong-chan.

653
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,160
I'm his mother.

654
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,440
He's in room 1727.

655
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,880
You better get ready to write
your written apology, jerk.

656
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,280
Run over here right now.

657
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,840
I'm at the hospital.

658
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,960
I'm at... Excuse me,

659
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,960
what is this hospital called?

660
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,440
Hosang Hospital.

661
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,240
-"Hosang Hospital"?
-Hosang Hospital.

662
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,680
"Hosang Hospital"...

663
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,280
Yes. I'm at Hosang Hospital.

664
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,800
Bring your camera.

665
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,400
Hurry up and shoot me.

666
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,120
Get over here now!

667
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,560
Dong-chan.

668
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,720
-Dong-chan.
-Dong...

669
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,840
Hurry. Hurry up...

670
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,400
Hurry.

671
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,560
(Absolute Rest)

672
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,040
Father.

673
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,480
-My brother!
-Dong-chan!

674
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,080
Mom! Mom!

675
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,240
-My brother!
-Call a doctor!

676
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,520
-What do we do?
-Mom.

677
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,240
What did you do to my brother?

678
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,360
Help Mom up.

679
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,480
Dong-chan. Dong-chan.

680
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,680
Are you okay?

681
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,560
-Dong-sik!
(-Dong-chan!)

682
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,200
-Dong-chan!
(-Dong-chan!)

683
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,120
Mr. Kim.

684
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,960
Mr. Kim, we're in trouble.

685
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,200
Dong-chan... Dong-chan is alive.

686
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,480
What are you talking about?

687
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,440
How could Dong-chan be...

688
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,160
What?

689
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,760
Dong-chan is alive?

690
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,880
Dong... Dong...

691
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,520
-Dong...
-What's wrong?

692
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,680
Mom.

693
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,000
Nam-tae.

694
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,240
Where is everyone?

695
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,320
Mom.

696
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,920
That place has been empty for a while.

697
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,320
You should ask the landlord.

698
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,400
The landlord?

699
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,440
The people who used to live there
earned a lot of money,

700
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,320
so they bought the building

701
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,320
to rebuild it.

702
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,120
Did my family get kicked out
because they couldn't pay rent?

703
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,840
What's going on?

704
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,600
I'm sorry, but the charger for this
cell phone doesn't exist anymore.

705
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,440
But I got it three months ago.

706
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,720
It's a new model.

707
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,240
No one uses this cell phone these days.

708
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,160
Have you been using this until now?

709
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,880
My family

710
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,880
moved.

711
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,560
Can you tell me

712
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,040
where they went?

713
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,520
My family just vanished

714
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,400
into thin air.

715
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,960
The doorknob's broken too.

716
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,480
How could your family move
without even telling you?

717
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,840
I know, right?

718
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,880
When was the last time
you saw your family?

719
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,440
Yesterday.

720
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,600
They never told me
that they were planning to move.

721
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,480
So you're saying you were living
with your family until yesterday,

722
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:17,000
but they were all gone
when you went home today?

723
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,080
Yes.

724
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,960
I think they got kicked out

725
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,480
because they couldn't pay the rent.

726
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,960
What's the address of your old house?

727
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,760
The frozen humans came back to life.

728
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,240
No one's home.

729
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,120
What's your mother's cell phone number?

730
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,280
Well...

731
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,760
She's completely nuts.
I bet she doesn't know.

732
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,720
Can you show us your ID?
We'll look into it for you.

733
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,840
Okay.

734
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,840
(1999, My Diary)

735
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,360
(How may we help you?)

736
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,360
-They're all really old.
-I know.

737
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,320
(ID Card, Ko Mi-ran)

738
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,600
You were born in 1976?

739
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,960
-You're 42?
-She was born in 1976?

740
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,240
-My gosh, no way.
-Stop joking around.

741
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,680
-He's right.
-She was born in 1976.

742
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,880
Yes, you're right.

743
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,440
Do you think she's a mother?

744
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,600
This ID card is really old.

745
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,040
-There we go.
-Okay.

746
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,240
Is your mother's name Yu Hyang-ja?

747
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,680
-Yes.
-Call this number.

748
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,160
She won't pick up.

749
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,640
Sir, can you call her one more time?

750
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,680
And please put me on the line.

751
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,960
Okay.

752
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,840
(The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.)

753
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,880
Mom.

754
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,920
It's me, Mi-ran.

755
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,600
Where are you guys?

756
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,280
You didn't get kicked out, did you?

757
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,880
Even if you did get kicked out,
you don't need to worry.

758
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,760
You have me.

759
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,680
Mom.

760
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,240
I'm at the police station.

761
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,520
I'm not here
because I did something wrong.

762
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,320
So don't worry too much.

763
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,480
Excuse me, ma'am.

764
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,120
What kind of cosmetics do you use?

765
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,920
Who called me so many times?

766
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,520
It's the police station.

767
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,920
This is your first voice message.

768
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,560
(Mom.)

769
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,160
(It's me, Mi-ran.)

770
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,560
(Where are you guys?)

771
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,200
(You didn't get kicked out, did you?)

772
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,120
(Even if you did get kicked out,
you don't need to worry.)

773
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,080
(You have me.)

774
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,920
(Mom. I'm at the police station.)

775
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,480
(I'm not here
because I did something wrong.)

776
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,800
-Mi-ran.
(-So don't worry too much.)

777
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,880
Mi-ran.

778
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,640
Honey.

779
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,120
It's... It's Mi-ran.

780
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,600
She came back alive.

781
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,080
Mi-ran's alive.

782
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,200
Mi-ran!

783
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,040
-Mi-ran.
-Mi-ran!

784
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,080
-Mi-ran!
-Mi-ran.

785
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,120
-My gosh, Mi-ran!
-Mi-ran!

786
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,440
-Mi-ran!
-Mi-ran!

787
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,480
-Mi-ran.
-My goodness, Mi-ran.

788
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,520
Where's Mi-ran? Where's my daughter?

789
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,160
-She just left.
-What?

790
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,120
She was waiting here,
but she left just now.

791
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,320
Where? Where did she go?

792
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,680
She told me to tell you
that she'll be heading to school

793
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,200
to meet her friends.

794
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,440
-Mi-ran!
-Mi-ran!

795
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,680
-Mi-ran!
-Mi-ran!

796
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,800
-Mi-ran.
-Her school.

797
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,040
-My goodness.
-Mi-ran!

798
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,240
Taxi!

799
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,800
-Taxi!
-Mi-ran!

800
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,720
Are you serious? Dong-chan's alive?

801
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,640
It was definitely his voice.

802
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,880
Dong-chan's alive! He woke up!

803
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,960
What should we do? If he finds out
that we concealed the project...

804
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,960
My gosh, are you crazy?

805
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,840
No one can find out
that he came back alive, okay?

806
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,120
No one knows about this
apart from us, right?

807
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,640
The press doesn't know, right?

808
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,560
Okay, great. Make sure he doesn't talk.

809
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,640
If the press finds out,
we'll both be doomed.

810
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,280
My gosh, is he really 52 years old?

811
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,760
-I'm sure there's been a mistake.
-He looks like he's in his 20s.

812
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,400
-What's wrong with this?
-Does it show the same results?

813
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,720
