1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,400
(This program includes
indirect advertisements.)

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,200
(All characters, organizations, places,
cases, and incidents...)

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,760
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,480
Does this mean...

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,480
that we can live like normal people now?

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,000
I think...

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,720
that's going to take some time.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,960
Why?

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,840
Professor Hwang is being blackmailed.

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,040
See? I knew it.

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,440
I didn't want to tell you
because I knew you'd get scared.

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,640
Stop trying to deal with everything
on your own.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,720
Let's do it together from now on.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,640
This is about both of us.

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
I...

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,840
just want Ma Dong-chan to be happy.

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,880
That's what I want for you too.

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,759
I don't want you to know anything
about difficulty,

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
toughness, getting frightened,
or living in pain.

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,880
I just want you to live in joy
and happiness...

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,160
without thinking too much.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
I think that is...

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,320
what will make me the happiest
at this point.

24
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,200
Let's dry the clothes in our own rooms.

25
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,800
Okay.

26
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,040
Goodnight.

27
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,920
Did the two of you fall in love?

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,160
You two are like Adam and Eve.

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,160
The first people
of the cryonics experiment.

30
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,440
This is a spycam.

31
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,000
Please tell me the entire truth.

32
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,480
What in the world happened?

33
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,440
It's him.

34
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,640
The one who tried to kill me.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,760
The accident from 20 years ago.

36
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,720
The one who called...

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,800
to meet up with me
right before the accident.

38
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,760
It was the same voice.

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,880
His voice was so unique...

40
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,560
that I could never forget it.

41
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,720
He blindfolded me
so I wouldn't catch a glimpse of him,

42
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,000
but it's as if...

43
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,360
I had seen his face.

44
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Are you still reading the first chapter?

45
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,800
Do you have any idea
what that book is about?

46
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,880
Right here. Take a look.

47
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,560
"This is the intrinsic reason."

48
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:58,680
(Koyuhan)
"This is the intrinsic reason."

49
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:58,800
(Koyuhan)

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,040
Intrinsic, "koyuhan".
(Koyuhan)

51
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,760
Intrinsic, "koyuhan".

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,520
That's my dad's name.

53
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,800
It's so uncanny.

54
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,320
Is that why...

55
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,720
you've been staring
at that page until now?

56
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,080
Yes.

57
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,959
Nam-tae.

58
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,760
One day,

59
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,840
after a long time,

60
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,640
if we ever make...

61
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,960
a drug that makes you so smart
so you can read this book...

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,200
through and through like other people,

63
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,000
then could you...

64
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,240
go into a cryonic capsule
to face that day?

65
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,400
I can be smarter? Really?

66
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,520
One day, such a day will come.

67
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,480
I won't go in.

68
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,159
Why not?

69
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,640
Because I can't see my mom, dad,

70
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,159
and sister anymore.

71
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,320
I may not be smart,

72
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,120
and people make fun of me,

73
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,360
but I like living with my mom,
dad, and sister...

74
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,640
about 100 times more.

75
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,520
Actually,

76
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,560
after my sister disappeared,

77
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,120
this place...

78
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,880
This place hurt so much
that I almost died.

79
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,520
It kept on hurting even after
I took some medicine.

80
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,160
So I cried a lot.

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,520
You're the best.

82
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,240
You gave me my sister back.

83
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,040
So I don't mind
even if you snore too loudly.

84
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,760
I like it as much as TWICE's songs.

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,440
If I...

86
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,720
had any family,

87
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,159
if I had such people in my life,

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,200
I probably wouldn't have started
this project.

89
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,440
I didn't think about how
one's family would feel.

90
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,400
That's...

91
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,960
something I never thought about.

92
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,520
Professor Hwang, let me give you a hug.

93
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,400
I'll be your family.

94
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,520
(Episode 11: Family, After All)

95
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,880
Please report that the reporter,
Park Hyo-woo,

96
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
is Lee Seok-du's wife.

97
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,520
And that she's dead too.

98
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,600
Chairman Lee Seuk-du
is definitely behind this case.

99
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,960
I'm sure of this.

100
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,640
Like I said before,

101
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,240
Chairman Lee has been...

102
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,120
frozen in Professor Hwang's
cryonic capsule...

103
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,000
for 21 years,
starting in 1998 and to this day.

104
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,280
Then what does this mean?

105
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,120
Are they twins?

106
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,120
Yes, and that means 1
of the 2 men is a fake.

107
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,600
The one in the capsule is the real man,

108
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,880
and the one out here is fake.

109
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,640
But there is no information...

110
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,760
on how Chairman Lee has a twin brother.

111
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,280
There has got to be at least
some rumors on it.

112
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,840
That's unfavorable
to the fake Lee Seuk-du,

113
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,680
so I'm sure he deleted that information.

114
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,480
If he releases a rumor about how
he's a love child without his twin,

115
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,480
people will believe that information.

116
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,920
How can something like that happen?

117
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,160
Did you say Professor Hwang is alive?

118
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,440
Then was it him who got you and Ms. Ko...

119
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,160
out of that capsule?

120
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,800
Yes, it was him.

121
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,280
That was it.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,360
Yes, I understand.

123
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,560
Hello?

124
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,080
President Kim, this is Lee Seuk-du.

125
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,440
Yes, Chairman. Hello.

126
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,080
I'd like to see you today.

127
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,400
Yes, sure.

128
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,200
Yes.

129
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,080
I'll see you soon.

130
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,960
Keep that information
about how the informant is...

131
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,320
Lee Seuk-du's wife.

132
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,920
I'll meet Chairman Lee for now.

133
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,840
You should go find out
why he wants to meet you,

134
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,320
then we'll talk again.

135
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,799
Mi-ran, one second.

136
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,320
Oh, okay.

137
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Did you call all of our citizen cast...

138
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,800
to check everything?

139
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,360
We're getting a new intern.

140
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,920
It's the guy that you said this
and that about.

141
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,040
That young kid?

142
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,800
Darn it.

143
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
You need to make sure you do this right.

144
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sure you have a dream
to make a successful program...

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,480
before you die.

146
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,200
Oh, you don't?

147
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,160
I expected too much of you, didn't I?

148
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,960
Why are you picking a fight with me?

149
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,280
Did you catch the person
who stole that account?

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,520
Well, the police said...

151
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,320
we can't report that person
without any evidence.

152
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,600
That's exactly why I told you
to catch the person.

153
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,480
Why should I track and find the ID thief?

154
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,080
I have a lot to do as a chief!

155
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,480
And you want me to be
a part of "Go Go 99" too!

156
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Hey, Hyun-gi.
You posted that online, didn't you?

157
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,080
I'm not insane. Why would I do that?

158
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,480
If you didn't do it, prove it.

159
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,760
Find the ID thief...

160
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,400
and prove that it wasn't you.

161
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,480
Until then,
I'll keep thinking that you did this.

162
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,920
That's unfair!

163
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,360
And it doesn't make any sense!

164
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,560
Why doesn't that make any sense?

165
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,320
Hello.

166
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,400
I'm Hwang Ji-hoon, the intern.

167
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,680
-Ji-hoon.
-Mi-ran.

168
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,320
You can sit next to me.
I already cleaned it up.

169
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,480
Thank you.

170
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,800
Congratulations.

171
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,200
Let's get to our meeting.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Take a look.

173
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,960
Hey, Mi-ran.

174
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,840
I think you gave me the wrong document.

175
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,120
Pardon? That can't be right.

176
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,920
Take a seat and tell me.

177
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,400
Yes, look.

178
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,400
I mean, is this the right picture?

179
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,600
I gave you the right document.

180
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,400
You're right. I got confused.

181
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,160
The pictures aren't so bad.

182
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,680
Let's do it here.

183
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,120
Okay. Then I'll schedule
the shoot over three days.

184
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,840
Let's shoot our pilot episode here.

185
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,160
But one of our cast called us...

186
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,400
and said they can't do it
because their appendix ruptured.

187
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,520
Their appendix ruptured?

188
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,960
Yes, we need to find someone else.

189
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,680
I'll look for someone.

190
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,600
There's someone I know
who would be perfect for this.

191
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,360
I should've attended the funeral.

192
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,240
I didn't get an obituary notice,
so I wasn't able to go.

193
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,240
Are you all right?

194
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,640
Of course not. My wife passed away.

195
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,880
Right. I'm sure.

196
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,280
Did you find the informant
who was on the news?

197
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,520
Well...

198
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,360
The voice of the recording
that was on the news...

199
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,360
sounded like my late wife.

200
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,280
Did...

201
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,880
anyone identify her as my wife,
Park Hyo-woo?

202
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,000
You're grieving,

203
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,160
so I didn't want to bring this up,

204
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,800
but someone actually did.

205
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,800
Thank you for bringing it up first.

206
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
I don't want...

207
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,880
this story to be discussed again.

208
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,760
I don't want my deceased wife...

209
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,880
to become the talk of the town.

210
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,360
But the News Bureau should finish
the news they were reporting.

211
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,600
You need to cover up...

212
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,840
that case.

213
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,600
If you dishonor my wife's death,

214
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,120
I won't sit still.

215
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,040
It's not just your political career
at stake.

216
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Do you know how much
the party was bribed with?

217
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,000
You and I are already on the same boat.

218
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,040
You should stand on the same side as me.

219
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,880
If you stand on the other side...

220
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,480
and be ambiguous
about which side you're with,

221
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,240
then you'll be done for.

222
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,400
You should think carefully.

223
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Here.

224
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Just think about it simply.

225
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,160
Focus on getting into
the National Assembly,

226
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,120
and forget about...

227
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,440
all other distracting thoughts.

228
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,160
Yes, sir. I understand.

229
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,680
(President Kim Hong-suk)

230
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,680
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

231
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,040
Hello?
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

232
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,760
-It's me.
-Yes?

233
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,000
Consider the reports we received
about that voice nonexistent.

234
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,640
That's the News Bureau's official stance.
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

235
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,160
If I help you,

236
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,320
what will you give me in return?

237
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,920
The station decided to hire interns
as a part of a new strategy...

238
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,480
so I took you in,

239
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,840
but I don't really need a trainee.

240
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,880
-Okay.
-"Okay"?

241
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,400
Also, you shouldn't...

242
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,520
get too close with your seniors
during the month you're here.

243
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,000
You'll leave a bad impression.

244
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,840
You should keep a distance, especially...

245
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,400
with the female seniors.

246
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,440
Okay.

247
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,000
Do I get to go to the set of "Go Go 99"?

248
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,080
Why would you go there?

249
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Okay.

250
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,680
Just work enough to be unnoticeable.

251
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

252
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,360
No, no. Don't do your best.

253
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,440
Just be unnoticeable.

254
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,040
Should I learn the work from Ms. Ko?

255
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,880
Why would an intern learn
from another intern?

256
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,800
Are you out of your mind?

257
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,640
What could she teach you?

258
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,120
You don't even know your basics.
How did you even get in?

259
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,240
Hey.

260
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,040
Do you see that man? Learn from him.

261
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,960
What are you looking at?

262
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,400
It's like a dream to be working with you.

263
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,080
-What?
-A professor of mine said...

264
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,800
you were different
even when you were a student.

265
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,160
Sure. I guess.

266
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,360
You put up a hand-written poster
as an homage...

267
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,600
to "I Wail Bitterly Today",

268
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,280
and with that poster,
you were able to unite the students.

269
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,480
I heard it was quite the happening.

270
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,600
Yes, that's true...

271
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,480
You're my role model.

272
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,160
My heart will be full
from learning from you each day.

273
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,920
Hey...

274
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,960
All right. Sure, do that.

275
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,160
That punk has an eye for people.

276
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,480
No one noticed our relationship yet,
right?

277
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
I don't think so.

278
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,160
Do you want to do something tonight?

279
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,640
Is it okay for us to think about
something like that right now?

280
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,040
Professor Hwang is in trouble,
and we have the show to think about.

281
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,160
Those things are separate.

282
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,440
I just thought we should...

283
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,599
What?

284
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,560
What is it?

285
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,800
-What?
-Hurry.

286
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,079
Can't you find a place for me?

287
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,960
As for the salary,
I'll pretend to give way...

288
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,880
and accept a smaller amount.

289
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,080
I can't stand being here anymore.

290
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
Ma Dong-chan?

291
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,320
Every rumor about him is exaggerated.

292
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,360
He's not good at his job at all.

293
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,680
Maybe it's because he was frozen,
but his ideas are outdated.

294
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,960
I'm teaching him one thing at a time.

295
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,040
I'm about to pass out...

296
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,320
due to exhaustion from teaching him.

297
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,400
Do you know how high maintenance he is?

298
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,640
I'm the chief.
Of course, he can't be rude to me.

299
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,240
Anyway, please put in a good word for me.

300
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,080
I really want to start over
at a cable channel.

301
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,120
I'm really quick-witted these days.

302
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,440
Did you say your director doesn't want me?

303
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,680
Then I'll bring three shows being drafted
here with me.

304
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Yes. Of course.

305
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,840
Is he crazy?

306
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,640
How much worse can he be?

307
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,520
-I was so scared.
-I want to kill him.

308
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,200
Gosh.

309
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Mi-ran.

310
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,560
I don't know how to organize these.

311
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,360
And? Really?

312
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,480
Is it reaching an all-time high?

313
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,920
What should I do?
Should I sell them or not?

314
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,680
Mr. Ma told me
I should learn the work from him.

315
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Really?

316
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,600
I doubt there's anything
you can learn from him.

317
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,760
-I took care of it.
-Good work.

(Unlimited charcoal-grilled beef ribs)

319
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,440
Now that you're exposed,
(Unlimited charcoal-grilled beef ribs)

320
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,240
you need to stay
where there are a lot of people.

Gab Su, you should eat with me.
(Unlimited charcoal-grilled beef ribs)

323
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,520
Gab Su, you should eat with me.

324
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,040
You must be tired from serving
so many customers.

325
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,160
Let's do that.

Here.

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,760
Cheers.

330
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,880
Gab Su.

331
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:01,040
Please help my son spend the winter
without an air conditioner.

332
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,480
I have no regrets even if I die now.

333
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,800
I don't need to live any longer.

334
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,800
But, I want to die after seeing my son...

335
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,760
live properly.

336
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,440
That's why I've been taking
herbal medicine...

337
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
and paying attention to my health.

338
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,680
What are children to parents anyway?

339
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,200
I don't know.

340
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,120
When my son went missing,

341
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,840
I couldn't sleep properly.
Not even for a single night.

342
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,880
I'm sorry.

343
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,800
I didn't bring this up
to get an apology from you.

344
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,840
Hey.

345
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Please forget all the times...

346
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,160
I spoke rudely to you and made you upset.

347
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,280
I'm sorry.

348
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,200
No, I can understand.

349
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,560
If you need...

350
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,560
subjects for an experiment again,

351
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,560
you should use me.

352
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,520
Please keep it a secret from my son.

353
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,280
Don't perform an experiment on my son
before you do it on me.

354
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,800
After all, I'm sure...

355
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,960
he and I have similar DNA structures.

356
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,280
My gosh, I'm at TBO.

357
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,760
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

358
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,720
By any chance, do we know each other?

359
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,720
I'm not sure.
You do look awfully familiar.

360
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,760
Did we meet at a hookup bar?

361
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,600
No, I only go to music clubs.

362
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,240
Then I guess it's because you have
a very common-looking face.

363
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,680
I'm actually here to meet...

364
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,800
Director Ma Dong-chan in Variety Team One.

365
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,000
How do you know Director Ma?

366
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,240
I'm his younger brother.

367
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,160
We look alike, don't we?

368
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,080
Do you know my brother?

369
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,520
-Yes, of course.
-How?

370
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,160
He used to be my superior.

371
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,720
My gosh.

372
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,680
Hey, Dong-sik.

373
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,000
Hey, Dong-chan.

374
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,280
He's my younger brother.

375
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,720
You're telling me that
she packed her bags,

376
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,880
stole Mom's jewelry,
and moved into that guy's house?

377
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
Yes, that's right.

378
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,080
Dong-ju's gone nuts.

379
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,520
She must be out of her mind.

380
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,160
Do you know where she is?

381
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,960
Yes, Young-tak told me.

382
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,360
My gosh, I feel sorry that
he was once married to Dong-ju.

383
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,120
He still needs to deal with her mess.

384
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,480
-My gosh.
-This is crazy.

385
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,200
Let's get going. Lead the way.

386
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,440
-What?
-Never mind. I'll lead the way.

387
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,760
We should think of what to do first.
We can't just go...

388
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,040
Dong-chan, you're going the wrong way.

389
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,800
Who is it?

390
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,120
You little...

391
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,480
Dong-ju!

392
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,840
-Open the door!
-Hey, open the door!

393
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,440
Are you kidding me?

394
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,000
I think I broke something.

395
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,840
This is unbelievable.

396
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,280
This is Dong-ju's older brother.

397
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,760
And I'm her younger brother.

398
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,760
Oh, I see.

399
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,760
Hello.

400
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,880
My name is Chu Bang-nam.

401
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,400
Hello.

402
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,040
Well...

403
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,040
What do you do?

404
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,080
I'm sitting down and talking to you.

405
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,520
No, that's not what I meant.

406
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,720
What I meant was,
what do you do for a living?

407
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,400
I sell industrial products on the highway.

408
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,160
So you carry stuff around
on your truck and sell them?

409
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,480
Yes, that's right.

410
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,680
Is this enough to earn a proper living?

411
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,840
This is illegal, so I don't pay taxes.

412
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,320
The money isn't half bad.

413
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,960
By the way, where are you from?

414
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,200
I ran a restaurant in Garibong-dong
for nine years.

415
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,280
But the head cook and our customers
were all from Yanbian.

416
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,840
So that's why I have this accent.

417
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,080
But I was born and raised in South Korea.

418
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,320
I have an ID to prove it.

419
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,560
(Chu bang-nam,
Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon Province)

420
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,920
You were born in Cheorwon,
Gangwon Province?

421
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,000
(Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon Province)

422
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,560
Is your name really Chu Bang-nam?

423
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,440
Are you sure it's not
some nickname you got...

424
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,760
after you got kicked out of Yanbian?

425
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,040
Why would you joke around
with my name like that?

426
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,720
I already told you that
I'm not from Yanbian.

427
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,320
My name means "a man who's like a flower".

428
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,680
My dad gave me that name
so I'd become good-looking.

429
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,560
Okay, that's enough.

430
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,000
What's your relationship with my sister?

431
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,480
And what kind of future
do you plan to have with her?

432
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,840
How about we talk about this
over some alcohol?

433
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,360
Why are you suddenly using a dialect
from Gangwon Province?

434
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,080
Okay, stop talking about that.

435
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,240
This isn't something to talk about
over drinks.

436
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,080
Hurry up and tell me your plan.

437
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,960
We're both old and lonely.

438
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,600
So I just want to be
good friends with her.

439
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,480
We get along very well,
and we share the same values.

440
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,320
We're just friends with benefits.

441
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,880
Hey! You crazy little jerk!

442
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,200
-Dong-chan, don't get angry!
-What? "Friends with benefits"?

443
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,600
I'm not going to go home!

444
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,760
How old do you think you are?
Why are you acting so immature?

445
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,960
You tell me.

446
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,520
How old do you think I am?
You can't tell me what to do.

447
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,480
Since we're on that subject.

448
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,680
What exactly have you done for me?

449
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,560
What have you done for me...

450
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,680
while I got married and divorced twice?

451
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,200
All my other friends got cars
and houses from their brothers.

452
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,160
But you gave me nothing.

453
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,880
So why are you suddenly
trying to act like an older brother?

454
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,440
Hey, are you serious?

455
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,680
Do you know how upset I am
to see how weird you've become...

456
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,080
over the past 20 years?

457
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,840
You really have no right
to say that, Dong-ju.

458
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,960
You took tons of money
just so you could start businesses.

459
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,640
But you failed at everything,
and that's why we sold our house!

460
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,320
You're the reason why I got depression!

461
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,840
I can't believe you just said that.

462
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,480
You lost a ton of money as well.

463
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,080
I used that money to do art!

464
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,920
Hey, that's enough! Stop it!

465
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,560
Let's go talk about this at home.

466
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,800
Let's all go.

467
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,440
No, I'm not going.

468
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,520
Dong-ju.

469
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,280
Okay.

470
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,720
Then I'll do as you say
and go home for now.

471
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,000
Find out what kind of guy he is
before you start seeing him.

472
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,560
We need to check
what kind of person he is.

473
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,040
I wanted to be loved.

474
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
What?

475
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,400
No one loves me.

476
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,120
You have no idea...

477
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,760
how much I'm deprived of love
and attention.

478
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,440
No man has ever loved me
from the bottom of his heart.

479
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,960
What kind of guy would love you...

480
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,560
when you're living such a reckless life?

481
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,040
You need to cherish
and love yourself first.

482
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,480
That's how you get guys to respect you.

483
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,880
I should...

484
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,520
never have been born.

485
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,920
It's too late to say that now.
You were born ages ago.

486
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,240
You've had your fair share of life.

487
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,360
So what's your point?

488
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,720
Are you saying I'm old enough to die now?

489
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,000
Okay, fine.

490
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,240
-I'll just die.
-Hey, come on.

491
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,840
-Just kill me.
-Hey.

492
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,920
Will you please stop? Seriously.

493
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,720
I have a herniated cervical disc.

494
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,920
Dong-ju,
will you please come to your senses?

495
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,680
You really need to stop living like this.

496
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,480
I'm going to marry Bang-nam.

497
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,560
-No!
-I'm going to marry him.

498
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,080
My gosh, go ahead and marry him.

499
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,120
What do you like about him so much?

500
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,200
He's very strong.

501
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,200
Today,
I only want to talk to you about work.

502
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,360
The same goes for me.

503
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,840
Read it first.

504
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,440
It's a list of questions
for a psychology professor...

505
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,680
and the anticipated answers.

506
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,360
Your name, occupation,
and the school you teach at...

507
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,640
will be shown on TV in captions.
Are you okay with that?

508
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,880
This script was written by people
who lack an understanding...

509
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,680
of the relationship between
people's age and social behavior.

510
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,920
I don't need to stick to this, right?

511
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,120
The questions and answers were made
to coincide with the show.

512
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,800
"Age does not define human beings."

513
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,560
You need to say things
that correlate with that.

514
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,920
Not whatever you want.

515
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,480
The purpose of the show is too sincere.

516
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,840
So I'm guessing it won't be
very entertaining.

517
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,080
Do you know that Ji-hoon's
going to work here as an intern...

518
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
for a month?

519
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,640
I'm talking about your son, Hwang Ji-hoon.

520
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,920
He's working here as an intern...

521
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,040
so it'll help with his career.

522
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,480
Ji-hoon's working here as an intern?

523
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,400
He's very future-oriented
because he takes after me.

524
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,440
He's just a freshman,
but he's already preparing for his future.

525
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,800
But wait a second.

526
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,480
Does he know about our relationship?

527
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,040
What relationship?

528
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,000
There's nothing going on between us.

529
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,920
Mi-ran, will you stop tainting
my pure love toward you?

530
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,240
You really need to give me a chance.

531
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,560
Cut the nonsense!

532
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,080
You idiotic scumbag.

533
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,640
Why did she become so rough?

534
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,600
She used to be like a deer.

535
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,120
But she was like a T-Rex just now.

536
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,480
Is it a side effect from the experiment?

537
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,800
I thought your dream
was to become a reporter.

538
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,360
I didn't know you'd apply
for a variety department.

539
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,760
Let's go somewhere and have a chat.

540
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,320
Did you date...

541
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,360
Mi-ran before?

542
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,160
Yes, she's my first love.

543
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,200
She's the definition of my youth.

544
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,400
Do you know how much
a man's first love means to him?

545
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,400
You probably have no idea
because you haven't loved anyone.

546
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,480
Why wouldn't I know that?

547
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,440
Why did it have to be...

548
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,520
Mi-ran?

549
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,800
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

550
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,000
(Please report that the reporter,
Park Hyo-woo,)
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

551
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,040
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

552
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,080
(is Lee Seuk-du's wife.)
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

553
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,400
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

554
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,840
(And that she's dead too.)
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

555
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,360
(Consider the reports we received
about that voice nonexistent.)

556
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,040
Hello, Chief Na.

557
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,680
Glad to have you. Take a seat.

558
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Yes.

559
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,920
I came by to thank you.

560
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,160
What did I ever do to have you thank me?

561
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,320
I'm thinking.

562
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,200
When the world was saying
whatever they wanted about me,

563
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,480
you made a report from my shoes.

564
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,400
That's when I realized
how powerful the news is.

565
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,760
Thank you.

566
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,800
The News Bureau
only did what it had to do.

567
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,920
You don't have to thank me.

568
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,800
It wasn't to protect you.

569
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,640
We just reported on
what exactly the facts were.

570
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,800
That's my job.

571
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,280
But not everyone does
what they are supposed to do.

572
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,040
I should be grateful...

573
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,000
for what you did.

574
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,560
In that case, okay.

575
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,640
You may go now.

576
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,440
If you came to thank me,
I think that was enough.

577
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,440
You seem busy, so please excuse me.

578
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,400
Make sure...

579
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,440
you protect Dong-chan well.

580
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,800
Anyone would want to steal him.

581
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,240
Yes, exactly.
I have great ideas these days.

582
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,680
Yes, that's why
I'm asking you for a favor.

583
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,000
Yes, okay.

584
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,000
I'll call you later.

585
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,800
What is it, Dong-chan?

586
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,840
It must be tough trying to teach me.

587
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,080
I'm so high maintenance.

588
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,480
I came back in 20 years...

589
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,639
so my ideas are outdated...

590
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,679
and all I do is bully you.

591
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,840
But...

592
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,560
if you're going to move,
leave empty-handed.

593
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,960
You have no business morality, you jerk.

594
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,800
I...

595
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,440
Chief Son.

596
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,800
I'm leaving "Go Go 99".

597
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,639
-All of a sudden? Why?
-Well, just because.

598
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,080
I have to prepare
the end-of-the-year episode...

599
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,159
for "Show Music Tank"
with Hyeon-cheol anyway.

600
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,159
-I'm busy.
-That's disappointing.

601
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,159
What am I going to do without you?

602
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,960
I'm deeply disappointed in you!

603
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,320
-What? Disappointed?
-Hey.

604
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,920
Were you trying to take away her project?

605
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,800
-Wait, no...
-She's very disappointed.

606
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,600
Wait, it's not... Goodness.

607
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,520
Come with me, will you?

608
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,120
You can learn from me,

609
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,320
and I'm sure there are things
I have to learn from you.

610
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,840
Let's have time to discuss
directors' stories...

611
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,760
from back then and now.

612
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,440
Then I'll put you on the list
as one of our crew members.

613
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,480
So annoying.

614
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,640
I should have never liked him
from the start.

615
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,160
I like him even more
now that I know he won't be mine.

616
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,040
What are you doing by yourself?
Performing a monologue?

617
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,040
Don't make me compare.

618
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,480
With whom?

619
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
(I'm Ko Mi-ran,
a 44-year-old who's dating right now.)

620
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,880
(I'm Ko Mi-ran, a 44-year-old...)
(I'm Ko Mi-ran,

621

(I'm Ko Mi-ran,

(who's dating right now.)

624
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,920
Mi-ran.

625
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,600
Buy me dinner tonight.

626
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,800
I'm sorry. I already have plans.

627
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,840
Can you hold it off until tomorrow?

628
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,760
You're going to Pocheon tomorrow.

629
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,760
Right, you're coming too.

630
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,920
Director Ma told me to stay.

631
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,560
Really? We have enough space.
Why did he tell you that?

632
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,720
It's okay.

633
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,360
I'll stay loyal to Mr. Ma.

634
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,440
Gosh, you're so cute.

635
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,520
(Ma Dong-chan, a 52-year-old single guy
that Mi-ran likes.)

636
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,920
(Ma Dong-chan, a 52-year-old...)
(Ma Dong-chan, a 52-year-old single guy
that Mi-ran likes.)

637
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,640
(single guy that Mi-ran likes.)

638
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,640
Come on.

639
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,640
(Let's go on a date tonight.
I'll text you the place.)

640
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,160
(Let's go on a date tonight.)
(Let's go on a date tonight.
I'll text you the place.)

641
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,080
(I'll text you the place.)

642
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,760
She does everything by herself.

643
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,080
It's our first date.

644
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,120
(This way to the basement ice rink)

645
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,880
(Skate Rental)

646
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,440
We could have come together.
Why did she insist on...

647
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,120
-Did you get them?
-Yes.

648
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,360
-Are those 260mm?
-Yes.

649
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,080
You got the perfect ones.

650
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,720
Hello, I'm Ko Nam-tae.

651
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,600
Hello, I'm Ma Dong-chan.

652
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,160
Why didn't you tell me?
I would have picked him up.

653
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,240
Give me your hand.

654
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
That's good.

655
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,760
I'm 52 years old on paper,

656
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,800
but I only lived as much as you did.

657
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,160
-Really?
-Yes.

658
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,240
Wow, this is awesome.
I have a new friend!

659
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,520
Be careful, Nam-tae.

660
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
Okay.

661
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,080
Hello.

662
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,200
I'm Ko Mi-ran, a 44-year-old...

663
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,240
who's on her first date with you.

664
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,000
I want to explain my life to you,

665
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,400
but there's nothing I'm proud of.

666
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,400
No, that's not true.
I'm a really wonderful person,

667
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,840
but I wasted a lot of time.

668
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,720
My current self isn't that great.

669
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,360
That doesn't matter to me at all,
Ms. Ko Mi-ran.

670
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,720
I'll live my best from now on,

671
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,440
so please watch me.

672
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,960
That boy is a part of my life.

673
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,600
I always wanted to have
the person I like...

674
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,920
meet my brother first.

675
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,080
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

676
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,880
I better leave a good impression.

677
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,560
I hope he likes me.

678
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,360
Since you came into my life,

679
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,960
I hope you'll look after
my little brother with me.

680
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,960
Thank you.

681
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,320
Of course, I will.

682
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,720
I'll gladly look after him with you.

683
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,160
Thank you.

684
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,720
Mi-ran!

685
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,240
Nam-tae, you're good.

686
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,960
Hey, stop.

687
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,960
Give it back.
It's because I can't fall asleep.

688
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,640
You still shouldn't drink.

689
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,520
What can I do? I can't sleep.

690
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,760
Dong-ju.

691
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,200
Remember when you were
a sophomore in university,

692
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,720
I found out that you went
on an overnight trip...

693
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,840
with my friend Won-seok,

694
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,240
and I beat him half to death?

695
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,600
Why are you bringing that up?
It's embarrassing.

696
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,560
You were a precious sister to me.

697
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,760
Whenever my friends came over
and said that you're pretty,

698
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,480
they were cut from my life.

699
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,000
Do you know why?

700
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,680
Because you were too good
for any of my friends.

701
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,440
That's the kind of sister you were to me.

702
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,400
And this is still the case now.

703
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,600
Why do you think no one loves you?

704
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,960
I love you and cherish you so much.

705
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,000
Dong-ju.

706
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,920
I can't let you be with Chu Bang-nam.

707
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,240
It doesn't matter how strong he is.

708
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,240
Why not?

709
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,800
Because you're precious.

710
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,280
Gosh, my back.

711
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,120
Are you up?

712
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,560
What's wrong? Are you aching again?

713
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,760
My knees are better,

714
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,080
but my wrists hurt now.

715
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,200
Gosh.
It's hard to forget that I'm aging...

716
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,840
no matter how hard I try.

717
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,520
My body is broken.

718
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,080
I'm still young at heart,

719
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,080
but my joints keep on hurting.

720
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,160
I wonder how I'll survive
the remaining years.

721
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,960
-Dong-sik.
-Yes?

722
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,000
Do you want to go on a trip with me?

723
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,800
What?

724
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,400
("Go Go 99")

725
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
-We need to start right away.
-I did the headcount.

726
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,480
-Let's go, then.
-Okay.

727
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,560
Let's go.

728
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,960
Kyung-ja.

729
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,320
-This is my friend, Park Kyung-ja.
-I see.

730
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,760
Hello. I'm Kyung-ja Park. Park Kyung-ja.

731
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,400
I'll make sure all the hours
you spend with me...

732
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,880
sparkle and be beautiful.

733
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,880
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

734
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,200
-Hello.
-Can I sit there?

735
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,160
-Gosh.
-There's no one there.

736
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,240
Sit here.

737
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,960
We have to turn the air conditioner
really high,

738
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,040
so we better sit together.

739
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,320
-Right?
-Yes.

740
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,480
We have no other choice.

741
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,560
No one said anything. How ridiculous.

742
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,120
Why do you keep on talking
to yourself these days?

743
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,440
You're making me curious.

744
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,720
You can use me if you're lonely. I'm free.

745
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,440
Mind your own business.

746
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,920
Hey, you better not start having
an interest in me.

747
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,640
Excuse me.
I have a herniated cervical disk.

748
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,640
My neck is bent to the right,
so I should sit on the left.

749
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,280
Can you switch seats with me?

750
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:19,080
♫I can't do anything♫

751
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,680
♫Looking around, everyone is in pairs♫

752
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,560
♫Everyone is kissing♫

753
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:33,160
♫I'm the only one alone,
everyone else is hugging♫

754
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,640
♫Where is my lover?♫

755
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,960
♫I'm here alone♫

756
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,120
♫Where is he?♫

757
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,400
What kind of style do you want?

758
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,200
I want the world to love me.

759
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,480
I don't want it to treat me badly.

760
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,600
Give me such a style...

761
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,160
because I'm precious.

762
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,240
I'm precious.

763
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,040
Hello, everyone.

764
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,640
I'm the director of "Go Go 99",
Ma Dong-chan.

765
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,760
-Yes!
-You're so handsome!

766
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,360
At "Go Go 99",

767
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,200
we'll forget our ages...

768
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,040
and go back to our youths.

769
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,040
We'll now travel back in time.

770
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,560
(Age doesn't matter at this place.)

771
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,640
(Just remember that we're all youths
and the same age.)

772
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,360
(Once the experiment ends,)

773
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,120
(we'll examine the physical age
of the cast again.)

774
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,920
(We'll prove that your physical age...)

775
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,760
(will become younger...)

776
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,120
(if your age at heart is younger.)

777
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,120
The dancing game.

778
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,640
-"Dance Dance Revolution".
-Try it.

779
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,680
-I am ground, introduce yourself.
-I am ground, introduce yourself.

780
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,040
Youngest Se-young.

781
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,240
20-year-old Dong-sik.

782
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,600
Kyung-ja, Kyung-ja...

783
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,880
No, no. Wait.

784
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,080
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

785
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,240
-Dong-sik. Dong-sik.
-Be careful.

786
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,200
-Catch it!
-You'll hit Dong-sik, right?

787
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,600
-Kyung-ja.
-Throw it.

788
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,960
-Pass it.
-Hit him out first.

789
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,040
Get Dong-sik.

790
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,240
Get out. I got your spine.

791
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,280
Watch out for Dong-sik.

792
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,680
For youth!

793
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,000
(Let's Go Back to 1999! "Go Go 99")

794
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,440
That was an amazing pass.

795
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,280
-You guys should eat too.
-Thanks.

796
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,800
-That looks so much fun.
-You guys, we should officially...

797
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,880
I had the best time tonight.

798
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,440
Both the year 1999 and 2019 coexisted.

799
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,520
You should go inside and get some sleep.

800
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,920
I'm not sleepy yet.

801
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,440
Okay, fine.

802
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,600
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-See you.

803
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,920
(I can't seem to fall asleep.)

804
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,080
(I can't seem to fall asleep.)

805
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,880
(Me neither. Let's meet outside.)

806
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,320
My gosh.

807
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,080
When we actually...

808
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,320
become 52 and 44 years old,

809
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,080
how do you think we'll look?

810
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,520
You'll have less hair, a huge belly,

811
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,280
and a lousy temper.

812
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,120
Gosh, that's what you think?

813
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,080
You'll be a really loud woman
who's just filled with anger.

814
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,040
-You're wrong.
-No, I'm not.

815
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,800
Even if you do turn out to be
that kind of guy,

816
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,240
I'll still like you.

817
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,840
We'll have to face
a lot of unexpected things,

818
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,720
and we might even be sad
from time to time.

819
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,440
But I hope we'll become adults...

820
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,760
who eventually overcame everything.

821
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,320
When that time comes,

822
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,400
do you think our body temperature
will be 36.5℃?

823
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,080
I'll make sure that happens.

824
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,720
So don't worry.

825
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,520
Seeing that you wanted to meet me
outside of work at this hour,

826
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,480
it must be regarding something important.

827
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,120
May I ask what it's about?

828
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,640
There are a lot of eyes
at the broadcasting station.

829
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,320
Mr. Lee Hyeong-du.

830
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,880
I have two options.

831
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,720
I can either report this on the news...

832
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,840
or just keep it a secret.

833
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,480
I don't understand what you mean.

834
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,560
20 years ago,

835
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,400
three days before the inauguration
of the chairman of Unsung Group,

836
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,960
Lee Seuk-du got attacked by a stranger.

837
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,160
And because of that,
Unsung Group needed a fake...

838
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,040
to substitute Chairman Lee Seuk-du.

839
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,560
But of course,
they needed to keep it a secret.

840
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,800
You're not...

841
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,080
Lee Seuk-du.

842
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,640
Do you have proof?

843
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,200
How dare you talk to me this way?
Do you know whom you're talking to?

844
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,480
Of course, I know.

845
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,840
You're Chairman Lee Seuk-du's
secret twin brother,

846
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,960
Lee Hyeong-du.

847
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,800
I've been working as a reporter
for 20 years now.

848
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,200
And fortunately,
I'm very deeply involved...

849
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,280
with the cryonics experiment.

850
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,080
So it's something
I've been investigating for a long time.

851
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,520
Now, I finally get whom the culprit was.

852
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,720
It was someone who didn't want...

853
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,600
Lee Seuk-du to wake up from the capsule.

854
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,960
Someone who needed to kill
Professor Hwang.

855
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,280
Lee Hyeong-du.

856
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,640
It was you, wasn't it?

857
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,280
Mr. Jung.

858
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,680
Chairman Lee's wife, Park Hyo-woo.

859
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,400
Who would be your next target?

860
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,120
It's the guy you should've killed
but failed to do so.

861
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,920
Your next target must be Professor Hwang.

862
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,960
What do you want?

863
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,480
Ma Dong-chan.

864
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,800
(News Bureau Chief)

865
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,880
Hello.

866
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,920
Professor Hwang, hold on a second.

867
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,200
Mi-ran!

868
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,840
Yes?

869
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,000
The martial arts professor
who lived in our rooftop house is gone.

870
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,840
-What?
-He left behind a letter.

871
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,600
Aging is a way...

872
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,280
to show how cruel time can be.

873
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,120
The fact that time is limited
and life is finite...

874
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,080
Some people might feel sad
when they hear that.

875
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,320
But to others, it could give them
an opportunity to become free.

876
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,120
For example, the stuff that gave you
a hard time when you were young...

877
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,080
might become somewhat easier
to understand as you age.

878
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,120
It could end up giving you
a broader perspective in life.

879
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,600
The wisdom and insights of life
can be collected with time,

880
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,800
and that surely is a blessing.

881
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,680
However,
we all just seem to age without that.

882
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,240
So the way you look at life
and your attitude toward it...

883
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,920
matters more than the fact
that you're aging.

884
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,280
That's why people tend to say
that age is just a number.

885
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,800
However, listen up.

886
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,320
Life is all about numbers.

887
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,680
Numbers are important.

888
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,640
Then how do you think
we should live our lives?

889
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,720
-Hello.
-Hello.

890
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,440
You guys are still shooting?

891
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,400
He won't stop talking.

892
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,200
It's like he's been waiting for this
all his life.

893
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,760
I'll wrap this up.
You guys can get some rest.

894
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,600
That's what causes a gap...

895
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,720
-Good luck.
-between your maturity and age.

896
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,880
Does it make you happy to act your age?

897
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,280
Society holds no responsibility
when it comes to your happiness.

898
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,120
I really think he'll do great
in variety shows.

899
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,360
All there's left is maturity.

900
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,520
Age is just a tool to maintain
a hierarchical culture.

901
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,960
It's not something that defines you.

902
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,120
Forget about your age...

903
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,000
and start living a happy life
like Peter Pan.

904
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,560
Bravo your life!

905
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,920
Okay, great job! That was great!

906
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,920
That's enough.
You guys can go home now. Good work.

907
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,400
Thank you.

908
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,040
I do feel a little sorry that
I took up most of the time...

909
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,800
when the show is only 60 minutes long.

910
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,480
But I have to say,
I think you'll benefit a lot...

911
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,960
for having me on the show.

912
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,320
But...

913
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,040
I do need to set things straight.

914
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,000
What's your relationship with Mi-ran?

915
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,040
You guys aren't dating, right?

916
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,880
If you guys are actually dating,

917
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,680
there's no way that you'd cast me
on the show...

918
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,880
since I'm Mi-ran's ex-boyfriend.

919
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,560
Yes, of course. I'd never do that.

920
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,280
If I may be honest with you,

921
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,000
I'm actually not that interested in women.

922
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,280
Why do you think...

923
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,440
I decided...

924
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,080
to cast you on the show?

925
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,560
-Hello?
-Yes, I saw the text.

926
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,880
Did you really find the tape?

927
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,240
Of course.

928
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,880
I searched everywhere
around Yongsan area...

929
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,240
and finished converting the film too.

930
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,000
Yes, okay. I'll be there right now.

931
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,280
You cannot enter my lab
unless you're a staff member.

932
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,320
Please leave.

933
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,960
I'm related to this project.

934
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,360
There's someone that I must find.

935
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,320
You wouldn't have witnessed
anything like this...

936
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,800
if you only had cooperated with me.

937
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,600
Where did you take him?

938
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,600
Bring him here right now
if you do not wish to die!

939
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,400
Hello?

940
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,200
Yes, hello?

941
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,280
Hey.

942
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,240
No, never mind. What are you up to?

943
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,320
Putting together the payroll
for the cast members.

944
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,040
Good girl.

945
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,240
You should be that hardworking.

946
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,240
Why did you call?

947
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,440
Do I have to call you for a reason?

948
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,720
I just wanted to hear your voice,
that's all.

949
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,480
Should I sing a song for you?

950
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,880
You can't...

951
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,000
Hello?

952
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,240
There's a variation in the LAP.

953
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,040
Hello?

954
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,080
Professor Hwang, where are you?

955
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,560
I think those two will face
a variation in them soon.

956
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,600
You have to come quickly.

957
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,520
Professor Hwang?

958
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,160
You have my trust.

959
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,880
M, 3, 4.

960
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,760
M?

961
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,480
Hello?

962
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,880
Mr. Ma.

963
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,880
Hello?

964
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,360
(Melting Me Softly)

965
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,080
(Please save him no matter what it takes.)

966
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,680
(Are they in grave danger?)

967
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,880
(I like holding hands with you,
looking at each other,)

968
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,680
(and feeling happy together,)

969
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,120
but I don't want to be ill together.

970
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,360
(I think the variation began
in Mi-ran's body too.)

971
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,400
(Are you saying we might die?)

972
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,120
(We won't die.
We aren't going to die like this.)

973
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,280
(Why did you meet him?)

974
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,480
You have to stop here.

975
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,200
(You have to feel...)

976
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,200
(how painful it is
to have your heart race...)

977
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,760
only for that one person.

978
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,200
Why did you come out?

979
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,480
Because I missed you.

980
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,960
(We're in such an unordinary situation.)

981
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,880
(We don't know what will happen to us.)
