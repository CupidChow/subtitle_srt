to meet?

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,640
It took me a lot of courage
to ask you this.

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Sure.

20

Darn her.

38

For what?

52
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,040
I keep on

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,440
seeing hallucinations these days.

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,519
That's because your head
is full of garbage.

55
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,080
What is it? Is it hard to keep up
with your new girl?

56
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,960
Do you need the help of herbal medicine?

57
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,200
I'm not seeing people anymore.
I quit women.

58
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,440
You're talking nonsense.

59
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,880
Do you have any candy?

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,920
I bet a lot of courses changed at school.

61
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,800
Will you be able to follow?

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,800
You should take a break and regain
your energy before you start.

63
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,760
I already took such a long break.

64
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,120
That's true.

65
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,760
You sure took a long break.

Don't push yourself too hard
and take it easy.

68
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,160
Dad, do you know how tough it is
to get a job?

69
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,720
It's worse than 20 years ago.

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,080
I wonder why that is.

71
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,320
That's because there are fewer jobs
they need people for.

72
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,920
A lot of machines took over.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,440
Yes. That must be why.

74
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,680
Nam-tae, you've gotten so smart.

75
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,440
We're doing okay now.

76
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,120
You don't have to work so hard anymore.

77
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,960
You should live while doing what you love.

78
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,840
You don't have to worry about

79
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,600
paying rent or repaying debt
like you did 20 years ago.

80
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,040
The family will get by
without you having to work.

81
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,560
It's been 20 years for you two,

82
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,640
but it's been just a day for me.

83
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,320
How can I change the way I think
over just a day?

84
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,760
That's how it is for me.

85
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,240
I feel like I should find work
to make money.

86
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,320
I'm losing sleep over job hunting.

87
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,320
Anyway, I'm too depressed to sleep

88
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,960
knowing that I was sleeping for 20 years.

89
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,880

Hey. That girl is just my type.

95
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,240
Her fashion tells me she doesn't
care about what others think.

Gosh. He sure has good taste.

for "Introduction to Abnormal Psychology",

Hwang Dong-hyuk.

101
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,200
-Sir!
-Mr. Hwang!

It's that man from yesterday.

103
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,880
He was a professor?

104
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,360
What's wrong with him?

105
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,720
-Hello.
-Hi.

106
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,000
You're a new face.

107
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
-Have you worked in this field?
-Yes.

108
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,160
I guess I have.

109
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,760
I see. Which shows have you made?

110
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,960
Didn't you do variety shows?
Then what did you do?

111
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,960
Are you the director of Variety Team?

112
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,480
Don't you know who I am?

113
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,440
I see. Did you get in through connections?

114
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,640
I'm Park Woong-soo.

115
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,280
You know "One Must Eat To Live",
don't you?

116
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,640
I'm the one who made it.

117
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,640
It's not easy being a director
of a variety show.

118
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,320
Sure, it might look cool and easy.

119
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,159
It must look like a job
where you can slack off.

120
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,400
What? "Slack off"?

121
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,960
What are you talking about?
This is like a battlefield.

122
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,880
-Of course it...
-Variety Team is tough.

123
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,360
You should think it through.

124
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,520
Do you know how much work
is required to get the funds

125
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
for an international shoot?

126
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,160
Of course, companies sponsor
on shows that I do,

127
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,560
but everyone else is hardly holding on.

128
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,720
The director has to bring in
the funds themselves?

129
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,720
You're so naive.

130
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,560
Who else would do it
other than the director?

131
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,120
Shooting the show is trivial work.

132
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Securing sponsors is the real part
of the job.

133
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,600
Just take it easy with your job.

134
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,840
It's not like you're trying to get
scouted to a cable channel, are you?

135
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,160
Especially if you landed the job
through connections.

136
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,360
By the way, you're really handsome
for a director.

137
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,840
Let me take a look.

138
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,960
Is this necessary for a director?

139
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,720
I'm pretty good-looking,
but you're way too handsome.

140
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,480
Gosh, what a work of art.

141
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,680
What do you think you're doing?

142
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,120
Good morning, Chief.

143
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,040
Sir...

144
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,480
Haven't you taught your employees?

145
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,760
What did I do wrong this time?

146
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,120
This guy here. He has a rotten mentality.

147
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,320
You jerk.

148
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,520
You need to teach them
the right attitude first.

149
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,080
He told me to take it easy.

150
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,080
Why are all the employees just like you?

151
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,440
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,720
Hey.

153
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,200
When did you start working here?

154
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,480
You punk.

155
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,760
You better work properly.

156
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,400
You should be worth your paycheck.

157
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,080
You said we have a program planning
meeting, right? Where is it at?

158
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,680
Are all of you out of your minds?

159
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,640
Don't you know what year it is?

160
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,560
Do you think such proposals will work?

161
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,840
This is why people say
you're not worth your paycheck.

162
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,120
Do you think we're still in the 1990s?

163
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,560
Even broadcasting stations could go under.

164
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,640
We can only survive if we do our best.

165
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,800
Why do you think this happened
to broadcasting stations, Mr. Son?

166
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,160
What? Why? Well...

167
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,400
It's because...

168
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,280
I think this happened

169
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,800
because the one at the top hasn't changed.

170
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,560
My opinion is that the higher-ups

171
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,800
who only talk are the problems.

172
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,800
You annihilate talents who are creative,

173
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,560
and you break their challenging
and experimental spirits.

174
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,440
What are you talking about?

175
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,760
You only focus on the ratings,

176
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,640
so you only end up making shows
that are safe.

177
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,040
That's how we end up
with the same shows everywhere.

178
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,840
Are there any shows in Korea

179
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,640
that the viewers actually want to see?

180
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,360
They don't have a choice.

181
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,480
They have to watch whatever we're airing.

182
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,280
There are cable channels
and online platforms too.

183
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,800
It's fierce out there,
yet you expect to survive

184
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,560
while thinking so backwardly?

185
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,120
I watched television like crazy
for the last few days

186
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,440
since I had to learn
the broadcasting trend.

187
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,200
So, Ma Dong...

188
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,960
Anyway, do you have an idea?

189
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,080
I came up with a few items.

190
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,240
For example, we can set up
an observational camera.

191
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,400
It's an amalgamation
of documentary and variety shows.

192
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,680
In the end, variety shows

193
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,840
are meant to show humans.

194
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,920
We'll find an island,

195
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,440
and a few celebrities will go there

196
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,480
to make 3 meals a day. 3 meals a day.

197
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,840
Should I continue?

198
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,280
How about this?

199
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,120
We'll make singers wear masks
so no one knows who they are,

200
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,880
then we'll make them compete against
each other.

201
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,840
-"King of Mask Singer".
-Survival games

202
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,120
always work, you know.

203
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,600
They can be ranked.

204
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,280
What's with everyone?

205
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,040
You seem unenthusiastic.

206
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,000
What is this?

207
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,000
Do people drink soda without sugar now?

208
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,560
Are you trying to be funny?

209
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,640
What is this supposed to taste like?

210
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,840
Freud

211
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,800
used the desire to eat,
have sex, and excrete

212
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,840
as the basis

213
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,040
to analyze dreams.

214
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,240
Through our dreams,

215
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,480
our secret subconscious

216
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,240
(In 20 years, Hwang Byung-sim
would look just like him.)

217
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,680
Being conscious about our subconscious

218
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,040
is Freud's

219
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,840
-basic theory.
(-Gosh, this is boring.)

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,400
(After sleeping for 20 years,
how can I be sleepy again?)

221
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,800
Our goal is to understand
what psychology is about.

222
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,120
That's all for today.

223
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,960
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

224
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,560
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

225
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,680
-Wait!
-Professor.

226
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,160
We haven't received the syllabus yet.

227
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
What?

228
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,720
This is cool.

229
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,480
So I should use this.

230
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,080
Dong-chan, we should probably
hide your identity.

231
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,840
Even if I treat you casually
when others are around,

232
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,400
-please understand
-Sure.

233
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,320
But when we're alone, I won't be
polite to you. Is that okay?

234
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,120
Why would you even ask?
You've never been polite to me.

235
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,360
Hyun-gi, you've grown a lot, by the way.

236
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,520
I'll be 50 soon.
I'm not sure that's appropriate.

237
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,920
Right. You sure have aged.

238
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,160
I do feel a bit uncomfortable
talking so casually to you.

239
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
No way. You look absolutely comfortable.

240
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,360
I never cared about hierarchy
in the old days either.

241
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,360
I remember that.

242
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,920
That's why I can treat you casually
so easily now.

243
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,200
Regardless of age, I can't stand
anyone talking nonsense.

244
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,320
Of course. You didn't fear anything
then, and neither do you now.

245
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,760
You're right.

246
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,880
Dong-chan.

247
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,320
I'm saying this to help you,
so please don't take it personally.

248
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,840
What is it? Go ahead.

249
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,320
I've been thinking about it,

250
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,080
and I'm afraid your creativity
got frozen that day

251
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,520
along with your brain.

252
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,560
Your creativity is completely gone.

253
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,320
What? My creativity is gone?

254
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,640
Are you done?

255
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,600
You said I could say it.

256
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,560
Yes! Say anything you want.
I'm not stopping you.

257
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,080
Gosh, this is frustrating.

258
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,320
It took me a lot of courage
to tell you this.

259
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,120
The world is changing fast.
We have to work hard

260
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,640
to find out what our viewers want
to become successful.

261
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,160
That's what you told me 20 years ago
when I was an assistant director.

262
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,640
And that's exactly
what I want to tell you right now.

263
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,640
Otherwise, you won't survive
in Variety Team.

264
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,640
All right. I'll work harder.

265
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,440
A variety show director has to be

266
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,960
sensitive to change. You know that
better than anyone else.

267
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,240
Keeping up with the times is
not enough. You have to be ahead.

268
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,320
I get it! But I need some time.

269
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm Ma Dong-chan.
I can do anything I set my mind to.

270
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,960
-Hello.
(-This is Ko Mi-ran.)

271
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,440
Ms. Ko?

272
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,200
How did you get my...

273
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,240
My phone didn't work,
so I gave her your number.

274
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,960
Why are you stuttering?
Did you do anything wrong?

275
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
No.

276
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,320
-Hello.
-Based on my memorandum,

277
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,160
I want a meeting
with the broadcasting station.

278
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,720
Let's meet in a week.

279
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,120
-Are you still there?
-Yes, I am.

280
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,000
Let's talk more in person.

281
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,640
The two of us?

282
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,760
No. I want to meet everyone
involved in this at the station.

283
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,840
President Kim!

284
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,400
What is it now?

285
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,120
Ko Mi-ran wants to meet us.

286
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,640
-What?
-And she said

287
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,360
something about her memorandum.

288
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,360
-I have no idea what that is.
-Her memorandum?

289
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,720
Her memorandum

290
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,320
Mr. President, I had to go through hoops

291
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,920
to persuade Dong-chan
to participate in this experiment.

292
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,760
He'll have to risk his life
for the project.

293
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,160
It's not an easy decision to make
for a regular director.

294
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,120
But I reviewed the experiment
from many different angles,

295
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,880
and it looked absolutely solid.
That's how I persuaded him.

296
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,840
President, if we make this work,

297
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,119
it'll be a huge plus for not only
the reputation of our station

298
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,040
but also for your political career.

299
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,720
Yes.

300
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,440
(Chief Director Kim Hong-suk)

301
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Sir, I'll come to see you later.

302
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,760
Okay.

303
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,920
Ms. Ko, welcome.

304
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,359
Have a seat.

305
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,680
You don't have to worry about that.

306
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,640
I'll persuade Director Ma.

307
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Now that you said yes,
he must be getting cold feet.

308
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,240
You're doing it, right?

309
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,960
Yes, I am.

310
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,240
Of course.

311
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,920
This will help you land a job later
more than any experience.

312
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,920
The first cryonics experiment
subject like the first astronaut.

313
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,200
That sounds all good.

314
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,400
But why don't we sign a memorandum first?

315
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
A memorandum?

316
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,440
Professor Hwang, do you recognize me?

317
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,840
I'm Gi-bum. Jo Gi-bum, your assistant.

318
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,560
My assistant?

319
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,840
Yes. You did it.

320
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,560
Your cryonics experiment succeeded.

321
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,760
It didn't only last for 24 hours.
It lasted for 20 years.

322
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,120
My cryonics experiment?

323
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,240
Do you remember anything?

324
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,360
-Cryonics.
-Cry...

325
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,760
I want to cry.

326
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,480
Okay.

327
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,600
I'll make sure your memories come back.

328
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,440
That will solve everything.

329
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,800
You can't eat it. It's not candy.

330
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,480
Professor Hwang, calm down.

331
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,240
Look at me.

332
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,520
-Hang in there.
-Look at my finger.

333
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,280
Clench your fist.

334
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,360
Slowly. Clench it tight.

335
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,240
Clench your fist.

336
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Professor Hwang. My goodness.

337
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,480
Is this what you use for editing now?

338
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,240
I can't believe it.

339
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,240
Aren't you cold?

340
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,360
If you're cold, put on more clothes.
I can't take off any more clothes.

341
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,440
This was Korea's biggest event in 2002.

342
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Korea made it to the World Cup semifinals.

343
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,640
I edited it myself just for you.

344
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,240
A Summary of 20 Years of World History.

345
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,720
I'm sure you left out
the most important events.

346
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,400
"Director Ma Dong-chan's
cryonics experiment".

347
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,080
"Ma Dong-chan went missing."

348
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,480
Unbelievable. A black man
became the US president?

349
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,400
We even had a female president.

350
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,200
She's behind bars now though.

351
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,640
So the current Korean president is
Moon Jae-in. Who's the US president?

352
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,640
Donald Trump. He used to run
a real estate business.

353
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,640
Times sure have changed, I guess.

354
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,120
Who's this woman, by the way?

355
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,760
Oh, she? She's the woman
I had an affair with.

356
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,840
And why are you showing her to me?

357
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
What contribution has she made
to the world history?

358
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,840
I just thought you should know.

359
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,320
-Why?
-I'm a variety show director.

360
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,280
I want every video I make
to be extraordinary.

361
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,440
Gosh.

362
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,560
Isn't she beautiful?

363
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,920
What should I do not to end up like you?

364
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,280
Get a cell phone first.

365
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,120
That's called Tetris Dance.

366
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,600
I met her while making a show about it.

367
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,640
Don't say another word.

368
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,720
Fine.

369
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,280
Are you cold?

370
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,840
Do you mean he was hired

371
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,200
through his connections
with News Department Chief?

372
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,360
I'm sure. Didn't you all see that?

373
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,520
He brought up "King of Mask Singer"
and "Three Meals a Day".

374
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,120
He's not qualified at all.

375
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,760
Chief couldn't say anything to him either.

376
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,200
He seemed to be so intimidated.

377
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,120
Is News Department Chief so powerful?

378
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,800
Here's something I heard.

379
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,080
You've all heard about a variety
show director who mysteriously disappeared

380
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,000
in the middle of
shooting a show 20 years ago, right?

381
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,040
-Of course.
-Of course.

382
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,400
Everyone's heard about it.

383
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,160
It's a legend that's been
passed down in Variety Team.

384
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,400
Some people say the new hire is that guy.

385
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
No way.

386
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,080
If he joined the station 20 years ago,

387
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,680
he must have been at least 26 years old.

388
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,520
That means he's at least 46 years old now.

389
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,120
You didn't see his face?

390
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,000
-He can't be older than 30.
-He's right. That's absurd.

391
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,400
You don't know that.

392
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,320
When he went missing,
it was all over the news.

393
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,240
But after a while, a gag order was issued.

394
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,560
All the footage was deleted too.

395
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,720
But apparently,
many people had already seen it,

396
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,240
and some information started circulating.

397
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,720
And the new hire is
the director who went missing.

398
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,720
If anyone hears you say that,
you'll be fired.

399
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,320
Be careful, everyone.

400
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,960
Moreover, he used to be
a legendary variety show director.

401
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,280
A genius planner.

402
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,240
That's how a legend should end.

403
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,120
He's seriously good-looking.

404
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,680
I'd love to work with him
as an assistant director.

405
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,200
That also proves that he has connections.

406
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,640
A director can never look that good.

407
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,680
Right. All directors look like you.

408
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,560
By the way, what is Ko Mi-ran
planning to do to us?

409
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,800
I don't know.

410
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,240
I have a bad feeling about this.
It's making me nervous.

411
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,080
What?

412
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,280
(Leslie Cheung died on April Fools' Day.)

413
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,880
(It felt like a lie.)

414
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,200
I can't remember anything!

415
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,640
(1,000 won)

416
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,440
50,000 won?

417
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,160
-Hello, everyone!
-Hello, everyone!

418
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,520
You're watching "Run, Quick Man".

419
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,960
-Look over there.
-My gosh.

420
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,520
Hey, what in the world is that?

421
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,520
It's called a drone.

422
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,000
"Drone"? How high does it fly?

423
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,560
Are you hot, my baby?

424
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,200
Dogs are everywhere.

425
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,080
Frozen squid.

426
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,680
Thawed squid.

427
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,920
Frozen dumplings. Thawed dumplings.

428
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
"Thaw".

429
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,240
Frozen...

430
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,440
They're thawed...

431
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,560
Professor Hwang, do you remember anything?

432
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,920
Professor Hwang.

433
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,600
You need to remember
who were inside those capsules.

434
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,280
Those two people woke up.

435
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,040
But they'll be in danger
if you don't retrieve your memory.

436
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,960
Oh, gosh.

437
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,680
Hello.

438
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,440
(Memorandum)

439
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,600
Hello.

440
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,520
I'm Ko Mi-ran,
and I turned 44 years old this year.

441
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,160
I'm 48.

442
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,320
Why don't you all take a look
at the memorandum?

443
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,640
Did everyone read it?

444
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,120
Yes, well...

445
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,840
I fully understand the situation you're in

446
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,720
and what you're trying to say.

447
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,080
The broadcasting station

448
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,480
is very sorry about what happened to you,

449
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,600
and we'd like to sincerely apologize...

450
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,040
Listen to me. I'm not here
to get an apology.

451
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,320
I don't need an apology.

452
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,880
Do you really think you can end this
with an apology?

453
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,280
No, of course not.

454
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,280
I ask for compensation.

455
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,400
Back in 1999,

456
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,600
I got 6.5 million won for agreeing
to be frozen for 24 hours.

457
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,040
Am I right, Director Ma?

458
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,520
Wasn't it five million won?

459
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,320
I paid her 1.5 million won
with my own money.

460
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,680
Oh, I see.

461
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,160
Then let's say you paid me
5 million won for 24 hours.

462
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,400
That's 200,000 won per hour.

463
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,320
There are 8,760 hours in 1 year.

464
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,160
So that's around 1.7 billion won per year.

465
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,440
And if I times that by 20...

466
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,040
Maybe the battery's out.

467
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,240
What's going on?

468
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,960
Give me that.

469
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,240
Three...

470
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,560
3.54 billion won?

471
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,480
Did you hear that? That's my compensation.

472
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,760
But of course,
that's excluding the difference

473
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,680
of the market price
compared to 20 years ago.

474
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,160
Let me get to my point.

475
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,840
20 years ago, the bus fare was 500 won.

476
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,040
But now, it's double that price.

477
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,320
You can round it down.

478
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,720
If we round it down...

479
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,640
70 billion won?

480
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,400
70 billion won.

481
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,560
You owe me 70 billion won.

482
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,640
Hear me out, Ms. Ko.

483
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,480
We fully understand how upset
and frustrated you must feel.

484
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,280
But 70 billion won is
a huge amount of money.

485
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,640
Our broadcasting station

486
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,760
isn't even worth that much.

487
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,440
Is the broadcasting station broke?

488
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,480
Why are you talking
as if we're running a pop-up store?

489
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,840
That's going to make her anxious.

490
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,360
Be quiet!

491
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,920
I honestly don't think 70 billion won

492
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,880
will be enough to compensate
for the 20 years I lost.

493
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,960
But we should handle this realistically.

494
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,200
If it wasn't for that darn experiment...

495
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,320
Mi-ran!

496
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,160
Please lower your voice.

497
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,600
I would've had a family by now

498
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,840
and lived a happy life. Do you understand?

499
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,760
Listen, Mi-ran.

500
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,160
We'll do our best
to come up with a measure.

501
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,680
So please give us a little bit more time.

502
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,680
We'll think about various ways

503
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,240
to soothe your resentment.

504
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,680
And of course, it's not like
70 billion won

505
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,320
will bring you back
the 20 years that you lost.

506
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,720
But try thinking about it
in a different perspective.

507
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,600
To be honest, you're
20 years younger than your peers.

508
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,080
-Yes, exactly.
-Don't you agree?

509
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,360
You survived.

510
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,040
It's a better world
compared to 20 years ago.

511
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,520
You can totally enjoy your life.

512
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,080
What do you think?

513
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,840
How about you give it a shot
and get frozen for 20 years?

514
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,880
You don't even know what it's like.

515
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,280
Drink a cold cup of water.

516
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,120
What are we going to do?

517
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,320
She's a complete lunatic!

518
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,160
Why did you make her
participate in the experiment?

519
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,920
What kind of sane person would
participate in that experiment?

520
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,160
We're in big trouble.

521
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,080
How are we going to deal with this?

522
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,600
I thought I'd be able to settle everything

523
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
by giving her my pension.

524
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,960
How about we just reveal everything

525
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,480
and willingly

526
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,760
get judged by the law?

527
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,240
What in the world is wrong with your head?

528
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,960
What kind of a dumb idea is that?

529
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,520
They're coming out.

530
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,920
Let's go, Mi-ran. I'll drive you home.

531
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,920
It's okay, I can walk.

532
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,960
Just get in. I'm sure
you're not fully well yet.

533
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,160
Of course not. I'm aching all over.

534
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,360
(Seoul, G2590)

535
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,800
I can't believe that car's
still running. Isn't it cool?

536
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,920
You're right.

537
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,240
If I wasn't frozen for 20 years,

538
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,760
Leslie Cheung would still be alive.

539
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,760
How does that make any sense?
Are you a sophist?

540
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,720
I told you that he was scheduled
to visit Korea

541
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,640
a few days after the experiment, right?

542
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,880
Yes. I even promised
I'd let you see him in person.

543
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,960
Yes.

544
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,400
If I had met him then,

545
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,840
I would've helped him
find the desire to live.

546
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,880
He would have had the will to live
while thinking of me.

547
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,600
Then he wouldn't have
ended his life in vain.

548
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,520
What is this? I'm speechless.

549
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,560
If that's your way of thinking,
then we can assume

550
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
you might have died in a car accident

551
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,640
if you weren't frozen.

552
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,480
Are you serious?
Do you even hear yourself?

553
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,960
It's true, if we follow your logic.

554
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,440
You never know what could've
happened to you in 20 years.

555
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,040
Life isn't always filled with good things.

556
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,960
Are you going to keep on nitpicking?

557
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,840
In those 20 years,
I could've won the lottery too.

558
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,720
No, no. That would never happen.

559
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,720
Why not?

560
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,040
Why is it possible for me to die
in an accident,

561
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,200
but not win the lottery?

562
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,640
I'm saying we should consider probability.

563
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,880
I could've married Leslie,

564
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,480
or a really cool man...

565
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
Gosh.

566
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,080
Isn't it more likely to meet
a strange guy than a cool guy

567
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,080
based on the data you have
from the years you've lived?

568
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,639
On what grounds
are you making these comments?

569
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,800
Don't tell me

570
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,600
you're using my ridiculous
ex-boyfriend for the data?

571
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,199
See?

572
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,600
You admitted that your ex-boyfriend
was ridiculous.

573
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,679
No, I...

574
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,280
There aren't many cool guys out there,

575
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:38,199
nor do you have high chances
of meeting them

576
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,679
What happened?

577
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,840
Did the car die on me because
the air conditioning is too high?

578
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,120
Mi-ran.

579
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,600
Get out.

580
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,440
Get out and take a taxi.

581
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,720
Why... Why isn't this working?

582
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Ko...

583
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Mi-ran?

584
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,840
Is that you, Mi-ran?

585
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,880
Hello, Mr. Hwang.

586
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,400
It's unbelievable.

587
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,960
I heard a lot about you from my mom.

588
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,600
-Your mom?
-Yes.

589
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,480
Ko Mi-ran is my mother.

590
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
Then...

591
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,800
what about your mother?

592
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,600
She passed away in a car accident
when I was 11.

593
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,720
She died at the scene.

594
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,160
Until her death, she missed only one man.

595
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,560
Do you know what her last words were?

596
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,520
"The only love I had in my life
was Hwang Byung-sim."

597
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,560
No, Mi-ran!

598
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
By the way,

599
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,040
if she died instantly in the car accident,

600
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,560
when did she leave her last words?

601
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,080
Hey! Did you forget
the herbal medicine on the stove?

602
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,280
It's all burnt! Gosh.

603
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,240
I don't know what to do. Hey!

604
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,440
That jerk!

605
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,360
I'm so sick of junk emails.

606
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,880
Who is it?

607
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,720
"Mi-ran"?

608
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,720
Who's "Mi-ran"?

609
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,160
Mi-ran?

610
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,040
(Kyung-ja, this is Mi-ran.)

611
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,400
(Kyung-ja, this is Mi-ran.)

612
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,160
Ko Mi-ran?

613
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,200
(I'm sorry I'm only replying now.)

614
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,120
(I miss you so much.)

615
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,160
Oh, my goodness, Mi-ran.

616
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,800
Yes, Kyung-ja.

617
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,560
Mi-ran contacted me.

618
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,480
Mi-ran? Ko Mi-ran?

619
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
Yes.

620
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,200
She wants to meet.

621
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,400
What? Where is she right now?

622
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
Hey, Nam-tae.

623
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Mi-ran.

624
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
Here.

625
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,360
(Mi-ran, Nam-tae)

626
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,520
Did you bake this yourself?

627
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,080
It's delicious.

628
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,360
Mi-ran, I also have

629
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
this.

630
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,520
If you keep rubbing it,

631
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,840
it warms up. It's a hand warmer.

632
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,320
You were

633
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,080
-in the cold all this time.
-Thank you.

634
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,440
I'll hold this tight in my hands.

635
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,800
Goodnight, Mi-ran.

636
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,000
(Park Kyung-ja)

637
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,640
(Let's meet right now.)

638
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,080
Kyung-ja.

639
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,680
Sitting here like this

640
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,520
makes me feel like we went back
to 20 years ago.

641
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
You're right.

642
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
Ha-young.

643
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,760
Do you remember?

644
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,960
You said

645
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,640
you're scared

646
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,720
I might turn cold like ice
after the experiment.

647
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,760
I'm not the one who changed,

648
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,920
it's you.

649
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,880
I can understand.

650
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,800
I'm sure the 20 years I spent
is different from yours.

651
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,400
I didn't physically spend
the 20 years like you did,

652
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,520
so I was unable to change.
But it must be different for you.

653
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,880
Do I still

654
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,600
look like

655
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,360
a woman to you?

656
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Yes,

657
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,680
you do.

658
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,400
Where is she? Gosh.

659
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,480
Young-sun, look. Isn't that Mi-ran?

660
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,880
-Gosh, it's Mi-ran.
-It's her.

661
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,760
-Mi-ran!
-Mi-ran!

662
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,240
-Gosh, Mi-ran! Mi-ran!
-Mi-ran! Mi-ran!

663
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,920
It's me, it's me.

664
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,360
-Kyung-ja.
-Kyung-ja.

665
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,160
-Young-sun?
-Young-sun.

666
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,160
Kyung-ja. Young-sun.

667
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,720
How... How can this be?

668
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,720
I know, right? She didn't change a bit!

669
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,280
Guys.

670
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,240
-Gosh.
-How can this happen?

671
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,280
Why haven't you contacted us in 20 years?

672
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,840
I was busy in the US.

673
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,160
You're so mean. That's no excuse.

674
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,200
By the way, did you get married?

675
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,000
Not yet. What about you guys?

676
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,360
I know Kyung-ja's dream
was to become a good wife.

677
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,360
I guess it was.

678
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,520
I'm divorced.

679
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,520
I hate all men now.

680
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,160
You won't believe
who this girl is married to.

681
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,520
You don't want to know.

682
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,240
I can't believe it myself.

683
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,920
So why did you suddenly disappear
and stop talking to us?

684
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,760
We had all kinds of thoughts about
what might have happened to you.

685
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,280
She's right. Horrible incidents
were happening around that time.

686
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,320
And your mother told us

687
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,520
that you went to the US to study.

688
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,000
How can you look exactly the same
as you did 20 years ago?

689
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,200
You guys look the same too.

690
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,720
I've been taking good care of myself.

691
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,960
People do tell me
that I look like I'm in my 20s

692
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,000
all the time.

693
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,120
-Cut it out. The thing is,
-I'm tired of it.

694
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,480
you're on a whole other level.

695
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,520
-You haven't aged at all.
-Right.

696
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,120
-You think so?
-Yes.

697
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,720
Maybe it's because I've been
sleeping for the past 20 years.

698
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,960
What are you talking about?

699
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,400
You'd still age though.

700
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,600
So what did you do?

701
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,960
Did you undergo
some secret procedures or something?

702
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,040
Yes, tell us the truth.

703
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,280
What did you do?

704
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,840
In the US, they use root cells

705
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,640
It's stem cells, you fool.

706
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,120
-It doesn't matter.
-I can't believe you.

707
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,520
I heard they're developing
scientific techniques

708
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,120
that use cells to prevent aging.

709
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,840
-Is that what you did?
-Is that true?

710
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,000
Is that it?

711
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,720
What is it?

712
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,280
I'm grateful that
you guys have been doing so well.

713
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,840
I have to use the bathroom.

714
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,040
Did she live on preservatives
in the US for 20 years?

715
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,160
I'm sure she did something in the US.

716
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,200
It can't be Botox or plastic surgery.

717
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,440
It's impossible.

718
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,560
When it comes to plastic surgery,
Korea is the best.

719
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,720
I know that.

720
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,400
She's hiding something from us.

721
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,040
Medicine has come a long way,

722
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,960
but you can't achieve that
with medical procedures only.

723
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,960
Exactly.

724
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,960
Unless she's become a vampire
or been frozen

725
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,160
Has she been frozen?

726
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,480
No way.

727
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,440
Impossible.

728
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,840
-No?
-No.

729
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,720
Hi, Mom.

730
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,640
My class is over.

731
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,760
By the way,
Dad must be having a hard time.

732
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,800
He's playing the piano alone.

733
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,600
He's crying too.

734
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,760
(I'm sure it's hard for him.)

735
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,600
His brother came back after 20 years.

736
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,920
Is the galbi for Table Three ready yet?

737
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,600
It's coming!

738
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,160
Go straight home, okay?

739
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,560
(Korean Style Restaurant Jinsagalbi)

740
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,360
I'll cut it up later.

741
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,760
Are you full?

742
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,440
We ate as much as we wanted.

743
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,800
It was so tasty.
We'll definitely come back.

744
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,280
Come again, sir.

745
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,320
Does she think she can make them
come back, looking like that?

746
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:44,400
Is she putting on lipstick or eating it?

747
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,960
Dad!

748
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,480
Are you okay?

749
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,080
After playing the piano
with all the energy I have,

750
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,880
I often fall down like this.

751
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,160
I have low blood pressure.

752
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,800
Then quit playing the piano.

753
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,560
But I'm an artist.

754
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,160
Surviving is more important.

755
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,760
Art comes after that.

756
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,520
Get up.

757
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,240
Turn around.

758
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,160
You're the director. Act like one.

759
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,600
Keep your dignity.

760
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,440
I'll go out first.

761
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,320
Calm yourself down
and come out in five minutes.

762
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,320
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

763
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,760
Sir! We have a problem.

764
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,240
What is it now?

765
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,040
An article...

766
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,360
("Director Appears after 20 Years")

767
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,080
"A TV director
who disappeared 20 years ago "

768
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,120
"showed up looking exactly the same,"

769
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,080
"leaving everyone in shock."

770
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,040
("Director Appears after 20 Years")

771
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,880
"Where was he for the past 20 years?"

772
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,400
"What is the broadcasting station hiding?"

773
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,640
"He has no twin brother.
Could it be his doppelganger?"

774
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,000
"Could he have been locked up by aliens?"

775
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,760
"Could he have been
experimented on by them?"

776
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,920
How imaginative.

777
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,080
This journalist specializes in mysteries.

778
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,280
Will it be all right?

779
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,480
If people find out
that I came back after 20 years,

780
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,360
it might put someone in danger.

781
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,000
What do you mean?

782
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,800
What happened?

783
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,240
What did I tell you?

784
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,200
Did you see the article about
the director who came back?

785
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,440
I'm sure it has something
to do with Mi-ran.

786
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,400
My hunches are always right.

787
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,800
I had a hunch when my ex-husband
cheated on me too.

788
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,360
I'm having a hunch this time too.

789
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,840
Yes!

790
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,760
You don't trust my hunch?
I'm 100 percent sure.

791
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,760
Anyway, what's important is
that she came back safe.

792
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,560
("Invitation to the Unconscious")

793
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,520
Why did Ko Mi-ran show up
in my unconscious mind?

794
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,240
What could be the reason?

795
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,480
Is she an existential being?

796
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,160
Or...

797
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,000
("Director Appears after 20 Years")

798
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,560
Oh, my. What will happen to my son?

799
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,680
The broadcasting station people

800
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,840
need to plan something.

801
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,720
Those jerks!

802
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,400
He doesn't look like my brother.

803
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,080
Look at his facial expression and eyes.

804
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,840
He's someone else.

805
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,520
What should we do now?

806
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,120
People won't leave us alone.

807
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,680
The picture doesn't do him justice.

808
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,480
He looks better in real life.

809
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,800
I'll go to the broadcasting station

810
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,680
and settle things with them.

811
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,600
I'll teach those jerks a lesson!

812
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,240
-Okay, let's go.
-Mom, I'll come with you.

813
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,240
Stop! Grandma.

814
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,000
We need to calm down.

815
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,480
Uncle becoming a celebrity
wouldn't hurt us.

816
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,200
Now that Professor Hwang has woken up,

817
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,720
we're over the hump.

818
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,600
Is each cryonic capsule

819
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,640
sponsored by someone?

820
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,040
Going into a cryonic capsule

821
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,000
costs a fortune.

822
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,120
How were our capsules financed then?

823
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,320
They were sponsored
by Johnson McCarthy Foundation.

824
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,760
Professor Hwang wished to achieve this

825
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,480
using Korean capital and technology only.

826
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,440
But I guess that's failed.

827
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,680
It's been sponsored by McCarthy Foundation

828
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,560
for 20 years already.

829
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,680
You're right.

830
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,480
By the way,

831
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,760
I have a question.

832
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,240
Go ahead.

833
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,040
It's about my body temperature.

834
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,240
Is my normal body temperature

835
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,600
31.5°C after the experiment?

836
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,960
That's correct.

837
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,160
The critical point is 33°C.

838
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,080
(The Disappearance
of Director Ma Dong-chan)

839
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,840
He was declared dead,

840
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,760
but there were many suspicious things.

841
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,520
This man is the murder suspect
of Professor Johnson.

842
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,920
If he was 35 years old back then,
he'd be 55 years old by now.

843
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,520
Professor Hwang witnessed
Professor Johnson get murdered.

844
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,200
And he got into an accident

845
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,760
on his way to meet a CIA agent
to make a statement.

846
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,240
So in other words,

847
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,320
it's highly possible that this man
was the one who caused

848
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,200
Professor Hwang's car to explode.

849
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,400
Why did the CIA suddenly put an end
to the investigation

850
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,840
when even the Korean police
are suspicious about him?

851
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,160
He became a Russian senator.

852
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,200
He's not someone they can mess with.

853
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,480
So you think he's the culprit?

854
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,120
But what if it's not him?

855

(Unsung Group CEO, Lee Seok-du)

856
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,960
I think we should carry out
a background check.

857
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,720
Are you saying Professor Hwang
might not be dead?

858
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,200
That's right. No one succeeded
in finding his dead body.

859
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,400
And there's something very important.

860
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,520
A director that disappeared
20 years ago suddenly showed up.

861
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,000
But the thing is, he looks exactly
the same as he did 20 years ago.

862
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,240
And I even heard
that he was gathering information

863
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,560
about Professor Hwang's
experiment back then.

864
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,520
Are you sure about that?

865
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,120
Yes, I'm sure. I even
read an article about it today.

866
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,920
What should I do, sir?

867
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,160
I want you to check
if Professor Hwang is alive or not.

868
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,240
And

869
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,400
do a background check about that director.

870
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,040
Okay, sir.

871
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,400
And if it turns out
that Professor Hwang is still alive,

872
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,160
we should get rid of him.

873
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,400
By the way,

874
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,080
do people still think the Russian senator

875
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,720
is the one who killed Professor Hwang?

876
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,480
Yes, I think so.

My goodness.

880
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,400
I was so shocked the moment I saw you

881
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,040
because you hadn't changed at all.
So that's what happened?

882
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,600
You participated
in that experiment yourself?

883
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:25,000
I guess that's why you met
Professor Hwang back then.

884
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,720
There's also one more thing
you need to know.

885
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,560
-Professor Hwang isn't dead.
-What?

886
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,800
He's still alive,
but no one's supposed to know.

887
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,880
I'm telling you because I need your help.

888
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,360
I was also suspicious
about his death back then.

889
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,120
By the way, are you feeling okay?

890
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,080
Can I borrow your cell phone?

891
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,200
(The number you've dialed
is not available now.)

892
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,480
My gosh, how long is he
planning to live like a caveman?

893
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,000
He really should get a new cell phone.

894
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,080
Who's calling?

895
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,840
Hello?

896
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,560
(Hey, it's me.)

897
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,920
-Did you get a new cell phone?
-No, not yet.

898
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,840
Did you get home safely that day?

899
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,120
You totally abandoned me
in the middle of the road.

900
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,960
I guess that made you feel uneasy.

901
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,000
Do you feel sick by any chance?

902
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,120
I'm aching all over.
How do you expect me to be fine?

903

I'm sorry.

904
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,720
Make sure you don't get a fever.

Apparently, we need to be careful.

906

What's that supposed to mean?

907
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,880
Anyway, if you ever get a fever

908
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,880
or feel sick in any kind of way,
call me right away.

909
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,720
Let's talk again, face to face.
I'll hang up for now.

910
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,160
What's his deal? I really don't know
what I should do with him.

911

even have a cell phone.

-Another subject of the experiment.

Shouldn't you know that
if you went through my texts?

915

Didn't you get the hint?

916

in that experiment together?

No, not exactly.

930

It's because of something personal.

Shouldn't our broadcasting station
do an exclusive cover on this?

And why didn't you tell the cops
about the experiment?

951

If you had told them what happened,
they could've done an investigation.

After you disappeared,

969
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,480
we put an end to that project.

970
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,280
There was nothing I could do back then.

971

I was just an assistant director
who had absolutely no power.

00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,640
I just did what I was told.

973
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,520
And right now, you're just a chief
who still has no power.

974
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,200
You still follow orders, don't you?

975
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,640
Dong-chan, this is tormenting for me too.

976
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,160
We worked together for years.

977
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,680
How could you of all people

978
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,640
pretend like nothing ever happened
even when I disappeared?

979
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,080
You don't even deserve
to be called a human being.

980
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,640
What brings you here?

981
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:32,160
Director Ma, can you get me a job?

982
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,680
A job?

983
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,680
Yes, I want a job.

984
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,120
Where?

985
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,800
Right here at the broadcasting station.

986
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,320
Here?

987
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,880
(Melting Me Softly)

988
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,720
You're asking me to work
as an intern for three months?

989
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,120
(Something's weird about her.)

990
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,160
Dong-chan! Please don't cause a fuss.

991
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,320
I'm not going to lie!

992
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,720
(You also didn't look for me)

993
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,840
just like the others even when you knew?

994
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,720
(Do we need to keep living like this?)

995
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,240
(This is really cool.)

996
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,480
(Why do you think they locked us up
in a refrigerated container?)

997
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,000
Are you okay?

998
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,120
Mi-ran! Mi-ran, wake up!

999
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,120
(I'm sorry.)
