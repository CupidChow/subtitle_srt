Hello, everyone.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,160
I'm Na Ha-young. You're watching Newsline.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,320
Here's our first news.

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,120
Do you remember Director Ma Dong-chan,

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,600
the famous director who
disappeared 20 years ago?

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,040
Many speculations are being made about

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,760
what might've happened to him

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,160
during the past 20 years.

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,840
Today, Director Ma is with us right now

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,160
at the studio

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,840
and he's going tell us an answer

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,480
to all these speculations.

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,600
Director Ma.

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,240
I heard you came here to
tell us something.

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,120
I am

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,320
Ma Dong-chan, the first person to
survive a cryonics experiment.

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,960
Hey!

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,320
In 1999, as a variety show director,

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,400
I planned a cryonics experiment

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,440
and took part in it myself.

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,640
However, the planning and
the undergoing of the project

29
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,039
was directed solely by me

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,440
without the broadcast station's approval.

31
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,600
I can attest that the cryonics experiment

32
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,400
is no longer a dream but a feasible one.

33
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,600
I was able to wake up after 20 years.

34
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,040
However, this experiment
requires more research.

35
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,200
There is an unexpected side effect.

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,680
-Goodness, Mi-ran.
-Mi-ran.

37
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,160
-Mi-ran.
-Are you okay?

38
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Hypothermia is a side effect.

39
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,400
Cryonics can only survive
if they can maintain

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,000
a 31.5°C body temperature.

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,840
I am going to do everything that I can

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,000
to perfect this project.

43
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,120
This is all that I can say.

44
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,040
He's pretending that
he didn't come to see me

45
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,920
when he's recognizable from afar.

46
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,160
Professor Hwang was looking
for a solution.

47
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,120
He was looking for ways
to bring the temperature up to 36.5°C.

48
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,920
Did he succeed?

49
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,480
Yes, he did.

50
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,760
But the problem is, he's the only one

51
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
who knows the solution.

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,040
We can't just sit and wait
for him to regain his memory.

53
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,440
I'm going to look for another way.

59
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,720

60
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,640
that a mutated, frozen man has appeared.

(Frozen man found in South Korea)

62
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,720
Had we known this sooner,

63
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,960
my father would've been in one by now.

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,680
This was their first experiment...

65
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,120
Hold on. Isn't this about the man?

66
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,240
-Mi-ran's friend.
-I think it is him.

67
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,840
-He's trending online right now.
-No way.

68
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,520
Hey, Mi-ran.

69
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,200
You're a cryogenic human, right?

70
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,000
I knew it.

71
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
You participated in the experiment, right?

72
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,280
Shouldn't the National Assembly
discuss the issue of cryonics?

73
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,240
The Blue House's homepage has crashed.

74
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,320
Should we have that man join our party?

75
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,840
He's good-looking.

76
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,320
He'll help improve our image.

(Cryonic Medical Technology)

78
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,600
Hey.

79
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,560
What do you think

80
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
about inviting that man to the Blue House?

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,040
Please ask Jo Gi-bum's laboratory directly

82
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,159
regarding any cryonic-related questions.

83
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,720
Professor Hwang Gab Su, who was in charge

84
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,360
of the experiment, passed away.

85
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,520
-That is true.
-Then are you the one

86
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,920
who resuscitated him after 20 years?

87
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,080
Yes.

88
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,159
After the professor's death,

89
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,560
I felt responsible for his resuscitation
and delved into my research.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,720
It took me 20 years to come up
with the defrosting formula.

91
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,240
I see.

92
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,159
There are rumors

93
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,360
about another subject other than Mr. Ma.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,520
That is not true.

95
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,320
We need to get rid of Jo Gi-bum,

96
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,560
the man who resuscitated Ma Dong-chan.

97

(Professor Jo took part
in the experiment.)

98
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,520
That way,

99
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,120
Lee Seok-du will never wake up again.

100
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,800
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure to hire professionals.

101
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,360
Do it when the dust settles.
Everyone has their eyes on this issue.

102
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,320
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,960
Did you mention that the director's mother

104
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,600
has a pork rib restaurant?

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000

00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,440
did you ever assume that I was dead?

154
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,440
Never.

155
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,680
I believed that you got into an accident

156
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,440
and lost your memory.

157
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,320
If that was the case,

158
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,800
I assumed that pork ribs

159
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,040
would still be your favorite food.

160
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,760
I believed that you'd visit

161
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,440
our restaurant by chance.

162
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,320
Is that why you opened this restaurant?

163
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,000
That's right.

164
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,080
But this restaurant

165
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,880
doesn't suit you, right?

166
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,680
Thank you.

167
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,600
Don't be ridiculous.

168
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,600
You look good even in these clothes
from 20 years ago.

169
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,640
Whose son are you?

170
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
-I'll get going.
-♫ If it's for you ♫

171
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,440
-All right.
-♫ We'll give them all ♫

172
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,640
And you.

173
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,920
Stop drinking.

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,280
♫ Oh my goodness come in ♫

175
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,240
And you.

176
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,560
-♫ Our pork ribs ♫
-Read the books I got for you.

177
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,720
-Stop watching videos.
-Okay.

178
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,200
♫ You can eat all you want ♫

179
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,480
♫ Our pork ribs are the best ♫

180
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,280
So you have no idea who your client is?

181
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,160
You've never seen their faces?

182
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,760
I'm telling you so.

183
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,320
I was only given the address of
the director's house,

184
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,960
the broadcast station

185
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,240
and his phone number.

186
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,720
We were paid in cash

187
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,440
which was delivered to our office.

188
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,080
You can check again.

189
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,120
Gosh, it hurts.

190
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,520
Do you think they're telling the truth?

191
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,280
They have no idea.

192
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,880
Who could it be?

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,880
I know.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,720
The police aren't interested
because it's a closed case.

195
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,080
Whoever hired those men knows
that Professor Hwang is alive.

196
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
You're right.

197
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,720
By the way,

198
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,520
you're a star now.

199
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,520
Everyone's talking about you.

200
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Can you spare some time for me, Ms. Ko?

201
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,160
Is the cryogenic man

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,040
her boyfriend?

203
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,200
He can't be.

204
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,040
-Ji-hun, have some breakfast.
-I have no appetite.

205
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,440
-You should eat before you go.
-What about Dad?

206
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
Don't ask me about him. I don't know.

207
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,400
I am

208
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,240
Ma Dong-chan, the first person to
survive a cryonics experiment.

209
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,760
(Yes, it's him.)

210
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,320
(The director
of "Infinite Experiment Paradise".)

211
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,320
(Did Mi-ran work part-time for this show?)

212
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,600
(A cryonics experiment.)

213
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,840
(That's it!)

214
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
(Mi-ran took part in the experiment.)

215
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,360
A cryonics experiment?

216
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,240
That's it!

217
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,000
Mi-ran.

218
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,280
Ko Mi-ran!

219
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,920
It's Mi-ran.

220
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,520
-Hey, Mi-ran.
-Hey.

221
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Ta-da.

222
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,720
Did you finally get civilized?

223
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,120
How are you feeling?
I got worried because you were sick.

224
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,160
I'm fine. When is our project due?

225
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,440
Next Friday.

226
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,240
I brought the draft for my part.

227
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,400
Here.

228
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,840
Why don't you just email it to me?

229
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,240
I'll text it to you.

230
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,280
I see. Okay.

231
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
I'll do that.

232
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,360
I saw that TBO's Variety Department

233
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,200
has internship opportunities

234
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,040
for students over the break.

235
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,920
-Really?
-Yes. I'm going to apply too.

236
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,680
-That's a great idea.
-Hey, Mi-ran.

237
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,960
About that man who spoke
to you on the bench of self-reflection.

238
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,640
-What?
-The cryogenic director.

239
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,240
Him?

240
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,960
Is he your boyfriend?

241
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,000
No.

242
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,720
I have high standards.

243
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,160
What? He's good-looking.

244
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,080
He's not my type.

245
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,400
He's not good-looking.
He looks like a girl.

246
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,120
Dong-chan does whatever he wants.

247
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,880
I bet he's never stressed out.

248
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,920
You're right.

249
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,880
Instead, people around him get stressed.

250
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,280
He'll never feel stress or anger.

251
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,480
He cools down fast since
his body is like ice.

252
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,520
It'll make me look bad if I say this.

253
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,040
But I'll only say it to you.

254
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,160
If we knew this project
would become a hot topic,

255
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,480
I would've acted like
I was a part of the project.

256
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,360
It does make you look bad.

257
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,680
To be honest,
I was the one who paid for everything

258
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,000
and persuaded our boss.

259
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,720
This project only happened because

260
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,480
I got Mi-ran to sign the agreement.

261
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,360
Let's not dog paddle
even if we fall into the water.

262
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
What did you say?

263
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,440
You ran away from responsibilities.

264
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,320
Now, you want to be acknowledged.

265
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,560
-Let's not live like that.
-Shut your mouth.

266
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,040
I don't think I did anything wrong

267
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,560
to deserve a lecture from you.

268
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,560
I don't have a single regret

269
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
nor do I feel ashamed about my life.

270
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,520
That's why you live without a problem.

271
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,760
I'd be so shameful if I were you
and leave the country.

272
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,160
Remember your adultery case
with a Russian woman?

273
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,160
Hyun-gi, why are you always
in Mr. Kim's office?

274
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,400
Are you two dating?

275
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,960
Get out and work. Come on.

276
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
I'm coming.

277
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,560
This is so unfair.

278
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,520
This is extreme mutiny.

279
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,240
Can you gather the documents
from Director Cho's shows

280
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,680
and move them to my computer?

281
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,040
Dong-chan, I'm the chief.

282
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,360
I'm not your assistant director anymore.

283
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,800
Even if you remember me

284
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,040
as your assistant director,

285
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,240
you have to accept the reality.

286
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
Chief Son.

287
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,800
Stop. I'll move them to your computer.

288
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,280
I'll work hard from now on.
I'll come up with a pilot program.

289
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,760
Go ahead. Do whatever you want.

290
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,480
I'll keep Mi-ran with me.

291
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,000
Now I have another boss.

292
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,280
Once my Dubai investment hits gold,

293
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,440
I'm going to quit.

294
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,040
How much longer do you plan
on avoiding me?

295
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,440
I plan on protecting the woman

296
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,240
I once used to love.

297
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,280
I'm afraid of the truths.

298
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,760
I don't want to dig into it any deeper.

299
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,280
That's my way

300
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,960
of protecting you.

301
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,680
It's the best I can do for you right now.

302
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,360
Dong-chan.

303
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,920
I'll wait.

304
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,080
I'll wait until you come back to me.

305
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
It's...

306
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,160
It's the best I can do for you right now.

307
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,160
(Ko Mi-ran)

308
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,720
(I'll wait for you in the meeting room.)

309
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,520
(Ko Mi-ran)

310
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,800
My ability will be acknowledged

311
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,680
and I'll be offered a full-time job.

312
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,000
That won't be easy

313
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,040
unless everyone agrees
that you're talented.

314
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,320
-You have to do a good job.
-Okay!

315
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
You seem fine.

316
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,800
This watch can check your vitals.

317
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,480
If your temperature rises,

318
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,960
the watch will start warning you.

319
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,080
Whenever you have a fever,

320
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,400
make sure you get a shot
of this fever reducer.

321
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
After watching the show,

322
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,520
Biocode in the US manufactured it for us.

323
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,000
I hate taking shots.

324
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,160
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,120
No, I...

326
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,080
I'll just take it.

327
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,960
The needle is thin, so it won't hurt.

328
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,080
Okay. I got it.

329
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,720
Make sure you inform me

330
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,240
wherever you go.

331
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,280
Download the location tracking app.

332
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,640
Can you stop nagging?

333
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,720
Text me your heart rate, body temperature

334
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,400
and blood pressure every two hours.

335
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,400
You better get my permission

336
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,000
before you faint again.

337
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Why should I?

338
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,320
Because we share a common destiny.

339
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,520
I hate nosy people and
I hate being nosy too.

340
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,720
So do I.

341
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,240
We can't only do what we want.

342
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,200
And avoid things we don't want to do.

343
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,320
I'm sick of apologizing.

344
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,960
You have an hour-long class today, right?

345
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,800
-Yes.
-Come back right after class.

346
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,680
We're going to have a meeting.

347
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,960
These are the burdens of my life.

348
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,520
Director Ma.

349
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,880
I'm Kim Woo-sae,
a reporter from Shingi Media.

350
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,920
Oh, hello.

351
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,000
Hey, is it true

352
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,160
that you've developed a weird ability

353
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,960
after you came out of the capsule?

354
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,480
From what I heard,

355
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,520
everything you touch becomes ice cold.

356
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,200
Wait...

357
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,800
Where did you hear that?

358
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,920
Is it true?

359
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,400
How does this feel?

360
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,640
Well...

361
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,640
It does feel a little cold.

362
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,000
Right?

363
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,640
After three minutes...

364
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Yes?

365
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,240
You'll freeze to death.

366
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,520
Then what about the other rumor?

367
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,800
What?

368
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,760
Is it true that another subject
participated in the experiment?

369
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,440
Do reporters these days
write articles based on assumptions?

370
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,880
People got fired
for doing that 20 years ago.

371
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,200
Be careful.

372
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,680
Going backward is trendy nowadays.

373
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,160
(Department of Chinese Literature)

374
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,480
Can I help you?

375
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,880
Ko Mi-ran.

376
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,200
It's me.

377
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,360
Your first love.

378
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,560
Hwang Byung-sim.

379
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,640
I couldn't believe it
when I first saw you.

380
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,760
You haven't changed since 20 years ago.

381
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,640
You participated in that absurd experiment

382
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,200
because of me.

383
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,440
What are you talking about?

384
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,360
Cut the nonsense.

385
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,000
I hope we never run into each other again.

386
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,840
No wonder that psychology class
was so boring.

387
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,200
You're a professor?

388
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,040
I feel bad for your students.

389
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,920
Mi-ran, I never once forgot about you.

390
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,840
Why would you? Who do you think you are?

391
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,240
Why would you not forget about me?

392
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
You're still so hardheaded.

393
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,840
Mi-ran.

394
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,200
Let's go back to 20 years ago.

395
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,520
-What?
-Let's go back

396
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,600
and make up for the time we lost.

397
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,760
Let's make our love come true.

398
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,400
Byung-sim.

399
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,040
You haven't changed a bit.

400
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,560
Are you crazy?

401
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,720
No.

402
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,560
I'm being very rational right now.

403
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,800
You know that I don't drink or smoke.

404
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,080
I'm not emotional either.

405
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,400
Aren't you married?

406
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,600
Yes, I am.

407
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,560
But I'm going to get a divorce

408
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,800
now that you're here.

409
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,440
Mi-ran, let's...

410
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,960
Get lost before I kill you.

411
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,280
Mi-ran.

412
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,160
Hey! Hey!

413
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,800
Hey! My gosh!

414
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,560
What do you have against me?

415
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,440
It's been 20 years already.

416
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,760
Why are you messing with
my life by showing up again?

417
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,800
Why aren't you coming?

418
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,720
Where? The police station?

419
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,200
-44 years old?
-My gosh, she's 44 years old.

420
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,200
Are you serious?

421
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,080
Don't punish her.

422
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,120
I don't want to press charges against her.

423
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,800
How do you guys know each other?

424
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,280
Don't say that I'm your old lover.

425
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,960
Our love still exists in the future.

426
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,800
If I'm going to get punished for assault,

427
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,440
let me beat him up a bit more.

428
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,720
Auntie!

429
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,920
You can't beat someone up
at a police station.

430
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,880
Don't call me that!

431
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,000
Madam, please calm down and take a seat.

432
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,760
You can't beat those who

433
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,840
don't have the ability
to defend themselves.

434
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,440
You're here because we received a report.

435
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,640
But we'll send you home

436
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,560
sine he doesn't want to press charges.

437
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,360
Please sign this.

438
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,080
Mi-ran.

439
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,280
If you were a guy,

440
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
you would've ended up
in jail at least once.

441
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,120
That wouldn't happen.
I don't like getting locked up.

442
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,440
Do prisoners get locked up
because they like it?

443
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,040
They end up in jail because

444
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,920
they can't control themselves like you.

445
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,600
My goodness.

446
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,000
How could you beat up a professor
out of anger?

447
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,360
He's a lot older than you.

448
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,560
No, he's not. We're the same age. He's 44.

449
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,160
Quit playing with your age too.

450
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,640
Stop changing your age
to benefit yourself.

451
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,760
You're 24 sometimes.

452
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,000
But 44 in other cases.

453
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,480
Stop it. It'll become a habit.

454
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,400
It's bad for your health

455
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,560
to be so temperamental.

456
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,160
Your temperature will rise
and you'll get hospitalized.

457
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,400
I don't care if a woman isn't pretty,
eats a lot

458
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,400
and doesn't know the multiplication table.

459
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,280
I don't care if her hair is unwashed.

460
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,440
But I hate it when a woman swears

461
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,080
and beats up others.

462
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,120
So

463
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,440
please stop doing that.

464
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
Whatever.

465
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,680
Why did you hit him?

466
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,760
Answer my question.

467
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,640
This isn't your first time.

468
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,240
Is it your hobby?

469
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,640
It's the same guy.

470
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,280
-What?
-He's my ex-boyfriend.

471
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,080
He's such a jerk.

472
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,440
He kept hitting on me.

473
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,480
He wants to make up for our lost time.

474
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,880
My gosh, it was so gross.

475
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,760
If I had anything sharp,

476
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,440
I would've stabbed him.

477
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,720
Hey, you did the right thing.

478
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,680
You should've told me. Good job.

479
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,360
He deserves a good beating.

480
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,680
Good job.

481
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,640
You should've beaten him to a pulp.

482
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,320
What a complete jerk.

483
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,760
Where is that punk?

484
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,120
I need to increase my hemoglobin levels.

485
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,560
(I agree to the above statements.)

486
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,680
The cryogenic man?

487
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
Why are you messing with Mi-ran?

488
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,800
Before we talk about that,

489
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,560
why did you freeze my girlfriend?

490
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,600
My life got ruined because of you.

491
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,840
My gosh, I can't believe this jerk.

492
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,080
"Jerk"?

493
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,040
How dare you talk down to me?

494
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,760
My gosh.

495
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,280
I'm 52 years old!

496
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,240
You can't decide on that!

497
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,280
You weren't alive for the past 20 years!

498
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,720
You are unbelievable.

499
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,040
-Hey.
-What?

500
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,520
Look.

501
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,920
Do you see that?

502
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,840
When did you enter college?

503
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,600
-In 1996, you jerk.
-I entered in 1987, you punk!

504
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,200
On top of that,
I graduated from your university.

505
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,880
Who do you think you are
as a little junior?

506
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,440
I ate a lot more than you!

507
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,840
Well, good for you.

508
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,680
You should start acting your age.

509
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,840
Hey, you're faking your age.

510
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,560
That little jerk.

511
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,120
Hey, let me warn you.

512
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,520
If you mess with Mi-ran one more time,

513
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,280
I'll kill you.

514
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,000
What gives you the right to do that?

515
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,640
Because I'm partly responsible

516
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,160
for her life.

517
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
You're not only responsible for her life.

518
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,280
You're responsible for my life as well.

519
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,120
-Are you kidding me?
-Stop it.

520
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,760
Why should I?

521
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,920
My life turned into a mess

522
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,440
after Mi-ran disappeared suddenly!

523
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,200
What a complete lunatic.

524
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,000
-My gosh.
-Hey, you little...

525
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,960
-Let go, you jerk.
-Will you guys stop?

526
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,960
-No, I won't let go!
-You jerk.

527
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,840
Two civilians are fighting
at a police station.

528
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,800
And you're all just going to watch?

529
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,680
Will you please stop them?

530
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,000
Get over here!

531
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,080
-My gosh, stop it.
-You little jerk!

532
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,120
-Let me go!
-That's enough.

533
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,800
-My gosh.
-Stop it.

534
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,120
-Stop it!
-Let me go!

535
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,760
Come here!

536
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,120
-Stop!
-My gosh.

537
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,080
I'll teach you a lesson.

538
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,720
Let me go.

539
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,080
Darn it.

540
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,960
Listen. Stay away from her.

541
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,280
Don't make her blood boil.

542
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,680
Who are you to order me around

543
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,600
when you're still wet behind the ears?

544
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,040
Hwang Byung-sim! Shut it.

545
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,080
And you too.

546
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,160
I'll take care of my problems.

547
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,880
Let's go and eat. I'm hungry.

548
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,640
I got angry over something unnecessary.

549
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,760
Gosh, my blood almost boiled.

550
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
You!

551
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,400
Is he the cryogenic man?

552
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,240
You're right. He was on the news.

553
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,040
That little punk.

554
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
Hey.

555
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,800
(Korean Style Restaurant Jinsagalbi)

556
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,440
We've arrived, sir.

557
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,360
Let's just have a meal for today.

558
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,280
Dolphin? Where is it?

559
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,520
I'm sorry.

560
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
Are you all right?

561
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,200
-Excuse me.
-I'm fine.

562
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,760
He's the cryogenic man.

563
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,960
-He was on TV.
-You're right.

564
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,680
Isn't that him?

565
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,360
-Gosh. You're right.
-It's him.

566
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,240
-How fascinating.
-I told you.

567
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,160
After this, let's go back to the station

568
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,680
and plan out our program.

569
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,480
I'm not done with my proposals.

570
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,760
This is separate.

571
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,680
Do you think they'll approve
your proposals?

572
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
What do you mean?

573
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,000
I'm preparing something big. Just wait.

574
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Fine. I hope you do.

575
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,080
If that jerk bothers you again,

576
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,520
let me know immediately.

577
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,840
Forget it. I'll take care of it myself.

578
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,600
And stop smiling in front of men.

579
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,360
Don't do anything cute.

580
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,840
What do you mean?

581
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,720
Are you saying that I have a cute smile?

582
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,280
No, but that jerk might think so.

583
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,440
You don't get it.

584
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,800
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

585
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,000
Hey.

586
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,160
Hi, sir.

587
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,320
Look at that. It's so pretty.

588
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,520
Can I take a photo and put it on my blog?

589
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,840
-Okay.
-It looks so pretty.

590
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,960
Try it.

591
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,360
-It's good.
-Is it?

592
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,960
It's so crowded here.

593
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,560
They say the lucky ones make money.

594
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,679
You'll be able to buy this building soon.

595
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,679
Forget it. I'm jealous of Mi-ran.

596
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,719
She's 44 but looks 24.

597
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,600
Hey, be careful what you say.

598
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,960
No one can know about that.

599
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,120
Got it.

600
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,400
She should've told us about
that great experiment

601
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,480
instead of doing it alone.

602
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,280
I know, right? I would've done it.

603
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,040
Are they not doing it anymore?

604
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,240
I want to snuggle with Brad Pitt

605
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,760
in a single capsule.

606
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
I'd freeze myself

607
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,120
the day before I met Byung-sim

608
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,960
and wake up 20 years later.

609
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,160
You wouldn't have met
your handsome son, Ji-hun.

610
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,600
Oh, my. Talk of the devil.

611
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,880
(My handsome son, Ji-hun)

612
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,240
"Speak of the devil". You're so ignorant.

613
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,800
-Fine.
-What should I do with her?

614
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,560
My son.

615
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
What?

616
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,120
Dad was assaulted by
a female student at school?

617
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,280
-What?
-How bad are his injuries?

618
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,960
Who and why did she do that?

619
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,160
Okay. All right. Let's hang up for now.

620
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,240
What's wrong?

621
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,800
I'm so humiliated.

622
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,760
He's giving me a headache.

623
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,200
How could someone be such a nitwit?

624
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,120
Did he not tell you who it was?

625
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,360
He said he couldn't.

626
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,280
But he claims that neither he nor her

627
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,000
did anything wrong.

628
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,600
What does that even mean?

629
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,000
He's always blabbering like this.

630
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,400
He makes absolutely no sense.

631
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,400
You're right.
He says whatever is on his mind.

632
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,560
Don't get mad. It'll make you hotter.

633
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,040
Call Mi-ran. We're almost at the station.

634
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,360
Okay.

635
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,560
(New Variety Show Proposal)

636
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Director...

637
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,480
Hey, Young-sun.

638
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,600
You're here?

639
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
Okay.

640
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Hey, Mi-ran...

641
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,120
What?

642
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,960
(I'm clocking out early.
My beautiful friends are here.)

643
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,560
(I'm clocking out early.)

644
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,320
(My beautiful friends are here.)

645
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,960
There's a limit to
how much I can tolerate.

646
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,280
Do you know what's even more ridiculous?

647
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,360
Do you know what that jerk said?

648
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,200
He wants to be with me again.

649
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,120
So I gave him a good beating.

650
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,560
Why do you think he changed his name?

651
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,520
His face looks slightly different too.

652
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,360
I can't tell if he fixed his face

653
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,320
or if he was beaten up by someone.

654
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,480
Gosh!

655
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,720
Aren't you guys shocked too?

656
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,760
-Right.
-Yes, I guess.

657
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,680
I don't know who his wife is,

658
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,800
but I feel terrible for her.

659
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,200
Let me go to the bathroom.

660
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,840
-Mi-ran.
-Yes?

661
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,520
Byung-sim

662
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,520
got married to Young-sun.

663
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,560
Young-sun? Who is that?

664
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,200
Do you know her?

665
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
What?

666
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,720
Did they get married?

667
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,480
That's unbelievable.

668
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,040
I asked you to peel spring onions

669
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,960
since you're incapable.

670
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,760
Why aren't you working?

671
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,480
Don't tell me this is difficult.

672
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,960
I'm sorry.

673
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,560
Then hurry up and regain your memory.

674
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,280
If you can cure my son's side effects,

675
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,320
I will forgive you.

676
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,840
I will try harder.

677
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,080
-Hello, my son.
-Hello.

678
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
Professor.

679
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,080
I requested the police to protect you.

680
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,920
But you must still be careful.

681
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,920
The private police will escort you
from now on.

682
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
I think

683
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,960
I did something dangerous

684
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,360
in the past.

685
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,640
Maybe I did something I shouldn't have.

686
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,280
Today,

687
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,000
I bled a bit.

688
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,200
My bones hurt and so does my heart.

689
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,080
I'm feeling weak.

690
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,600
So...

691
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,760
Get out.

692
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,200
-What?
-Leave and live with Freud.

693
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,040
You're only harming...

694
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,920
Should I burn your clothes and books?

695
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,760
Do you want to leave this place naked?

696
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,320
If you don't want your name
on the school bulletin board,

697
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,960
get out!

698
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,000
You're lit now, Uncle.

699
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,240
What do you mean?

700
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,000
He's the opposite of a loser.

701
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,560
It means he's popular.

702
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,000
Did you read all the books
I told you to read?

703
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,960
Which ones?

704
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,160
Was it "The Three Little Ribs"?

705
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,080
I'm sorry.

706
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,800
It's because of the business we're in.

707
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,480
I hope you can understand.

708
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,120
Stop talking and just eat.

709
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,600
What about "Snow White"?

710
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,240
We shouldn't read about princesses.

711
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,520
Snow White, Ariel,
Thumbelina, and Cinderella

712
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,240
all have problems.

713
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,600
People nowadays don't think that meeting

714
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,240
a good man can change their lives.

715
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,520
We don't need princes on white horses.

716
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,760
It's time for stories about
white horses riding princes.

717
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,320
She has no childlike innocence.

718
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,800
I tried to revive it, but it didn't work.

719
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,120
Just eat.

720
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,040
What did you learn from
"The Three Little Pigs"?

721
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,200
Being the landlord is the best.

722
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,160
They go through troubles
because they don't have a house.

723
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,720
The clock struck 12.

724
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,400
Cinderella was rushing home

725
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,920
and her shoe fell off.

726
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,880
The glass shoe shattered.

727
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,520
That's how Cinderella hurt her foot.

728
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,160
Blood gushed out

729
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,160
like this.

730
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,040
It was bad.

731
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,840
That's why the KCSI came to the scene

732
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,200
to catch the criminal.

733
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,680
Cinderella was sent behind bars.

734
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,920
No, they tested the blood

735
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,640
and Cinderella turned out to be
the prince's sister.

736
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,760
What? Does that mean

737
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,520
Cinderella's mom had an affair?
That's crazy.

738
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,600
She got married to a good family.

739
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Hello?

740
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,400
Hey, Ma Dong-chan!

741
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,560
How much longer
do I have to be your lackey?

742
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,160
Until when?

743
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,600
You're here.

744
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,160
Yes, I am.

745
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,600
Do you want a drink?

746
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,000
Don't you know that I'm not allowed?

747
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,640
I didn't know.
What are you going to do about it?

748
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,560
Can I treat you

749
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,040
like you're younger than me for today?

750
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,920
If you think about it,

751
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,320
I lived more years than you.

752
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,720
One ice water, please.

753
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,160
Okay.

754
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,560
Once you become my age...

755
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,000
How should I explain this?

756
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,840
Your life will feel futile.

757
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,160
I don't know what I'm living for anymore.

758
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,760
I aged without having
accomplished anything.

759
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,680
But I don't intend on dying either.

760
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,120
Because...

761
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,720
It's embarrassing to die
without having done anything.

762
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,800
People will point fingers at me
when I die.

763
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,440
When I look back at my past,

764
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,520
my future feels even darker.

765
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,160
This body will rot after I die anyway.

766
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,920
So I choose to live recklessly.

767
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:48,000
That's my conclusion.

768
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,120
-Stop drinking.
-Stop it.

769
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,840
Don't.

770
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,840
You don't understand, right?

771
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,560
You'll understand later on.

772
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,280
You won't understand just yet

773
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,080
because you're too young.

774
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,280
Is there a pretty, curvy,

775
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,440
and benevolent woman anywhere?

776
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,840
-That's all I think about.
-This is Son Deok-hee

777
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,280
of "99 Minute Debate".

778
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,840
The world's first cryogenic man

779
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,080
appeared in South Korea.

780
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,640
(How old is the cryogenic man?)

781
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,920
(Captain Korea)

782
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,560
This is the latest trending issue.

783
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,280
Captain Korea.

784
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,160
It's a picture that proves how popular

785
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,200
the cryogenic man is these days.

786
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,080
What is "Captain Korea" anyway?

787
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,560
You're the fake Captain America,

788
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,160
the American cryogenic man.

789
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,800
Had I been frozen with you then,

790
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
I'd be Captain Korea's friend, Bucky.

791
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,480
The topic of today's debate

792
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,240
is on the cryogenic man's age.

793
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,520
Is he 52 years old according
to legal documents

794
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,920
or is he 32 years old according to
his physical appearance?

795
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,560
We'll now start our heated debate.

796
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,120
Stay tuned.

797
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,720
Descartes once said,

798
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,840
"I think, therefore I am".

799
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,040
He did not exist during

800
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,640
(Philosopher Kang Ok-bong)

801
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,440
the years he spent without thinking.
(Philosopher Kang Ok-bong)

802
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:11,520
(Philosopher Kang Ok-bong)

803
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,000
It won't make sense to count his years
in the capsule
(Philosopher Kang Ok-bong)

804
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,920
It won't make sense to count his years
in the capsule

805
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,640
when he was incapable of thinking.

806
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,360
The significance must be
put on his survival.

807
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,040
Being able to breathe means
that he was alive.

808
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,440
(Humanist Author Yu Ji-min)
Being able to breathe means
that he was alive.

809
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,360
(Humanist Author Yu Ji-min)

810
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,240
The fact that he was alive all along

811
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,200
allows us to count his years.

812
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,480
Being frozen doesn't mean
that he was dead.

813
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,240
We must count those years.

814
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,560
Everyone. Here's an example.

815
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,480
A ten-year-old in a cryonic capsule

816
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,000
wakes up 20 years later.

817
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,520
Will this child be 10 or 30 years old?

818
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,440
He's still ten years old.

819
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,400
He can only think like a ten-year-old.

820
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,280
How can he be ten years old?

821
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,960
All of his friends would be 30.

822
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,560
Should he cut off all
of his relationships?

823
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,760
Friends? What friends?

824
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,920
They won't be able to communicate.

825
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,600
Age doesn't matter between friends.

826
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,840
-Gosh.
-You don't have friends, right?

827
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,720
Darn.

828
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,000
-"Darn"?
-Excuse me, Ms. Kang.

829
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,200
Please refrain from slandering others.

830
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,360
Age shouldn't be accumulated through time.

831
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,320
Physical age matters to animals.

832
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,160
Aging must be visible physically.

833
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,200
The passage of time doesn't matter.

834
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,720
That's why that man

835
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,800
is 32 years old.

836
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,760
Yes! You're 32.

837
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,240
Cable television debates on such matters?

838
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,440
Now, we must define what age is.

839
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,000
-General MacArthur said this.
-Come on.

840
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,280
"You are as young"

841
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,800
"as your faith."

842
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,120
Just because you've aged

843
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,600
doesn't necessarily mean you're an adult.

844
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,640
Are you saying that we must ignore
the age of elderlies

845
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,720
if they do not have faith?

846
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,400
No, right?

847
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,640
Then...

848
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,080
Should we treat those
who are immature as adults?

849
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,560
Ms. Kang Ok-boon,
please watch your vocabulary.

850
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,320
It's not Ok-boon!

851
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,280
It's Ok-bong.

852
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,960
Ms. Kang,

853
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,440
you're being too harsh.

854
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,760
How are you so immature?

855
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,320
Hey! How old are you?

856
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,680
Okay. It seems like our panelists

857
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,840
are getting overly passionate.

858
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,640
Let's try talking to our viewers
over the phone.

859
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,040
Hello?

860
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,000
Hello.

861
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,280
Yes. What's your name and
where do you live?

862
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,640
I'm Oh Maria from Haengdang-dong.

863
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,120
I see. Ms. Oh Maria.

864
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,000
Why does the age
of the cryogenic man matter?

865
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,320
The state should support him.

866
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,720
To be frank, he doesn't get
any insurance benefits

867
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,760
nor are there any related medical laws.

868
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,480
This is an urgent matter.

869
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,640
Wait, doesn't she sound like Mi-ran?

870
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,760
What?

871
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,240
I called because it was frustrating

872
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,960
to watch you fight over his age.

873
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,760
Think about it. If that 52-year-old man

874
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,720
goes to a marriage consulting agency,

875
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,480
he'd be categorized as remarrying.

876
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,000
How can he get married then!

877
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,240
How upsetting would that be?

878
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,360
Shouldn't the government
compensate for that?

879
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,840
I think we should be in a rush to
pass a bill for cryogenics.

880
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,640
She's right. What a smart woman.

881
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,600
It'd be nice if Dong-chan
was given a pension.

882
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,880
It's not like he's an Olympic medalist.

883
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,240
Why would he get a pension?
We pay taxes for that.

884
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,920
Don't assume that everyone
deserves a pension

885
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,160
when you don't even pay taxes.

886
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,160
You cold-hearted punk.

887
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,160
Why would you be against
Dong-chan getting a pension?

888
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,760
My gosh, be quiet!

889
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,640
That's a good point.

890
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,680
But it's hard to acknowledge
that he was alive.

891
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,520
His organs were frozen all along.

892
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,000
He wasn't even breathing.

893
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,440
You can't call that a living organism.

894
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,440
It's him.

895
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,320
Everyone has their fate

896
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,400
based on the time and date of birth...

897
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,000
He isn't the cryogenic man.

898
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,440
He just looks similar.

899
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,360
It's not him.

900
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,080
He does look similar.

901
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,480
It's not him. Where are you going?

902
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,960
No, it's not him. You're mistaken.

903
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,840
Hello?

904
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,360
Are you trying to reveal that
you participated in the experiment?

905
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,280
What did I do?

906
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,720
Oh Maria? That was you.

907
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,080
How did you know?

908
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,320
I stuffed some dried squid
to change my voice.

909
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,760
Please think before you act.

910
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,280
No one can find out that you participated.

911
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,320
I told you that it'll put you in danger.

912
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,560
People around me already know.

913
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,280
I can't hide it forever.

914
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,600
But it's different when
the whole world finds out.

915
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,720
Okay, fine. Stop nagging.

916
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,720
Also, why do you care about my marriage?

917
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,200
What do you mean? It's my problem too.

918
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,040
I might have to go on a blind date
with a divorced man at this rate.

919
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,680
Forget it. There's no point in this.

920
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,480
-Let's hang up.
-Hey.

921
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,640
Are you feeling okay?

922
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,920
Just make sure you stay healthy.

923
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,360
Call me if anything happens, okay?

924
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,120
Okay.

925
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,800
She's such a psycho.

926
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,080
He's such an old geezer.

927
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,880
Gosh, you startled me.

928
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,000
Byung-sim, what brings you here?

929
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,600
I'd like to stay at yours for an hour
and thaw out.

930
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,120
It's so hot outside.
Why do you need to thaw out?

931
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,600
Because my heart is freezing.

932
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,080
My gosh.

933
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,640
My goodness, Byung-sim.

934
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,960
Kyung-ja.

935
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,000
You're my friend, right?

936
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,360
I'm not your friend.
I'm Young-sun's friend.

937
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,760
-Kyung-ja.
-Stop calling my name.

938
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,920
I hate hearing my name. It's so tacky.

939
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,600
-Kyung-ja.
-You jerk. I told you to stop.

940
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,800
Do you like it when
I keep calling your name?

941
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,040
Can you help me get back
with Mi-ran again?

942
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,760
-What?
-I...

943
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,000
I love her.

944
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,480
Are you crazy? What about Young-sun?

945
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,960
I'm not worried about her.

946
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,360
Her dad's loaded.

947
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,280
You already know that
we don't love each other.

948
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,520
-Do you think she will take you back?
-It'll take some time.

949
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,400
But she'll eventually take me back.

950
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,600
I get why Mi-ran is angry.

951
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,720
It's because she's frustrated.

952
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,840
She still feels betrayed by me.

953
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,320
She

954
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,960
still loves me.

955
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,640
I'll just cope with everything.

956
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,560
I'll be understanding.

957
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,320
How did Young-sun live
with you for 20 years

958
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,840
without killing you.

959
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,520
Hey, I've been cherishing that bottle!

960
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,840
-Hello.
-Hello.

961
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,600
Chief.

962
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,680
Someone leaked the fact

963
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,800
that there was another subject
in the experiment.

964
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,040
We should cover this first.

965
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,760
If we don't do it,

966
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,720
other channels will.

967
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,040
Then we'll come up with an article

968
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,360
that will rebut their assertion.

969
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,760
Have you ever thought
about why Director Ma

970
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,640
is protecting that person?

971
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,720
Some things shouldn't be broadcasted.

972
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,960
The News Bureau should know
how to differentiate them.

973
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,560
We can't cover this news.

974
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,600
Okay.

975
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,920
You should tell that woman to be careful.

976
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,960
You should reconsider working with her

977
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,760
in the same Department.

978
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,360
I heard the news.

979
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,960
Thank you.
I'm sure it wasn't an easy decision.

980
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,920
What's that supposed to mean?

981
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,080
What?

982
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,760
That ring.

983
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,440
Let's start over again.

984
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,600
Our love

985
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,080
hasn't ended yet.

986
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,600
Director Ma.

987
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,000
(Melting Me Softly)

988
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,280
At least he had a girlfriend from before.

989
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,360
What about me?

990
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,560
TBO variety shows are going to change

991
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,160
now that I'm back.

992
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,960

increasing suddenly?

993
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,120

I'll protect you and never
put you in danger again.

996
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,840
You've been in
a relationship before, right?

997
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,240
Or a fling?

998
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,240
Have you ever had a fling?

999
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,000
Help me protect everyone,
starting with Mi-ran first.
