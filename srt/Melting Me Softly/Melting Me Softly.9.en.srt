7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,080
Hey, stop acting up.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,680
Did you hear me? Don't act up.

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,560
If you keep acting up, I might just

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,800
start liking you.

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,280
What? What are you looking at?

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,720
What is it? Is there something behind me?

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,240
What? What are you staring at?

14
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,720
How dare you have the guts
to stare at your senior like that?

15
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,000
Follow me.

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,039
Gosh, it's so hot.

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,920
Are you going to keep standing there?

18
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,200
I'll just leave on my own.

19
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,560
Here you go.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,840
I was worried that
you might be allergic to strawberries,

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,320
chocolate, or kiwi.

22
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,920
So I just got you vanilla ice cream.

23
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,560
I'm not allergic to any of those. But...

24
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,560
But what?

25
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,840
But the only flavor
I don't like is vanilla.

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,280
You're unbelievable.

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,000
Then give it to me. I'll eat it.

28
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,040
You can give me yours.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,760
I can't give you what I already ate.
I'll just get you a new one.

30
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,920
You're eating what I already ate.

31
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Here.

32
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,760
Are you sober now?

33
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Yes.

34
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,520
Let's get to work. We have a lot to do.

35
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,840
If you drink during working hours
one more time, I'm going to fire you.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,360
-Okay.
-You'd better keep your word.

37
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,640
I have a question.

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,400
It's about the bureau chief.

39
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:23,560
Well, from what I know,

40
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,040
you guys used to date

41
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,400
before you participated
in the cryonics experiment.

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,520
Are you guys

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,640
still dating?

44
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
If you ask me that right now,

45
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,760
wouldn't that affect
our current relationship?

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,600
Is that why you're asking me?
I hope that's not why.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,240
I'm only asking because I'm curious.

48
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,000
She and I are not dating.

49
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,160
Don't smile.

50
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't say or do anything

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,360
that might affect our relationship.

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,560
Why not?

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,960
Do you really not know why?

54
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,520
No, I don't.

55
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,680
We can't get any closer to each other.

56
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,160
If any one of us approaches
the other person like this...

57
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Yes, that's right.

58
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
The other person should take
a step back and maintain a distance.

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,240
We should at least stay 50cm,
so 0.5m away from each other.

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,000
If we get any closer,

61
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,840
it'll be dangerous for us.

62
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,400
Why does it have to be 0.5m?

63
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,720
(Episode 9:
Between the Cold and the Passion)

64
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,800
I guess you've finally decided to do it.

65
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,400
Yes, that's what I decided.

66
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,480
You and I both knew
it was going to happen one day.

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,520
I'm guessing you're here because
you want me to do something for you.

68
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,360
I need the full support
of the News Bureau.

69
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,880
First, let's start off by
announcing that I was the person

70
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,040
who was in charge of planning
the cryonics experiment.

71
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,400
You worked so hard to keep this project
a secret 20 years ago,

72
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,120
but now you want to announce that
you were the one in charge?

73
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,200
The situation has changed.
Things are different now.

74
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,560
Populism.

75
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,000
My party wants me to use that stance

76
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,480
to appeal to the people of this country.

77
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,400
I didn't come up with the idea.

78
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,920
There are

79
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,120
more writers and directors in politics
than in a broadcasting station.

80
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,240
You need to plan everything out
and be strategic.

81
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,680
Do you know why I transferred
to the News Bureau?

82
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,480
Do you remember why I,

83
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,200
a mediocre announcer
who got criticized for her grammar,

84
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,240
volunteered to become a reporter?

85
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,720
It was to find Ma Dong-chan
and do a cover on his disappearance.

86
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,920
That's why I became a reporter.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,720
I had to take a test to become a reporter,
and I did that behind your back--

88
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,920
That's what I did.

89
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,000
And that's how you became

90
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,240
the Chief of the News Bureau.

91
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,320
I couldn't cover anything
whenever that happened.

92
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
Because a huge mountain stopped
the huge storm from the front

93
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,040
and the light breeze from the back.

94
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,000
You were such a huge mountain.

95
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,560
Are you sure you can pretend
that you were never such a big mountain?

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,480
You wanted to cover up Ma Dong-chan's
disappearance so badly,

97
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,000
but do you think that nobody would
care about it now?

98
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,680
That big mountain

99
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,640
is still... No,

100
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,720
it's even bigger now.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,640
I'm still a mountain that can stop

102
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,280
storms and breezes.

103
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,159
The world has changed, sir.

104
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,680
That's why I'm stepping down
at the perfect timing.

105
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,280
I'm telling you to become
an even bigger mountain.

106
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,920
It's only natural for the chief of news
to become the president.

107

(Chief of News Bureau, Na Ha-young)

108
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll cover all the storms and breezes
for you.

109
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,600
Then you can bring about

110
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,960
a new wind with your title
as the first female president

111
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,040
of a TV network.

112
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,800
President Na Ha-young.

113
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,040
Sounds nice.

114
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,600
(Audition Application)

115
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,920
Gosh, it'll take forever for the writers

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,920
to go through the applications.

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,320
Gosh, everyone's attention
is on this program

118
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,920
because it's Mr. Ma's show.

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,080
Anyway, why haven't
I seen that assistant director

120
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,760
who's apparently an intern?

121
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,720
Where is she?

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,920
Do you want to see the applicants?

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,400
Sure. Let me see.

124
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,320
Take this.

125
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,240
This is really cool.

126
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,480
The applicants look great, don't they?

127
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,960
Right.

128
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,200
Do you know who our final boss is?

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,880
-The president?
-It's this.

130
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,400
This cell phone.

131
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
I want to make a program where you
make people live

132
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,600
without their phones for a week

133
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,520
because people these days are all
addicted to them.

134
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,000
And do you know how feeble
people's relationships are?

135
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,560
Most relationships would end

136
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,480
if you took away their phones
and turned off their computers.

137
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,360
And people are also
getting stupider every day.

138
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,040
At this rate, in 100 years,

139
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,679
they'll turn back into homo erectus.

140
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,600
You're right. Come to think of it,

141
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,480
I didn't even memorize
my brother's number.

142
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,640
Right. Ko Nam-tae, 010-349-1974.

143
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,800
Don't think that our relationship
is moving forward with this.

144
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,160
I just memorized
your entire family's numbers

145
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,480
just in case I can't get a hold of you.

146
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,440
I can memorize any set of numbers
once I see them.

147
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,120
I'm sure it's a wonder to you,

148
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,080
but to me, it's just an everyday thing.

149
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,120
Oh, look.

Park Woong-soo, 010-102-8771.

151
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,800
Do you think I memorized his number
because I'm interested in him?

152
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,800
It's all because I'm smart.

153
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,400
Is he overreacting or putting up a wall?

154
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,680
Or is he hitting on me?

(Internship Application)

156
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,160
These are the applicants who made it
through three screenings.

157
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,480
Let's put two in each team.

158

This is an opportunity
to save the Variety Department.

159

We're getting a hold of

future talents in advance.

161
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,720
But all of those interns said
they want to work

162

with Director Ma Dong-chan.

163
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,200
It's because they never worked with him.

164
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,800
You have no idea how much he harasses you.
My gosh!

165
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Did you turn in the budget?

166
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,680
I was about to.

167
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,880
Is that so?

168
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,680
Why don't you do it in a month?

169
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,640
I told you to do it ages ago.

170
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,840
Okay.

171
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,080
-Hyun-gi.
-Yes?

172
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,560
Yes, what?

173
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,240
How long will you stay here?

174
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,520
You need to move your office next to mine.

175
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,880
Move out.

176
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,880
"Move out"?

177
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,600
I've never even been told that
by my landlords.

178
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,200
What is this?

179
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,440
He's so unpredictable,
playing with my heart.

180
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,920
"I might just start liking you."

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,480
But then what was that about the 0.5m?

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,880
My gosh.

183
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,840
I won't let him walk all over me.

184
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,480
Make sure you don't get caught.

185
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,240
No one else should find out

186
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,640
what your story is, right?

187
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,640
I don't want Dong-chan

188
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,600
to get into trouble.

189
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,640
The intern must have amazing connections.

190
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
All she did was text me, the main writer,

191
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,200
and she never came by to greet me.

192
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,440
Where has she been all day?

193
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,080
I need to speak with you.

194
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,240
Did you say hi to the writer?

195
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,200
I sent her a text message.

196
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,720
I thought it would be rude
to call her immediately.

197
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,680
She doesn't think so.

198
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,880
She doesn't think texting
is a way of communicating.

199
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,200
She only acknowledges
in-person conversations.

200
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,520
You got on her bad side.

201
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
What should I do?

202
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,720
What do you think? You'll be bullied.

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,920
She looks mean, but she's even meaner.

204
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,520
I'm sure she has

205
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,120
some trouble with her autonomic nerves.

206
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,320
Even I get scared of her.

207
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,320
But why do you want to work
with a writer like her?

208
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,880
She writes great scripts,
gets good guests, and plans well.

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,080
I just need her to do her job.

210
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,480
It's not like I'm going to date her.

211
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
I'll try to get along with her.

212
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,320
I'm good at moving people's hearts.

213
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,160
I know that about you.

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,560
Oh, she's apparently a huge fan of BTS.

215
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,720
You better study about them.

216
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,480
If you stammer because
you don't know them,

217
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,960
you'll end up being sent somewhere

218
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,440
out in the universe
where I can't help you.

219
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,200
"Goodbye, Ko Mi-ran." Like this.

220
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,320
BTS?

221
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,160
Who is that?

222
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,760
Right. The way you said that
and the way you looked

223
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,640
will make her beat you.

224
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,800
We're working overtime tonight.

225
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,760
Kim Nam-joon, Kim Seok-jin,

226
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,040
Min Yoon-gi, Jung Ho-seok,

227
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,520
Park Ji-min,

228
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,320
Kim Tae-hyung, Jeon Jung-kook, BTS.

229
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,400
Other than those people in their 40s,

230
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,400
we need to get some celebrities here too.

231
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,840
Did you make a list of candidates?

232
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,080
I plan on sending out the proposal
to management agencies

233
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,040
and get the singers' schedules.

234
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,400
Let's get BTS here.

235
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,520
Kim Nam-joon, Kim Seok-jin, Min Yoon-gi,

236
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,880
Jung Ho-seok, Park Ji-min,
Kim Tae-hyung, Jeon Jung-kook.

237
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,160
Let's get all of them.

238
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,520
Are you kidding me, Intern?

239
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,200
I'm not joking.

240
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,200
I really love BTS too.

241
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,520
Should we get them?

242
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,520
BTS isn't in Korea right now.

243
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,760
But...

244
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,880
Mi-ran loves

245
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,240
this program a little too much.

246
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
I know BTS is a global star,

247
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,640
but we can try to get them.

248
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,800
Why are you all so shocked?

249
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,720
Well, because of our budget...
We can make a call.

250
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,320
-Yes.
-We can try.

251
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,520
It doesn't cost anything to make a call.

252
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,640
-Let's ask them.
-What's their number?

253
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,560
I'm sure their agency will pick up.

254
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,600
Are there any other celebrities?

255
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,480
Kwak Cheol-yong.

256
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,400
Kwak Cheol-yong? What's his name...

257
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,400
-I mean, give me the info.
-Yes, him.

258
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,560
Will you call them?

259
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,440
(Chairman Lee Seok-du of Unsung Group)

260
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,920
(Restricted Number)

261
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,080
Hello?

262
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,000
(Can we meet tonight?)

263
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,800
Yes, it's okay if it's late.
Let's meet up.

264
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,480
I'll wait.

265
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,280
(Yes, I'll call you again.)

266
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,480
Wait...

267
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,160
That style looks great.

268
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,920
It looks great.

269
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,480
And it's much shorter.

270
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,120
You have to take this.

271
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,920
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, great work.

272
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,040
Is it tasty?

273
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,040
Contact them and check their schedule.

274
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,200
-Okay.
-These are three points each.

275
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,280
No. No. No...

276
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,000
Gosh. Go home.

277
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,200
If you're just going to yawn
and rub your eyes,

278
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,600
just go home. Go home. Go home and do it.

279
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,120
Hurry up and leave.

280
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,320

281
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,720

(When you get home safely, text me.)

284
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,960
Why does he keep on going back and forth?

285
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,800
I thought he wanted to keep a distance.

286
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,560
Is something uncomfortable, ma'am?

287
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,240
No. I'm talking to myself.

288
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,119
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

289
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,520
Hello?

290
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,079
(I'll go to the station now.
It'll take me 30 minutes.)

291
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,640
I'll wait for you.
My office is on the seventh floor.

292
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,640
They're strict about security here,
so they'll try to stop you.

293
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,880
I'll let them know that you're coming.

294
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,520
(Like I mentioned earlier,)

295
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,360
(let me meet Director Ma Dong-chan too.)

296
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,800
I'll arrange it.

297
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,960
She's coming now.

298
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,520
The person who gave us a tip
about Professor Jo's car explosion.

299
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,840
He's Unsung Group's
Chairman Lee Yang-gon's illegitimate son.

300
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,640
(Chairman Lee Seok-du of Unsung Group)

301
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,760
After Lee Yang-gon
was diagnosed with lung cancer,
(Chairman Lee Seok-du of Unsung Group)

302
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,360
the company suffered because
they didn't have a successor.

303
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,640
At the time, the hierarchy in
the financial world changed

304
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
due to the construction of
the water system in Libya.

305
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,040
According to his family register,
Chairman Lee's wife didn't have a son.

306
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,640
That's why his illegitimate son,
Lee Seok-du was added to the register,

307
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,320
and he received training as the successor.

308
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,840
Is there no information about what
Lee Seok-du did before he turned 37?

309
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,120
It's on the next page.

and he was living an ordinary life
in the US.

314
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,680
It looks like his wife is still in the US.

They're pretty much separated.

316

In 1998, he was assaulted
by a group of people and fell into a coma.

After 5 months of hospitalization,
he woke up miraculously.

321
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,200
Everyone called it a miracle

322
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,640
because they thought he would
never wake up again.

323
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,160
1998...

324
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,720
1998...

325
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,320
After he narrowly escaped death,

326
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,160
he has been continuously donating large
sums to that hospital that saved his life.

327
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,960
This is as much as I can find out for you.

328
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,800
Now, you have to tell me
why you need this information.

329
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,960
In Professor Hwang's lab,

330
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,360
there's a man in a capsule,
and he resembles Lee Seok-du.

331
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,040
What?

332
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,760
No, he doesn't just resemble him.
They're identical.

333
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,480
His face, his build, everything.

334
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,200
No wonder you're a director
in the Variety Department.

335
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,400
There are so many people
who look alike in this world.

336
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Why

337
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,240
didn't you come that day?

338
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,040
I guess a hotel room

339
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,800
could make someone uncomfortable.

340
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,600
-I was just...
-I still see you as a woman,

341
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,440
but I have no intention
of starting over with you.

342
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,400
But you wanted to see me in a hotel room.

343
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,400
That's why

344
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,800
I couldn't go.

345
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,040
When a woman tells a man
her hotel room number,

346
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,320
do you have any idea

347
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,120
-what she would want from the man?
-That's why I didn't go.

348
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,920
Because I knew how you felt.

349
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,400
Because your feelings
don't align with mine.

350
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Here you go.

351
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,640
Did you finish moving all of your stuff?

352
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,880
Yes. I'm sorry I woke you up
at this late hour.

353
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,520
I apologize, Mother.

354
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,280
It's okay. I was waiting since
my daughter didn't come home yet.

355
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,520
What could she be doing

356
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,560
to keep her from coming home
until such a late hour?

357
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,240
Gosh.

358
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,320
How is a professor like you so outgoing,

359
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,000
fit, and kind?

360
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,400
Let's get along like a family, Mother.

361
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,600
Gosh. Are you home, Mi-ran? This is...

362
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,800
He disappeared so fast.

363
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,880
Where did he go?

364
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,400
If you keep acting up, I might just

365
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,920
start liking you.

366
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
(Just a moment.)

367
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,400
What are you trying to do? Hey, let go.

368
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,280
-Mr. Jung.
-Let go!

369
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,160
Why do you think she wants to see me?

370
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,840
She's someone who knows
who wants to kill Professor Jo.

371
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,480
She's someone who wants to meet with me.

372
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,920
Where do those two things meet?

373
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,240
Before that, I have a question.
Is Professor Hwang

374
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,880
really dead?

375
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,280
(Restricted number)

376
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,320
(Restricted number)

377
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,280
(Speaker)

378
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,760
-Hello?
(-Please save my husband.)

379
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,880
(The cryonic capsule--)

380
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,440
It's been a while, dear sister-in-law.

381
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,120
Since when did you start
getting along so well with Mr. Jung?

382
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,080
What were you planning to do
at the broadcasting station?

383
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,720
(You won't be able to find the
remains of Mr. Jung.)

384
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,800
Do they call such a thing a useless death?

385
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,280
By the way, why do you think

386
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,840
I kept you alive?

387
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,840
Where is Lee Seok-du?

388
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,240
I don't know either.

389
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,480
That's impossible.

390
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,560
I was going to the station
to find that out.

391
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,360
I was going to ask that director.

392
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,240
Please let my husband come back alive.

393
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,320
We'll live quietly like dead people.

394
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,040
Please help him out
of the cryonic capsule.

395
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,920
You

396
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,320
should've never let me
taste money and power.

397
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,080
Chairman Lee Yang-gon should've never

398
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,720
made Lee Seok-du his successor!

399
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,400
If Lee Seok-du comes back alive,

400
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,160
then where will I go?

401
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,440
You can just

402
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,920
continue to live

403
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,760
as Lee Seok-du.

404
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,560
I'll let you do that.

405
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,840
If that's what you had in mind,
you should've come to me.

406
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,720
Why did you go to
the broadcasting station?

407
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,480
Whoever tries to wake Lee Seok-du up

408
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,320
will end up getting killed

409
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,360
regardless of whom that may be.

410
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,120
Listen to me carefully.

411
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm Lee Seok-du, not Lee Hyeong-du.

412
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,000
I will kill anyone that tries

413
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,520
to cause confusion about that.

414
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,600
I think I should call the cops.

415
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,840
No.

416
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,840
Not yet.

417
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,560
Don't agonize over it too much.

418
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,400
In the end, this is my problem.

419
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,320
This is just a scoop to you.

420
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,000
Do you think I'm being like this
because I lost a scoop?

421
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,400
It's because I'm worried about you.

422
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,160
I'm worried you might be in danger
and suddenly disappear again.

423
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,600
That's what I'm worried about.

424
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,920
It's late. You should go home.

425
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,640
I didn't bring my car.

426
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,680
Okay, I'll drive you home.

427
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,400
(Petition for Divorce)

428
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,120
I'll adjust to the temperature
that makes you feel comfortable.

429
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,640
I can do that for you.

430
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,040
Ha-young.

431
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,800
I'm sorry.

432
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,440
About what?

433
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,560
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you

434
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,040
for the past 20 years.

435
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,280
To me, those 20 years felt like a day,

436
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,880
but I guess it's really been that long.

437
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,760
I can't do anything to compensate

438
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,960
for the past 20 years
you spent all by yourself.

439
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,280
We already

440
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,360
missed our chance.

441
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,120
When I look at you,

442
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,520
my heart

443
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,960
no longer flutters.

444
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,080
I don't love you.

445
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,920
I think this is the end for us.

446
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,960
Are you ending things between us

447
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,000
because your heart now belongs

448
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,360
to someone else?

449
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,080
Let's see. It's perfect.

450
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,800
My goodness!

451
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,480
Hello, Professor.

452
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,880
Who are you?

453
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,280
My name is Ko Nam-tae.

454
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,200
My goodness, Nam-tae.

455
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,600
You've grown so much.

456
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,000
Do you know me?

457
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,480
Of course, I know you.

458
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,040
You ruined my first kiss.

459
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,520
You darn punk.

460
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,560
Anyways, I'm glad to see you.

461
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,320
I hope we get along.

462
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,560
Who are you?

463
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,080
Well, I'm...

464
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,680
This professor right here lost his memory.

465
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,640
He's staying with us,
so he could retrieve it.

466
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,080
Hello?

467
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,160
Really? I got the job?

468
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,960
Thank you.

469
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,600
Yes. When do I start?

470
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,680
Then will I get to work
with Director Ma Dong-chan?

471
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,120
Okay.

472
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,000
Tomorrow afternoon?

473
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,160
I'll be there right after
I'm done with my classes.

474
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,080
Okay, thank you.

475
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,560
Are you on your way to school?

476
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,760
Yes.

477
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,120
(Petition for Divorce)

478
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,760
I'm okay.
(Petition for Divorce)

479
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,960
So you don't need to worry about me.

480
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,840
Are you really okay?

481
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,560
I'm fine.

482
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,760
I'm serious.

483
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,400
You're the one who told me

484
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,560
that it's better to be happy alone
than to stay in an unhappy marriage.

485
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,120
It's not something my kid should
be telling me, but...

486
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,960
I got the intern job
at the broadcasting station.

487
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,400
I'll only be working there
during the break,

488
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,320
but it'll help with my resume.

489
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,680
Ji-hoon.

490
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,440
How do you know Ko Mi-ran?

491
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,000
I happened to see the photo

492
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,240
in your cell phone.

493
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,040
How do you know my friend?

494
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,240
"Friend"?

495
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,360
Friend, my foot.

496
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,280
You should go to school.

497
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,159
There are steps to doing that.

498
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,520
When do you want me to finish this?

499
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,960
The sooner the better.

500
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,480
Then should I give it to you by lunch?

501
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,760
Yes, that'd be great.

502
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,199
That will help me out a lot.

503
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,080
-Hello.
-Hey.

504
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,280
I think we can tie this person
with the person I showed you earlier

505
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,639
as they have similar stories.

506
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,480
These two are a married couple.

507
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,719
I think they'll have a lot to talk about,
and they also immigrated.

508
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,760
So I think they'll have
a lot of stories to tell.

509
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,520
Let's call this person as well.

510
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,320
(If you have something to tell me,
you can write it here.)

511
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,360
-Let's do it today.
-Okay.

512
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,159
And make sure the list doesn't overlap.

513
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,639
This person has a lot of hobbies too.
Should I contact them?

514
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,719
Yes.

515
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,880
Don't they seem interesting?

516
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,360
I'll write them down and contact them.

517
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,640
(Meeting on Friday at 3 p.m.)

518
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,920
(Come to the editing room right now.)

519
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,600
Do you really want to be
a variety show director?

520
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,120
Yes.

521
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,160
I know I've started later than others,

522
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,440
but I'm serious,
and I want to do a good job.

523
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,560
Okay, in that case, let's turn
"Go Go 99" into a great program.

524
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,920
Okay.

525
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,720
You told me 20 years ago

526
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,320
that you just want to make a living.

527
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,320
And you also said,

528
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,600
"That's what I want too."

529
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,520
Did I?

530
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,240
It seems like that was just yesterday.

531
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,880
Mr. Ma, why do you work as
a variety show director?

532
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,760
Once we are born,

533
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,720
we have to do something to make
the world a better place.

534
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,920
I want people in this world
to laugh a lot more.

535
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,200
If people watch my program

536
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,600
and feel happier and laugh a bit more
today than they did yesterday,

537
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,600
what could be better than that?

538
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,680
I take pride
because I believe what I do is

539
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,360
greater than establishing
a country with guns and swords

540
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,840
or making a huge building with money.

541
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,560
You should aim to make people happier.

542
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,800
Achieving your dream starts
with "Go Go 99".

543
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,640
Make sure you do this right.

544
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,760
It'll be greater than
simply making a living.

545
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,160
I can never find him
when I actually need him.

546
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,160
How dare he take a day off
without telling me?

547
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,200
Professor Hwang isn't the problem.

548
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,320
It's Dong-ju.

549
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,840
She won't pick up her phone.

550
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,920
What if she got wasted,
fell somewhere, and died?

551
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,400
Just leave her alone
even if she ends up dying.

552
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,840
I don't care anymore.

553
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,000
She's lived for half a century,
yet she's still so immature.

554
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,280
This won't do.

555
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,800
I should call Dong-chan.

556
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,560
(The 90s)

557
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,920
The project looks amazing. Good luck.

558
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,080
-Hello?
(-Dong-chan, it's me.)

559
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,320
Yes.

560
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,520
Dong-ju ran away.
I can't get a hold of her.

561
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,440
What? She ran away? Has...

562
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,640
Has this ever happened before?

563
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,520
No, we always knew where she was.

564
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,320
But I couldn't get a hold of her
since yesterday.

565
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,800
Did you report it to the police?

566
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,040
(Young-tak is a police officer.)

567
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,440
I told him about it,

568
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,680
but he doesn't care, not even an inch.

569
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,800
An... An inch?

570
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,800
No, not even a little. It's a slang.

571
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,840
He seemed fed up with her.

572
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,440
Let's wait until tonight.
I'm sure she'll come home.

573
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,600
I'll give her a good talking to
when she comes in.

574
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,600
Goodness.
Why can't she get a hold of herself?

575
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,520
Okay. Let's hang up for now.

576
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,680
What do women in their 50s do at night?

577
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,280
What could she be doing
instead of coming home?

578
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,040
-Who?
-My sister.

579
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,720
Oh, right. I see.

580
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,160
I have no idea why she lives like that.

581
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,160
She must have menopause.

582
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,320
I totally know how that feels.

583
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,720
You need to give her more attention.

584
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,280
I know she's my sister,
but when I see her,

585
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,400
I can't get mad at her.

586
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,120
She seems like an old lady.

587
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,280
You can treat her like how you treat me.

588
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,840
You treat me harshly.
Why are you like that?

589
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,120
You're right. I can do it to you,
but why can't I do that to her?

590
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,120
My gosh.

591
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,480
Anyway, why did you want to see me?

592
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,880
It's not exactly about the show, is it?

593
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,680
Is Chairman Lee Seok-du of Unsung
the sponsor for

594
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,880
your political career?

595
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,520
I guess so.

596
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,440
Then may I tag along next time
you see him?

597
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,800
Really?

598
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,840
Yes, it would be great to get to know him.

599
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,960
-I'd like to ask him to sponsor our show.
-Goodness, of course.

600
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,400
It seems like Chairman Lee
is greatly interested in you.

601
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,640
-Me?
-Yes.

602
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,520
He's really interested
in the cryonics experiment.

603
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,960
I see.

604
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,080
The audition is tomorrow at 2 p.m.

605
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,520
Yes, you don't have to bring anything.

606
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,880
Okay, thank you.

607
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,040
Will anything change
from building up the wall?

608
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,720
We have to keep seeing each other.

609
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,960
I can see parts of your face
through all these things.

610
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,080
You wanted to keep a distance
of 0.5m between us.

611
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,520
Putting up these things in front
won't keep our distance at 50cm.

612
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,280
You were bad at math in school,
weren't you?

613
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,800
Do you know a thing about width,
length, 2-dimension and 3?

614
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,360
I thought you were talking about
the distance of our hearts.

615
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,840
This isn't an example of
the distance of our hearts.

616
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,920
It's like kids trying to shut
each other out.

617
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,320
I have trouble staying focused,
and I get distracted easily.

618
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,000
Of course, you do.

619
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,280
If you sit there in front of me,
I can't seem to focus on work.

620
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,440
Why?

621
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,680
I told you. I get distracted easily.

622
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,880
Gosh, I don't understand.

623
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,000
Isn't it distracting to have this
in front of you?

624
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,520
I feel frustrated
to have my vision blocked.

625
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,200
Stop picking a fight. It's what I want.

626
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,640
Fine, this is what I want.

627
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,360
This is what I want.

628
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,360
It's not distracting at all.

629
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,800
Much better now.

630
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,240
-Great work.
-Okay.

631
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,080
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

632
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,240
Something came up at home,
so I'm leaving early.

633
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,800
Okay.

634
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,880
So you should go home now too.

635
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,600
I'll go home alone. Don't worry about me.

636
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,640
I can't stop or start worrying
about someone

637
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,560
just because I'm told to.

638
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,840
Let's go home. I'll drop you off.

639
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,040
Why do you keep changing your mind?
You're confusing me!

640
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,720
I told you that I'm leaving alone.

641
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,040
You want to keep a distance,
then you say you're worried.

642
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,920
How do you really feel, you jerk?

643
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,920
I have to organize some material
for the audition.

644
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,040
You already gave me everything.
What else do you have?

645
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,680
Are you the type who studies
after the exam is over?

646
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,760
Just pretend to be hesitant
as you follow me out.

647
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,480
Let's go home.

648
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,640
Hurry up.

649
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,800
Aren't we a little too close for you
to sneak peeks at me?

650
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,760
I wasn't sneaking peeks.

651
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,920
Then why did you turn away
when our eyes met?

652
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,240
You're a playboy, aren't you?

653
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,480
No, I'm not.

654
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,200
You must not realize it,
but you're a typical womanizer

655
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,320
who toys with women.

656
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,680
Gosh. You've never seen a player before,

657
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,640
so how would you know what they're like?

658
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,080
Hello?

659
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,200
(Mi-ran?)

660
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,440
Hey, Ji-hoon.

661
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,680
I got accepted as TBO's intern.

662
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,640
Really? Congratulations.

663
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,120
I hope you and I can work
on the same team.

664
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,880
Me too.

665
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,560
I miss you.

666
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,640
Mi-ran?

667
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,560
Yes. Right.

668
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,480
I miss you too.

669
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,720
We'll get to see
each other often now, right?

670
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,320
We better.

671
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,880
Mi-ran,
I'll be going to the station tomorrow.

672
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,400
See you tomorrow.

673
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,800
Okay, see you tomorrow.

674
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,280
I should ask who it is
to make this situation go smoothly, right?

675
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,760
No, you don't have to ask.

676
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,200
All the more reasons to ask.

677
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,440
Is it a man?

678
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,920
-Of course.
-He must be younger than you.

679
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,640
That's right.

680
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,200
-Is he handsome?
-Absolutely.

681
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,920
"Absolutely"?

682
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,280
Why would a young
and handsome man call you at this hour?

683
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,000
What kind of question is that?

684
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,200
If he's a young and handsome man,

685
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,160
who should he be calling at what time?

686
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,960
I heard that kids these days

687
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,960
don't invest time on women
unless they're serious.

688
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,680
What do you mean?

689
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,120
You don't like him, do you?

690
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,520
Why would he waste his energy
on calling someone

691
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,040
who doesn't even like him?
That's what I'm wondering.

692
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,440
Why do you think I don't like him?

693
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,440
Tell me why you think that.

694
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,760
Because you like someone else.

695
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,040
You're easily distracted.

696
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,600
How could you like two people
with a single heart?

697
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,600
Wait.

698
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,640
Who are you saying I like?

699
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,760
I'm just saying

700
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,200
whatever comes to mind.

701
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,600
Why are you overreacting?

702
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,120
Are you hungry?

703
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,000
Yes, a little. I'm hungry.

704
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,440
Then go home and eat with your family.

705
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,160
I'll do the same.

706
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,880
It's because I promised my family
I'd eat with them today.

707
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,280
You should go in.

708
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,320
I didn't say anything.

709
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,960
I know you're mad at me
because I didn't eat with you.

710
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,000
You're wrong.

711
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,320
I know I'm right.

712
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,280
It's Mi-ran.

713
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,600
It's the cryonic man.

714
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,360
That jerk...

715
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,160
That's Mr. 52-only-on-paper!

716
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,200
("Go Go 99")

718
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:54,960
Nam-tae.

719
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,520
Yes?

720
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,600
Can you help me record a video?

721
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,600
Hey, Ma Dong-chan!
Step away from my woman!

722
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,000
In dramas and movies,

723
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,880
people tend to get their memories back

724
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,640
when they hit their head really hard.

725
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,760
Something dramatic like that
won't happen right now, will it?

726
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,400
Life isn't that easy.

727
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,200
Of course not. Such a thing won't happen.

728
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,120
By the way, if you have a doctorate,

729
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,720
what was your major?

730
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,280
It's confidential, so I can't tell you.

731
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,680
I'm sorry.

732
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,000
That's okay.

733
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,480
By the way, what's your relation

734
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,080
with Ma Dong-chan?

735
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,400
Why do you hate him so much?

736
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,040
I won't forgive Ma Dong-chan!

737
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,360
I'm glad Dong-ju's safe.

738
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,920
Hey, did it seem like she was with a man?

739
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,640
I think I might know the guy she's seeing.

740
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,680
I think it's Mr. Chu whom
she met at the center for alcoholics.

741
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,880
She always goes, "Mr. Chu, Mr. Chu."

742
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,600
She always looks for
him whenever she drinks.

743
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,960
Are you saying she's dating an alcoholic?

744
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,320
Only an alcoholic would date my sister.

745
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,120
Why would a normal person
without an addiction date her?

746
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,200
Alcoholic Mr. Chu?

747
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,760
Is it a title of a novel
from the Middle Ages?

748
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,640
She's crazy.

749
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,440
What will we do if she wants to
get married again?

750
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,000
I know. That's what I worry about too.

751
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,560
She gets married like it's nothing

752
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,760
as if it's her hobby.

753
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,040
Why did Dong-ju turn out this way?

754
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,920
What happened in the last 20 years?

755
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,800
I don't know what to do
whenever I see her.

756
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,440
Uncle, take a picture of proof with me.

757
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,080
-A picture?
-Yes.

758
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,640
I told my friends that
you're the cryonic man,

759
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,880
but they won't believe me.

760
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,280
Why not?

761
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,240
Are you sure it's not
because you lie too much?

762
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,080
No. It's because
the kids are always being lied to.

763
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,000
They were hurt by lies.

764
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,280
All right.

765
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,400
Gosh. My cute niece.

766
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,680
I can already see
what kind of adult you'll become.

767
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,680
What kind of adult
do you think I'll become?

768
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,720
There's a woman I know well,

769
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,120
and I think you might turn out
to be like her when you grow up.

770
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,040
She's pretty, isn't she?

771
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,400
Of course she's pretty.

772
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,040
Maybe she's pretty only to you.

773
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,440
Yes,
but she only needs to be pretty to me.

774
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,960
She's really pretty.

-Mi-ran.

778
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,000
Do you know what Freud said?

779
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,760
"Anatomy is destiny."

00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,600
I'm so glad we rented out
the rooftop house.

781
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,840
Nam-tae loves that professor.

782
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,200
Not only is he handsome,

783
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,760
he's really fit.

784
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,920
He's also really friendly.

785
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,240
He always calls me "Mother".

786
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,960
Is our tenant a professor?

787
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:46,960
Yes.

788
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,280
He's not a Psychology professor
from my school, is he?

789
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,840
He is. How did you know?

790
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,560

I thought you should know this.

We rented out our rooftop house,

00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,280
and Byung-sim moved in.

799

00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,960
Hello. I'm Mi-ran's friend, Oh Young-sun.

00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,080
(Hey, Mr. 52-only-on-paper!
Stay away from my woman.)

806
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,280
(Stop lurking around my woman!)

807
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,640
(Hey, Ma Dong-chan.)

808
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,880
-What?
(-Step away from my woman.)

809
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,800
-Mr. Ma?
(-You completely ruined my life!)

810
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,040
(Now, it's time for you to man up
and take responsibility!)

811
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,600
-He messed with his wife?
-How could he date a married woman?

812
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,000
-He's unbelievable.
-Seriously.

813
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,040
-Hello.
-Hello.

814
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,200
Come on. That guy told him
not to mess with his woman.

815
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,680
That obviously means Director Ma
is dating a married woman.

816
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,440
What is the matter with you?

817
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,040
Stop making stuff up

818
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,760
based on that ridiculous video clip.

819
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,960
Why would Dong-chan
date a married woman? That's absurd.

820
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,160
That man sent that video clip
to our official email address.

821
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,400
It obviously shows that
he's holding a huge grudge.

822
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,640
Imagine how angry he must've felt
to do something like that.

823
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,920
Do you think I shouldn't have deleted it?

824
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,200
What are you talking about?
The chief would've gotten furious.

825
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,880
-You did the right thing.
-Right?

826
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,800
Why would I have gotten furious?

827
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,720
Dong-chan. Dong-chan.

828
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,480
Take a look at this.

829
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,640
Hurry.

830
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,920
(Hey, Mr. 52-only-on-paper!
Stay away from my woman.)

831
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,600
Who have you been seeing these days?

832
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,520
Why did he send us such an email?

833
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,200
I get that you've been single
for 20 years,

834
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,440
but regardless of how
desperate you may be,

835
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,120
you should never mess
with a married woman.

("Go Go 99")

837
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,160
Do you really think he's dating
a married woman?

838
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,800
He obviously looks like a playboy.

839
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,680
Do you think that's why
he broke up with Chief Na?

840
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,360
Apparently, they're awkward
around each other.

841
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,440
-I guess 20 years doesn't change anything.
-I guess you're right.

842
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,640
Welcome.

843
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,040
Did you take a day off yesterday

844
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,000
to get a haircut?

845
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,960
Do you like it?

846
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,280
Well, it's cute.

847
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,640
I'm going to head back

848
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,120
to my laboratory.

849
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,320
I should get my memory back.

850
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,200
I think that place will help me
find my memory.

851
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,560
My son purposely brought you here

852
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,640
because it's dangerous there.

853
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,720
No.

854
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,880
I want to confront it.

855
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,400
I need to get my memory back

856
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,640
in order to help your son
live a normal life.

857
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:13,400
Please do what you can
to make that happen.

858
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,960
I'll do anything for you.

859
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,760
Why are you wearing a hat?

860
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,480
I'm destroying common sense.

861
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,920
A suit and a fedora.

862
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,840
Don't I look like Sirasoni?

863
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,280
That look doesn't suit him at all.

864
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,320
This is the moment I've been waiting for.

Go ahead and hit me. Come on! Come on!

867
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,480
Would you like to appear on TV?

868
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,800
-What?
-First of all,

869
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,120
unclench your fists.

870
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,720
Let's talk.

871
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,920
-A TV show?
-Yes, a TV show.

(Listen to me, Ma Dong-chan.)

875

I'm sorry for causing trouble.

876

Why do you keep making me look for you?

Why are you crying? It's not like you.
