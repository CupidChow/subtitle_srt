4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,960
I've been looking for him everywhere.

5
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,480
I can't believe this is where he was
all along.

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,080
Where did you take him?

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,160
Bring him here right now
if you do not wish to die!

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,480
Professor Hwang, where are you?

9
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,080
I think those two will face
a variation in them soon.

10
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,120
You have to come quickly. Professor Hwang?

11
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,000
You have my trust.

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,840
M, 3, 4.

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,320
(Professor Jo Gi-bum)

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,240
Tell me.

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,280
Where did you hide the cryonic...

16
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,759
that was here?

17
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,640
I guess...

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
you've succeeded in thawing them.

19
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,640
Then...

20
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:01,000
who took Lee Seok-du?

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,680
Don't kill Professor Hwang.

22
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,760
If you do, you'll be done for.

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,160
Take him.

24
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,400
His body temperature is 32.8°C.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,560
We can't just treat him however we want.

26
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,520
-Did you call his guardian?
-No.

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
Please call...

28
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,560
Professor Jo Gi-bum.

29
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,560
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed...

30
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,800
Hello?

31
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,200
Which hospital is it?

32
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,200
(Episode 12: To Die or To Be Mad)

33
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,280
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

34
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
(Lee Hyeong-du)

35
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,120
Hello?

36
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,960
Seok-du has disappeared.

37
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,880
They made a move before us.

38
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,000
Find him!

39
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,480
Isn't this Ma Dong-chan's phone?

40
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,040
Yes, it is. I'm a nurse.

41
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,120
He's hospitalized.

42
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,880
He's hospitalized?

43
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,880
The toxins are accumulating in your body.

44
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,280
That's why you were in shock.

45
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,240
This is a temporary antidote.

46
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,520
The symptom will manifest itself
once again in 48 hours.

47
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:40,640
But this antidote won't work
the second time around.

48
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,440
48 hours?

49
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,080
Then...

50
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,159
will Mi-ran also suffer from this?

51
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,600
Yes.

52
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,200
There has been a variation in the LAP...

53
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,000
and has turned into toxins.

54
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
Professor Hwang had mentioned this
in his note.

55
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
He already knew this would happen.

56
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,880
However, we do not have a reagent
that will get rid of it permanently.

57
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,920
I'm currently researching the protocol.

58
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,160
But I need Professor Hwang's help.

59
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,720
I need to know the code...

60
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,280
for the LAP that he administered
into your bodies.

61
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,280
Where is he right now?

62
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,840
Are you okay?

63
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,000
What happened? Did you get a fever again?

64
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,000
Are you okay?

65
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,080
I'm fine.

66
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,960
What is this?

67
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,080
When did I get this bruise?

68
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,440
That isn't a bruise.

69
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
Then?

70
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,920
I think the variation is happening
in your body as well.

71
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,480
We'll have to keep an eye on it.

72
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,040
Could this be...

73
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,800
lethal?

74
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,480
I need to see Professor Hwang right now.

75
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,600
That's the problem. I cannot reach him.

76
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,800
And he said something strange.

77
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,640
He said he trusted me.

78
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,240
-What are you doing?
-I need to find him.

79
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,320
There's no time.

80
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,480
You just collapsed. You need to rest.

81
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,040
You must remain at the hospital
so we can keep an eye on you.

82
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,040
I'll look for him.

83
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,120
Go home.

84
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,440
How can I?

85
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,560
You must protect your immune system,

86
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,960
so go home.

87
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,120
Since when did you have this?

88
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,800
I wasn't aware of it.

89
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,320
How is it possible that you didn't know?

90
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,159
There's something wrong on your arm.

91
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,040
Go home and rest.

92
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,720
I won't go.

93
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,120
-Go.
-No.

94
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,480
Professor Jo Gi-bum?

95
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,200
Can you spare me a minute?

96
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,960
Are those two...

97
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,040
in danger?

98
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,320
I need to find Professor Hwang.

99
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,160
Is Professor Hwang the only one
who can cure them?

100
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm currently looking for a solution.

101
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Where's Lee Seok-du?

102
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Why are you asking me that?

103
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,120
Dong-chan told me.

104
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,040
He told me that the current Lee Seok-du...

105
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,800
isn't really him
and that the real Lee Seok-du...

106
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,840
has been in a capsule.

107
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Now, can you believe that...

108
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,320
we're on the same team?

109
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,960
Go home. I'll call a cab.

110
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,000
Why are you trying to send me away?

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,280
Your being here won't help me.

112
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,880
My temperature will keep rising.

113
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,560
Then I must go.

114
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,960
All you're doing is worrying.

115
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,600
I like holding hands,
looking at each other,

116
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,480
and being happy together.

117
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,800
But I don't want to be sick together.

118
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,920
Fine, I'll leave.

119
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,240
But don't get sick again.

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,880
I'm all better now. Don't worry.

121
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,680
Call me if anything happens.

122
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,400
Let's video call instead.

123
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,280
You love me so much, don't you?

124
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,919
Yes, I do.

125
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,840
Me too.

126
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,960
Hello?

127
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,120
Hello, I'm Professor Seo Hyun-jung,

128
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,000
the cultural communications professor.

129
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,440
Hello.

130
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,280
Have you given the essay some thought?

131
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,800
Things are a bit hectic for me
at the moment.

132
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,520
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,880
(Professor Hwang Gab-su)

134
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,120
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

135
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,240
(I think the variation is happening
in your body as well.)

136
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
Professor Seo.

137
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,120
This is Ko Mi-ran.

138
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
I'll write that essay.

139
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm glad you agreed to do so.

140
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,200
May I ask what changed your mind?

141
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,280
There's someone...

142
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,160
that I love.

143
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,720
But we're in an unusual situation.

144
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,360
We don't know what will happen.

145
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,120
I feel like I should write down our story
to be remembered.

146
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,000
(At the age of 44, I found my first love.)

147
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,240
(At the age of 44, I found my first love.)

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,320
(However...)

149
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,120
(However, this could be my last.)

150
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,320
(This could be my last.)
(However, this could be my last.)

151
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,520
(However, this could be my last.)

152
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,280
Where are you going?

153
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,680
I told you to stay at home.

154
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,000
I told you to stay at the hospital.

155
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,360
Why did you come outside?

156
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,280
Because I missed you.

157
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,800
Why did you send me home
if you were going to come so soon?

158
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,600
I told you, I'm fine.

159
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,880
Do you want to get a drink with me?

160
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,800
Why are there so many things I can't do?

161
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,480
I'm a bad drinker too.

162
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,960
Why can't I hold the man I love
as much as I want?

163
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,520
My life is unfair.

164
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,560
It's not like I had the opportunity
to love many people.

165
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,760
This is my first time.

166
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,800
Ma Dong-chan,

167
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,320
why did you come into my life?

168
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,920
Why did you...

169
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,920
make me love you?

170
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,000
I was told my life would get really lucky
in 20 years,

171
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,240
and that I'd meet the man
I'm destined to be with.

172
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,640
I finally met you,

173
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,720
but I'm going to die.

174
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,920
Who says you're going to die?

175
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,280
We're going to die soon
because of the side effect.

176
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
We're not going to die.

177
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,120
We won't die like this.

178
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,200
I'm going to drink with you,

179
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,880
and spend a whole day just holding you.

180
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,920
I'm even going to take you to Africa
where it's hot.

181
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm going to do all of this with you.

182
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,720
Why are you crying?

183
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,400
I think Professor Hwang has been abducted.

184
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,040
Will he be all right?

185
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,680
What Lee Hyeong-du wants is Lee Seok-du.

186
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,440
He won't act recklessly
until he finds out...

187
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,839
where Lee Seok-du is.

188
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,200
That person is coming on a flight early
tomorrow morning, right?

189
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,920
Yes. The only hope who can help us
find Professor Hwang...

190
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,400
is Lee Seok-du.

191
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,160
We need that person
in order to protect Lee Seok-du.

192
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,080
By the way, Ms. Na asked me...

193
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,960
where Lee Seok-du is.

194
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,840
-Ha-young asked you?
-Yes.

195
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,960
So?

196
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,000
Did you tell her?

197
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,320
If they defrosted him,

198
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,640
that means they're prepared
to bring him back alive.

199
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,440
No way.

200
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,600
Could they have contacted Jung-woo?

201
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,600
There's no time.

202
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,520
Ma Dong-chan is scheming something.

203
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Dong-chan?

204
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,400
Find out what he's trying to do.

205
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Are you ordering me right now?

206
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
If we weigh the things we want,

207
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,560
which way do you think
the scale will lean?

208
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,600
Did you...

209
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,760
forget who I am?

210
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,320
I can unveil a truth that's covered,

211
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,040
or cover up a truth
that should be exposed.

212
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,920
On top of that, I know a fact...

213
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,920
that the world will turn
their attention to if it airs on the news.

214
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,400
Could there be someone scarier to you?

215
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,200
But you have a weakness.

216
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,880
Ma Dong-chan.

217
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,520
I have Professor Hwang with me.

218
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,200
Without him, Dong-chan will die.

219
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,240
Then,

220
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,960
your other offer will be
chucked out the window.

221
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,880
Are you Lee Jung-woo?

222
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,520
How is Father doing?

223
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,800
He's barely hanging on. We have to hurry.

224
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,400
-Yes.
-I'm driving right behind you.

225
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,480
Okay.

226
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,040
You haven't found
Professor Hwang yet, right?

227
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,360
We've been tracing Lee Hyeong-du,

228
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,160
but we haven't found where
Professor Hwang is yet.

229
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,440
By the way, our boys told me...

230
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,760
Lee Hyeong-du met with Ms. Na last night.

231
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,160
Hyeong-du met with Ha-young?

232
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,400
Wait.

233
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,040
They're tailing me as we expected.
Let's get started.

234
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Okay.

235
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,720
Hold tight.

236
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Father?

237
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,680
He's ready for the transfusion.

238
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,240
He would've been in grave danger
if you hadn't come right on time.

239
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,600
(Certified Medical Institution
by the Ministry of Health and Welfare)

240
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,800
Hello?

241
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,120
Hey, how do you feel?

242
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,120
Okay, don't come to work today.
You should rest at home.

243
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,120
Okay, bye.

244
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,000
You can't come in here.

245
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
But...

246
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,480
Lee Hyeong-du.

247
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,040
You must feel frustrated.

248
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,200
You need to settle a deal with me,

249
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,760
but you also can't admit
that you took Professor Hwang.

250
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,560
Then how about I make an offer?

251
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,000
How about you give me Professor Hwang,

252
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,840
and I give you Lee Seok-du in return?

253
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,480
I need Professor Hwang,
and you need Lee Seok-du.

254
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,480
How does that sound?
Doesn't it sound intriguing?

255
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,200
Think about it carefully.

256
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,120
Professor Jo.

257
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,480
Is he recovering properly?

258
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,560
Okay, thank you.

259
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,480
And as for Professor Hwang,

260
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,360
he won't be able to hurt him.
You don't need to worry too much.

261
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,920
Okay, bye.

262
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,560
-What do you want?
-Why aren't you here yet?

263
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,840
"Go Go 99" is going to air soon.

264
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,400
You need to be here for the final editing.

265
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,240
-I'm busy.
-Are you kidding me?

266
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
You're busy with something else
other than work.

267
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,920
How can you tell the chief
that you're busy?

268
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,360
I'm saying I'm busy because I am.

269
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,880
When are you going to come to work?

270
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,280
I'm on my way.

271
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,640
Take a look at what's written here
and organize the information.

272
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,880
-Okay.
-Ask me if you have any questions.

273
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,120
-Okay?
-Okay.

274
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,240
Is there anything else you'd like to ask?

275
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,120
I'll give it a try first.

276
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,720
I'll try organizing everything.

277
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,440
Mi-ran,
we didn't get to eat dinner last time.

278
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,720
So how about we eat dinner today?

279
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,480
Ji-hoon, I'm sorry.
Can we eat together next time?

280
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,880
It's because
you seem really down these days.

281
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,400
I'll brighten up your mood.

282
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,360
My gosh, you're so kind.

283
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,360
Hey, what are you guys doing?

284
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,880
Get back to work.

285
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,760
Hey, Intern.

286
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,880
Didn't I tell you not to socialize
with another intern?

287
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,160
You'll learn nothing from her.

288
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,920
And I told you not to be so kind...

289
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,960
to the other female employees.

290
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,440
Mi-ran and I were friends
before I even started working here.

291
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,440
Please don't get the wrong idea.

292
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,720
You're friends?
Who says you can be friends?

293
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,360
The thing is, he's my friend's son.

294
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,880
He's your friend's son?

295
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,680
Then why are you acting like
she's your friend?

296
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,160
You should be treating her
with more respect.

297
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,440
Plus, I'm not friends
with any of my mom's friends.

298
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,120
She's not exactly young enough
to be your friend.

299
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,560
And tell me something, Intern.

300
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,680
How exactly are you going to
brighten up her mood?

301
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,880
I'm sorry, but I don't really get why
you're so upset right now.

302
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Do you think I'm joking around?

303
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,720
Who ever said you were joking around?

304
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,400
I told you to stay at home.

305
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,400
What's wrong?

306
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,040
I'm okay.

307
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,400
Don't lie to me. Let me see.

308
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,120
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

309
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,680
I'm really okay.

310
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,440
Dong-chan.

311
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,120
Yes, what's up?

312
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,160
Well...

313
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,120
Something about work?

314
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,920
Yes, that's exactly what we were doing.

315
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,040
-But your hands...
-No, we were talking about work.

316
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,080
Oh, okay. Go ahead.

317
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,400
My gosh, he startled me.

318
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,920
You don't think he saw us, right?

319
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,400
-We were really fast.
-He couldn't have seen us.

320
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,160
Why are you so busy these days?

321
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,120
I finally tracked down the IP address.

322
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
What IP address?

323
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,920
The person who wrote
that post about Ko Mi-ran.

324
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,760
It took me a lot of effort
to track it down.

325
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,640
You're the one
who wanted me to track it down.

326
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,680
You said you'll think it was me
if I don't find out who.

327
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,280
Oh, right. Good work.

328
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,720
-That's it?
-Is Ha-young in her office?

329
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,440
Dong-chan, I'm not her secretary.

330
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,600
Is President Kim in his office?

331
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,720
Dong-chan!

332
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,040
You should go see him.
He's been looking for you all morning.

333
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,160
Okay.

334
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,000
You came to work really late today.

335
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,960
What were you busy doing all morning?

336
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,520
Why do you want to know?

337
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,280
Dong-chan.

338
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,000
But then again, I also want to know...

339
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,800
what you did that night.

340
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,640
What? "That night"?

341
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,600
My goodness. Don't worry, sir.

342
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,160
Dong-chan is a variety show director.

343
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,080
There's nothing much he can do.

344
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,760
Chairman Lee is very bothered by him.

345
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,960
Why don't you create a project abroad...

346
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,160
and send him overseas?

347
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,480
He won't go just because I tell him to go.

348
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,240
And he won't come just
because I tell him to come.

349
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,160
He's here.

350
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,760
I'll call you back.

351
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,960
Okay, bye.

352
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,560
Were you talking about me?

353
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,200
You look really startled.

354
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,080
My gosh, what are you talking about?

355
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,720
What brings you here?

356
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,440
I don't have much time.

357
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,800
I need to differentiate my enemies
from my allies.

358
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,600
So let me be straightforward
and ask you something.

359
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,920
President Kim.

360
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,520
Do you know who Lee Hyeong-du is?

361
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,560
"Lee Hyeong-du"?

362
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,920
No, I don't.

363
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,680
Okay, then.

364
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,960
Do you know that Lee Seok-du
and Lee Hyeong-du are twins...

365
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,760
and that Lee Hyeong-du
is just an imposter...

366
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,120
who's pretending to be Lee Seok-du?

367
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,960
What? What did you just say?

368
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,840
Do you also know that the real Lee Seok-du
was in a frozen capsule?

369
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,720
Are you telling me...

370
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,080
that there were other people there
other than you and Mi-ran?

371
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,440
But Lee Hyeong-du is the person
who's helping you...

372
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,640
become a politician, isn't he?

373
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,280
Hey, I really have no idea what you're...

374
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,160
It'd be best for you to find
another sponsor.

375
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,560
That sponsor of yours
is completely rotten and useless.

376
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,680
President Kim, that guy took...

377
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,560
Professor Hwang.

378
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,160
Do you really not know anything?

379
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,480
I really don't get
what you're talking about.

380
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,040
What do you mean they're twins?

381
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,320
And who in the world is Lee Hyeong-du?

382
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,480
Where did he go?

383
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,720
Why do you want to know?

384
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,520
But then again, I also want to know...

385
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,160
what you did that night.

386
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,360
("Go Go 99" Credits)

387
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,360
Are you making the closing credits?

388
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,960
I have the cast list.

389
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,840
Oh, I see. I'll take that.

390
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,560
You don't look so well.

391
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,440
No, I'm okay.

392
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,200
I'm sorry, Mi-ran.

393
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,160
You must've been through a lot.

394
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,240
What do you mean?

395
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,280
I'm talking about my dad.

396
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,600
You don't need to apologize for him.

397
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,480
Please think of me separately from my dad.

398
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,400
Don't worry.

399
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,080
Hello?

400
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,160
Hey, Young-sun.

401
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,640
Are you sick? You don't look so well.

402
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,400
No, I'm okay.

403
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,960
I'm relieved to hear that.

404
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,720
Mi-ran.

405
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,200
You can't date Ji-hoon.

406
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,280
-Young-sun.
-Guys in their 20s...

407
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,120
are all full of passion.

408
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,280
If they like someone,

409
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,960
they don't care about the woman's age.

410
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,240
They're very naive
and passionate at that age.

411
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,920
And if a kid like him
starts showing that he likes you,

412
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,480
we should try to talk him out of it
since we're adults.

413
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,760
That's what we should do as people
who are older than him.

414
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,160
Young-sun.

415
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,560
Your son's 20 years old,
and you think of him like a kid.

416
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,760
I've lived for 24 years,
and you think of me like an adult.

417
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You're right.

418
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,880
You didn't live as much as I did.

419
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,400
You have changed...

420
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,160
so much.

421
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,560
You used to have trouble
differentiating words.

422
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,040
But now, you're so thoughtful.

423
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,520
You're a grown-up now.

424
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,880
You know what?

425
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,280
I'm in love.

426
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,280
Are you dating?

427
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Yes.

428
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,680
(Here is the IP address
of the ID you've requested.)

429
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,440
All right.
So the person who wrote that online...

430
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,640
was at this cafe?

431
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,320
Okay. I got it.

432
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,720
This is it.

433
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,760
But how do I catch them?

434
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,960
So that's what happened.

435
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,640
Is it important or not?

436
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,360
It is.

437
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,640
Mi-ran, what brings you here?

438
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
I came to meet my friend
during my lunchtime.

439
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,040
-This is her cafe.
-Hello.

440
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,920
(Ko Mi-ran)

441
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,160
(Editing Room A)

442
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,280
How about we do this? Follow me.

443
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,639
-Where are we going?
-Just follow me.

444
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,040
Where are we going?

445
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Let's go.

446
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,040
You need to tell me where.

447
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,360
Are they...

448
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,160
"M, 3, 4".

449
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,440
I thought Mi-ran was going to come
after work, but you're here early.

450
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,920
What? Were you going to come here?

451
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,400
Yes.

452
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,880
By the way, he has the same thing.

453
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,240
It's progressing around the same time.

454
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,080
Sir, no matter what happens,

455
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,160
do save him.

456
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,120
Cure him first. We have no time.

457
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,880
(This is a temporary antidote.)

458
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,280
(The symptom will manifest itself
once again in 48 hours.)

459
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
Dong-chan.

460
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,040
Are you feeling unwell?

461
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,080
Why did you meet Lee Hyeong-du?

462
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,040
Why do you want to know
where Lee Seok-du is?

463
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,760
Why haven't you covered this case yet?

464
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,720
Don't do anything shameful.

465
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,280
Stop here.

466
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,320
You need to know how it feels.

467
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,200
To have aged...

468
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,800
but for the person you love
to still be shining brightly.

469
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,760
To be rejected by that person
for being old and worn out.

470
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,680
To have aged...

471
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,480
but still be passionately in love
with that person.

472
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,080
You need to feel the pain.

473
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,120
You must.

474
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,320
-Please leave.
-I need to find Professor Hwang.

475
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,840
I'm running out of time.

476
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Please help me.

477
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,360
-By the way...
-I think...

478
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,640
I was told something
that I shouldn't have known.

479
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,720
And it's something so intense.

480
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,080
Me too.

481
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,640
What do you know?

482
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,080
You go first.

483
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,960
It's nothing you should know.

484
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,280
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

485
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,840
(I need to find Professor Hwang.)
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

486
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,520
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

487
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,920
(I'm running out of time. Please help me.)
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

488
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

489
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,920
It's me. If you want to find Lee Seok-du,

490
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,280
send Professor Hwang
back to them right now.

491
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:54,640
(Lee Seok-du)

492
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,040
Did Dong-chan tell you to do this?
(Lee Seok-du)

493
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,200
I'm going to report the disappearance
of Professor Hwang.

494
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,040
I'm going to do an exclusive
and report all the facts...

495
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,200
regarding that case.

496
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,640
But if you let him go,

497
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,320
I won't do it.

498
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,920
(Lee Seok-du)

499
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,520
Put Ko Mi-ran back
into the cryonic capsule.

500
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,520
That's our deal.

501
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,680
You...

502
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,960
What are you planning to do?

503
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,240
You were blinded by love
and acted too rashly.

504
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,160
I'm considering releasing this
to the press right now.

505
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,400
(You need to know how it feels.)

506
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,480
(To have aged...)

507
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,120
(but for the person you love
to still be shining brightly.)

508
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,880
(To be rejected by that person
for being old and worn out.)

509
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,880
(To have aged...)

510
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,760
(but still be passionately in love
with that person.)

511
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,880
(You need to feel the pain.)

512
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,360
(You must.)

513
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,920
I've attached a photo of him
and checked the time.

514
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,040
All right, good work. I'll wrap it up.

515
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,760
-Are you in here?
-Yes, I am.

516
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,000
What were you watching in here?

517
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,840
Well... Nothing.

518
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,520
What is it?

519
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,520
The person who wrote
the post about Mi-ran...

520
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
turned out to be her friend
who runs a cafe.

521
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,640
-Oh, are you sure?
-Yes.

522
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,960
Okay, I got it. You can go.

523
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,120
Is that all?

524
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,080
Yes.

525
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,880
Is it because you're afraid
your girlfriend will get hurt?

526
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,120
I thought something was going on
between you and her,

527
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,040
but I didn't know you two would date.

528
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,360
Well...

529
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,520
Don't tell Mi-ran about her friend...

530
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,960
who wrote that post.

531
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,720
Not to your girlfriend either.

532
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,680
What are you talking about?

533
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,800
The three of them are friends.
You know, Mi-ran's friend...

534
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,640
you were seeing in secret
on the set of "Go Go 99".

535
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,880
Your girlfriend.

536
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,720
I know everything.

537
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,720
What do I do? What?

538
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,440
Gosh, you must have
been stressed out lately.

539
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,720
Darling.

540
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,800
Yes, honey?

541
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,880
Dong-chan found out about us.

542
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,080
How did he find out?

543
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,480
Do you know what's more shocking?

544
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,320
-What?
-Dong-chan and Mi-ran...

545
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,480
are dating.

546
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,040
If they have a baby,

547
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,880
it'd be an ice baby.

548
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,520
Should we relocate?

549
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,600
-There are too many eyes on us.
-Right.

550
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,560
What is it? Are you embarrassed by me?

551
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,560
It's not that, darling.

552
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,640
Right. I have one more thing to tell you.

553
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,200
The one that wrote the post
about Mi-ran's identity...

554
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,480
is your friend who runs a cafe.

555
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,640
You should know
what kind of person your friend is.

556
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,640
What? Young-sun?

557
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,880
-Yes.
-That's impossible.

558
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,400
One second.

559
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,840
(Young-sun)

560
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,880
Hello?

561
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,120
Yes. It's me.

562
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,160
I know. You're a witch.

563
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,640
You shouldn't live like that.

564
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,160
I understand why you don't like Mi-ran,

565
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,680
but how could you do that to a friend?

566
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,960
You better not call me for a while, witch.

567
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,960
What?

568
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,920
Gosh.

569
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,960
-Honey.
-Yes?

570
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,160
How about a nice bowl
of warm fish cake soup?

571
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,760
We could have shots of soju
to go along with it.

572
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,080
Shall we?

573
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,440
Do you know a good place?

574
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,480
-I know many.
-Let's go.

575
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,360
What was that about? Gosh.

576
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,760
I'll get going, ma'am.

577
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,200
Okay.

578
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,880
I thought you wanted to work here
so you could work at the station.

579
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,600
Did you give up on finding a job there?

580
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,000
Yes. I don't want to work
at the station anymore.

581
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,280
The people there are mean and unfair.

582
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,600
Thank you for everything, ma'am.

583
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,800
Sure. It was nice having you.

584
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,400
-Chae-yeon.
-Yes?

585
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,000
You should log out from your account.

586
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,920
It's okay. That's not my ID anyway.

587
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,200
(Put Ko Mi-ran back
into the cryonic capsule.)

588
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,040

589

and acted too rashly.)

590

(I'm considering releasing this
to the press right now.)

591
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,440
Look for Professor Jo.

592
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,640
He knows...

593
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,000
where Lee Seok-du is.

594
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,400
(I need to find Professor Hwang.)

595
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,080
(I'm running out of time.)

596
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,320
Please help me.

597
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,360
(Na Ha-young)

598
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,680
Hello?

599
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,160
It's me.

600
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,480
What are you trying to find out from me?

601
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,880
Professor Jo is in danger.

602
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,640
I called to tell you that.

603
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,920
Ever since his car explosion incident,

604
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,640
the police have been with him at the lab.

605
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,360
That's why Lee Hyeong-du
couldn't do anything.

606
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,520
Now he knows the police
aren't at the lab anymore.

607
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,720
You should warn Professor Jo.

608
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,080
How did he know that?

609
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,080
Because I...

610
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,280
Because I told him.

611
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,320
It's me.

612
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,400
Yes?

613
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,520
Can you go to Professor Jo's lab now?

614
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,640
You need to hurry.

615
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,480
You, guard at the front of the lab.

616
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,800
The rest of you can standby outside.

617
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,880
Yes, sir.

(Cold-hearted Punk: Don't go anywhere...
and stick right beside Professor Jo.)

619

(Cold-hearted Punk: Don't go anywhere...
and stick right beside Professor Jo.)

620
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,440
(and stick right beside Professor Jo.)
(Cold-hearted Punk: Don't go anywhere...

621

(We don't know
what kind of symptoms might show.)

622
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,040
"Maito Magick"?
(Maito Magick)

623
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,840
What is this?

624
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,200
"Maito Magick"?

625
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,200
You have my trust.

626
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,880
M, 3, 4.

627
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,320
M,

628
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,120
3, 4.

629
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,680
Maito Magick number 34.

630
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,080
I've moved out of Mi-ran's house.

631
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,120
I'll stay here until I find a new place.

632
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,560
No. Get out.

633
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,880
Dad.

634
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,200
Hwang Byung-sim, Hwang Ji-hoon.

635
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,680
You two must really be father and son.

636
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,480
You have the same taste in women.

637
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,160
I'm so embarrassed...

638
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,520
to see people.

639
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,600
I gave up on Mi-ran.

640
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,640
The reason is,

641
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,360
more than being Mi-ran's first love,

642
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,880
I believe it's more valuable
to be your father.

643
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,120
I compared it on a balance sheet,
and that's what I got.

644
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,320
Thank you, Dad.

645
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,800
Can I start dating Mi-ran now?

646
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,760
-What?
-She's my type.

647
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,000
You punk.

648
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,080
If your father steps back
in such a cool way,

649
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,360
you should say something really cool too.

650
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,200
"Date her"? What are you saying?

651
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,760
You didn't step back.
You were pushed back.

652
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,840
No. Mi-ran is my friend.

653
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,480
What's wrong with that?

654
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,200
It's better than dating
the mom of a friend.

655
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,240
Gosh.

656
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,960
You've been interning
at the Variety Department,

657
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,520
so you're making a joke?
How is that any better?

658
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,400
How is it any different?
A friend's mom versus Mom's friend?

659
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,080
That's not what I mean.

660
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,440
Both of you, shut your mouths!

661
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,920
I won't allow it.

662
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,240
Gosh. It's Dong-chan's fault.

663
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,640
I'm sure he ruined you.

664
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,680
Mi-ran has a boyfriend.

665
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,880
You two should go home.

666
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,120
I'll finish this
even if I have to stay up all night.

667
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,920
I'll be in touch, Mr. Ma.

668
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,240
Okay.

669
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,480
Sweet dreams.

670
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,840
You too, honey.

671
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,240
"Honey"...

672
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,920
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

673
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,960
I'll go with Dad tomorrow.

674
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,000
Why?

675
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,760
He wants to do it.

676
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,040
All right.

677
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,760
You should hurry home.

678
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,880
After we resolve things one by one,

679
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,440
we'll be able to live
just like ordinary people.

680
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,240
After we take the reagent
and find Professor Hwang again,

681
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,840
we just need to get the treatment
to get our temperatures normal.

682
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,960
You're right.

683
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,640
See you, then.

684
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,800
But this antidote
hasn't gone through a clinical trial.

685
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,920
So one person
needs to get the injection first.

686
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,200
I'll get the injection first.

687
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,360
If I turn out to be fine,

688
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,360
you can give it to him.

689
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,360
Hey, Professor Jo. I'll be on my way soon.

690
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,000
Is Mi-ran there already?

691
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,280
Yes, she's here. But the thing is,

692
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,200
Mi-ran already got the injection.

693
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,480
What?

694
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,640
It's been two hours since she got it.

695
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,400
I think the antidote works.

696
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,960
Why did you get the injection first?

697
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,160
Because I wanted to live first.

698
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,720
Why do you always do everything first?

699
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,800
This reminds me of the day
I first met you guys 20 years ago.

700
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,080
For 20 years,

701
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,920
you guys were frozen and asleep.

702
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,360
But on the other hand,
I've seen you guys for 20 years.

703
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,200
I guess that's why I'm not surprised
to see that you're dating.

704
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,600
I guess we were meant to be.

705
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,640
We were destined to be with each other.

706
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,400
You both need to keep this in mind.

707
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,640
This is just an antidote.

708
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,760
It's not a cure that will bring
your body temperature back.

709
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,440
You both need to keep maintaining
a body temperature of 31.5℃.

710
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,840
Let me see.

711
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:18,160
Today, the pilot episode of "Go Go 99"
is finally going to air.

712
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,000
It's truly a historical moment.

713
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,800
It was planned by Ko Mi-ran...

714
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,400
and directed by Director Ma Dong-chan.

715
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,240
But where is Director Ma?

716
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,080
I saw him working
in the editing room earlier.

717
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,440
He's been in there for days.

718
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,720
I can't believe he isn't done yet.

719
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,120
My gosh, he really lost it.
It's because he's old.

720
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,640
And one more thing.

721
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,520
If you're dating a colleague,
please be extra careful.

722
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,320
People are bound to make fun of you.

723
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,560
And every couple ended up getting caught.

724
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,440
It's all done.

725
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,080
Mi-ran.

726
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,560
Are you dating Director Ma?

727
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,520
-Yes.
-I'll wait for you.

728
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,840
I'm still very young.

729
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,400
-Don't be such a kid.
-Stop drawing a line.

730
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,320
We're only four years apart.

731
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,680
The pilot episode of "Go Go 99"
is going to begin soon, right?

732
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,600
-Yes, should we watch it here?
-No.

733
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,560
Let's watch it with the employees
in the lobby.

734
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,560
Okay.

735
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,800
Did you watch the rough version?

736
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,240
Yes, it's fun.

737
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,800
Dong-chan really is the best.
The show's bound to do well.

738
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,160
He's so focused on the details.

739
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,880
He's been editing for days now.

740
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,600
Hyun-gi, do you hear that?
I hear the ratings going up.

741
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,680
Listen to that.

742
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,720
What's taking him so long?

743
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,240
We're going to air
the advertisements soon.

744
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,680
Hello?

745
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,400
I'm sorry for being late.
I just sent you the file.

746
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,920
I thought there was a problem.

747
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,880
He sent the file. Standby.

748
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,800
("Go Go 99")

749
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,720
Okay, everyone.

750
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,600
-I'm so nervous
-We're finally watching the show.

751
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,360
("Go Go 99")

752
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,240
Let's go!

753
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,600
I love the introduction.

754
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,640
(I'm Dong-sik.)

755
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,000
(-I am ground, introduce yourself.
-I am ground, introduce yourself.)

756
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,960
-It's fun.
-It has to be fun for sure.

757
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,000
(-For youth!
-For youth!)

758
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,920
(Let's Go Back to 1999! "Go Go 99")

759
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,800
-What's going on?
-What's this?

760
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,440
-Something's wrong.
-What's the matter?

761
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,760
What's going on?

762
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,560
(Please save my husband.
The cryonic capsule...)

763
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,280
(What happened to her...)

764
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,680
(on that night of 2019?)

765
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,080
-Shouldn't we stop this?
-No, let's leave it.

766
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,160
(What happened to her
on that night of 2019?)

767
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,040
(On that night of 1999,)
(On that night of 1999...)

768
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,600
(we were waiting to be thawed
after having participated...)

769
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,040
(in the experiment for 24 hours.)

770
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,800
(But what in the world
happened to us that night?)

771
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,480
(The two incidents may seem
totally irrelevant from each other.)

772
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,560
He's...

773
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,800
(But this man,)

774
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,160
(Lee Hyeong-du, the younger brother
of Unsung Group's chairman,)

775
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,600
(Lee Seok-du, was behind both cases.)

776
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,120
What the...

777
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,160
My goodness.

778
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,200
Is that really true?

779
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,280
(I am...)

780
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,120
(the real Lee Seok-du.)
