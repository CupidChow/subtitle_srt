-Hello?
-Hello, Mr. My Love.

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,640
It's me, Nam-tae.

10
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,440
This is Mi-ran's phone.

11
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Yes.

12
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
I know.

13
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,600
You were saved as "My Love"
on Mi-ran's phone.

14
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,080
And I thought I'd call.

15
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,680
She did that?

16
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,480
But your voice...
Are you really Mr. Cryonic?

17
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes.

18
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,680
It's me.

19
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,360
No, wait.
You're not a cryonic human anymore.

20
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,840
My sister's a cryonic human.

21
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,680
My goodness. My gosh, Director Ma.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,400
My son just called for no reason.
Don't let it bother you.

23
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,760
What are you doing?

24
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,200
I really don't think you're an inferior.

25
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,120
So I saved you as something else.

26
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,120
What did you save me as? Let me see.

27
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,440
-No.
-I know what you saved me as.

28
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,560
I went from Cold-hearted Punk
to Warm-hearted Punk, didn't I?

29
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,280
-No.
-Don't lie to me.

30
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,880
-No, you're wrong.
-Then let me see.

31
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,480
No, I'll show you next time.

32
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,720
Dong-chan, you should sit down.

33
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,079
Eat up.

34
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,200
You guys.

35
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,640
I have something to tell you.

36
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
I think

37
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,760
I need to be away for a while.

38
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,360
We froze a person with hypothermia,

39
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,720
so we need to start over again.

40
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,160
We can do it, Professor Hwang.

41
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
We need to make it work.

42
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,760
Yes, of course. We must succeed.

43
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,440
-Did you finish it?
-Yes.

44
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,560
You're free to do what you want.

45
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,760
We're not going to carry on
with the project.

46
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,640
You can join another team
and work on another project.

47
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No.

48
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,120
I want to stay in your team
and continue to learn from you.

49
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,760
Hey, it's me.

50
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,280
I feel uneasy that I didn't
get to see the culprit get arrested.

51
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,600
Make sure you keep the hotline open.

52
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,400
We need to find that culprit
no matter what.

53
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,560
Okay, Reporter Park.
Keep up the good work.

54

I'm sure it'll work out.

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,200

65
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,680
I was suspended.

66
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,520
This is impossible.

67
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,560
You must've done something wrong.

68
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,040
They said I approached a female student

69
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,480
with personal intentions.

70
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,400
That "female student" is

71
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,840
Ko Mi-ran.

72
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,280
How is she a mere female student?
She's my first love.

73
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,240
But no matter what I say,

74
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,000
no one believes me.

75
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,640
And Mi-ran is back in...

76
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,360
Anyway, that's that.

77
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,320
You're the only person
who can confirm this.

78
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,040
You'll get fired soon.

79
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,040
Don't call me to discuss things like this.

80
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280

I'm not someone who can help you.

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,240
If anything, I can destroy you.

88
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,880
If I get involved,
not only will you be fired,

89

Hey, he's calling me.

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,640
He's desperate for a witness.

95
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,560
He's so stupid.

96
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,600
Shall we have galbi-tang?

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,200
Dong-chan, let's have lunch.

98
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,760
No, I'm fine. Go without me.

99
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,600
You should go too.

100
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,160
I feel bad for Dong-chan.

101
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,800
I can't bear to see him.

102
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,440
I think this project is more difficult.

103
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,480
It's unprecedented for a person
with low body temperature

104
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,040
to be frozen again.

105
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,800
And that Professor Hwang needs
to start from square one,

106
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,360
so it'll take some time.

107
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,640
That's terrible.

108
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,280
What if they finally meet again
when he's 70 years old?

109
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,800
Is this funny to you?

110
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
I wasn't joking.

111
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,320
That's even more horrible.

112
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,160
My gosh.

113
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,640
Apologize to him.

114
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,400

It's our first date.

123

You need to be healthy
in order to protect your woman.

124
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,960
Did you change her name
in your contacts to Ms. Ko?

125
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,680
I said no to that already.

126
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,520
What a stubborn punk.

Mr. Ma.

128
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,840
She will persevere through this

129
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,800
and wake up miraculously.

130
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,160
At the freight cars? Are you certain?

131
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
All right.

132
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,200
I found Terry Kim.

133
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,720
The search team is there.

134
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm off.

135
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,880
I got Professor Hwang a place
to stay nearby the lab

136
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,120
since he had to focus on the project.

Nam-tae, will you be all right
sleeping alone?

138
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,120
I miss him.

139
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,960
I'll tell him to visit this weekend.

140
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,240
Eat up.

141
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,320
This looks tasty.

142
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,680
Thank you for the meal.

-Morning, did you sleep well?
-Yes.

180
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,120
I'm not going to eat. I'm late.

181
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,960
You should eat. I'll drop you off.

182
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,360
Yes. You should eat.

183
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,520
-Okay.
-Dong-chan.

184
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,400
You should have a bite as well.

185
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,440
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

186
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,040
You drank a lot yesterday. Have some soup.

187
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,400
I can't say no when you've made
hangover soup.

188
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,920
All right, then.

189
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,880
Right, Mother.
I have a company dinner tonight.

190
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,560
Don't wait up for me.

191
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,480
Not again.

192
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,880
Cut down on the alcohol.

193
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,640
-Eat up.
-Eat up.

194
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,400
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

I'm not walking.

202
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,760
Take your shoes off.
The heels are too high.

You're walking barefoot.

-You're walking.
-I'm not walking.

205

Try walking. You can do it.

206
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,920
I said, I can't walk.

207

-You won't get cranky.
-I said, are you kidding me?

I don't think you do.
You must be a swindler.

Did you call me a swindler?

After living with him,
I see how lazy he is.

He thinks he'll get a big break
and get rich.

219

You're not a chief,
so why are you so busy?

I'm so sick of you. I'm hanging up.

233

It's him.

234
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,280
He's nasty. He doesn't even shower.

238
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,320
This is unfair.

239

Is it my fault we're in the deficit?

240

They tell me to be responsible
for the low viewer ratings,

241
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,600
but I know it's just an excuse.

242

Those in power are pushing me out.

243
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,440
This isn't news. Why are you so upset?

244
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,880
When Korea gets a new president,

245
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,640
our station also gets a new president.

246

You're such an understanding person.

247
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,840
They put you in Programming Team
and took away your chief position,

248
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,800
but you don't look upset.

249
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,640
What difference would that make?

250
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,040
It'd only give me more disadvantages.

251
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,560
How did you end up like this?

252
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,160
This is the way I was born.
It's in my fortune.

253
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,360
Being in a high position
is poisonous for me.

-BBC.

257
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,200
Maybe we can do something related to BBC.

258
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,000
-Okay.
-It'll work if we have this.

259
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,200
-Let's start the meeting.
-Okay.

260
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,120
Right.

261
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,600
There was something similar to this.
This won't work.

262
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,000
How about a special
for our 50th anniversary

263
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,280
and expand our Eskimo episode?

-What candid camera?

-This did amazing on BBC.

Do you think this will work?
There are so many.

Don't grow feelings for me.

How's Dong-chan doing these days?
Is he well?

295
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,080
Of course not. He's doing bad.

296
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,120
He's my big brother,
but he feels like my baby brother.

297

Actually, ever since he returned,

298
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,920
I considered him our youngest sibling.

299

He feels responsible and sorry.

302

That's where his love bloomed.
That's how I look at it.

Why do you think that?

She's not his type.

Types don't matter.

306
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,800

I fell in love with you at first sight.

telling us to get back together.

310

I won't get back together with you.
I'm too precious.

How are you so dignified

-It makes you look charming today.
-Shut your mouth.

You're like garbage to live with.

No one knows what you're like
unless they lived with you.

315

Dong-chan has no idea.
That's why he keeps on pushing us.

316
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,000
You look normal only on the outside.

317
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
Dong-chan is smart, so he knows.

318
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,200
He's older than me,
but what would he know?

319
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,480
He shows how inexperienced he is.

320
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,800
You don't age for free.

321
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,720
The number of years you lived
shows in your life.

322

Thank you.

323
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,720

324
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,560
Yes. Do you live here?

325
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,920
Yes. It's been about two months
since I moved here.

00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,640
My little sibling lived in my place
while I was in the US.

327
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,960
They moved out a month ago,
so the mailbox was packed.

328
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,920
So you were in the US.

329
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,600
No wonder someone else was doing the news.

330
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,240
I originally planned for 2 years,
but I ended up staying 1 more year. Is

331
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,760
Is Mi-ran

332
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,960
well?

333
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,240
Yes. She's well.

334
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,800
I prayed

335
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,920
for Mi-ran every day.

336
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,680
Please help her

337
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,600
come back healthy.

338
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,880
She was put in a cryonic capsule
when her temperature was low,

339
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,720
so we must perform several clinical tests.

340
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,000
We're doing the best we can.

341
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,680
Don't worry too much.

342
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,120
Gosh, look at your collar.

343
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Mother, I have to go home today.
We have a family meeting.

344
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Dong-chan.

345
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,120
You should move back home.

346
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,880
You don't have to stay here anymore.

347
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,840
We can manage it on our own.

348
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,560
Is it because I'm a bother?

349
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Of course not.

350
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,440
Your mother must be so upset.

351
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,760
That's why I visit them every weekend.

352
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,680
Also, my two siblings are there.

353
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,960
It's fine. Don't worry.

354
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,400
You're so reliable.

355
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,080
I can see why Mi-ran liked you so much.

356
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,920
Mi-ran has high standards.

357
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,280
You're right.
She's nothing like her mother.

358
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,160
Call me if anything happens.

359
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,720
-Okay.
-I'm heading out.

360
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,880
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

361
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,400
Let's see.

362
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,640
My gosh.

363
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,320
You're going to return to school?

364
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,720
-Yes.
-Live your life to the fullest.

365
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,320
You remember what I said, right?
You only get to live your 20s once.

366
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,440
Yes, of course.
It's the same with your 30s.

367
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,920
My goodness.

368
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,520
About Mi-ran...

369
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,200
You mean, Aunt Mi-ran?

370
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,480
Is she doing well?

371
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,800
Yes, she's doing well.

372
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,440
I'm getting older every day,

373
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,560
but her time has stopped.

374
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,520
It makes me feel nervous.

375
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
Even if time passes by

376
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,600
and you become an old man,

377
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,200
her feelings for you will remain the same.

378
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,840
The one equal thing
that was given to us by the skies

379
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,080
is the time we get each and every day.

380
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,200
A poor man and a rich man

381
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,360
are both given
the same amount of time each day.

382
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,600
Mom's become sophisticated
after she started

383
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,120
taking poetry lessons
at the Lifelong Education Center.

384
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,520
Everyone in our family
should live a happy life

385
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,760
during the time we have left.

386
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,880
Right.

387
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,400
Let's all pray to the deities
we each believe in

388
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,320
and ask them to help Mi-ran
wake up as soon as possible.

389
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,520
Okay, then. Let's eat.

390
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,720
Okay, let's eat.

391
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,640
Is the interior construction
going well at the new house

392
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,200
you're planning to move into?

393
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,880
Yes, everything will be done
once they build the garden fence.

394
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,960
I see. What about your thesis?
Is that also going well?

395
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,080
I have presbyopia,

396
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,240
so it's hard to catch up
with the young ones.

397
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,400
But I'm happy,
and things are going really well.

398
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,320
I've also started composing.

399
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,960
My gosh, that's good.

400
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,880
What about you?
You're in fourth grade now.

401
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,280
How's school?

402
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
I've become more responsible,
and it's very pressuring.

403
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,280
I have more subjects to learn.

404
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,360
I'm really stressed out these days.

405
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,840
School isn't really my thing.

406
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,800
Are you still dating
that boyfriend of yours?

407
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,800
That was ages ago.
I already broke up with him.

408
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,640
I'm sorry, Uncle.

409
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,440
You're waiting
for your girlfriend to wake up.

410
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,200
I shouldn't have said that.

411
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,720
Dong-chan, when are you
going to move back in?

412
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,120
Once we move,
the house will have empty rooms.

413
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,840
You should move back in.

414
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,640
I'll move in once I get married.

415
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,680
That's why I bought that big house.

416
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,400
We're going to carry out
our last clinical trial today.

417
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,760
If this succeeds, we can wake Mi-ran up.

418
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,600
But there are still some risk factors.

419
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,240
Like what?

420
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,040
We need to inject the shot
as soon as she wakes up

421
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
to bring her body temperature
back to normal.

422
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,320
But it might be too hard for her to bear.

423
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,400
On top of that,
she also needs to receive surgery.

424
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,640
(If I could turn back time,)

425
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,080
(I would've forced you)

426
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,680
(to get the shot that day.)

427
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,680
(Every time I think about that,)

428
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,480
(it drives me crazy.)

429
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,640
(I've been trying so hard)

430
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,480
(to act like I'm okay.)

431
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,440
(Mi-ran.)

432
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,800
(I miss you so much.)

433
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,920
Dong-chan, if you air
that cryonics project on TV,

434
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,640
I won't get fired.

435
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
That project will save
our broadcasting station.

436
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,560
Can we please air the show, Dong-chan?

437
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,240
I'm not going to air the project.

438
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,760
And Mr. Kim, you should leave now.

439
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,120
But...

440
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,600
I have nothing to say either.

441
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,320
I heard you were coming back.

442
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,040
Congratulations on your return.

443
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,160
Thanks.

444
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,040
I heard the company wants you
to become chief,

445
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,680
but you're refusing to take the job.

446
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,680
I saw the news and heard about

447
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,680
the six other cryonic humans
that were able to wake up.

448
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,440
It's Mi-ran's turn now.

449
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,400
I'm sure she'll be able to wake up.

450
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,160
I know how hard this must be for you.

451
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,680
But you should trust
that everything will be okay.

452
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,120
Mi-ran

453
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,000
will overcome this no matter what.

454
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,400
Okay.

455
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,560
Here you go.

456
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
Okay, thanks.

457
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,920
Let's

458
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,120
Hello?

459
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,520
The clinical trial was a success.

460
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,920
We need to see how things develop
in the next 24 hours.

461
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,320
Thank you, Professor Hwang. Bye.

462
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,560
I need to go.

463
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,880
Does that mean

464
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,280
Mi-ran will finally be able to wake up?

465
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,800
Yes.

466
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,800
But there is a problem.

467
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,840
Not only does Mi-ran have hypothermia,

468
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,120
but she also needs to go through surgery.

469
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,280
And the problem is whether or not
she'll be able to endure it.

470
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,960
It normally takes a week
for a person to recover

471
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,080
and have their body temperatures
return to normal.

472
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,800
But for her, it'll only take a day,

473
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,640
so that will obviously
put a strain on her body.

474
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,040
What should we do?

475
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,720
I thought about what Mi-ran would do.

476
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,720
And if she had the choice to decide,

477
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,760
she would've chosen to wake up
and overcome this.

478
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,120
Yes, she would've done that.

479
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,120
Yes, of course.

480
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,560
Yes.

481
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,600
A wireless emergency switch
will be connected to her

482
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,760
for the next 24 hours.

483
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,760
She needs to enter the OR in that state.

484
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,040
We've already talked to the doctors,
and they've agreed

485
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,960
to let Professor Hwang
and Professor Jo enter the OR.

486
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,920
We'll give her the shot

487
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,880
as soon as we enter the OR.

488
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,240
And when her body temperature
returns to normal after 30 minutes,

489
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,680
she'll be put under general anesthesia

490
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,560
and undergo surgery.

491
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,040
What if her body temperature
fails to return to normal

492
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,000
in 30 minutes?

493
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,640
That won't happen.

494
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,560
We've done
more than enough clinical trials.

495
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,520
The problem is

496
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,000
whether or not her body
will be able to endure it.

497
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,560
We'll do it, Professor Hwang.

498
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,880
(Operation Time)

499
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,360
How did the surgery go?

500
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,880
Why isn't the doctor coming outside?

501
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,200
It's taking her longer than expected
to wake up from the anesthesia.

502
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,800
We're going to move her
to the Intensive Care Unit.

503
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,040
(Director Ma.)

504
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,040
(I'll be fine.)

505
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,560
(I'm going to wake up.)

506
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,160
(So don't sit there looking all sad)

507
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,760
(and cheer up.)

508
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,040
(Intensive Care Unit)

509
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,920
(Etiquettes inside
the Intensive Care Unit)

510
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,360
Her pupils are responding.

511
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,880
Let's keep an eye on her.

512
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,120
Her will to wake up
matters the most as of now.

513
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,320
Doctor.

514
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,800
May I see her?

515
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,800
No, not yet. For fear of contamination,

516
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,360
we cannot allow any visitors just yet.

517
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
I understand.

518
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,200
You should keep it.

519
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,600
All right. Don't worry too much.

520
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,800
Mi-ran is going to wake up soon,
so hang in there.

521
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,600
Okay?

522
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,720
Okay.

523
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,840
You too.

524
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,680
You know how much she loves you, right?

525
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,680
Me too. I love her very much.

526
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
Good.

527
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,040
(Date)

528
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,920
(Date)

529
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,800
(1st day at work, 1st time I kissed him)

530
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,440
(First time I kissed him.)

531
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,800
(The day he complimented me at the park.)

532
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,960
(Day one of our relationship.)

533
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,400
(The first time we went on a date.)

534
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,200
(Dating at the skating rink,
the first time calling me honey)

535
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,160
(Dong-chan's mother's birthday)

536
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,960
(Dong-chan's mother's birthday.)

537
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,400
Did you hear? Mi-ran's pupils responded.

538
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,240
-Isn't that good news?
-Of course.

539
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,960
-She'll wake up soon, then.
-She must.

540
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,920
I hope she'll be fine.

541
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,280
-I miss her.
-Me too.

542
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,160
(Intensive Care Unit)

543
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,040
Her temperature is plummeting.
Bring Professor Hwang.

544
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,040
How How bad is it?

545
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,200
It's 35.4℃. She's in danger.

546
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,680
This won't make Dong-chan leave.

547
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,160
If he refuses,

548
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,760
we need to kick him out.

549
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,360
We can't ruin that young man's life.

550
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,960
That's unacceptable.

551
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,840
Honey.

552
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,120
Honey.

553
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,120
We can't do this.

554
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
We should let him go.

555
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,440
Why are you being like this?

556
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,680
Dong-chan gave his all.

557
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,520
Since he's so kindhearted and honest,

558
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,920
Mi-ran sacrificed her life for him.

559
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,840
I'm sure this is what she wants too.

560
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,960
What are you doing?

561
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,880
-What are you doing?
-Dong-chan.

562
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,760
-You should go.
-Go where?

563
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,840
Mi-ran's going to kill me
when she wakes up. Come on.

564
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,120
Don't be like this. My gosh.

565
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,000
I asked you to get these dry-cleaned,

566
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,640
but you still haven't.

567
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,960
Gosh.

568
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,440
Also,

569
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,880
don't try to kick me out.

570
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,520
If you keep doing this, I'll get upset.

571
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,240
I need to return to
the hospital after I eat.

572
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,880
Let's eat.

573
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,120
I'm hungry.

574
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,200
Dong-chan.

575
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,080
Honey.

576
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,600
Make him some dinner.

577
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,480
(Director Ma, my temperature went up.)

578
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,040
(I think I'm going to get better.)

579
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,960
(Be patient.)

580
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,600
Professor Hwang,
could you come to the hospital?

581
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,400
Her temperature rose.

582
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,320
Did the hospital call you?

583
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,640
No, not really.

584
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,400
I just have a feeling.

585
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,240
Okay.

586
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,480
I'm on my way right now.

587
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,120
See you.

588
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,440
(Intensive Care Unit)

589
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,840
(Intensive Care Unit)

590
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,320
She has a normal body temperature.

591
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,480
She's recovering.

592
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,400
Dong-chan is running late.
Is he filming something tonight?

593
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,320
He said he was spending
the night in Jeju Island.

594
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,840
Oh, right. He's returning
tomorrow evening, right?

595
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,280
Dear me.

596
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,680
Goodness.

597
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,480
Hello?

598
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,360
What... What did you say?

599
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,040
Did...

600
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,760
Did you say our Mi-ran

601
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,960
woke up?

602
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,080
Gosh

603
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,640
The place we went to is
a volcanic cone, so it's too windy.

604
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,560
Is that so? Then we should
find a place tomorrow morning

605
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,600
-Just a second.
-Let's go see another one.

606
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,880
Which other places?

607
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,280
Hello?

608
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,560
Are you...

609
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,720
Are you serious?

610
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,360
Yes. I understand.

611
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,480
Mi-ran

612
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,800
Mi-ran woke up.

613
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,120
-Really?
-That's

614
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,440
such good news.

615
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,640
I need to go right now.

616
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,200
Dong-chan! We're on Jeju Island.

617
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,160
It's late at night.
There are no planes or boats.

618
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,360
Right.

619
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,400
You're right.

620
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,040
Hey, what time is it right now?

621
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,160
-It's...
-I'll check

622
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,400
-if anything is available.
-Right.

623
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,760
Hello?

624
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,600
Mother, did she really wake up?

625
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,800
Yes. She's talking and smiling.

626
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,240
It's like a dream, but she's awake.

627
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,000
She's walking now.
Do you want to talk to her?

628
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,600
No. No.

629
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,120
I'll go there

630
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,560
and talk to her in person.

631
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,280
Okay.

632
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,920
Excuse me, sir.

633
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,600
Could you hurry?

634
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,720
Sure.

635
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,000
Are you okay?

636
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,920
Have you been well?

637
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,040
Yes.

638
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,680
It was a little tough, though.

639
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,320
You're still so cool, Dong-chan.

640
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,200
I...

641
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,520
I missed you so much.

642
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,960
I'm cold.

643
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,640
Please warm me up.

644
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,120
The program reshuffling is tomorrow.
How can you sleep at night?

645
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,720
Hey, do you call this a proposal?

646
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,200
How can you go around
boasting about your title?

647
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,720
You. I'm talking about you.

648
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,160
Ko Mi-ran!

649
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,040
-Yes.
-Do you want to get a demotion?

650
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,040
No, of course not.

651
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,160
You were a hard worker
when you were an intern,

652
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,400
but your brain seems to have
gotten dull after your promotion.

653
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,040
How can you call this a proposal?

654
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,760
The thing is, I was frozen
then thawed, then frozen again.

655
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,560
I went back and forth,
so I don't have fresh ideas.

656
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,760
Don't make me laugh.

657
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,000
You can't call that an excuse.

658
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,720
Your attitude is the problem.

659
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,400
I'll do my best.

660
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,720
Good.

661
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,360
I'll give everyone a week.

662
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,800
Come to your senses!

663
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,000
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

664
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,640
I got us drinks.

665
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,800
Come in.

666
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,560
Okay.

667
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,840
Here. It's coffee.

668
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,200
Did my brain get dull?

669
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,920
No, no. That's not true.

670
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,360
I just I have to talk like that
in front of other people.

671
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,120
What else can I do?

672
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,160
Did I upset you?

673
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,760
Yes. I was a little upset.

674
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,920
A little?

675
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,160
No, no.

676
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,760
We have to be professional
when we're at work.

677
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,960
I know that.

678
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,800
But

679
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,200
I think I need a change.

680
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,360
Yes, I'm sure.

681
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,760
You've been 24 years old for 23 years.

682
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,560
Yes.

683
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,800
Here, drink this first.

684
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,760
It's hot.

685
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,680
What do you two plan on doing?

686
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,480
Mi-ran,

687
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,920
are you not interested
in getting married yet?

688
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,160
I'm only 24, ma'am.

689
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,840
You were 24 for a long time.

690
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,080
How are you still 24?

691
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,280
You're right.

692
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,440
I keep on missing my chance to age.

693
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,040
So? Are you telling me
you won't get married?

694
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,120
Yes.

695
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,240
I was actually planning
on going abroad to train.

696
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,760
What? What? Going abroad?

697
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,720
Our company supports full-time staff

698
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,720
to train abroad.
I was hoping I could apply.

699
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,880
Then... Then...

700
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,240
What about me?

701
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,640
If you do that, what about me?

702
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,280
-I'm sorry?
-Come on.

703
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,080
I waited three years

704
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,800
while you were in that capsule.
Don't you care about me?

705
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,680
I was able to understand women

706
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,880
who wait for their boyfriends
while they serve the army.

707
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,320
But look.

708
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,440
People serve in the army
for a year and a half these days.

709
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,400
Then I spent twice as much time.

710
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,280
How could you talk about
going abroad in front of me?

711
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,080
You're kidding, right?

712
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,560
I'm not kidding.

713
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,720
I want to study properly

714
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,720
and become a good director.

715
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,280
I need to go out and build experiences.

716
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,480
I was always stuck inside a small space.

717
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,720
If I have the chance,

718
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,200
I also want to get a master's degree
once I'm done with my studies.

719
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,120
And it might take about five years
for me to finish all that.

720
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,600
You're really selfish.
Do you only care about yourself?

721
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,080
I'll be 40 after 5 years.

722
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,920
No, you'll be 60.

723
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,800
Yes, I'll be 60.

724
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,560
Yes, you're right. You'll be 60 then.

725
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,360
You're making me get angry again.

726
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,360
Let's not fight on a happy day.
Why don't we eat first?

727
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,320
I have an idea.

728
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,280
Dong-chan, you should go abroad
and study with her.

729
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,520
Mom, I'm working on
so many projects right now.

730
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,480
I can't study abroad.
What am I going to learn?

731
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,720
Or how about this?

732
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,800
Mi-ran, how about you get married

733
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,600
and have a baby first?

734
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,960
Dong Joo will raise the baby for you.

735
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,240
Then you guys can go
study abroad together.

736
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,280
-What?
-What?

737
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,600
-What?
-Think about it.

738
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,480
That's the only solution to this problem.

739
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,560
Why would I raise Dong-chan's child?

740
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,080
Mother, you should calm down
and think more logically.

741
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,320
Mom, you're talking nonsense.

742
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,120
You make it sound like she's crazy
about studying abroad.

743
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,360
Why would she leave our child here
and leave to study abroad?

744
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,200
And you really
shouldn't be like this either.

745
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,320
It wasn't my idea.
Why are you angry at me?

746
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,160
What a mess.

747
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,400
Anyway, I personally want you guys

748
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,200
to get married before summer comes.

749
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,840
Mom, take back what you said
about making me raise their kid.

750
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,720
Mi-ran might not be
saying anything right now.

751
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,640
But I'm sure she doesn't want you
to raise her kid either.

752
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,600
-Aren't I right?
-Well, I...

753
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,440
What's that supposed to mean?

754
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,640
I never even agreed to raise her kid.

755
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,400
Then are you just
going to let your brother grow old?

756
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,240
He needs to have a kid
to carry on the family tree.

757
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,760
Let's stop for a minute.

758
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,240
Let's drop the subject for now
and eat first.

759
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,840
This isn't a light subject.
We shouldn't talk about this now.

760
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,880
You must really
want to marry her, Dong-chan.

761
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,520
Yes, of course.
Of course, I should get married.

762
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,040
I'm going to get married.

763
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,680
I'm going to get married.

764
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,880
I guess you're not angry.

765
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,200
I am angry.

766
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,720
No, you're not.
You're thinking about something.

767
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,240
Stop acting like you know me.
You don't know anything.

768
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,360
Here.

769
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,480
I wrote these diaries
while I waited for you.

770
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:56,280
I thought you might want to know
what happened while you were asleep,

771
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,320
and I did this so I could
share that time with you.

772
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,280
Do you know what I realized
while you were asleep?

773
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,200
This really isn't like me.

774
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,040
But I started to believe in fate.

775
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,200
Everything will turn out
according to our fate.

776
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,400
So let's just leave it to fate.

777
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,240
Okay.

778
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,480
-Drive safely.
-Okay.

779
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,520
(You were on my dream today.
You became the woman of my dream.)

780
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,880
(I can't forget you even in my dreams.)

781
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,600
(I'm sure the frozen fate of ours
is slowly melting now.)

782
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,720
(My life without you continues.)

783
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,040
(It's natural for me to miss you.
So I'm not going to struggle.)

784
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,680
(Missing you is
part of my every day life.)

785
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,920
(If I could turn back time,)

786
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,400
(I would've forced you
to get the shot that day.)

787
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,360
(Every time I think about that,
it drives me crazy.)

788
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,640
(Mi-ran.)

789
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,000
(I miss you so much.)

790
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,440
Hello, Chief.

791
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,480
Congratulations on your return.

792
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,240
Thank you for coming back.

793
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,800
Thank you for worrying about me.

794
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,040
-Mi-ran.
-Yes?

795
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,560
You can do what you want.

796
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,160
I support your dream.

797
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,840
I read your diaries.

798
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,320
I don't want to be apart from you anymore.

799
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,320
I can't follow you abroad.

800
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,200
You're in the process
of chasing your dream.

801
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,600
But I need to work hard where I am.

802
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,000
We need to meet in the middle.

803
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,760
I'll wait for you.

804
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,800
No, I don't want to go anymore.

805
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,880
No.

806
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,160
I can't make you give up
on your dream because of me.

807
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,080
But I don't want to be apart from you.

808
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,000
Me neither.

809
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,120
I think there might be a solution.

810
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,280
-It's understandable.
-I guess so.

811
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,000
-What a pity.
-We'll just have to support them.

812
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,360
-Hello, sir.
-Chief, what brings you here?

813
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,800
What's up?

814
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,680
Director Ma and Mi-ran are going to leave.

815
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,120
What?

816
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,520
(2 months later)

817
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,200
(Hello, everyone. Hello.)

818
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,480
(Hello.)

819
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,960
(Dong-chan and Mi-ran's Travel Vlog)

820
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,560
(Uncle, why are you making things
seem so complicated?)

821
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,960
(You should go with her
and start a YouTube channel.)

822
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,320
I think there might be a solution.

823
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,880
(We're currently in Seattle.)

824
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,600
(It's freezing here.)

825
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,640
Everyone, you should
live your lives passionately.

826
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,200
Being able to share the time
and space with our loved ones

827
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,920
is what makes us happy.

828
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,160
Thank you for your support.

829
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,520
-Bye.
-Bye.

830
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,320
Bye.

831
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,440
(And the two cryonic humans,
Dong-chan and Mi-ran,)

01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,800
(lived happily ever after.)
