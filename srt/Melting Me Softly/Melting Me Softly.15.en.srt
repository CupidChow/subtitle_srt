00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,360
I heard Dong-chan is
meeting Professor Hwang today.

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,880
Is he trying to get the shot first?

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,080
Who's that?
I thought I wasn't getting any backup.

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,840
-Wait here for a second.
-Okay.

(Police)

11
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,360
He's going to get
another shot on the sixth day.

12
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,080
We'll know if his body temperature
will return to normal

13
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,360
24 hours after he receives that shot.

Hey, are you filming everything?

00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,080
-Yes, don't worry.
-Okay.

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,000
Please roll down the window.

17
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Hello?

18
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,160
What? So what happened?

19
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,480
How's Mi-ran? Is she okay?

20
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,400
That's a relief.

21
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,480
Okay, I understand. I'll call you back.

(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

23
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,120
I want more people
at Cheongun Police Station.

24
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,280
There's going to be breaking news.
Prepare a clear photo of Terry Kim.

25
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,560
We'll see what kind of things
he could've disguised himself as.

26
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,800
I'll contact the CGI Team.

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,440
Do you feel better now?

28
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,560
Yes, how is Detective Baek?

29
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,520
Fortunately, he wasn't deeply stabbed.

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,160
So he got moved to the general ward.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,040
I'm relieved to hear that.

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,320
When did a freshman learn how to drive?

33
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,920
During vacation.

34
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,440
But I haven't practiced much,
so I can't guarantee anything.

35
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,280
Hey, forget it. I'll drive.

36
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
You're not supposed to do anything
that strains the heart.

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,120
I'll drive slowly at 60km per hour.

38
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,800
Okay.

42
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,280
Did something happen?

43
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
No.

44
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,480
What's wrong with your voice?
Do you feel sick?

45
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,280
No.

46
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,440
I'm glad to hear that everything's okay.

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,160

Terry Kim's real name is Kim Hyeon Do.

51

He stole the identity of
Jeong Ki-seok, a homeless man,

52
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,880
who disappeared and has an ID number
that starts with 801204.

53
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,120
He's been using a fake identity.

54
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,120
Make sure you reveal his face
and personal information.

55
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,360
This will be our main news topic.

56

-Okay.

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Let's go.

58
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360

I'm sorry I couldn't keep our promise.

63

Director Ma ended up
taking the shot before you.

64
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,320
This morning.

65
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,160
Mr. Ma got it first?

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Yes, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

67
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,840
He asked me not to tell you.

68
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,920
Is he doing okay right now?

69
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,280
Hello?

70
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,120
Dong-chan.

71
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,520
What's with your voice?

72
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,240
That guy got me,

73
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,240
and I'm in the hospital.

74
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,080
What? Are you seriously injured?

75
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,040
I got better now.

76
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,000
He

77
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,520
somehow got a police car

78
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,280
and pretended like he's a police officer.

79
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,440
You need to catch him soon.

80
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,520
He was

81
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,280
trying to attack Ms. Ko.

82
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,480
-What?
-Hear me out to the end.

83
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,720
But he was countered

84
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,840
by Ms. Ko and failed.

85
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,760
What about Mi-ran? Is she okay?

86
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,640
Have some for now.

87
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,240
Then we can start fighting.

88
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
You need to take some time off from work

89
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,120
until he gets caught.

90
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,600
You're the one
who needs some rest, not me.

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,280
No, I'm fine.

92
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,160
You don't look all right.

93
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,080
No, I

94
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,360
I'm fine.

95
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,320
I'm sorry,

96
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,080
but I don't think I can eat anything yet.

97
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,320
Why didn't you tell me
that you'll get the injection?

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,600
You always do everything first.

99
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,680
I thought you might do it
before me if I told you.

100
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,760
I set up an appointment and
even was going to take a day off

101
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,920
to get the injection.

102
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,680
Of course, you did.

103
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,200
But you shouldn't take a day off
but take a leave for a while

104
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,680
until he's caught.

105
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,400
No, I can't do that.

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,040
I'm going to catch him.

107
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,240
What?

108
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,400
What is this?

109
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,560
The culprit is after us.

110
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm going to spray this
whenever he shows up.

111
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,840
Hey, forget it.
Don't get involved in this.

112
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,159
My gosh. Just let the police handle this.

113
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,680
Even the police were attacked.

114
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,560
You can focus on getting better.

115
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,880
I'll catch the culprit.

116
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,920
I already attacked him first
with a stun gun,

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,920
so he probably doesn't think we're a joke.

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,560
You need to stop watching
Hollywood movies.

119
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,360
Do you think you're Wonder Woman?

120
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,760
Just stay home, will you?
Don't come to the office either.

121
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,120
Who are you trying to catch?
Are you out of your mind?

122
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,360
I'm bad at dating,
but I'm good at everything else.

123
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,680
I've done so many episodes
on "Infinite Experiment Paradise".

124
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,360
Every single fight
is about taking the lead.

125
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,960
The more I get scared,
the more he'll think I'm a joke.

126
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,240
Hey, don't be ridiculous. You aren't...

127
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,240
This is a professional killer.

128
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,440
Get the right idea about your situation.

129
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,159
Let's go home. I'll give you a ride.

130
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,440
You can't give me a ride
in that condition.

131
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll go home alone.

132
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,760
Don't be ridiculous.

133
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,760
If Mr. Ma's test results look promising,

134
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,520
then will you inject the shots
into the other two subjects as well?

135
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,360
Chairman Lee will do it

136
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,520
after he gets a little better.

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,960
We need to do this
as soon as possible for Ms. Ko.

138
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,480
She'll begin to build tolerance
against fever reducer.

139
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,360
I want to see Mr. Ma and Ms. Ko
return to their healthy condition.

140
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,200
We'll see that soon.

141
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,320
Were you here all along?

142
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,200
I'd love to be ill in your place.

143
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,840
In just a week,

144
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,960
we can do everything
that everyone else does.

145
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,560
We can go ride Disco Pang Pang
that you wanted to go on badly.

146
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,520
And?

147
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,720
And

148
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,160
we can have a cup of hot Americano.

149
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,600
-And?
-And...

150
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,680
But it won't be in a week.
It'll be in two weeks.

151
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,840
Professor Hwang told me
to get injected in a week.

152
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,040
That makes it two weeks.

153
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,320
Yes.

154
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,800
You're right.

155
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,040
(Even if you feel like throwing up,
have some food.)

156
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,320
(Professor Hwang said
you need to eat something.)

157
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,200
The first day after the injection.
It has been 12 hours,

158
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,080
but there is no change
in my body temperature.

159
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,200
My heart rate is a bit irregular.

160
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,440
And I have a serious headache.

161
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,920
I can still feel
a bit of pressure on my heart.

162
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,320
I don't feel nauseated anymore,

163
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,360
but I still need iced water.

164
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,000
I am still a cryonic human.

165
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,160
(Did you sleep well?)

166
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,520
(Yes, did you?)

167
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
(Yes.)

168
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,320
(Should I return
to the rooftop house tomorrow?)

169
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,080
(Should I return
to the rooftop house tomorrow?)

170
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,400
(Is that necessary?)

171
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,440
(Is that necessary?)

172
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,280
(I didn't fix my toilet yet.)

173
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,880
(What? I used your toilet yesterday.)

174
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,280
(What? I used your toilet yesterday.)

175
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,560
(It was fixed.)

176
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,080
(It was fixed.)

177
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,400
The second day after the injection.

178
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,360
My body temperature is 32.8℃.

179
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,760
The third day after the injection.

180
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,080
The pain in my head and chest is gone,

181
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
but I am still a bit dizzy.

182
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,880
And my body takes turns
feeling hot and cold.

183
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,200
But it feels good.

184
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,000
It feels like the injection is working.

185
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
-The change in...
-Uncle Dong-chan, come and eat.

186
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,800
Okay. Give me a moment.

187
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,920
Okay.

188
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,120
Why aren't you going to work lately?

189
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,280
Did something happen?

190
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,360
No, nothing.

191
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,840
Nothing happened.

192
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,400
Hey, Dong-sik.

193
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,720
Will you keep working at the restaurant?

194
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
I should. What can I do?

195
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,000
There's not much I can do.

196
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,200
Why don't you open up a singing class

197
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,000
for men?

198
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm sure there are men
who'd love to learn to sing.

199
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,040
I woke up after 20 years,

200
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,360
but all I see are
singing classes for housewives.

201
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,560
-Dong-chan.
-Yes?

202
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,760
Things like that will definitely fail.

203
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,520
Guys only sing when they're drunk.

204
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,040
Okay, fine.

205
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,800
Hey, you should think about
getting back with Young-tak.

206
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,160
Don't make it that simple
just because this isn't your life.

207
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,560
I'm only saying because
you look rather calm these days.

208
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,800
You need him.

209
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,240
And he's the best partner for you.

210
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,800
Young-tak isn't an idiot.
He won't take her back.

211
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,320
He might faint and get hospitalized
if he hears that.

212
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,560
Shut it. I don't want him either.
I have high standards.

213
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,480
Young-tak is at the hospital.

214
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,880
He got hurt in an accident.

215
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,040
So visit him.

216
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,320
Why did he get hurt?

217
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,360
Gosh, I really don't like him.

218
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,120
Hey, stop dating weird guys

219
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,080
and try to work it out with Young-tak.

220
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,880
When will you get married?

221
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,920
Get married? Nonsense.

222
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,080
I guess I should get married one day.

223
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,120
You should. You're 52.

224
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,000
You'll become 60 in no time.

225
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
60?

226
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,440
Is the air conditioner on in here?

227
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,200
Yes. I turned it on for you.

228
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,960
I'm cold. Turn it off.

229
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,280
-Hurry up and turn on the camera.
-Okay.

230
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Is it ready?

231
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,680
The current temperature is 33.3℃.

232
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,560
I've gone past the critical point.

233
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,680
There are no problems with my heart.

234
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,680
My hands and feet aren't numb either.

235
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,400
What's important

236
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,320
is that I finally

237
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,520
started to feel cold too.

238
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
What are you looking at?

239
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,600
Why did you decide to participate
in this experiment?

240
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,480
Don't you regret it?
It's been so difficult for you.

241
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,600
Would you do it again
if we could turn back time?

242
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,840
I should.

243
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,800
-Why?
-Because no one else will do it.

244
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,000
I should do things no one else wants to do

245
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,840
for a better tomorrow.

246
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,720
That's my calling as a director.

247
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,120
Can I treat you like my big brother?

248
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,120
Your big brother? Forget it.

249
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,400
I'm older than your dad.

250
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Then should I call you an elder?

251
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,160
Yes. This elderly
is going to the President's Office.

252
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,440
Clean up the equipment.

253
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,200
Change my name in your contacts.

254
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,280
A correspondent in Washington?

255
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,040
I told you I'm resigning.

256
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,760
Yes. I know how you feel.

257
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,599
But if you leave like this,

258
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,720
that makes you more irresponsible.

259
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,400
Of course becoming
a correspondent in Washington

260
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,640
isn't a job for a bureau chief.

261
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,360
That's why you should
consider this as a chance

262
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,640
for you to be responsible.

263
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,760
Think of it as a demotion.

264
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,840
Stay there for two years.

265
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,560
It'll make you feel better too.

266
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,880
Did you say you'll return after two years?

267
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,040
I hope we can see each other

268
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,320
as friends when I return.

269
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,480
Am I being too shameless?

270
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,360
We'll go for drinks then. As friends.

271
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,160
Take care of yourself and stay healthy.

272
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,160
I hope you'll stay happy.

273
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Thank you.

274
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,720
I'm going to become even happier.

275
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,440
I really hope so.

276
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,360
What? Why...

277
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,480
How did you know I was here?

278
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,200
Dong-chan told me.
I came because I heard you're ill.

279
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,960
Are you okay?

280
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,400
What are you doing?

281
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,720
Dong-chan promised to give me 500,000 won

282
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,560
if I send him a picture
to prove I came to see you.

283
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,880
-What?
-Stay still.

284
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,560
Smile.

285
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,280
I'm really sick.

286
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,320
Smile anyway. We're taking a picture.

287
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Bunny ears.

288
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,760
What?

289
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,240
You want me to air his face
on our channel as a commercial?

290
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,000
-Yes.
-Gosh.

291
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,640
Do you know how much that would cost?

292
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,160
Also, it would never pass deliberation.

293
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,920
We have to catch him no matter what.

294
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,560
He's a murderer who killed two people.

295
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,680
But we still can't do that.

296
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,200
It's not possible.

297
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,320
Are you still on Lee Hyeong-du's side?

298
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
What did you say?

299
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,120
Lee Hyeong-du is
targeting us even from prison.

300
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,360
Mi-ran almost got in trouble.
Don't you know what I mean?

301
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,920
Hong Suk, don't you have a conscience?

302
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,720
You should try to be responsible

303
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,480
and fix what you did wrong!

304
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,440
Dong-chan.

305
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,000
How could you...

306
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,640
-This is...
-Wait, wait.

307
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,280
My... My temperature isn't rising.

308
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,320
This...

309
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,760
My heart rate went up,
but my temperature is the same.

310
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,840
What's with him?

311
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,080
Mi-ran.

312
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,480
My temperature won't rise
even when I get agitated or mad.

313
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,200
Look.

314
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,080
-Really?
-Yes.

315
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,160
I'll make a quick trip
to see Professor Hwang.

316
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,760
Don't go home and wait here.

317
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,000
Don't go around by yourself.

318
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,400
Okay.

319
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,760
Let's shoot a teaser video
and promote it first.

320
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,320
The show's not until a month later.
Do you want to shoot a teaser now?

321
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,960
It's a strategy to secure air time.
We'll air the teaser of the new show

322
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,080
for a month on TBO.

323
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,640
We'll shoot short commentaries
outdoors like introductions.

324
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,920
It'll get people's hopes up.

325
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,240
We'll only show the backside
of the stars we're casting

326
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,600
to get people curious.

327
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,080
Mi-ran, can you get a list of the cast?

328
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,600
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

329
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,840
It'd be best if the cast
works well together.

330
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,960
Did you come back?
What did Professor Hwang say?

331
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,000
Let's go. We can talk on our way home.

332
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,960
Okay.

333
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,320
Are you cold?

334
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,400
Yes, isn't it cool?

335
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,280
Should I just get the shot tomorrow?

336
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,080
No, just wait a few more days.

337
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
It's not over until it's over.

338
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,720
Professor Hwang told me
that I need to get one last shot

339
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,360
and see how I react to that to be sure.

340
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,480
Are you really cold?

341
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,720
-Yes.
-This is so cool.

342
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,040
I'm starting to get cold
a lot easier than before.

343
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,240
I feel like my body is slowly
starting to react to the shot.

344
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,600
And this might be
the biggest change I've experienced

345
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,000
ever since I got the shot.

346
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,000
My current body temperature is 34.7°C.

347
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,280
My goodness.

348
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,840
Hey, Mi-ran's smart with many things.

349
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,160
But she's not so clever
when it comes to Director Ma.

350
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,960
She doesn't know
how to take control of her man.

351
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,800
It's because she likes him.

352
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,560
I think she really likes him.

353
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,760
Do you think so?

354
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,400
Just a second.

355
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,240
Hey, honey.

356
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,160
I was just having a conversation
with my friend

357
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,600
about life, society, and culture.

358
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,480
I love you too.

359
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,280
Don't work too much
but earn a lot of money.

360
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,920
Okay?

361
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,720
I'll call you later.

362
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,000
My gosh.

363
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,800
You only just met him, and you're
already telling him you love him?

364
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,960
Back in the days,

365
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,200
guys used to approach me
whenever they got the chance.

366
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,080
But dating at our age
isn't an easy thing to do.

367
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,240
I should make the best of it.

368
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,000
Mom, I'm home.

369
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,960
-Hey, Aunt.
-Did you eat?

370
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,200
I ate with my coworkers and Mi-ran.

371
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,880
She's your mom, I'm your aunt,

372
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,360
and Mi-ran's your friend?

373
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,720
This is really complicated. It really is.

374
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,320
Are you having fun at work?

375
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,120
Yes.

376
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,120
Being a director seems really cool.

377
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,160
I'm going to be a great director
just like Director Ma Dong-chan.

378
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,640
Ma Dong-chan? Mi-ran's boyfriend?

379
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,520
You guys have
such a peculiar relationship.

380
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,160
What do you think about
getting frozen in a cryonic capsule?

381
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,600
What do you mean?

382
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,520
I mean, you're going through
a hard time right now.

383
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,360
Haven't you ever wanted

384
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,160
to escape reality

385
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,240
and start a new life in a better future?

386
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,480
No.

387
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,160
I may have gotten a divorce,

388
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,560
but I'm happy

389
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,320
thanks to my son.

390
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,240
Watching you grow up like this

391
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,600
is the source of my happiness.

392
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,680
What's the use of waking up in 20 years?

393
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,280
I wouldn't be able to see you grow up.

394
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,080
And not much will be different
after 20 years

395
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,560
or any other time in the future.

396
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,760
It's like postponing your homework.

397
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,000
Life is all about suffering anyway.

398
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,400
What about you?
Would you enter the capsule?

399
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,080
No, I also feel happy

400
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,320
being able to live
in the same time period as you.

401
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,240
I've raised an incredible son.

402
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,680
Nice.

403
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,600
I went jogging today,
and I'm completely fine.

404
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,520
I'm serious.

405
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,320
By the way,

406
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
what should we do today? It's our day off.

407
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,400
-Do you feel okay?
-It's really cool here.

408
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,920
-I see.
-Isn't it cold there?

409
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,240
No, not at all.

410
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,320
Will you close the door? It's freezing.

411
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,320
-It's cold.
-What are you doing?

412
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
-I'm sorry.
-It's freezing.

413
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,000
-I'm sorry.
-You've been keeping it open.

414
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,360
-What's with you?
-Seriously.

415
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,760
-I'm sorry.
-My goodness.

416
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
My gosh.

417
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,240
Are you that cold? You could stay outside.

418
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,840
No, I'm not cold.

419
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,240
And...

420
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,400
And you can't be alone.

421
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,320
Make sure you take me with you
wherever you go.

422
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,080
Even when you go outside to buy sikhye.

423
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,400
You're not fully cured yet.

424
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,480
What if you catch a cold?

425
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,240
That shouldn't happen.

426
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,280
See? You should wait outside.

427
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,040
No, I can't do that either.

428
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
I should warm myself up.

429
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,240
I'll rub my hands.

430
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,120
Gosh, I can't do this.

431
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,720
You know what?
Let's just go somewhere else.

432
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,360
Where?

433
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,600
Just follow me.

434
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,080
Is there anything else you want to do?

435
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,560
There are loads of stuff.

436
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,920
Like what?

437
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,320
I want to take you for a ride
on a bicycle.

438
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,880
And I want to go to a proper sauna.

439
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,200
I also want to go see the stars with you.

440
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Just wait a bit more.

441
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,000
Let's do everything
we want to do together, okay?

442
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,640
Okay.

443
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,240
Hey, stop it.
Your body temperature will rise.

444
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,360
I got myself a hot cup of coffee.

445
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,120
My gosh, that's nice and warm.

446
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,400
That looks so nice.

447
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
You traitor.

448
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
This is good too.

449
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,920
You'll soon be able to drink
something warm as well.

450
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,840
Director Ma, let's go home now.

451
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,120
You want to go home already?

452
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,160
We don't have much time
until we shoot "Go Go 99" again,

453
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,360
so I have a lot of work to do.

454
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,320
I need to go to the office.

455
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
So you should go home
and spend time alone.

456
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,320
You want me to go home
and spend time alone?

457
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,600
My gosh, you're really cold-hearted.

458
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,200
Of course. I'm a cryonic human.

459
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,280
I should get some drinks for my teammates.

460
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,240
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

461
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,280
-Bye.
-Thank you.

462
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,720
Let's go.

463
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,200
I'll come pick you up once you're done.

464
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,440
No, it's okay.
The police promised to come.

465
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,240
You don't need to worry.

466
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,640
You should go home before midnight.

467
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,800
I'm not Cinderella.

468
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,320
You should go now.

469
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,520
Let's wait like seniors

470
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,480
who are waiting for their KSATs.

471
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,640
-Okay.
-Okay.

472
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,560
-I'll be off now.
-Okay.

473
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,080
The fifth day.
My body temperature won't go up anymore.

474
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,520
There's no change in my temperature.
Will it be all right?

475
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,920
You just got injected with
the final shot. Let's wait and see.

476
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,160
This is the final step in returning
to your normal temperature.

477
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,640
Things may get pretty tough today.

478
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,240
We cannot use more drugs on you today.

479
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,680
You must
live through this all by yourself.

480
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,360
Don't worry.

481
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,240
Hello?

482
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,400
I'm in regret right now.

483
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,000
About what?

484
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,040
I should have followed you
no matter what you said.

485
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,320
I should've been there with you.

486
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,360
I know you miss me,
but hold yourself back.

487
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,040
And don't be worried either.

488
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,400
Go home early.

489
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,200
Tell me if you're in pain.
I'll run over right away.

490
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,280
Okay. I'm completely fine.

491
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,560
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

492
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,520
I'm a bit sleepy right now.

493
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,680
I have to go to sleep.

494
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,400
Okay.

495
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,280
Let me know if it gets too tough. Okay?

496
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,880
Okay.

497
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,400
Here.

498
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,360
Thank you.

503
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,679
Dong-chan has been weird lately.

504
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,639
He's always in his room
muttering to himself.

505
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,800
And he sleeps so much, doesn't he?

506
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,960
He keeps on sleeping
like he's a 100-day-old baby.

507
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,360
In movies that deal with cryonic humans,

508
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,000
they sometimes age overnight, right?

509
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,600
That's not his case, is it?

510
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,280
That can't happen.

511
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,920
It can't. That's just too unfair.

513
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,120
Hello?

514
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,800
Mi-ran, I...

515
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,720
Right now, I...

516
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
I'm

517
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,360
at 36.5℃ right now.

518
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
Really?

519
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,840
You're really at 36.5℃ right now?

520
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,560
This is great.

521
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,840
I'm so glad.

522
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,640
Mi-ran.

523
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,920
I'm sorry and thank you.

524
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,760
At first,

525
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,000
it seemed hopeless,
unfair, and devastating.

526
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,600
But come to think about it now,
there were good things too.

527
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,000
Like what?

528
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,240
You.

529
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,720
Thanks to this, we got to share

530
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,680
the time that only we know about.

531
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,480
And

532
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,680
we fell in love too.

533
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,720
Wait just a little more.

534
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,480
We'll be able to live

535
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,200
just like everyone else.

536
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,440
I have the test result.

537
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,000
Everything looks normal.

538
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,320
(Test Result)

539
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
We did it.

540
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,360
Congratulations.
You finally became a normal human.

541
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,320
Thank you.
Then can Mi-ran be injected soon?

542
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,720
If she's up for it,
I'll prepare it right away.

543
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,920
Yes, I'll talk to Mi-ran.

544
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,160
Let me tell my family about it.

545
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,360
You were born again today.

546
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,800
Have a bite.

547
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,480
Okay.

548
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,400
It's really good, Mom.

549
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,920
It's not hot anymore.

550
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,840
Thank you, my son.

551
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,440
Thank you, Mom, for waiting.

552
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,440
Congratulations, Dong-chan.

553
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,240
You never even had a drop
of alcohol. It must've been tough.

554
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,360
You aren't a frozen human anymore.

555
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,960
You can't make a YouTube channel anymore.

556
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,200
Dong-chan, we should go to the sauna.

557
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,800
We can rub each other's backs
and sweat off our fatigue.

558
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,280
-Let's do that, okay?
-Okay, sauna sounds great.

559
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,040
After the sauna, let's grab a drink.

560
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,640
Let's have all the drinks
that you couldn't have to this day,

561
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,040
and let's get wasted.

562
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,560
Aunt Dong-ju, stop trying to
use him as an excuse to drink.

563
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,280
I'll tell Grandma all about it.

564
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,920
Don't be so naughty.

565
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,160
Quiet down, everyone.

566
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,160
Be quiet so Dong-chan can eat.

567
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,360
-Eat up, now. Eat up.
-Okay.

568
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,400
Eat up.

569
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,600
You should get the shot tomorrow.

570
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,360
We're shooting the teaser tomorrow,
so I'll get it the day after.

571
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,960
Work isn't important right now.

572
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,080
Did you forget who got me

573
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,280
to become passionate
about being a director?

574
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,400
Are you serious? Then

575
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,360
I'll play your bodyguard
until the suspect is caught.

576
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,320
Tell me where the shoot is tomorrow.

577
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,680
Are you coming to the shoot?

578
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,440
Yes. I'm going to go.

579
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,280
It's so frustrating to watch
how your team works.

580
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,360
By the way, why are you wearing
this watch? You don't need it.

581
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,960
When you become 36.5℃, we'll get

582
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,400
matching watches.

583
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,120
Okay.

584
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,240
Gosh.

585
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,120
Can you check the times
on the video files in here?

586
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,000
Yes.

587
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,680
Are you going somewhere?

588
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,320
Yes. I have to go somewhere.

589
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,320
Are you saying

590
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,680
that you have

591
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
normal body temperature now?

592
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,560
Yes.

593
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,840
My goodness.

594
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,520
Your hand is really warm.

595
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,000
It's warm.

596
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,200
If Mi-ran gets her shot,

597
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,880
she'll become normal just like me

598
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,040
in one week.

599
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,240
Yes!

600
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,520
Does that mean she's not
a cryonic person anymore?

601
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,200
That's right.

602
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,880
You went through
so much trouble, haven't you?

603
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,120
I was shameless.
I never apologized to you properly.

604
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,040
Mi-ran

605
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,240
will be able to live
like other ordinary people.

606
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,840
Please just wait a week.

607
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,720
Thank you so much.

608
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,800
Please forget about

609
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,360
how much we hated

610
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,320
and resented you.

611
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,720
Don't worry about it,

612
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,400
Mother and Father.

613
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,040
I'm

614
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,280
the world's first cryonic man,
Ma Dong-chan.

615
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,200
Hello?

616
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,280
I have a package I want to send.

617
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,880
The receiver's name is Ma Dong-chan.

618
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,240
Yes. I'll give you the address.

619
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,480
Please come this way.

620
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,080
Put the props behind the camera.

621
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,240
-Okay, okay.
-Take them away.

622
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,320
(Let's go to 1999!)

623
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,200
This is getting in the shot, so go higher.

624
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,680
Can you check this one?

625
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,240
-Are you feeling less nervous?
-Yes.

626
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,080
When you use the stage,
make sure you spread out.

627
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,640
Please step back a little bit.

628
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,120
They have so much time.

629
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,640
Why are they shooting the teaser already?

630
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,960
I guarantee you

631
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,200
the teaser will be completely
different from the actual show.

632
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,160
-Mi-ran! Mi-ran!
-Blood! Blood!

633
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,680
What happened?

634
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,200
-Hey.
-Are you okay?

635
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,320
Ko Mi-ran!

636
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,520
Hey! Wake up.

637
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,760
Mi-ran.

638
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,120
Hey. Please help.

639
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,720
-Call 911!
-Please help!

640
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,680
Be careful.

641
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,920
That way.

642
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,320
Put pressure on the wound,
and check her BP.

643
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,440
(Emergency Center)

644
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,560
Mi-ran

645
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,840
The wound better not be too deep.

646
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,240
It's impossible to perform surgery on her.

647
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,440
I know.

648
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,720
Once she gets anesthesia,
her blood vessels will expand,

649
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,360
and her body temperature
will drop even more.

650
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,880
It takes a week for her

651
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,560
to regain her normal body temperature.

652
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,200
She needs to hang in there for a week.

653
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,360
If she doesn't...

654
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,280
The wound is deep.

655
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,200
Doctor, her temperature is 31.5℃.

656
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,920
We need to perform
an emergency ventrotomy.

657
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,320
It's not possible
to perform surgery on her.

658
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,200
She's a special patient
with low body temperature.

659
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,040
You can't give her any anesthesia.

660
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,560
Will you be able to operate on her

661
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,240
when her body temperature returns?

662
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,280
Is it possible to get
her temperature back right now?

663
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,200
Even if it's not completely
back to normal,

664
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,680
wouldn't you be able to operate on her

665
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,560
if she's around 33℃?

666
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,080
If she can't get anesthesia,
we can't operate on her.

667
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,520
If she doesn't get surgery,

668
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,560
how long will she be able to hold on?

669
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,280
Her heart might stop

670
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,720
within the next 24 hours.

671
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,520
Honey.

672
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,560
Director Ma. There is only one way.

673
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,520
We have to make a decision.

674
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,720
She has to

675
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,400
go back into a cryonic capsule.
That's the only way.

676
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,840
When she does,

677
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,760
it'll stop the flow of her blood.

678
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,960
Even if she doesn't get
operated on right away,

679
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,880
we'll be able to stop her from bleeding.

680
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,160
But when she gets thawed,
she'll start bleeding again.

681
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,760
So we need her body

682
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,760
to be in a state where it can

683
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,680
endure the surgery
as soon as she gets thawed.

684
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,320
But her body temperature
will still be low.

685
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,920
Yes.

686
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,040
So we're going to develop a medicine
that will enable her body

687
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,560
to return to its normal temperature
as soon as she gets thawed.

688
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,440
I'll develop it.

689
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,560
I'll risk everything I have
to make sure I develop it.

690
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,760
I trust you.

691
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,320
I trust you, Director Ma.

692
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,440
Ma'am, I'm...

693
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,480
I'm sorry.

694
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,800
I'm sorry.

695
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,200
I'm sorry.

696
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,840
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha-young)

697
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,000
How did it go?

698
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,800
They had to put Mi-ran
back into the cryonic capsule.

699
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,200
She couldn't receive surgery
because she didn't have

700
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,800
normal body temperature.

701
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,480
Okay, you can go.

702
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,960
Okay.

703
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,240
(If I ever)

704
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,360
(enter the capsule again,)

705
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,800
don't join me.

706
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,280
If something like that happens to me,

707
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,920
protect me from outside the capsule.

708
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,400
Okay?

709
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,040
(Don't worry about that.
Why would I enter another capsule?)

710
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,640
Over my dead body.

711
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,120
(Ko Mi-ran)

712
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,280
(You'll never match up to me
because I like you a lot more.)

713
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,560
(You'll never match up to me)

714
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,280
(because I like you a lot more.)

715
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,080
(Melting Me Softly)

716
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,160
I'm sorry you have to be
in the cold all by yourself.

717
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,720
(Is Mi-ran doing well?)

718
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,320
(It seems like I was born to love him.)

719
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,080
(He makes my life complete.)

720
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,280
(That's how much I love him.)

721
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,360
(If only I could turn back time)

722
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,880
(Mi-ran.)

723
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,640
(I miss you so much.)
