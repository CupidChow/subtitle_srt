THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL

TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,978
<i>The next stop is</i>

4
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:46,271
<i>Maju Station.</i>

5
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:53,278
<i>Please check your belongings</i>
<i>and have a good day.</i>

6
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,835
This may be a rural area,

7
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,587
but you can't find a place like this
with that money.

8
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,968
By the way, if you're 18,

9
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,429
even if you're mature for your age,

10
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,973
you're kind of young to live alone.

11
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,266
-Your parents are...
-They passed away.

12
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,437
Goodness.

13
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,938
Then what brings you here?

14
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,108
It's my mom's hometown.

15
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,234
Is that so?

16
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,694
What was her name?

17
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:24,162
- I'll take it.
- Sure, okay.

18
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,163
Great choice.

19
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:28,123
Let's see.

20
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:32,086
I'll bring the contract from my house.

21
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,296
We just need to sign it.

22
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,757
I'll come to your house.

23
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,759
Wouldn't that be right? Let's go.

24
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,098
They're shooting it in the middle
of the day now.

25
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,228
Unbelievable.

26
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,275
I'm sure you'll come to find out,
but this is a great neighborhood to live.

27
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,610
It's rural,
but it's still a part of Maju City.

28
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,570
We're not county residents. Right?

29
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:19,425
That's Kangoh Group's third son.

30
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:22,971
I think the eldest came too.

31
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:25,223
I guess he's staying at home today.

32
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:27,850
Then again,

33
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,394
he's an illegitimate child,
what use is he?

34
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,562
That's why he was confined here.

35
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,942
Goodness.

36
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,569
Young Master Inha
goes to Kangoh High School.

37
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,697
How old are you? I mean, what grade?

38
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,781
No, wait.

39
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,992
Forget everything I said.

40
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,411
You didn't hear anything from me, okay?

41
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:48,913
Let's go.

42
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,187
Like this!

43
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,362
HIRING

44
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:49,367
I'm sorry, but we don't hire
high school kids.

45
00:06:50,158 --> 00:06:52,286
I see.

46
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:55,038
Instead of here,

47
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:57,542
there's a restaurant called Hanwoowok.
Try there.

48
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,627
I think they were looking to hire someone
to man the grills.

49
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:04,423
Thank you.

50
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:12,014
There we go.

51
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:35,413
It gets hectic during dinner time,
so never be late.

52
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,749
-Yes, sir. Thank you.
-Yeah, see you later.

53
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:40,918
HANWOOWOK

54
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,389
FRESH FRUIT

55
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:56,433
What are you looking at?

56
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,300
I saw you at the convenience store.

57
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:34,263
You should leave a review
if you enjoyed it.

58
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,682
You saw me do it.

59
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:39,309
How was I?

60
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:41,479
Are you embarrassed?

61
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,650
Ah. Here in Maju, they pretend
not to see anything I do.

62
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,570
They pretend not to know.
It's like an unwritten rule.

63
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,161
-I have no reason to be embarrassed.
-You are embarrassed.

64
00:08:58,328 --> 00:09:00,623
Because I saw you
and I don't care about the rules.

65
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,333
- What are you saying?
- Let me tell you.

66
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:07,087
Those people aren't pretending
not to know.

67
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,548
They don't need to pretend.

68
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:11,884
-What?
-It's almost like...

69
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:16,681
-you're invisible.
-We just met. That's rude.

70
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,311
If you're going to be rude,
you should apologize.

71
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,230
Do you want attention?

72
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:26,731
That's not an apology.

73
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,486
Steal something bigger
if you want attention.

74
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,447
Not worthless trash.

75
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:37,868
Isn't this tip better...

76
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:40,538
rather than an apology?

77
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,432
Up.

78
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:09,734
Jab then knee up!

79
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:14,196
Steal something bigger
if you want attention.

80
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,658
<i>Not worthless trash.</i>

81
00:10:17,741 --> 00:10:18,993
<i>Isn't this tip better...</i>

82
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,370
rather than an apology?

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,793
Let's go. Cham cham cham!

86
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,340
- Why is it two?
- You're making dust fly!

87
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,474
-Cham cham cham!
-Settle!

88
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,726
- Cham, cham, cham!
- What?

89
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:45,811
What's this?

90
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,690
Hey, sit down.

91
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,110
Come on in.

92
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,743
He's a new transfer.

93
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:02,410
Introduce yourself.

94
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:04,746
My name...

95
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,124
is Han Taeoh.

96
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,044
Can he not speak?

97
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:14,423
-Is that all?
-That was simple and nice.

98
00:11:15,173 --> 00:11:17,551
There's an empty seat in the back.

99
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:18,635
Go sit there.

100
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:21,263
Now.

101
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,974
Every cloud has a silver lining.

102
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,061
We're close to having a top student
in our class.

103
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,144
Our transfer student

104
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,731
scored in the top 0.1% nationwide
on the mock test.

105
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:43,994
Go eat somewhere else.

106
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,078
Get lost.

107
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,956
Punk.

108
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:49,125
What is this?

109
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,668
- It looks good.
- It's terrible.

110
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,921
It's strange.

111
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,351
-What are you doing?
-I just don't like you.

112
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:47,557
What the hell?

113
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,268
That was so cool!

114
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,739
Hey, kill him!

115
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:06,576
What's going on?

116
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:08,537
Kill him! Get him!

117
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,707
Stop!

118
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,629
What are you two doing?

119
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:34,647
LETTER OF APOLOGY

120
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,525
What? Why don't you show off again?

121
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,235
Call me invisible again.

122
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,696
Give me another tip.

123
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,573
Hey, Inha.

124
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,784
The teacher said you can go.

125
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:50,203
Okay.

126
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,209
The invisible man is leaving.

127
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,379
Good luck.

128
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,143
Damn it.

129
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,855
He told him to go too?

130
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,482
The vice principal kept going on
about sending you home so he did,

131
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:21,902
but he had to send Taeoh home too.

132
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,405
<i>The invisible man is leaving.</i>
<i>Good luck.</i>

133
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,200
That's so embarrassing. Damn it.

134
00:14:28,908 --> 00:14:30,870
-Get off.
-What? What about the movie?

135
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:32,663
I'm busy! Get off!

136
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:55,769
Why didn't you go home?

137
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,524
Didn't you get the message to go home?

138
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,581
Hello?

139
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,687
Hey!

140
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,833
I'm sorry, but can you hurry?

141
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,822
Use a watermelon!

142
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:32,323
He should re-enlist.

143
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,408
Hey.

144
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,703
That's enough.

145
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:57,807
Wow!

146
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:23,709
Kang Inju! Kang Inju!

147
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,355
Mom.

148
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:53,197
Run away.

149
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:00,828
Just...

150
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,041
Just leave right now!

<i>Son, you know, don't you?</i>

153
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:43,872
<i>You know I didn't kill your mother.</i>

154
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,376
She's alive and well.

155
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:52,506
Go and tell her.

156
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:56,300
Tell her not to let her guard down
because I'm in here.

157
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,346
<i>My boys left to find her,</i>

158
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,638
<i>and I'll see her soon.</i>

159
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,766
<i>Right.</i>

160
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:04,852
We should meet too.

161
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:07,688
I miss my son...

162
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,066
<i>so very much.</i>

163
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,878
You, this way. You, that way. Go quickly.

164
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:32,962
Hurry up!

TEAM MAD DWAG'S TUITION FEES

167
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,577
Why? Are you going to learn
to fight to beat me up?

168
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,211
Do they teach you how to kill someone?

169
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,257
-That's what I need.
-You're crazy.

170
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,467
Forget it.

171
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:26,599
You want me to teach you?

172
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:30,979
But...

173
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,232
I'll teach you if you beat me.

174
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,238
Put it on.

175
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:48,222

176
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,976
<i>so very much.</i>

177
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,228
<i>We should meet too.</i>

178
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,067
Are you okay?

179

<i>- No! Taeoh!</i>
<i>- What the hell did you say?</i>

181
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,744
Not Taeoh! No!

182
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,621
Not Taeoh!

183
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:12,788
- No!
- Move!

184
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,541
- Taeoh!
- Aren't you sleepy?

185
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,294
<i>- Shall I put you down?</i>
<i>- Honey!</i>

186
00:22:17,376 --> 00:22:19,337
<i>No, no!</i>

187
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,634
Hey! Stop!

188
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,761
Stop, you bastard!

189
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,183
Stop!

190
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,907
Oh.

191
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,286
You nutjob.

192
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,790
Am I the one you want to kill?

193
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,172
I'm so hungry.

194
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,924
Want to get burgers?

195
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,804
I won, so I'm buying.

196
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:14,809
Let's go again.

197
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:18,230
I surrender!

198
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:21,316
You won!

199
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:41,294
Bye.

200
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,046
- Friends...
- Nope.

201
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,548
I didn't finish yet.

202
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,924
I don't want anything you're about to say.

203
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:51,054
I don't want to be your friend either.

204
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:52,638
It was about the burger!

205
00:23:52,721 --> 00:23:55,599
I was going to tell you to pay me back!

206
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:57,477
How rude!

207
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,396
Hey! You'd better pay me back!

208
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,731
Pay me back, jerk! So annoying!

209
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:18,164
Friend?

210
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:36,098
<i>Hey!</i>

211
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:37,433
Hey, Inha!

212
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,934
Did you hear the news?

213
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:41,645
Your face...

214
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:43,815
- What about it?
- It looks swollen.

215
00:24:43,898 --> 00:24:46,902
- I know.
- What? Hear what?

216
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:48,153
That's right!

217
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,613
It's about Taeoh.

218
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,740
His dad killed his mom!

219
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,450
Stop lying!

220
00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:55,410
- His dad killed his mom?
- Stop lying.

221
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:57,369
- There you go again.
- A murderer's son?

222
00:24:57,453 --> 00:24:58,913
Why would I lie?

223
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,250
So what?

224
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,835
It's so brutal.

225
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,212
He's the son of a murderer!
Are you kidding me?

226
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,089
By chance, do you talk about me too?

227
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,010
That I'm a bastard who can't even
call his dad, "dad".

228
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,640
Why would you bring that up now?

229
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:19,558
You ran in here like this before
and told the other kids.

230
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,186
"Hey! Inha's a bastard!

231
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:24,146
"That's why he's abandoned here!"

232
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:32,989
You can never keep your mouth shut.
Is it because you're a lowly nobody?

233
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,535
-That's kind of harsh.
-Yeah, I'm allowed to be.

234
00:25:38,118 --> 00:25:40,538
I'm a very luxurious bastard.

235
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,669
The son of a distribution center's
security chief is nothing compared to me.

236
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:49,256
The person way up there is my creator.

237
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:52,174
Who's your creator?

238
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,263
He's just a servant
that gets paid by my creator.

239
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:08,316
Don't mind him. Let's go.

240
00:26:19,702 --> 00:26:20,828
I don't.

241
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,414
You're the one who's bothered.

242
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,780
I bet the other kids are chatting away.

243
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,659
They're like hyenas.

244
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,625
What're you listening to?

245
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,467
What song is this?

246
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,928
-My mom's song.
-Is your mom a singer?

247
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:20,012
You're crazy.

248
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,267
My mom listened to it everyday.

249
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,477
Ah.

250
00:27:26,185 --> 00:27:29,021
I've listened to it so much
that the tape wore out.

251
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,026
That kind of song.

252
00:27:41,492 --> 00:27:43,369
Don't you want to know if it's true?

253
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,538
Not really.

254
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,876
He's not my biological father.

255
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,921
The cause was domestic violence.

256
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,383
He's been sentenced to death
and is in prison.

257
00:27:56,465 --> 00:27:59,885
- Wow.
- Are you scared?

258
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,471
Not really.

259
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,891
You're not a killer
and I've never met your father.

260
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,857
-Let's be friends.
-Are you doing me a favor?

261
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,652
You said you didn't want to.

262
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:17,487
How ridiculous.

263
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,491
Let me rephrase, instead of friends,
let's be partners.

264
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,868
Do you want to be bullies or something?

265
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:26,328
That's so childish.

266
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:29,790
I don't plan on playing
in the minor leagues forever.

267
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:32,876
So, I'm going to use you.

268
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:35,880
You'll be my rope that'll help me reach...

269
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:37,923
the major leagues.

270
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,345
In return,

271
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,347
I'll help you get what you want.

272
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,976
What I want?

273
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:52,146
What's that?

274
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:53,856
Whatever it is.

275
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,028
Who do you think you are?

276
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:01,655
With what power?

277
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,199
Top 0.1%?

278
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,201
You're just a smart bum.

279
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,327
I'm not a bum.

280
00:29:08,454 --> 00:29:09,455
Han Taeoh.

281
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:13,542
The power you speak of.
It's not a big deal to me.

282
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,837
I have something better.

283
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,133
Desperation.

284
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,397
Will it be possible for me to go to...

285
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:39,443
-Hanguk University with you?
-My smarts,

286
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:42,154
top 0.1% in the nation.

287
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:44,907
I'll give it to you.

288
00:29:45,991 --> 00:29:47,743
We just have to decide what we'll do,

289
00:29:48,577 --> 00:29:49,828
and what we want to do.

290
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,500
Together.

291
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,698
<i>We will depart shortly.</i>
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

292
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,082
Let's each pick a problem

293
00:30:34,164 --> 00:30:35,834
that we solved today.

294
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:37,460
Who wants to go first?

295
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,173
Come on.

296
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,815
â™Ş <i>Happy birthday to you â™Ş</i>

297
00:32:22,898 --> 00:32:26,486
â™Ş <i>Happy birthday dear Han Taeoh</i>
<i>who just showered â™Ş</i>

298
00:32:26,568 --> 00:32:28,070
â™Ş <i>Happy birthday to you â™Ş</i>

299
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:29,364
Whoo!

300
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:31,990
I told you not to do it this year.

301
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,410
Shut up and blow it out.
This was expensive.

302
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,205
Ah!

303
00:32:38,914 --> 00:32:39,915
Your wish!

304
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:44,420
I throw you a birthday party
and you complain. Uh!

305
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:53,136
A report on industrial organization
and this week's lecture notes.

306
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,596
I color-coded it by importance.

307
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,266
The details are inside. Take a look.

308
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,317
This is why I can't help but love you.

309
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,239
Now.

310
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,450
BISUN-RO, JONGRO, SEOUL

311
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,414
That's my birthday gift to you.

312
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,541
The address to Bisunjae.

313
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,877
I recommended you to tutor Huiju in math
to Mr. Moon.

314
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,798
I did good, didn't I?

315
00:33:30,424 --> 00:33:31,425
I'm the best, right?

316
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,848
So what are you going to do today?

317
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,018
-I'm going to school.
-After that.

318
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,144
Work.

319
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,813
Study, money, study, money, study, money.

320
00:33:43,895 --> 00:33:45,772
Live a little, man!

321
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:49,777
You have to read it
before I turn in the report, okay?

322
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,319
Stop nagging!

323
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,075
Try this.

324
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,953
The color is different. It looks good.

325
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:03,249
Hey, this too.

326
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,875
This is lamb.

327
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:16,012
Will your father
make the announcement today?

328
00:34:16,094 --> 00:34:17,346
What announcement?

329
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,849
Who he'll appoint
to the Future Strategy Office.

330
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:21,434
Who do you think? It's me.

331
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:25,938
Don't just assume,
and try to get a concrete answer.

332
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:28,983
What if they use media manipulation
against us?

333
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,110
They won't. They're scared of Father.

334
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:33,945
The same goes for them.

335
00:34:35,655 --> 00:34:36,657
Ah.

336
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,112
Yes, sir.

337
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,530
- It's due tomorrow.
- Okay.

338
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,489
Hey, Taeoh.

339
00:35:17,572 --> 00:35:19,867
Professor Choi Dongwuk's looking for you.

340
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:21,744
Bye.

341
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:31,838
Hey, come on in. Sit.

342
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,757
Let's see.

343
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,844
Do I have anything to offer you?

344
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,349
There's not much to being a professor.

345
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,398
I called to compliment you on this report.

346
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,483
I randomly chose the title.

347
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,278
The key points in your report

348
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,989
points out the future strategy
for Kangoh, right?

349
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,201
-Yes.
-To be honest, I got a thesis proposal

350
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:04,704
from Kangoh Economic Research Institute.

351
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,746
But with the report you wrote,

352
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:10,458
it narrowed it down
to the one thing they want.

353
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,295
<i>"Co-prosperity Cooperation Center."</i>

354
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:16,798
"Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center"?

355
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,094
It's a sort of business unit
for acquisitions and investments

356
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:21,804
in various startup sectors.

357
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,974
Of course,
investments are just the pretext.

358
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,059
The key is merger and acquisition.

359
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:31,813
<i>Let me buy this report.</i>

360
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,775
How much do you want?

361
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:40,739
I'll hold onto the cost of...

362
00:36:42,782 --> 00:36:44,409
the report for my future.

363
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:55,213
<i>The key you were looking for.</i>

364
00:36:55,295 --> 00:36:57,088
<i>I think I got my hand on it.</i>

365
00:36:59,007 --> 00:37:01,302
This will be a new power for Kangoh Group.

366
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,264
It will open a new era for Kang Seongju.

367
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:08,601
FUTURE STRATEGY FOR KANGOH

368
00:37:19,402 --> 00:37:21,322
KANGOH GROUP, RANKED 9TH IN THE WORLD

369
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,242
ASK CHAIRMAN KANG JOONGMO
AND SENIOR DIRECTOR KANG SEONGJU

370
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:29,579
KANGOH GROUP

371
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,798
A BLUEPRINT
FOR KANGOH'S SUCCESSION STRUCTURE

372
00:37:42,217 --> 00:37:43,219
INJU OR SEONGJU?

373
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,387
WHO'LL BE THE DIRECTOR OF
FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE?

374
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,440
THE TWO BROTHER'S SUCCESSION PLAN
HAS BEGUN

375
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,092
Oh. Wait.

376
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,016
Are you pretending not to know me?

377
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:33,978
We're neighbors
and we're in the same department.

378
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:37,148
I think that's enough
for you to act like you know me.

379
00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:43,237
Hey.

380
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,659
Your coffee.

381
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,163
Ah. I don't drink coffee.

382
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,958
And my name's not "hey."

383
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:57,876
It's Na Hyewon.

384
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,427
Let's go eat.

385
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:12,432
I'm hungry! Come on!

386
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,942
Don't be too discouraged.

387
00:39:24,152 --> 00:39:26,112
That doesn't mean do whatever you want.

388
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,284
You're not going like that, are you?

389
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,873
-Why?
-First impressions matter at Bisunjae.

390
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,126
Let's buy a collared shirt.

391
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,670
-Forget it.
-Then change your t-shirt.

392
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:42,838
That's enough.

393
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,090
You have to change!

394
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:46,675
Hurry!

395
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:48,177
Okay.

396
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,286
Are you interested?

397
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,458
Are you into Na Hyewon?

398
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:22,585
You're talking nonsense
which means I have to go.

399
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,965
-You've never had that look before.
-What look?

400
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,971
It's not, "What's her deal?"

401
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,891
It was more like, "I wonder who she is."

402
00:40:36,474 --> 00:40:38,018
Fine. I'll change.

403
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,688
What? Han Taeoh just changed the subject.

404
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,813
You're crazy.

405
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,065
I'll hit on her if you don't.

406
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,485
-Do whatever you want.
-Playing hard to get?

407
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:05,670
How adorable.

408
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,815
Welcome.

409
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,027
This way.

410
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,409
Isn't our house nice?

411
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,666
My name's Kang Huiju.
I'm a first-year at Kangoh Arts High.

412
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,295
Are you the new tutor?

413
00:41:46,961 --> 00:41:48,505
I'll take him inside.

414
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,764
Are you arrogant?

415
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,353
Or are you confident?

416
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,862
Good, your understanding
of quadratic equations are established.

417
00:42:11,945 --> 00:42:13,489
Next is the most important.

418
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,282
The minimum and maximum values.

419
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,619
-Are you good at anything else?
-In general form...

420
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,869
I asked you a question.

421
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:26,001
Running.

422
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,670
Wow, it's destiny!

423
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,507
Running's the second best thing
I'm good at.

424
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,344
In general form,

425
00:42:36,427 --> 00:42:40,056
y equals x squared
minus two x minus three.

426
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:41,266
How do you fix that?

427
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,686
Change it to standard form
and find the vertex.

428
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,025
I see.

429
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:51,402
Y is open parenthesis,

430
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:56,072
x minus one, close parenthesis,
squared minus four.

431
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,784
-Also...
-I heard you're Inha's best friend.

432
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:01,119
Since when?

433
00:43:01,202 --> 00:43:04,164
I find smart people boring.
Are you the same?

434
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:07,835
But...

435
00:43:08,293 --> 00:43:10,461
have you thought about
changing your style?

436
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,047
To something younger.

437
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,132
Maybe swoop your hair to the side.

438
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,512
Then, the vertex is at one
with a value of minus four.

439
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,264
You're no fun.

440
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,309
Still, you're handsome.

441
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:27,228
I'll give you that.

442
00:43:36,195 --> 00:43:38,740
If you're testing my patience,
you can't beat me.

443
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:41,409
No, I can.

444
00:43:41,492 --> 00:43:43,911
Patience can't be bought.

445
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,121
Do you want to bet?

446
00:43:46,873 --> 00:43:49,083
Let's see if it can be bought or not.

447
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,503
Have you hit bottom?

448
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,340
You can find out.

449
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,050
See if I'm at my bottom or not.

450
00:43:57,842 --> 00:43:59,469
See what kind of person I am.

451
00:44:15,735 --> 00:44:17,487
Send me your account number

452
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,864
and I'll wire your payment next time.

453
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,034
Also, this.

454
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,835
Even if it's uncomfortable,
you must sign it.

455
00:44:31,918 --> 00:44:33,420
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

456
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,012
SIGNEE, HAN TAEOH

457
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,865
Do you want more?

458
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,742
I'm good.

459
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:08,746
You see the chairman?

460
00:45:10,581 --> 00:45:12,918
I met Mr. Moon
and your sister, Kang Huiju.

461
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:14,670
I only saw them.

462
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,382
She's grown, right?

463
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,510
What?

464
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,431
-Trying to read your mind.
-What are you saying?

465
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,891
"I want to see my family."

466
00:45:29,684 --> 00:45:32,603
"I miss my family."
Something along those lines.

467
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,190
No way.

468
00:45:35,273 --> 00:45:37,108
I'd have to see them to miss them.

469
00:45:38,693 --> 00:45:40,653
You keep in touch with your sister.

470
00:45:40,987 --> 00:45:43,532
Is that why? Huiju's different.

471
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:46,326
She's almost like my real sister.

472
00:45:48,244 --> 00:45:49,829
Blood is thicker than water.

473
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:52,498
Something like that.

474
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,960
I'll get more beer.

475
00:46:05,344 --> 00:46:06,554
About Na Hyewon...

476
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:11,143
Where does she live?

477
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,771
Why do you want to know?
Are you a stalker?

478
00:46:13,853 --> 00:46:15,438
I'm really interested in her.

479
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:27,034
Are you being sincere?

480
00:46:27,867 --> 00:46:29,744
I'm always sincere.

481
00:46:30,244 --> 00:46:33,539
In every moment.
So where does she live and work?

482
00:46:33,623 --> 00:46:37,001
What does she like the most?
Go find out, Mr. Han Taeoh.

483
00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:07,990
Hey, open the door!

484
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,327
Open the door, brat!

485
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,496
Open the door!

486
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,248
Open the door!

487
00:47:24,048 --> 00:47:25,050
Hey!

488
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,262
Hey.

489
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:29,847
Hyewon.

490
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,764
Your mom's here.

491
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:32,849
Come out.

492
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,146
Give it back! Give it!

493
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,568
Hey, if I hadn't given birth to you,

494
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:47,239
could you have gone to Hanguk University,
the best in our country?

495
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,157
Be quiet!

496
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,786
Shut your mouth before I make you!

497
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:59,126
You're in this world thanks to me.

498
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:00,626
If you reaped the benefits,

499
00:48:01,335 --> 00:48:03,005
have some shame, you brat!

500
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,717
How long
were you going to to hide from me?

501
00:48:08,175 --> 00:48:12,514
I'm sure you made plenty of money
tutoring with your background!

502
00:48:12,597 --> 00:48:16,059
You're dead if I find any money
in your house!

503
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,811
Where did you hide it?

504
00:48:18,644 --> 00:48:19,646
Give me more!

505
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,440
Unbelievable.

506
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,079
What? You ignored me before.

507
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:19,789
Just do what you normally do.

508
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,501
Hey.

509
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,253
Do you want some beer?

510
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,099
Mmm. We're neighbors and classmates.

511
00:49:37,682 --> 00:49:39,643
I think that's more than enough reason

512
00:49:40,184 --> 00:49:41,394
for us to grab a beer.

513
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:58,286
Unbelievable.
You're seriously just drinking.

514
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,164
I mean, I'm thankful you're not asking,

515
00:50:02,248 --> 00:50:04,208
but it's not like you didn't see it.

516
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,876
You saw what happened.

517
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,170
Pretending to be clueless
is uncomfortable.

518
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,175
That's how I lived.

519
00:50:29,483 --> 00:50:32,528
Aside from Bisunjae and work,
MD Kang Seongju goes swimming,

520
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:35,865
horseback riding, golfing,
and nothing out of the ordinary.

521
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,784
Executive Managing Director Kang Inju
showed a change.

522
00:50:40,661 --> 00:50:41,954
Two days ago in Cheongdam,

523
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,831
he took over a club called Chrom.

524
00:50:43,914 --> 00:50:45,833
-He bought a club?
-Yes.

525
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:49,588
He's deliberately trying to loaf around.

526
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,840
How pathetic.

527
00:50:54,425 --> 00:50:56,762
FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE
ESTABLISHMENT PLAN

528
00:50:56,844 --> 00:51:00,097
You'll leave the Future Strategy Office
to one of the two...

529
00:51:01,307 --> 00:51:03,184
The establishment plan just came out.

530
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:04,769
Let's not rush.

531
00:51:06,353 --> 00:51:07,481
I'm sorry, sir.

532
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,748
Mr. Moon...

533
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,085
should have arrived by now.

534
00:51:49,688 --> 00:51:50,981
<i>What of him?</i>

535
00:51:51,565 --> 00:51:53,485
You're the star on this road.

536
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:56,070
We have to get rid of any obstacles
in your way.

537
00:52:11,418 --> 00:52:14,588
You'll still be able
to continue your lifestyle.

538
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,717
You won't be cut off
from financial support.

539
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,052
By chance,

540
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:22,304
if you think it's not legally valid,

541
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,099
you're wrong.

542
00:52:24,932 --> 00:52:28,436
You know the legality of it can be made

543
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:31,773
depending on how it's used, right?

544
00:52:36,193 --> 00:52:38,362
<i>Only</i>
<i>the establishment plan is out,</i>

545
00:52:38,445 --> 00:52:41,867
but the news is already talking
about the Future Strategy Office,

546
00:52:41,949 --> 00:52:43,952
so they're preparing for the succession.

547
00:52:44,827 --> 00:52:45,996
Which means...

548
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:48,248
Director Jang Geumseok will call you.

549
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,876
Since the succession plan has begun,

550
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,711
<i>the bastard son will become a nuisance.</i>

551
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:59,009
<i>What if she tells you</i>
<i>to give up your inherited shares?</i>

552
00:53:03,429 --> 00:53:05,347
<i>If I want to get inside,</i>

553
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,601
<i>I'll give them up.</i>

554
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:12,271
<i>You're right.</i>
<i>There's only one answer.</i>

555
00:53:13,731 --> 00:53:14,773
<i>It's predetermined.</i>

556
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,777
There's only one answer.
It's predetermined.

557
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:22,615
Whether you can reach the answer or not
depends on you.

558
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,744
Go over the questions you got wrong.

559
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,079
Don't just review them.

560
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,333
If you want to find the answer,
look over the process.

561
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,753
If the process is wrong,

562
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,797
it will never take you
to the right answer.

563
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:44,304
I signed the papers.

564
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,494
Hurry up and go inside.

565
00:54:08,744 --> 00:54:09,788
Seriously.

566
00:54:16,126 --> 00:54:17,336
But did we buy too much?

567
00:54:17,836 --> 00:54:18,922
Our fridge is tiny.

568
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,798
I told you this was too much.

569
00:54:29,556 --> 00:54:31,559
What is it? What now?

570
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,269
We didn't buy alcohol.

571
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,244
Hello.

572
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,083
- Just a second.
- Okay.

573
00:55:03,173 --> 00:55:04,217
We've plenty of alcohol.

574
00:55:16,061 --> 00:55:17,438
Why is there so much? Wow.

575
00:55:21,775 --> 00:55:23,360
Now, let's go to my house.

576
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,405
It's too cramped here.

577
00:55:26,947 --> 00:55:27,949
Well?

578
00:55:30,034 --> 00:55:32,454
Sounds good.

579
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:36,791
Hey. What are you doing?

580
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:39,293
Let's go!

581
00:55:39,918 --> 00:55:41,211
I'll come after I clean up.

582
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,677
Clean up?

583
00:55:50,137 --> 00:55:51,889
Oh! You can't go in.

584
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,519
Shall we wait downstairs?

585
00:55:57,603 --> 00:55:58,980
Uh...

586
00:55:59,063 --> 00:56:00,606
I have to go to the bathroom.

587
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,690
Ah.

588
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,195
Sorry about that.

589
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:28,760
This is unexpected.

590
00:56:28,842 --> 00:56:30,387
Who knew that'd embarrass you?

591
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:32,429
I'm a person. I'm not a robot.

592
00:56:34,306 --> 00:56:35,349
What is it?

593
00:56:36,141 --> 00:56:37,143
The bathroom?

594
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,980
That was an excuse.
I wanted to be clear about something.

595
00:56:41,063 --> 00:56:44,483
Don't get the wrong idea,
I didn't follow Inha here because of you.

596
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,320
You want me to think that?

597
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,949
What if I want you to?

598
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,416
You're kind of cute today.

599
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,556
Now, let's toast!

600
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,268
Cheers!

601
00:57:22,646 --> 00:57:23,648
Ah.

602
00:57:26,275 --> 00:57:27,277
Got any friends?

603
00:57:29,528 --> 00:57:30,947
You're always alone.

604
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,739
I'm pretty busy.

605
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,284
There's no one busier than Han Taeoh.

606
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:36,369
But he has a friend.

607
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,704
It's me.

608
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,498
Then you can be my friend too.

609
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,585
I don't want to be just friends.

610
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,713
I could be your boyfriend.

611
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,217
Why does that sound so cocky to me?

612
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,052
You're right, I'm cocky.

613
00:57:53,135 --> 00:57:54,804
I don't like groundless confidence.

614
00:57:54,887 --> 00:57:56,222
It's not groundless.

615
00:57:57,389 --> 00:57:58,474
My friend?

616
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,853
Tell her who I am.
Introduce me.

617
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:05,981
He has a lot.

618
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:07,650
So...

619
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,068
he has a lot to lose too.

620
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,405
But he's so rich
that it's okay for him to lose it.

621
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,367
Did you hear that?
The grounds for my confidence.

622
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,079
I admit it. It wasn't groundless.

623
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,210
If you admit it,

624
00:58:28,003 --> 00:58:29,005
go out with me.

625
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:32,717
I told you. I'm really busy.

626
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,179
That's such a practical reason.

627
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,889
-If that's why you're rejecting me...
-If you keep going...

628
00:58:40,516 --> 00:58:42,143
you'll make me feel uncomfortable.

629
00:58:44,978 --> 00:58:47,565
Okay, I got it.

630
00:58:55,072 --> 00:58:56,074
Cheers!

631
00:59:24,101 --> 00:59:26,271
Na Hyewon isn't easy.

632
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:28,273
She said she was uncomfortable.

633
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,358
-I'm being sincere.
-I know.

634
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:33,945
But that doesn't make it right.

635
00:59:37,739 --> 00:59:39,157
-Let's go.
-I'll take you home.

636
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,536
-You had wine.
-Whoops!

637
00:59:43,036 --> 00:59:45,039
-I'm going.
-Bye.

638
01:00:03,682 --> 01:00:06,476
This feels strange.

639
01:00:18,572 --> 01:00:19,782
<i>How about another round?</i>

640
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:32,420
This is where I lived two years back.

641
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,715
I paid the rent by cleaning a bathhouse.

642
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,096
It's not as great as the night view
at Inha's place,

643
01:00:42,554 --> 01:00:43,847
but isn't it still nice?

644
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,351
It's better.

645
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,940
This place, and this moment.

646
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,195
You shouldn't think it's better.

647
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,907
Then there's no reason
for you to be with Inha.

648
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:06,496
Aren't you hanging out with Inha
for the reason I'm thinking?

649
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:08,246
And what's that?

650
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,585
Kang Inha's a golden rope.

651
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,295
Why did you bring me here?

652
01:01:16,797 --> 01:01:17,798
You and I...

653
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,385
are very similar.

654
01:01:33,188 --> 01:01:34,815
Just say what you want.

655
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,985
Kang Inha,
the bastard son of Kangoh Group.

656
01:01:39,528 --> 01:01:41,947
You want to gamble
to see whether he'll be...

657
01:01:44,324 --> 01:01:46,034
the golden rope or the rotten one.

658
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:51,416
-Like me.
-Yeah.

659
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,001
Like you.

660
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,478
Speaking of which,

661
01:02:14,938 --> 01:02:18,275
why didn't Taeoh tell me
that Hyewon lived here?

662
01:02:25,574 --> 01:02:27,117
<i>If I asked you to help me,</i>

663
01:02:29,494 --> 01:02:30,496
would you?
