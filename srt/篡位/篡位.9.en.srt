Who...

5
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,691
It was you.

6
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,943
The rat.

7
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,739
A member of North Korea's

[sighs softly]

10
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,664
You left the European-based hacking
organization for financial institutes.

11
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,877
- An ex-agent of Bluenoroff.
- Are you explaining that for my sake?

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,005
- Your kindness is a disease.
- Han Taeoh's dead.

13
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:39,057
- It's probably getting wrapped up by now.
- Why go through the trouble?

14
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,768
You found Roy.

15
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,562
Will you kill me too?

16
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:45,939
It won't be easy.

17
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,692
Really? I think it'll be easy.

18
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,068

- See?
- [Wan scoffs softly]

21
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,704
I said it'd be easy.

22
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:02,748
This...

23
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,043
[in Italian] Was it money after all?

24
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,712
[in Italian] "Don't follow people,
follow the money."

25
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,672
I'm only following your rules.

26
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,758

I'm sorry.

35
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,850
I went to do what I was told,

36
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,644
but Inmate 3866 was already gone...

37
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,481
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,322
You'll disappear if you tell anyone
about what we asked you to do.

[Hyangmi] <i>What are you saying?</i>

I'll get the money. Wait!

Don't leave me out!

51
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,285

I know you have money!

Where are you?

54
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,803
Okay.

escaped?

58
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,441
Don't bother with
unnecessary thoughts. Just find him!

Find Mr. Han?

60
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,538
I thought there was
a bit of romance in you.

61
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,624
I didn't know you were a little punk.

62
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,792

63
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,503
[in Italian] That's fresh coming from you!
Stop talking nonsense!

64

Will you shoot me?

65
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,425
[in Italian] No, no.

66
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:46,346
No matter how much Kang Inha pays you,
half is mine.

67
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,265
What?

68
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,228
- [in Korean] Follow the money.

71
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,237
Come on. If you have a brain, think!

00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,991
Don't be ignorant

Don't worry about it.

84
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,429
He'll live the life of a fugitive.

85
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,559
How long will you stay here?

86
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:17,604
I have no intention of getting along
with your father anymore.

I must bring down Inha
from the Future Strategy Office.

Father was so absorbed with Han Taeoh.

[scoffs softly]

93
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,669
Now, he's entangled
in Inha's web of deceit.

94
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,005
If you stay here,

95
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,675
Na Hyewon could take the slush funds
from the foundation. It'll be over.

96
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,971
We have more than a few shares in Kangoh.

97
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,016
Don't get impatient.

00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:03,901
Kangoh Securities will be back on track
in a short amount of time.

101
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,613
I can gain his approval for real now.

102
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,159
So I'll go see him
and have you reinstated.

103
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:13,994
No.

104
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,210
I've been working behind the scenes too.

105
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,713
I'll try to hurry
before the chairman goes further.

106
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:28,175
We must gather power from the shareholders
and board members

107
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,927
who are on our side first.

108

[Seongju sighs softly]

109
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,694
[Hyangmi] Is she coming or not?

110
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,615
Should I have just called her husband?

111
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,160
Damn, I need a reason to call.

112
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,037
That way I can bring up money.

113
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,349
She really came.

114
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,232

[bag rustling]

116
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,488
Are you terminally ill or something?

117
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,283
Why was this so easy?
You came and brought me money.

118
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,618
Find me a professional
who can find people.

119
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,203
Is your husband cheating?

120
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,706
What a shame.

121
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,125
You acted so high and mighty.

122
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,459
Can you find them or not?

123
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:48,630
All sorts of people gather here.
You think I can't find you one?

124
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,340
Do it by tomorrow.

125
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,593
What's your hurry?

126
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,053
- I'll pay you twice as much.
- Really?

127
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,348
By tomorrow. Get out.

128
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,894
Twice as much. Don't go back on your word.

129
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,237
Who the hell is she looking for?

130
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,534

137
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,065
Yeah, Hyewon visited me.

138
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,567
She's looking for a professional
to find someone.

139
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,237
Do you know who she's looking for?

140
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,074
<i>She's so peculiar.</i>

141
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,494
<i>I'm worried she might cause trouble.</i>

142

Kang Inha...

00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:36,817
[Inha scoffs softly]

153
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,569
Inha was there.

154
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,030
He was there.

155
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,701
There...

156
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,609
KANGOH AIRLINES
IS LAUNCHING ANEW

157
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,528
What happened?

158
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,071
I brought you here.

159
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:24,948
Does that mean...

160
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,243
I'm an escaped convict?

161
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,747
If it weren't for me,
you'd already be dead.

162
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,916
What do you mean?

163
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,211
It seems like someone
took out a hit on you.

164
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,678
If something insignificant continues
to pop up during important moments,

165
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,056
it's no longer insignificant.

166
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,601
That was the case for Mo Gijun.

167
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,437
His name came up
at every important moment.

168
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:57,940
It reached my ear.

169
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,943
That's how I started to follow him.

170
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,194
And at the end...

171
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,466
- Kang Inha...
- You killed my son,

172
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:26,802
so why did I keep you alive?

173
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,554
I didn't kill Kang Inju.

174
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,681
There's no proof you didn't.

175
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,432
There's no proof I did either!

176
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:37,104
[Joongmo] <i>Inha, he must've been there.</i>

180
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:02,963
Did you find someone?

181
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,506
[Hyangmi] <i>Who do you think I am?</i>

182
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,301
<i>They want to meet today. Do you have time?</i>

183
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,906
WOMAN

184
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,991
[line ringing]

185
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,183
Are you looking for him?

186
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,227
ESCAPED CONVICT (MURDERER) WANTED NOTICE

187
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:35,305
Now! Full house.

188
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,474
- It's mine.
- Wait.

189
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,059
What is it?

190
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,229
- [laughs boisterously]
- [men groan]

191
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,194
- [woman] She hit the jackpot tonight!
- [laughing]

192
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,039
[Inha] There's no point.

193
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,500
Don't waste your energy.

194
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,265
Since when have you
been in contact with her?

195
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,059
How much did she sell me off for?

196
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,644
The person you're looking for.

197
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,315
Han Taeoh.

198
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,775
Is that right?

199
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:31,820
Why? Will you find him for me?

200
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:33,655
[Inha chuckles softly]

201
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,199
Are you insane?

202
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,075
Taeoh didn't escape.

203
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,912
- I'm sure something happened!
- Shut your mouth.

204
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,081
There's no reason he'd try to escape.

205
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,459
Not only are you disgusting and vulgar,

206
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,045
but you're trying to tell me
you know Taeoh better?

207
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,088
I know him better than anyone.

208
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:53,425
As if deceiving me
all this time wasn't enough, you still...

209
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,844
How dare you?

210
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:58,597
Should I get on my knees and beg?

211
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,062
- Don't tell me...
- Yeah.

212
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,648
I know you know about me and Taeoh.

213
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,733
[Inha scoffs]

214
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:14,446
You know?

215
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:16,657
You do?

216
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,326
How are you so dignified?

217
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:21,578
I was sorry.

218
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:25,123
I thought of living
with the burden forever.

219
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,252
That was before you choked me.

220
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,297
We failed each other.

221
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:34,758
Failed?

222
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:36,677
Failed?

223
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,181
[breath trembling]

224
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:43,934
You deceived me.

225
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,228
I'll never forgive you.

226
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:53,569
I bet you were happy you reached
the chairman's fingertips.

227
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:54,653
That's too bad.

228
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,907
I'm sorry to end it like this.

229
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,742
Come in.

230
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:02,494
[man] Nurse!

231
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:03,954
Kang Inha!

232
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:06,707
Kang Inha!

233
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,001
- [man] Grab her!
- [Hyewon] Hey, you!

234
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:32,608
Let's see.

235
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:08,977
[door opens]

236
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:12,397
[door closes]

237
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:19,238
[Director In] Sir, I'll get going now.

238
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,534
[door opens]

239
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:37,756
Tell me...

240
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,510
why you helped me now.

241
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,805
I'm the one that brought you Kang Inha.

242
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,142
Don't lie and tell me
to clean up the mess.

243
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:51,687
You're right.

244
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:56,525
You don't have to be the one
to get rid of Inha.

245
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,530
I have plenty of new pawns
willing to get their hands dirty.

246
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:04,658
However, if Kang Inha has joined forces
with Park Sajin,

247
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:06,827
it changes things.

248
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,415
Those two people are trying
to divide and separate Kangoh.

249
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,125
How dare Inha do that?

250
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:17,921
He's trying to cut Kangoh in half
and give it to Park Sajin.

251
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,256
You're too late.

252
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,550
He's already started the dispense work.

253
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,843
On what grounds?

254
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:26,847
I designed the blueprints
of the dispense work.

255
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,642
Yes, it was your plan.

256
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:35,147
I know you two were trying
to tear Kangoh apart.

257
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,234
I know that's why you brought
Kang Inha to me as well.

258
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,528
Turning Kang Inha
into the owner of Kangoh...

259
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,364
was my plan.

260
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,167
Put the plan back in place.

261
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,795
Also, get rid of Kang Inha from Kangoh.

262
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,964
You can do whatever you want with him.

263
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,968
Then I'll return everything you had

264
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,971
back to you.

265
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:23,904
I named the holdings
for the dispense work, "PY."

266
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:28,158
I want everyone to know
that Kangoh's start

267
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,535
was with our family.

268
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:33,205
It wasn't Kangoh Trade, but Kangoh Mill.

269
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:38,001
Your father, the founder of Kangoh Mill,

270
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:42,381
Park Young. PY.

271
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,385
How meaningful.

272
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:50,347
When you first came to me and spoke
of Kangoh's division and separation,

273
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,392
I just thought you were crazy.

274
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:55,394
[Inha chuckles softly]

275
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,532
It seems like you're not comfortable
being with me,

276
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,075
so I'll get to the point.

277
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,789
I want to be the chairman of Kangoh.

278
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:22,504
I'm curious as to why
you're telling me this.

279
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:25,090
Because you have to help me now.

280
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:29,011
[laughs]

281
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,682
You're a Kang in name only.
You're actually an illegitimate son.

282
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,810
So what merit do you have?

283
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,270
Why would I take your side?

284
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,398
If I become the chairman...

285
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,152
we're going to split Kangoh in half.

286
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,905
You don't have that kind of power.

287
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,406
That power...

288
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:52,659
needs to be made by you.

289
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,166
Advisor Im Jongyong of Kangoh Electronics.
He's your greatest helper.

290
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:01,752
Right?

291
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,754
What is it that you want to say to me?

292
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,924
There's a lot of dirt on Mr. Im.

293
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,430
Were you this much of a scumbag?

294
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,682
Do you think that's all there is?

295
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:16,808
[chuckles softly]

296
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,062
If there's anyone who's unfriendly to you,

297
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:21,230
it's our job to find out

298
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:24,107
even the tiniest speck of dust
in his pocket. [chuckles softly]

299
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:29,238
You wanted to meet me
to blackmail me with a third-rate threat.

300
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:35,494
[Inha] Han Taeoh would've done that.

301
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:39,039
However,
Han Taeoh's office no longer exists.

302
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:43,001
Now, Kang Inha's Future Strategy Office...

303
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:45,879
will move forward with you.

304
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:50,717
Not only the mill, but food, distribution,
and construction...

305
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:54,513
will all be yours.

306
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:56,515
[inhales sharply]

307
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,350
Park Sajin's new empire.

308
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,728
Doesn't that sound fabulous?

309
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:07,276
So we're at the launch of PY Holdings.

310
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:11,780
What we're doing will be called a legend.

311
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:16,827
I won't be embarrassed
to face my late father now.

312
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,373
[clinks]

313
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,095
[dialing]

314
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:47,983
[operator] <i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

315
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,319
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:52,070

[â™ª sentimental song playing]

318
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,907
KANG INHA
PARK SAJIN

319
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,700
[â™ª sentimental song continues playing]

320
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,160
[pen clicking]

321
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:48,460
[Taeoh] <i>Let's be friends.</i>

322
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:52,214
<i>Let me rephrase, instead of friends,
let's be partners.</i>

323
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:57,010
<i>I don't plan on playing
in the minor leagues forever.</i>

324
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:58,136
[grunts]

325
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,264
So I'm going to use you.

326
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:04,643
You'll be my rope that'll help me reach
the major leagues.

327
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:08,605
[chuckles]

328
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:11,358
[Inha] <i>In the end, you didn't trust me.</i>

329
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,610
<i>To you, you're the only capable one!</i>

330
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,613
[Taeoh] <i>Making you</i>
<i>Chairman Kang Inha of Kangoh</i>

331
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:19,157
<i>is the only reason I exist.</i>

332
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:21,614
[Inha] <i>Then what about you?</i>

333
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:24,538
Does nothing exist for you?

334
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,206
Nothing.

335
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:28,333
Ah.

336
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:32,296
If there was anything, it's you, Inha.

337
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:35,424
[Inha] <i>You ruined everything.</i>

338
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,052
Our plan. Our dream.

339
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:44,433
I'll do everything I can
to restore everything you ruined.

340
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:46,310
Even if you ruined everything,

341
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,729
I came to tell you
my position hasn't changed.

342
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,565
Because as always,

343
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,484
you'll be more worried about me than you.

344
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:12,628
[Inha] Are you up?

345
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,170
[in English] Good morning.

346
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:20,052
Get this off of me.

347
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:22,137
[in Korean] You brought this on yourself.

348
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:24,765
I'll never forgive you.

349
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:26,391
I bet you get it now.

350
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:30,604
That's exactly how I felt.

351
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:33,690
I'll kill you.

352
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:34,775
I'm so scared.

353
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:41,615
Calm down. If I die, you're nothing.

354
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,583
What happened to you?

355
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:52,834
What happened to me?

356
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:55,170
Nothing's changed.

357
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:58,465
I'm still the same.

358
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:02,469
If you can promise me one thing,

359
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,097
I'll let you out of here.

360
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:10,185
You'll exist for me from now on.

00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,145
Just as Han Taeoh did.

362
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,148
You'll become my next Han Taeoh.

363
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,776
You'll breathe and live for me.

364
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,239
You won't have a choice.

365
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:28,495
If you don't, you really might
leave this place in a body bag.

had Na Hyewon admitted against her will.

370
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:14,583
Why do you think he let her go?

371
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,297
Because...

372
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:24,718
he's trying to get his hands
on the foundation's slush funds.

373
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:25,969
Na Hyewon.

374
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,805
You must make sure she's on your side.

375
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:33,018
To carry out the dispense work,
Kang Inha and Park Sajin will need money.

376
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:36,355
In order to get it,
they'll need Na Hyewon.

377
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:39,316
Put your questions aside for now.

378
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:43,153
We don't have enough time
to answer those questions.

379
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:44,404
There's too much to do.

Did you find anything?

384
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:20,346
[in Korean] He's still looking.

385
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:22,818
Yes, sir.

386
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:25,946

He's going to need a lot of money
for what's to come in the future.

393
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:57,352
The reason I gave you that position.

394
00:32:57,436 --> 00:33:01,148
Make the wise judgement
as to whose side you'll take.

395
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:11,116
In return,
don't stop me from doing anything.

396
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:16,330
There are things I must do for real now.

397
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,635
Welcome back.

Nothing will happen

Kang Inha will do what he can

You're not saying we should wait until
he tries to get rid of him, are you?

421
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:22,808
I'm telling you
to get rid of Park Sajin yourself.

422
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:24,726
How?

423
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,271
Kangoh's division.

424
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:29,565
Make the official proposal first.

425
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:36,280
You want me to break apart Kangoh myself?

426
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:39,199
You need Park Sajin on your side.

427
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:43,328
Give Park Sajin
half of Kangoh along with Kangoh Energy.

428
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:44,538
Are you insane?

429
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:47,082
It started out as a partnership.
So the dispense...

430
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:49,793
It was bound to happen.
The problem was timing.

431
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:52,296
As if half wasn't enough,
give him Kangoh Energy?

432
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:55,132
That could never happen.

433
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:56,216
Don't tell me.

434
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,219
Did you think that was the end?

435
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:01,346
Energy was a card to discard anyway.

00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,891
- What?
- The rest...

437
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,810
will be temporarily entrusted
to Park Sajin.

00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:11,648
- Entrust it to him?
- I promise to bring it all back.

The core of Kangoh Group

No matter how Kangoh changes,

442
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,660
the fact that Kangoh's owner is you
won't change.

443
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:30,083
So even if Park Sajin takes half
of Kangoh, nothing will change.

It was just unexpected.

- Were you worried I might be sick?
- That's right.

When that's the case,

I can do anything I want to you
and not feel a thing. Do you understand?

you must meet with Park Sajin tonight
and decide.

Quickly.

[Sajin] What about you?

499
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:06,915
Did you think I'd keep quiet
and stay at Kangoh Mill forever?

500
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:08,333
[Joongmo] Of course not.

501
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:09,960
[Sajin] Then what's the problem?

502

You haven't changed at all.

522
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:39,383
Seeing as how you'll abandon
your own blood to protect Kangoh.

523

You've changed a lot.

I don't need strength.

529
00:46:57,651 --> 00:46:59,903
I needed someone from the Kang family.

and shield.
